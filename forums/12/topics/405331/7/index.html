              <p>XMM. You don't want people to call you XMM but you are acting like one.</p>
              <p>Anyway, IMO, your results are not good at all. You think you are doing really well, but no. Assuming you are from a neighbourhood school (since your friends think that you are nerdy simply because you are in express stream... please lah, then more than half of the secondary school population is considered as nerds), the papers are not hard, maybe even easier than O level papers (I've seen and that's what I think). You are going to be pitting yourself against people from top secondary schools and when the dreaded bell curve comes into play, it might work against you. </p>
              <p>Since you are so free, why not do some revision (oh no so nerdy!). You already missed 2 weeks worth of lessons and O levels is coming. </p>

              <p><em>be prepared to be the breadwinner...</em> that sounds ominous.. but true..</p>
              <p>oh... mom is actually counselling one girl and after so many years, her eyes are finally opened..</p>
              <p>the girl's folks are friends of my folks..</p>
              <p>the girl's grades were pretty crappy.. she was never home, mixed around with people who were like the people as mei ting described her boyfriend to be...ne'er-do-wells, people who could but somehow refused to...</p>
              <p>after lots of coaching and teaching, she made it into the poly.. her folks were overjoyed..</p>
              <p>then she hooked up with this guy in poly..</p>
              <p>there was blind faith and what she thought was love...</p>
              <p>she pressed on with her diploma, he dropped out</p>
              <p>they got married.. he was sleeping on the wedding day and was late for everything because he was sleeping and could not be bothered... that should have given her a clue but there was blind faith again...</p>
              <p>she went and got a job while he went through the cursory search for a job.. and whenever a job offer came in, he rejected it saying it was "too low-paying" expecting to get at least $2,500 monthly.. for a poly drop-out with just o-levels...</p>
              <p>blind faith made her keep struggling...</p>
              <p>then came the child...</p>
              <p>and then he went to apply for a flat without her knowing...</p>
              <p>she ended up paying for the flat (somehow.. but we suspect her folks paid the instalments) while he sat around in the house doing nothing...</p>
              <p>more blind faith until there was domestic violence.. because she could not keep giving him money to do nothing in the house while the child was being brought up by her...</p>
              <p>one day she popped in at my house, started to talk to mom and i made myself scarce so they could have some privacy...</p>
              <p>4 hours later and lots of tears, she realised she was in a mess...</p>
              <p>the "damn.. i screwed up" was from her..</p>
              <p>now she's seeking help from professional counsellors, legal help with custody of the child (the in-laws wanted custody.. which they'll fight but will be unable to win) and will be seeking legal aid to divorce the guy, throw him out of their flat although he applied for it, he never paid a cent..</p>
              <p>so.. the "damn.. i screwed up" is from here..</p>
              <p>now.. imagine if she didn't press on with her diploma as instructed by my mom?</p>
              <p>that.. is a true story..</p>

              <p>Well, either I can sugarcoat my words and bluff you, or I can just come out with the hard truth. If there's one thing I've learnt, it is that the hard truth can be better in the long run than a sugarcoated lie.</p>
              <p>Instead of coming up with '<em>Don't call me a nerd!!!</em>', be more proactive in your studies and strive to make the best of things. You got two weeks off school for your misdeeds, so use those two weeks wisely to catch up on past work.</p>
              <p>If your peers want to call you a nerd, so be it. All it means is that you really have to wonder what kind of company you're dealing with, because then that means that half of the entire cohort are all nerds. All it means is that your friends just cannot be bothered to strive for excellence, and they try to bring down those who genuinely do want to improve their lot in life.</p>

              <p>Then in that case, you have just admitted that those friends of yours want to bring you down, and they are doing it for the really selfish (and really stupid) reason of 'they don't want to lose you forever'. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Look, think. Here we are encouraging you not to give, up, but go whack hard in your studies to achieve the highest possible that you can get. Your "friends" and bf are like asking for the opposite for you.</p>
              <p>O levels, once in a lifetime opportunity to score your A1s while in school uniform. You won't get any more chances after this. So what if you are in express stream and the rest of your "friends" aren't? You are on a different path, different track. What's the point of having the same study timetable and attitude as them? Different paths and tracks require different efforts.</p>

              <p>maybe for the sake of TS, i myself hang around with a group of all Normal Acad friends, while i was an Express student during my sec sch times. And after 10 years+, we are still very good friends who hang out together alot. True friends will never differentiate themselves and you whether u are express student or not. True friends are those who will stay by u when u have problems.</p>
              <p>Nobody is asking u to stay away from your friends, but know how to weigh things differently. When its time to study, study. When its time to relax, go ahead, go out with your friends. If they are forever putting u down by saying, "You are not supposed to be in Express, your results not that good, should go down to Normal Acad where it is supposedly easier", then i believe its better for u to not hang around with them anymore.</p>

              <p>FYI, my teacher told us that he used to have 2 different groups of friends. He will play really hard with one group and study really hard with another- because the playful ones are no good to study with as they will distract him and the studious ones are no good to play with as they are too boring. </p>

              <p>I'm really suspicious of the types of friends you are hanging around with. With your some B3 and A2s, as well as an A1 results, I can assure you, they are not stellar results at all. I think you got to pay more attention to the group that you are hanging out with. Firstly, you seem to be easily swayed by what they have to say of you. Secondly, their advice is only going to cap your limit to what you can do. </p>
              <p>Read up on some of Confucius Teachings. There is one about the types of friends you are better of with, which mainly categories into 3 parts. 3 types of good friends, 3 types of bad friends. And your friends, if according to his teachings, are those who should be avoided. </p>
              <p>If you allow your results to decide for you where you should go, I think you have taken the meaning of education out of context. Do your best, you are just a few marks away from that A1. Count it yourself, what is the difference between an A1 and A2? A lot of differences in name, but not the value. 4 marks differences, which is most likely to be the equivalent of getting 1 to 2 questions correct. </p>
              <p>Rather then allowing your marks decide where you should go, why not let yourself decide what you want to do instead? Open your choices up by studying now. Don't limit yourself. Why earn 900 bucks when you could be earning 5k in future?</p>
              <p>Btw, even if you did not score very well and decide to enrol into a polytechnic instead, you wont be given a course of your choice if you choose the higher ends one. Higher end ones are the more popular courses like the Business courses, Science courses, Media courses and Arts courses. All these, with your current results, you are at a very high risk of not getting in. </p>
              <p>Lastly, it is still your friends your friends and your friends! Think of what they have said and are their words is what a friend is suppose to say! </p>
