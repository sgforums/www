              <p>the best thing you can do is to sit down, think about what you want to do with your life.. the rest of your life is a mighty long time...</p>
              <p>what you can do now is to give yourself the greatest number of choices in life so that even if you haven't a clue what you want to do later, you can have a choice...</p>
              <p>see your "boyfriend" with his "tattoo to tell him not to work in blah blah".. that's not a smart thing... i bet he has no bankable skills, no qualifications yet, and he is narrowing his path and maybe even cutting it off...</p>

              <p>not cursing u, my friend :) Your parents don't care if he's a nice boy. There are many nice boys out there. And when you are sweetly in love, he's nice. When arguments start, he's a jerk. And do you know what is love? Love when teenage years and when grown up is different. Your parents are worried for you? And do you understand a parent's anxiety? Their hearts must be pumping even while they are busy, wondering what you are doing with your bf, where you are going, are you getting into any sort of trouble. They are worried.</p>
              <p>And if you understand what is love, you love your parents, you will try your best to listen to them. Get a better bf, one who's studious and cool and cute at the same time. There are plenty of them.</p>

              <p>if you are pregnant, then are you going to spend the $$$ to abort it. If you are going to be mom, are you going to lose your freedom since 16 years old? Is it practical in either way? </p>
              <p>If the guy is really serious about you, he will not think you are a "fresh lollipop". If his interest is really to seek sexual pleasure from you, then you are no different from the geylang ladies, except that you are free to come by. </p>
              <p>Another friend, of mine, a guy have been having a GF since 16 years old. And he is the cannot study type, ah beng, attitude &lt;-- basically a bad boy. But to my surprise, he claim to have no sexual affairs with his GF for up to 4 years now. He said he want to do it after marriage. And he will get married when he stablises.  </p>
              <p>One thing you must know is that "educated" is not equal to "nice" is not equal to "playboy" is not equal to "love". These are individual things and not related.  </p>
              <p>Honestly, it is ok to have a boyfriend at your age and since you claimed to be the studious girl then there is no doubt that your BF is most likely to be academically inferior compare to you. Else do you expect to get some1 from RI or RJ? </p>
              <p>What we fear for you is like your BF probably take you like a "sexual lollipop". And worse you are not aware of it. </p>

              <p>i now sec 4 in express. Im not trying to hao lian hor but i did
              really well on my studies :). As usual in sch there's of cos gonna
              be some love, fight, frens here and there. I have a bf and its
              nearly going to be 4 months. This is where my problem slowly
              starts...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ever since im with my bf, my frens started to see my physical
              appearance started to change. I never pierce before only on my ear
              but now im with him, i started to pierce my tongue. ok its called
              culture to me, u all can say to me watever u want but to me its
              called culture. My bf appearance is quite an ah beng image becos he
              got a tattoo on his leg but he's a nice guy :). One day we were
              walking around in cineleisure my father saw me walking with him.
              When i got home he talked to me and at first he said is he your bf?
              then i shouldnt be with him and watever. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dont get it why people judge book by its cover? he IS a
              nice guy. ok one day i pon sch becos there's no lesson
              so no point me go mah. so my bf know abt this and he ask
              me to pon and meet him and relax/sit around. So i did but that
              got me thinking with people passer by keep on looking at me wearing
              a sch uniform when i was suppose to be in sch since its sch hours,
              i was like stare at them back. i dont think im turning to
              a gangster it just irritates me when people look at me
              strangely. Its a reflex and i know u guys do it too</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dont know how but my teachers found out that i pon sch that
              day and was asked to call my parents. My parents quite flipped and
              i get hell of a scolding. But what they really flipped is when they
              saw a drawing (NOT A TATTOO) stick on my under forearm. it can be
              erase one but they really got mad over that. And they want to see
              my bf but i wont let them becos i know they want him to leave me
              alone which i dont want. And they call me a bad girl and my frens
              now seeing me as a gangster. I shout at my parents for scolding me
              but i had to, its natural right? we all do it. This is not wat i
              had in mind. i dont smoke but why they call me a gangster and see
              me as a bad person? just becos i did all those?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Am i really turning to a bad person?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>btw, i got suspended from sch for 2 weeks now. So im really

              <p>Look what the Bear said. He have not even started work and yet he has already sealed off an option, a big one at that too. And given Singapore economy, a lot of office jobs around. </p>
              <p>Not that I want to scare you. But since you took the initiative to even talk about your problems in a forum, it shows that you do see that there is something not quite right. As for your bf, if you 2 really love each other, good. Encourage him to pick up a skill. </p>
              <p>In future, at least when it comes to parent meeting, it would help a lot. Right now, focus on studies, and get your grades first. Pon teng school once in a while its okay. But do it the smart way. </p>

              <p>1. Tattoo to remind himself not to do white collar work? Gosh, that's outright stupid. So he's that dumb to shun good honest high-paying work, and he needs to mutilate himself to remind him of that?</p>
              <p>2. Say what you will, but your nonchalant attitude towards abortion is really very disturbing. Let me put this clear: <strong>ABORTION IS NOT A CONTRACEPTIVE</strong>. Get that in your head.</p>
              <p>What is with this '<span style="line-height: 18px; font-size: 15px; color: #333333;"><em>once u abort all those family stuff will go away right?</em>' You know all those girls who screwed up their own lives because they got pregnant at a young age? Dollars to donuts say that they all thought the same way. If you have friends who think this way then you really need to take a good look at your social circle.</span></p>
              <p>You are still young; don't mess up your life. Your parents simply want what's best for you. You may think that they may control you too much, but five years from now when you are a full legal adult, you will look back and realize that much of what they say actually makes sense.</p>
              <p>If what you say is true and you truly did well for your studies, then I say congratulations.</p>
              <p>However, you need a lot of work on your life skills.</p>
