              <p>XMM, from long previous post , I think your BF is ok. He knows what he wants and he will do well in the future if he presists in the graphic design industry.</p>
              <p>In contary, you are lost in your career path.</p>
              <p>You can have love, with him while managing your studies.</p>
              <p>You seems to be "mature" in certain ways,but you are inexperienced in life. (as expected, cose you are young)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just try to get A1 for every subjects. Hang out with your BF during weekends. I believe you know how to weight your priority and get everything right. </p>

              <p>Mei Ting, fyi, graphics designer IS an office job, unless your bf intends to just stay home and do freelance designing, which i believe is of no future. No orders, no income. White collar job refers to office job by the way.</p>

              <p>Anyway, based on your results, it's good enough for poly already. JC could be a little difficult.</p>

              <p>after lots of coaching and teaching, she made it into the poly.. her folks were overjoyed..</p>

              <p>more blind faith until there was domestic violence.. because she could not keep giving him money to do nothing in the house while the child was being brought up by her...</p>
              <p>one day she popped in at my house, started to talk to mom and i made myself scarce so they could have some privacy...</p>

              <p>It's either extra work this year and perhaps the next few years (total 6.5 yrs more)</p>
              <p>Or extra work all the way after you step into the workforce till you retire (perhaps 30 years or more)</p>
              <p>Your choice.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope you understand the meaning of my words ;) <br>I'm sharing things I never thought of when I'm your age. But fortunately, it worked out well for me.</p>
