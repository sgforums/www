              <p>For most of us, being single will be more of a phase than a final destination. This is the best place to practice the art of contentment. Someday, I'm sure most of us will fall in love and get married. But the thing is, love will always be tested.</p>
              <p><br><br>Someone more handsome, beautiful, more charming, richer, funnier, sweeter would come along. If you have not practiced the art of contentment as a single person, chances are you would be tempted to want that and not cherish your chosen one. Practicing the Art of Contentment as a single person means that you take what life gives you, good or bad, and you're willing to see it through. It means you don't walk away everytime things get tough, because it builds in you patience, perseverance, understanding and a hundred different virtues that people in a hurry will never have to cherish.</p>
              <p><br><br>Being single means you would find how it feels to be alone thus, allowing you to cherish every moment you spend with your chosen one. The art of contentment means you wouldn't mind if life had to make you wait for so long to find the love of your life, because you know that the waiting would only make the finding the love of your life much sweeter.</p>
              <p><br><br>Being single is a time of your life when you can get to know yourself better. You can pursue different interest and passions without having to ask another person's approval. It is a phase when you can keep focus on other things, discover your potentials and talents, and see yourself become more of the person you expect to be.</p>
              <p><br><br>Allow yourself to surprise you. Stop wasting precious energy trying to figure out why you're still romantically unattached. It's all in the mind. Take the time to go see your friends, spend time with your family, do charity work and you will realize that you are not, and never for one moment, was alone.</p>
              <p><br><br>Try to get to know yourself first before you try to get to know other people. To be truly loved, means to be known and accepted for who you are. How do you expect other people to know you and to love you, when you don't know who and what you really are? Sometimes the dilemmas we face are not between what is absolutely bad and absolutely good. Sometimes, it's between what is good and best.</p>
              <p><br><br>Treat this stage of your life as a phase to evaluate who is good for you and who is best for you. Sometimes, you won't hear music, or feel magic to know who's best for you. The heart just knows and it doesn't need any romantically charged scenario to decide on the matter. Trust in your heart, and trust that time will eventually lead you to, not to the perfect partner, but to the most suitable partner for you. Being single is a phase of life that we need to be thankful for, because being single means our hearts have yet to choose the best one for us.</p>
              <p><br><br>Take your time, the world will wait. Being married doesn't guarantee that it will make your life happy. It doesn't guarantee anything at all. Sometimes, it only brings two miserable people together only to make their life even more miserable. Without the right intention, the emotional maturity, financial security and of course, unwavering love, you're better off unattached.</p>
              <p><br><br>Living Life. Don't put your life on hold for Mr. and Mrs. Right, but don't let it waste away with Mr. or Mrs. Wrong. Life is about things that you do and happen to you everyday. It's not about the things that could have happened but never did, or things that you think would happen in the future. Live life now. Live it to the fullest and stop beating yourself up, trying to be perfect on a Saturday night date. Allow life to surprise you with it's most wonderful blessings.</p>

              Wow dude,
              
              Thanks for this. Honestly i dont know if this is an original creation but if it is, thanks alot. I have been single all my life and currently in NS i have been questioning my position in life. Why am i still single, will i ever find some1, and all that jazz. I have always placed enormous importance on friendship and enjoying life and studies. Far too much importance on those things to go bother looking for some1. I always had the idea and notion that 'the one' will just come by your life and there is no need to go out actively looking her. But only recently i have started to question that way of thinking. Anyway i just found your writing very meaningful and helpful (its weird cause it was only this week i started thinking about all this and just hhalf an hour ago i was talking to my best friend in life about this topic before i stumbled upon this random post). I will continue to cherish the wonderful friendships i have with both the guys and girls in my life. Especially those that have been there for me for years and will continue to be there for me for years to come.
              
              Cheers!
