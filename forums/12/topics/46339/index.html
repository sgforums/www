            <div class='col-md body'>I'm very confused now... Really don't know wat to do.. Hope u ppl can gif me some advice.. Thank's..<br><br>I have known this guy, K, at a remedial.. (In my school)<br>It all happened like dis...<br>I have noticed that K has been lookin at me for the whole lesson..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> After the lesson ended, i went to the library.. Before i left, he asked his friend to ask me for my number... Of coz, I ignored him...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  He didn't give up and followed me to the library where I was supposed to do my project with my friends.. It was so coincidence that K's friend was in the library too n he was my classmate... He asked me for my num thinking that i will gif it to him since he is my classmate, but i didn't gif him as well... Left wif no choice, i left d library... When i came back, he has left... However, K has gotten my num from another friend of mine... And now, almost the whole class knew of my num...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>K messaged me and called me.. He said he wanna make frenz wif me.. So, we started messaging n tokin to each other... He told me dat he likes me n he wants me to be his stead... I didn't really know what i'm supposed to do.. He told me dat i mean alot to him n he wanna care for me... I dunno whether he's true.. Sometimes when he nvr msg me, i'll feel lonely.. i'll miss him too...<br>Maybe i'm interested in him too but many of my frenz told me that he's a flirt.. He has asked for a lot of gals' num too.. n i'm jus one of them..<br><br>I tried to reject him but i jus couldn't.. I really dun wanna hurt him but i dun wan to gif him up too... I really dunno how i feel.. Haf i fallen in luv wif him? Or maybe it's jus bcos i dun wanna hurt him?<br></div>
