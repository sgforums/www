              <p>To say truth, I also met someone of late who fits your list but am starting to feel strange because I don't see all that good stuff happening to me. He seems unreachable. Well, that's another story which I might post at a later time on AA. I think women have this intuition built in their system when they feel things are out of balance. But the funny thing is, a lot of us women choose to ignore the uncomfortable feelings and sometimes even good friends' advice so as to pursue the giddy toxicating "love" feeling that certain guy give us. We are after that high almost like a drug, choosing to ignore all signals we find strange of a guy, choosing to put all these signals one side so as to feel "love". We give more and more in a relationship hoping that he would give back to even out this imbalance, hoping that he would realize soon enough what a fine woman we are. But it doesn't work this way. You voice out your unhappiness and he defers by saying he will do it but you don't see it coming. The more you give, the more he takes, until it becomes like his god given rights. You do not expect much from him, but the least you ask of him when you do need his help, he grumbles saying it's too much to ask of him and it all ends up on a very unhappy note because, 1) either he chooses to ignore or pretend he's forgotten about your pleas for help, or 2) he does the thing that you require but make known his unhappiness very clearly as if you are nothing but trouble! Hey, who was all the way there for him when he needs help even without asking?</p>
              <p>To put it simply, this is just a relationship to him out of convenience. Which scumbag would refuse when there is a woman in his life who offer to help clean up his mess while providing him a free not having to work for female companion? Pardon me HelloKittyFan, I'm going to get very crude here. See? He doesn't even have to offer his entire month's pay for a night with you! You came into his life, he doesn't respect you and he sees that you don't leave but only express unhappiness about it. So he sometimes coax you, sometimes ignores you, sometimes being sweet to you... all at his convenience! While at times when it matters the most, he is not there for you.</p>
              <p>Above are my personal experience in my previous unhappy marriage, for your reference. So if it's like this already before marriage, I think it's going to be much much worse after. It was a lot of agony for me to come to a decision to leave my marriage. When I told him about my decision, suddenly he agreed to go for counselling! (which I had repeatedly told him to before this decision but which he refused) There will be a lot of patterns coming upon the decision of wanting to break, be it a marriage or just a relationship, but I want to tell you that should you come to this decision, stay strong. There is a reason why I've posted certain links on my past threads because I do see a pattern among certain guys. If you don't mind, go read them.</p>

                          love as well. Be it frenz or family.<br> <br> I never rely on him to solve my things, rely on him in watever
                          situations I am in. Cos, I know he can't help, neither will

                          person in my life and my life revolves ard him. My life now

              <p>I was in my marriage for 7 years, before I woke up to realize that I could not picture myself living this life with him forever.</p>
              <p>I understand the confusion part because just merely 2 years into the marriage, even my colleagues have been hinting "should I get divorce" when I told them some of my woes. At that point, the idea of divorce hadn't even pop up in my mind yet.</p>
              <p>But then it was seeded and I toyed with the idea in my mind, but felt immediately guilty afterwards. How could I just want the easy way out? Women are by nature not abandoners. So I decided to put in more effort in my marriage, to help him out whenever I can.</p>
              <p>But then again, life in a marriage, there will always be a lot of issues beside just love. And when things are fine, we have had happy times together. But when things are not, you start to see him shrinking his responsibilities, deny his responsibilities and even blame his responsibilities on guess who? YOU.</p>
              <p>Yes, your mind is wanting out. Your sentimentality however, clings stubbornly onto those happy memories that you both have had and is feeling guilty. But hey girl, brush aside those happy times. Traumatic as it seems, look clearly in the face at those times when he ditched you, ignore you in your sorry plight. If you ignore all that, I'm sure there will be more of such coming to add to your traumatic "collection", and even then, I hope you will not be cuddling all those happy memories of him and thinking of his "potential" as you've seen of him in your initial good impression of him, to sleep.</p>
              <p>I feel so much for you. I know you need a good hug and cry. Come, Let me give you a good virtual hug, strong woman. At times, I know that actually, the stronger and more capable we women are, the more we actually crave for someone out there to show that they care. That we need not be as strong and tough the way we have been so accustomed all along to deal with life. Let me give you a good hug girl. The forumnites here are rooting for you.</p>
              <p>Hugz.</p>

              <p><strong>Mayb I did things the wrong way - I tried making him see things

              in hosp, after a major op, I was there most of the time, and it was
              near to xmas. He was discharged only after xmas. But, my fiance was
              nagging and nagging and saying how can we be spending xmas in hosp,
              we should be out enjoying ourselves. Plus, isn't it enough we pop
              by to see him already, why's the need to stay till xmas over? I
              compared - I told him straight in the face, if that's his dad lying
              there, and I am telling him the things he is telling me now. How
              would he feel? --&gt; Is this compare? I felt in a way it is.<br> <br> For the recent 2 yrs together, I started using comparing, like the
              above example, to let him see things from my view, how he would

              <p>You need to persist. IGNORE ALL THAT. Patterns like this promising false promises to change will keep coming your way. Have absolutely no contact with him no matter how he yell you heartless. I know I know girl.. I've been through all that tough times. You will feel indignant because you're not as "heartless" as he proclaims and you want to retaliate to tell him that you're not.</p>

              <p>There is a name for this method of breaking away from such unhealthy relationships. It's call "Starve the Vampire." I think you should be abe to google this term and find related articles to it.</p>
              <p>I have been doing a lot of readings on my own because I realize to have a healthy relationship, I have to be emotionally healthy myself to recognize what is healthy and what is not for me. Even then, it's been hard, like I almost fell for something unhealthy recently. Almost.</p>

              <p>We will only be this "strong" until we can find someone we trust and rely on. To feel accepted. One way and the easiest is of course to find a partner. But very soon we discover that he is not as reliable as he seems.</p>
              <p>So widening our social circle is one way. Even then, not everyone seems "safe" enough for you to confide your problems to. And with the image of a "tough, independent" woman you've projected yourself to friends and they reaffirming by saying you're strong and all, it becomes even harder to tear the mask down and to admit that we are actually very vulnerable at core.</p>
              <p>But still, I do believe, that there is someone as gentle and kind as you out there in this world. It is for this that I am staying strong and not give myself in when I feel sad and vulnerable, not to toss myself carelessly into my ex's arms with his wide grinning vampire's fangs.</p>
