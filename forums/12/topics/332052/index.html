              <p>Actually, I dunno by posting is to seek advice, to let it out or both.<br><br>I felt awfully tired.<br><br>I dunno is cos I dun understand my fiance, he dun understand me, or is it both ways?</p>
              <p>Or in a way, I have always been strong, that regardless of what things that may happened, he felt I am supposed to be able to go thru in one piece?</p>
              <p>Whenever things cropped up in my life, I told him - he jus nod and nod.<br><br>When things cropped up in my life, he told me, I couldn't jus nod and nod, I have to offer advice, help, solve. I am expected to do all those.<br><br>When my dad was in hosp after a major op, during xmas time, his mentality was why is he in hosp with me, we should be out enjoying ourselves crazy.<br><br>When my sis was in hosp, I sent soup to her everyday after school, he came to fetch me back, but he was constantly nagging why must he always appear in hosp to see me.<br><br>All these trips to hosp, visits to my family, I never requested him to do so, neither did I ask.<br><br>On my bro's wedding day, he was late by an hour plus, I told him he was lucky cos some of my family members were caught in a jam, thus would be late, meaning he was in time for the dinner. His reply - I am not the groom today, late or not, dun matter.<br><br>His sis's rom, he said he thot the time was 9am, but actually it was 11am, we reached there at 830am.<br><br>I was once teased and laughed at very badly cos I bought a soft drink for ten bucks when I was overseas with his family.<br><br>Recently, I went to the same place again with my family, I bought three soft drinks, my family told me, as long as u r happy, and we are here to enjoy, jus buy wat u wan.<br><br>When I got into a quarrel with his fren, he took the neutral part, although he knew well that his ren was at fault. His reason - it's only fair I be neutral, it doesn't matter who rite who wrong, as long as I know u rite, everything's ok liao.<br><br>But, mayb he had forgotten, I was close to some of his frenz as well, they told me, he told his frenz I was at fault, it's me being ridiculous.<br><br>His fren caused me to have an accident, landed in hosp, missed my first day of job, and I have to resign cos I was in hosp for three months, yet it's my fault.<br><br>I went for a short holiday, came back, but felt tired as due to the schedule, I had to be up early during the trip. He nagged and nagged at me saying I was looking so tired and so sian after my trip, said since I so tired from holiday, might as well dun go. He met me the day I came back from my trip.<br><br>I was worrying about my family member's medical result, dunno whether op is needed or not, he said I am being ridiculous, why bother to think about these things. It's a major op, can't I be worried?<br><br>No hold hands = dun love him.<br><br>Too long no meet his family, cos of my work commitments, I get scoldings. And have to drag me go meet them for dinner despite knowing I am very tired out. Ended up, I was on medical leave for a week, cos I caught a cold during that dinner. He jus said who asked you to work so much, see, dun work so much den you won't fall sick already.<br><br>I dun work? Is he going to provide for me and my family? -_-"<br><br>The following scenario mayb is I myself being ridiculous - seeing pretty gals, or rather those wearing shorts or mini skirts, he will tell me he felt like stopping his car and giving them a drive. See these gals in retail stores, he will say he dun mind giving his entire month's pay jus for a nite with them. I ??? - Once, twice, I am fine; but each and everytime he saw, he must say? Am I being ridiculous or am I just being normal by getting angry?<br><br>I seldom turn up for his family gatherings, but he will turn up at mine and started comparing how often he turned up at mine, while I never turned up at his. I will definitely love to say, at least my family treats u like a human being and is courteous to u, urs? Urs either treats me like another vase there or take out on me when they are feeling moody. <br><br>Imagine dining with a group of ppl, when the food is served, esp one that everyone loved, the plate jus go practically empty within a few minutes? When I didn't take any meat, jus take veges, cos meat are pretty high in demand on the table, I was 'branded' as fussy. I didn't want to 'snatch' meat.<br><br>These are just Part 1; there are more parts to go~~~~~~~~<br><br><br><br></p>

              ridiculous.<br> <br> His fren caused me to have an accident, landed in hosp, missed my
              first day of job, and I have to resign cos I was in hosp for three
              months, yet it's my fault.<br> <br> I went for a short holiday, came back, but felt tired as due to the
              schedule, I had to be up early during the trip. He nagged and
              nagged at me saying I was looking so tired and so sian after my
              trip, said since I so tired from holiday, might as well dun go. He
              met me the day I came back from my trip.<br> <br> I was worrying about my family member's medical result, dunno
              whether op is needed or not, he said I am being ridiculous, why
              bother to think about these things. It's a major op, can't I be
              worried?<br> <br> No hold hands = dun love him.<br> <br> Too long no meet his family, cos of my work commitments, I get
              scoldings. And have to drag me go meet them for dinner despite
              knowing I am very tired out. Ended up, I was on medical leave for a
              week, cos I caught a cold during that dinner. He jus said who asked
              you to work so much, see, dun work so much den you won't fall sick
              already.<br> <br> I dun work? Is he going to provide for me and my family? -_-"<br> <br> The following scenario mayb is I myself being ridiculous - seeing
              pretty gals, or rather those wearing shorts or mini skirts, he
              will tell me he felt like stopping his car and giving them a
              drive. See these gals in retail stores, he will say
              he dun mind giving his entire month's pay jus for a nite with
              them. I ??? - Once, twice, I am fine; but each and everytime he
              saw, he must say? Am I being ridiculous or am I just being normal
              by getting angry?<br></p>

              <p>He sounds like a big time mcp. I see a lot of warning bells in the above. He seems to be someone see human say human words, see ghost say ghost words. Plus the part about him commenting on those retail girls - big alarm bell. If you need to go overseas somewhere away, would you be able to trust him alone in Singapore? The fact he keeps saying seems to indicate that it's constantly on his mind. Even if you're in Singapore, you cannot control his every action, who wants to baby a man anyway?</p>
              <p>He doesn't respect you man.</p>

              <p>There's no right or wrong in loving someone, but there are times where you just have to let go, take a step back to relax and think if you really want to go on FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE with such a person.</p>

              <p>To help yourself think through better, write down the pros and cons of maintaining the relationship. But the ultimate question is to ask yourself, why do you love him in the first place.</p>

              <p>OMG, HelloKittyFan. I really feel for you especially after what I've read of your some of posts several days ago. How long have you been in this relationship dear? Sometimes, as days and even years go by, we are subjected to constant "grumbling" of our partners till we are not able to differentiate what is right or wrong anymore just because our other half made it seem like the most natural and normal thing on earth to do. Secretly, we fume and we resent, but are being pardon me "shut the f***k" up by his ridiculous "reasons".</p>
              <p>Your list is very good, but have you respect yourself enough to adhere by it?</p>
