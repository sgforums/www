              <p>The butt of the joke is that it took you 5 long years to come to this realization?</p>
              <p>Some words of wisdom for you '<em>don't get married for the wrong reasons'. </em>I'm not rooting for anyone to jump ship at first sign when something isn't right - but if you realized that there're some significant issues in the relationships (or serious character flaws in your partner), then it's really time to take a step back to reexamine the plans.</p>
              <p>Marriage is lifelong; and a divorce proved to be more difficult and painful. Don't even take the wrong step, may you have the wisdom to cut your losses whenever necessary <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"></p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>i support the suggestion to ignore him for awhile. he has taken u for granted so u must show him that subconciously, u r still impt to him.</p>
              <p>unfortunately he is also very possessive. usually this is a sign of someone insecure about aspects of his life, he also has the need to feel important in front of u.</p>
              <p>its good that u r complaining. the day u stop complaining will be the day u give up.</p>

              <p>After reading your posts, i can't help but to feel for you. You really need a break from this relationship. A break to give you a breather, a clear mind and time to think about all these things. It takes two hands to clap and it takes efforts from both parties in a relationship to make it work. Your fiance has certainly been insensitive to your feelings during the course of your relationship and has not even tried to put himself in your shoes.</p>
              <p>Learning to let go of certain things is very hard. Especially when it comes to a relatrionship because of the responsibility that we have towards the relationship as well as the guilt that we may feel towards the other party. But maybe it's time to let go off this relationship le. Don't make yourself go through such agony le.</p>

              <p>Relationships don't have to be a bed of
                              roses but eventually, do you see a satisfying r/s
                              with a happy man down the road?</p>
              <p>If that possibility is nowhere in sight after 5 years, I think not. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's best to evaluate the value of this r/s and try answering your own questions objectively. Break it down.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What foundation is your r/s built upon?</p>
              <p>Mutual support for each other? Partnership? Trust?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is your sex life still satisfying?</p>
              <p>Are you still attracted to him? Does he still rock your world in bed?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Disagreements are common but if the bickering is wearing you out and he's constantly making nasty remarks, then it's definitely going down hill.</p>
              <p>He mentioned he will commit a month's paycheck to sexy women on the streets, I wouldn't worry if I were you because he doesn't sound like the type with the goods the pull that one off. Being in a r/s doesn't mean you stop being attracted to others, so the red flag, imho, is the resentment building up inside of him. He sounds like he's seething from something.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What about yourself?</p>
              <p>Do you want to meet new people or are you be satisfied with just him on your horizon. Forever?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since the both of you run in the same family and social circles, why don't you seek second opinions from family and close friends? What do they think of him?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We usually put on our best behaviour in the dating stage, so it's common to expect 50% less after marriage. And even then, most guys will respect their gfs and wives. I have close friends heading into their sixth year anniversaries with their girlfriends and I don't see their r/s disintegrating as badly as yours.</p>
              <p>I'd bail if I were you. I'm of the opinion men never dump women, they just display all the signals, then wait for you to walk away.</p>

              <p>Hi there again. I was reading a particular article and found some of what it said worth pondering. For your reference:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Regardless of his appearance in society, her needs aren't important to him. In fact they are a downright nuisance.</p>
              <p>If I ever expressed dissatisfaction in the relationships, or anything having to do with my needs being met within our union he would react with a put-down of me rather than seeing the possibility that he was contributing to the problem. Normally I experienced a  voicelessness, never really feeling seen or heard, which was what I had experienced as a child. So instead of telling myself that I deserved to be seen and heard, I would plummet into those familiar old emotions that reminded me that I wasn't really worthy enough to be truly visible.</p>
              <p>This is the difference between a narcissistic personality and one who is not. A narcissist can't put himself in his partners shoes. He can't imagine what it might be like to be on the other side of the situation. He can only see it from his own perspective, which is a perspective that completely lets him off the hook and puts 100% of the responsibility upon his partner.</p>
              <p>The horror I experienced within the relationship was nothing compared to the devastation of leaving. It was during this time that I had to come to the true realization that I had been living a lie and had invested years of my life enforcing this illusion. Suddenly his image of the consistent partner gave way to a rage that I had never before seen in him, yet intuitively I always sensed it was there.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The abuse came in the form of constant invalidation of my reality until I came to invalidate my own reality. <strong>I lost trust in myself and my ability to know what the truth was in any given situation.</strong> I became dependent upon him for his version of reality so I could make sense of what was going on in my life</span>.</p>
              <p>There are a two signs: He doesn't believe he is at fault for anything. He has a certain air of superiority. There are also other obvious signs such as haughty body postures, eccentricity, a charasmatic presence, highly confident appearance, intense and invasive sexual energy, a casual interest in me in order to get something they want, in some I notice a need to constantly talk about themselves, others are quiet and introverted.
              <strong>The most important detection devise is the way I feel. I feel anxious, drained, on guard, inadequate, frustrated, and confused. I think those are the kind of signs we need to listen to the most. How do we feel?</strong> Once we learn to trust our own feelings we stop selling our reality for the narcissistic illusion. It is then we are able to call back our power and stop playing into the hands of one who doesn't have our best interest at heart.</p>

              <p>Dear HelloKittyFan,</p>
              <p>I do hope you feel better after crying. Then again, I hope that after feeling better at this cry, you would not feel silly at yourself for "kicking up such a big fuss" and doubt whether this matter is really that heavy after all. My personal experience is that after being stifled for so long, at times when I do feel better, I felt strange. Subconsciously, it was as if I am not supposed to feel light and happy! Don't let this soften your will power as you have said, to want to leave.</p>
              <p>Like what above forumnites have said, it's not easy on your part to let go of him. Purpledragon84 has put it. It's like an addiction, and an unhealthy one at that. There will be withdrawal symptoms after leaving.</p>

              <p>u know.. it's going to be hard letting someone who has been ard
              and part of ur life for 5 years.. it's like an addiction.. and an
              unhealthy one at that..</p>
              <p>u're gonna get the withdrawal symptoms.. but after the
              withdrawal symptoms are over.. it's a brand new life..</p>
              <p>ditch him.. get a better guy.. or even a pet..</p>
              <p>a pet will love and appreciate u if u care for it.. not this
              guy..</p>

              <p>And like what jojobeach said, 5 years of misery is nothing compared to a lifetime of suffering.</p>

              <p>5 years of torment is nothing compared to a lifetime of

              <p>You can cry.. you will grieve.. you will get depressed.. it's
              all part of the healing process.</p>
              <p>You will feel lonely, your life will seem meaningless.. by hey.
              you survived before you met him didn't ya ?</p>
              <p>It's time to try out other flavors.. date other men... live life

              <p> </p>
              <p>u still rmb my last post? abt my friend going back to that jerk?? haven't u saw those objections made by the others? as in how she shouldn't go back to him..abt how a leopard cannot change its spots..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>is the same as for ur case..if u know that this guy isn't good to u..y do u still stick to him?..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i was taken aback when i saw this : "No hold hands = dun love him."</p>
              <p>&gt;&gt; is he a MCP or he's simply childish? =.=''' no offense ah..but i don't think a mature man will have that kind of thinking..love is express through other ways &amp; not by whether a couple is holding hands constantly or not..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but..the final decision still lies with u bah..is ur life &amp; u choose ur own path..</p>
              <p>will pray for the best for u =)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>people can only give u advise..the choice still lies with u ultimately..go thru the pros &amp; cons..think abt the possibility of a future with this guy..&amp; how's life going to be if u still cont. with him..&amp; most imptly..does he deserves u? does he appreciate what u have done for him?..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>no offense again..bt he really sound childish &amp; selfish..taking u for granted..really feel that he doesn't deserve u..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>haiish..lots of jerks out there..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"My fault, cos I dunno how to reject him, reject to help him." &gt;&gt; is just that u r too kind to reject him..don't blame it on yourself..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway..cheer up k =D</p>
