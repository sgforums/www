All they care is play and play, bully people. The teachers favour them (sheesh) and ignore the ones that truly works. The ones that truly works graduted while the lazy ones stay behind. Sad to say, everywhere I go (even outside) they were try to pick and tease. Ya cause i'm quiet and don't have daring friends to talk back at them. So ya, I became lazy and unwilling to work. School was hellish. So anything wrong I did, I am being laugh at or bullied. It's like..restricting me..<br><br>How to tell that they r jealous? There was this person she asks me how much I got for my F&amp;N and I told her my results..in the end, she pout her lips grumpily and went to her friends start whispering. Once, there was a clogged sink and two ppl start accusing me of doing that! anyway, I have a lot of small traumautising events that leads my emotions goes up and down. So I was tired of the politics and start slacking . To make it worse, this girl bully make me feel even more miserable when she makes my crush (he likes me too) doesn't like me anymore. Because my crush is a popular guy in school so she is jealous and she kept clinging on to him  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>How would I realise the consequences? I am not fully matured and I dunno how to go abt expressing my emotions. Since I made a mistake in the past, I am now of course asking ppl how to deal wif this kind of thing if YOU were in my situation.</div></blockquote>Stick around with people of your calibre and kind....<br><br>As much as it might sucks because your teacher(s) 'fail' you; your class 'fail' you or your enevironment 'fail' you... You'll just have to start to realise that this is really how things are gonna work while living in this world...<br><br>You can't tell your boss you won't be completing his work because you don't like him; you can't tell your government that you don't wanna pay tax because you don't like them; can't tell your customer you don't wanna serve them because they jealous of you.... This is just how the world works girl... Whatever is happening around you... You just change, adapt, tolerate and accomodate...</div>
