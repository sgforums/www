            <div class='col-md body'>The best way to revenge is to prove them wrong, action speaks louder than words. Last time there was this guy who always make bold claims, sometimes impossible things and everyone will say he is crazy obviously, but once he has done enough impossible things (not all, but done enough), people will start to believe that impossible things is not so impossible for people with determination to do it. I am not suggesting people go around claiming they can lift the MRT track on his own, in short, know your limits.</div>

I have to say that I did quite well during sec 1-2 so at that period of time ,they were like jealous, trying to disturb me to gain spotlight. So you now asking, since I so good why I still need to retake? Long story bro...I am not the kind that ace every exams without studying. Ya, true the enviornemnt everything, even teachers affected my overal well-being. In short, from sec 3 onwards, I was combined with another class and my life went downhill there.<br><br>True, a bit silly..but just can't let go some the bitterness in me. I am a very sensitive person so I tend to let things go to my head. But ya, part of this thread is a rant.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why would I want to be in their clique? All they care is play and play, bully people. The teachers favour them (sheesh) and ignore the ones that truly works. The ones that truly works graduted while the lazy ones stay behind. Sad to say, everywhere I go (even outside) they were try to pick and tease. Ya cause i'm quiet and don't have daring friends to talk back at them. So ya, I became lazy and unwilling to work. School was hellish. So anything wrong I did, I am being laugh at or bullied. It's like..restricting me..<br><br>How to tell that they r jealous? There was this person she asks me how much I got for my F&amp;N and I told her my results..in the end, she pout her lips grumpily and went to her friends start whispering. Once, there was a clogged sink and two ppl start accusing me of doing that! anyway, I have a lot of small traumautising events that leads my emotions goes up and down. So I was tired of the politics and start slacking . To make it worse, this girl bully make me feel even more miserable when she makes my crush (he likes me too) doesn't like me anymore. Because my crush is a popular guy in school so she is jealous and she kept clinging on to him  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>How would I realise the consequences? I am not fully matured and I dunno how to go abt expressing my emotions. Since I made a mistake in the past, I am now of course asking ppl how to deal wif this kind of thing if YOU were in my situation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>okie...i see your problem...now do you know your solution?<br><br>edit:i think your real problem is you are finding something to blame instead of yourself...a state of denial...you feel that your life suck because they sabo you and are jealous of you...i mean..how is that possible?<br>you feel that because of them...you have to retake your exams...you cannot see the fact that if you had study harder...would you be in the state you are now?<br><br>seriously...now is already may...technically you should be seperated with them for at least 6 months...why only now you wanna start blaming them?<br>the answer to this is that...you are frustrated that you have to retake your Os..and you need some form of outlet to vent out your frustration...and yes..you are using your ex-classmate to put the blame on...although its not totally their fault...but you just needed someone to push the responsibility to...<br><br>hard words...but the truth...</div>
