(not too sure what she concern me abt?) we seldom talk to each other and even we met on the way, she just walk away like i'm transparent. these few weeks we began to talk  more. (just some normal stuff) Not too sure if i 'm bored and need a companion is it, i began to think of her. sometime when she talk to another guy, i will get a bit irritated or worked out. i began to ask her out 1 evening. we have a nice meal and a movie. the problem is we already knew each other for so many years but why i suddenly think of her so much. does she think of me too? do i really to like her? does she like me too? if she does, why she always ignored me when we meet? Am i thinking too much? both of us are single. i think right now only myself asking her out, but she doesn't ask me out. it make me wonder am i thinking too much. she might not like me at all.</div>

Something's not right somewhere. Or perhaps, she's just peeved you haven't made a pass on her all these years. Then again, how old are the two of you?</div>

Love starts with nothing and end with everything.<br><br>She could be shy, that's why she avoided you. You should give it a try and if situation permits, ask her to be your girlfriend. Give each other sometime to understand each other better. Ask her out for dinner more often. Praise her! Girls love hearing praising from guy. But of course, your praise must be genuine.<br><br>Good luck!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

But if I never try, I won't be having a gf now. My gf is 8 yrs older than me, taller than me, last time earn more money than me, so imagine the odds lah, most guys would have given up... but if I never try, I never win her over. If genna rejected, it's the girl's loss lah, what I will then do is to work hard and earn lots of money and get a better girl and prove to her that it's her loss lor, and I won't go back to her side anymore. That's just my thoughts lah, it may be worthless.</div>
