Try to put your career ahead of u. Take up a course, and channel your energy to elsewhere.

Do you even realise that in the beginning, by right, you shouldn't/wouldn't have gotten this relationship at all? (Since you mentioned it was forbidden).<br><br>It was a bonus right from the start. A fantasy. A dream. A haven. An escape.<br><br>`And tada, welcome to the club - the top ten mistake man make; which is to treat the lady of their dream like Goddess. Seriously speaking, the last thing you would ever want to do, is to make your woman lose that respect in you as their man.<br><br>A man who gives in to anything will lose everything - CloUdiSm Remix III<br><br>I do not know why it was a forbidden love (well, unless you explain), but anyway, it can be 7 years, or even 2 years or even less - a good relationship is one that has made impact and positive influence into our lives. The duration doesn't matter - its the process that we should cherish and the memories to be kept. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: You learned a lesson: Woman are like fire - the minute they become your master, you are screwed. Keep them moderate and you will discover their beauty and probably subconscious respect. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
