            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,im 15 this year and i'm feeling really sick whenever i think of this girl g. (im a girl btw). G is seated beside me in class. We've been siing beside one another since March. In the beginning of the year,being in a new class,i found i've problems fitting in. Everything was fine when i hang out with S,C and G. It was around this time, when S and C,for some reasons,decided to stop befriending G. S,who was seating beside G at that time, asked me politely if i'd like to seat beside her instead. It was a mistake. I thought G was a wonderful,nice and understanding friend. But this is a girl who is so possesive,sensitive and demanding. It became apparent to me she was the total opposite of me. When i go off with other friends,she refused to talk to me.It was only when i promised to accompany her then she will resumed to her normal self. I find her very quiet. My other friends from various schools,who used to be her pri sch classmates,said she has a bad temper.<br>Soon,here are the varioys incidents i've encountered:<br><br>When dining some of our classmates,she refused to join them at the same table. The boys were stunned. I was embarrassed as well.<br><br>We were each assigned by our teacher to a group study session. She was the leader. As there are 4 members to a group,a leader is supposed to help us in our assignments. G,for some starange reasons,refused to talk,and therefore i'd to ask the other member L,for help. G began ignoring us and even cried!!!!<br><br>Once,our friend K cried.G and I,along with another friend tried consoling her. After which,i mumbled to myself,"i must tell S". S is K's good friend. And G began ignoring me. It was very disturbing. Is this woman sick? Thanks to her,my friend H began siding her too. I think G has a two personality. She tends to show me the unpleasant side of her. When H decides to go jogging with the other girls,G insisted she is trying to abandon her. When i asked G to forgive H,G was like,"im joking la." I find G terribly disgusting. In a way or so,she disgusted me. She flirts with boys,thinks she's the prettiest girl in class and for the slightest thing,like if i forget her birthday,she flares up at me.<br><br>Now,i find myself totally changed when hanging out with her,H and K.Im like the most quiet one. H and G are totally together,thats fine. I can't be bothered anyways.I hate it when G keep pintpointing me as a baddie. Look,this woman has a little loosescrew up there.<br><br>I wrote a letter to her yesterday. I began blaming her everything. I apologised repeatedly in my letter and i know she will hate me,but look,there's is indeed a problem with her.<br><br>All i longed for is a caring friend and not some mad person who gets mad at me for no apparent reason and begin gossipping about me to my friends. So what if i've more friends than her? That doesn't give her the to ruin my reputation. Could someone kindly advise me what to do when i see her tomorrow in school? Im sitting beside her in class and it's indeed unbearable.<br><br>(P.S: I found out that S and CP are no longer friends with G cos G is always jealous of S' marks and thus,this led to the end of their friendship.)</div>
