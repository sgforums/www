I hate guys who cries. Anyway, she is just feeling insecure and terribly confused at the point when she msg you that morning. I'm sure she meant it when she says that she likes you. Assure her that the relationship will not hinder her studies...and you should jolly well make sure it doesn't. You need to be patient with her to support her emotionally.<br><br>Liking a person doesn't means possessing that person. And love will never die once you have accepted love or decided to give love. So give her a call and assure her...don't let your happiness slips away or turn into a tragedy.<br></div>

She has told you not to msg her so that she will forget you.. It may be a sign telling you to back away till after her exams..<br><br>Since you going in to NS soon, why don you let her have her exams first and talk things out when you come out frm NS say in a couple of weeks time.. which i believe her exams will be over by than? You don wan to be blamed or regret later when she failed her exams becuase of you.. Do you? She may say what she said with out going thru her brain.. Let her be for the time being.. She may be overly stress and confuse..<br><br>Talk abt it at a later date ya?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by universe:</div><div class="quote_body">I knew her for 2 months +,she is a very sweet and gentle girl. After getting to know each other after days and days of chatting/ outings with each other, i found out i like her alot. Then, one day i told her i like her. From that day onward, i was like chasing her, her feeling to me was confused too at that time. During this time it was like roller coaster for us.<br><br>Yest, she told me she suddenly found out she likes me..I was quite happy at first. But then she cried on me.<br>She told me she couldn't concentrate on her studies at all when she wants to study. She will thinks of me and become restless. Because she put her studies very high and an As student in her work, she became stressed out. I am going to national service next week, she say she will miss me and think of me as the days come along.That made her couldn't concentrate and she wants to score well in this semeter.<br>She was crying on me quite a few times, i was helpless. I cried a little too. Maybe she was crying, i had to be strong not to cry also.<br><br>Then she added, sometimes she felt she regretted knowing me. I told her that too during my chasing of her coz she really hurted me.<br>She told me that she thinking of forgetting me so that can concentrate on her studies this semeter. I told her, why not u forget till after her exam and at the same time i POP too. She say she scare she will become too cold-blooded, once if can forget me, will forget the feeling..<br>I don't know what to do...ask her to balance her studies and her feeling, cannot..ask her to forget me until her exam finish, cannot...<br><br>I asked her what she wants, she say she just wants to do well for her sem. That means forgetting about me hence can concentrate. She say she will try not forget me totally to the point of losing her feeling to me. I couldn't do anything too right..<br><br>This morning, she smsed me. I cried this morning.Please do not msg me anymore, i will try not to love you anymore.<br><br>I was like gutted and sad, now finding hard to take it. Its like we went though alot till she likes me. i mean we..not me alone.<br>Now she wants to forget about me, is trying not to love me anymore.<br><br>We are both selfish yah, she wants to study only while i selfish for her love..<br><br>Love is selfish.<br><br>What should i do now...if u tell me to let nature takes its course, my six sense is telling me that after her exam finish, her heart will change,not with me. I couldn't accept that...she finally likes me..then now.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br>But i couldn't do anything much about it right now yah..except letting her exam finish and my bmt finish..<br>love you, sy...</div></blockquote>Like i always say.. only confessed your feelings if only you know you will get her gaurantee.. or you jus wanna let hier know how you feel and think of no further progress.. then say.. and do it..<br><br>Girls are always like that.. once they know a guy likes her.. she will either avoid him cos totally no interest or she will think about it awhile.. then as time goes by then she thinks that she likes you.. Well for this.. i dun really think that she's really inl ove with you.. jus becos someone likes her.. and the world knows about.. slowly she feels that "eh.. actually i like him too after you confessed to you.."<br><br>She has no intention and not ready to go into a r/s yet.. cos her priority is her sutdies.. If you both really like each other.. 3 months is not long to test your love/ feelings for each other.. Once you go in army.. there will be less time seeing each other.. and if you really start you r/s now.. is rather very unstable.. Give yourself and her time to think about.. there's no rush for this.. take it easy and slow.. ok..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
