If you are so calulative about who is giving and receiving more - I rather you take the time to do something more practical. Sure it is may disappointing when you are being 'used' by another person, but hey, who else can you blame apart from yourself? Being 'used' and 'giving' in relation is two different thing. If you are 'used' - you are being cheated from your action and why does it happen? Because YOU allow it to happen. Giving in a relation is an involunteering action that does not take records of what have you done, etc. Since it does not take record - when you are giving - by right and logic, you should not even feel this way at all, unless deep inside you wanted something.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Instead of pondering over this issue that doesn't do you any good, think about this - don't just like someone blindly and being lead by the nose to eventually find out she is conning your feelings. Sure love is blind - but play emotionally and rationally smart moves to find out whether is she serious, or making 'used' of you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Cheers</div>
