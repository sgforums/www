              <p>But if you insist on giving me your unwanted attention, then you should not be naive and prepared to believe that I will NEVER give in to your suggestions. <img src="http://sgforums.com/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>i..kinda broke up with my gf today...I dont even know what i have done. I treat her nice,i make her happy i love her so much. Then one day she just told me she's thinking about her ex bf and said to me she misses him. I really dunno what to say..i felt so sad.</p>
              <p>Sometimes i really wonder whether am i just a stand-in for her ex bf...she always said to me she love me the most and would never leave me. But today when i ask her whether what she had said in the past is true,she just told me she love me now as a friend and would never abandon me..im really confused..i dont know what is she trying to say..</p>
              <p>sometimes,she compares me with her ex bf and say i should change and stuff..she..always talk abt the bad points in me...like if i have some pimples,she would say why i didnt take care of my face and everything. But if she got a pimple..i ignored it and pretend its not there...she never talk about my good points...i nvr once heard her say i dress nicely(even though i had alr tried my hardest to dress my best) or say im good looking,kind caring and everything...only when i ask her then she would say..</p>
              <p>when we first got together,she was so....sweet and everything..but now,she has changed...so fast...we were once so loving..i dunno...should i blame myself or blame her..i really dont wan this relationship to end,but she said she still likes her ex bf..i really really really dont know what to do anymore..</p>
              <p>parn,hurry and tell me what to do..haha ur advice can be quite..useful sometimes..haha..));</p>

              <p><br>there's nothing much you can do about it, since her heart is no longer with you....</p>
              <p>all this while, you were probably just her "spare tyre" to fill out the void left by her ex....</p>
              <p>i've gone through that before..... move on bah.</p>
              <p>find someone who's able to reciprocate your love, and is worthy of it.</p>
              <p>as for her, you may choose to remain friends with her.... but i think it will be quite hard now that it turns out this way.... in any case, it's your choice.....</p>
