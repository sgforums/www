              <p>i..kinda broke up with my gf today...I dont even know what i have done. I treat her nice,i make her happy i love her so much. Then one day she just told me she's thinking about her ex bf and said to me she misses him. I really dunno what to say..i felt so sad.</p>
              <p>Sometimes i really wonder whether am i just a stand-in for her ex bf...she always said to me she love me the most and would never leave me. But today when i ask her whether what she had said in the past is true,she just told me she love me now as a friend and would never abandon me..im really confused..i dont know what is she trying to say..</p>
              <p>sometimes,she compares me with her ex bf and say i should change and stuff..she..always talk abt the bad points in me...like if i have some pimples,she would say why i didnt take care of my face and everything. But if she got a pimple..i ignored it and pretend its not there...she never talk about my good points...i nvr once heard her say i dress nicely(even though i had alr tried my hardest to dress my best) or say im good looking,kind caring and everything...only when i ask her then she would say..</p>
              <p>when we first got together,she was so....sweet and everything..but now,she has changed...so fast...we were once so loving..i dunno...should i blame myself or blame her..i really dont wan this relationship to end,but she said she still likes her ex bf..i really really really dont know what to do anymore..</p>

              <p>What you receive here may simply be words, but the advice forumers give, are not without shadows of their own past, no? </p>
              <p>I know that losing the one thing your heart desires is painful and personal, but since this is her decision, just learn to respect it and let go. Make new friends. Work your ass off. Keep busy. Let time do its work. You'll be fine even though you may not believe it yet. Cheer up.</p>

              <p>There is something you lack and it is possibly your biggest FLAW. This flaw will plague all your future relationship if you continue to not do something about it.</p>
