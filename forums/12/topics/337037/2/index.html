              <p>Its just me trying to be creative.</p>
              <p>Try to understand women here, if u live in modern sg, chances r the girl will have emotional baggage from their past relship and wat nots, trust me on this :)</p>
              <p>But if a girl is willing to move on w her life and loves u, then give her some thoughts, but that is if you are <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">VERY</span> </strong>certain. You want a relship where u can love her and be loved back. Rem 2-WAY-TRAFFIC, being the man, we should lead and take the initiative + respect and consider her views (i know its sort of conflicting but leading dosent mean lording over ahha)</p>
              <p>Anyway all the best to you... :)</p>

              <p>Well, first thing is that she is still thinking about her ex-boyfriend. She was not more considerate. By dragging up her ex-boyfriend in front of you, well, you would not pull up any exes to hide behind right?</p>
              <p>I feel quite sure that she was not sure of her feelings for you when she agreed to a relationship with you. Thats why she cannot tell you how she could choose about her ex and you.</p>

              <p>haha glad u still have ur sense of humour... hmm jus leave gracefully ba...</p>
              <p>repeat this sentence to urself to whenever u tink of her: <strong>i must leave with dignity....</strong></p>
              <p>if u force her to choose, it will lead to resentment btw u both... it will prove her right tt u have many flaws (e.g. dun respect her decision)... and may even strengthen her feelings for her ex... human nature is such tt we dun like to be force... she confirm won't choose u if u ask her so soon... so respect her n leave her alone to sort out her feelings first...</p>
              <p>i suggest u dun confront her abt the substitute thing again. even if she answers u, how can it help things? she's trying to get out, prob bcos she felt smth was missing in the rs... it's not necessarily ur fault... try to be gracious in ur exit... better end it early than waste time trying  for smth tt's nt meant to be... it'll cause more pain in the long run...</p>
              <p>both of u can still be friends and keep in touch... it's true tt most pple have baggage fr past rs... then u have to overcome them tog as couple... not a one-person show...</p>
              <p>if u shld find another gf.. try to make sure she has gotten over her ex.. (e.g. dun go out wif someone who actually openly says, "my ex is this and that..." - it means tt she's still thinking of him and may nt be ready to accept a new rs...)</p>

              <p><br>Agree with Beautiful951 on the girl's commitment to you. </p>
              <p>Its natural to feel sad when a relationship ends. To 3rd parties, we can only just listen(read in this case) and empathise with what you have gone through...We do not know even 50% of the story(i.e. 50% your side; 50% her side).</p>
              <p>From what you've said about the reason that she broke off with you because she still cannot get over her ex, its quite clear that you love her but she loved herself more. Just straighten yourself and move on.</p>
              <p>Will you still accept her if she comes back to you one day and says she has decided to be with you? Do you want to take the risk again?</p>

              <p>To TS: From what you put across to me in this thread, I assume you are below 20 year old...So its really an age where passion mostly comes first before any long-term commitment.  </p>
              <p>After saying that, just enjoy this time of your lifetime and do not fret over this relationship for too long. There is a long road ahead with so much possibilities.</p>

              <p><br>Anyone can advise TS regarding his topic in here and that's including me and you. BUT since you have made a comment on my post, then you should be sensible enough to see it to the end.</p>
              <p>Trying to close it abruptly would seems more like a hit-and-run act, but if that's what you are after, then you are of no value to me or any forumers if you are unable to hold your ground. Chances are there will be other forumers who will disagree with you too, and that forumer might not be me.</p>
              <p>Not many forumers are capable of giving sensible advices and you're definitely not one of them, so I don't blame you if you are unable to understand my advices to TS. But it would certainly helpful if you are.</p>
              <p>Afterall, your "implying" statement has already told me the kind of person you really are. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> </p>
              <p>One last thing, forumers knows me more than you in this particular forum. And I don't need you to amuse me by commenting on my value with regards to this topic.</p>
              <p>Hang around in this forum more often and advice sensibly if you have any. Else you can always learn alot just by reading other forumers advices if you do not wish to read mine.</p>
              <p>No sensible forumers will mind having an extra piece of advice from any forumer who genuinely wishes to help, ease, comfort, lift, encourage other forumers who are in desperate situations.

              <p><br>Anyone can advise TS regarding his topic in here and that's including me and you. BUT since you have made a comment on my post, then you should be sensible enough to see it to the end.</p>
              <p>Trying to close it abruptly would seems more like a hit-and-run act, but if that's what you are after, then you are of no value to me or any forumers if you are unable to hold your ground. Chances are there will be other forumers who will disagree with you too, and that forumer might not be me.</p>
              <p>Not many forumers are capable of giving sensible advices and you're definitely not one of them, so I don't blame you if you are unable to understand my advices to TS. But it would certainly helpful if you are.</p>
              <p>Afterall, your "implying" statement has already told me the kind of person you really are. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> </p>
              <p>One last thing, forumers knows me more than you in this particular forum. And I don't need you to amuse me by commenting on my value with regards to this topic.</p>
              <p>Hang around in this forum more often and advice sensibly if you have any. Else you can always learn alot just by reading other forumers advices if you do not wish to read mine.</p>
              <p>No sensible forumers will mind having an extra piece of advice from any forumer who genuinely wishes to help, ease, comfort, lift, encourage other forumers who are in desperate situations. At least I won't mind.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>But you were to place yourself in his shoes (if you're a guy and in her shoes if you're a girl), then your advices wouldn't be too far off.</p>
              <p>Nobody can say their advices is the best one or the most accurate/correct one, and that includes me as well.</p>
              <p>But then again, even if TS really did come clean with the entire situation and everyone else read it like a book, the advices that are going to follow will still varies from different individuals.</p>
              <p>I can tell you I always do my best to give my best advice depending on the situation, and it's not easy to advice if you do not have a clue about the person you're advising as most of us forumers only knows the best about ourselves and had never bothered to understand one another. So people often advise others based on their own temper, attitude, opinions, and understanding of themselves. Unless people start to take interest to understand the person that they are trying to advise, they will find themselves giving the wrong advices and causing more grieve to the TS.</p>
