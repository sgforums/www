Well, not everyone is like that. This world must be balance. U have good ppl, u must have bad ppl. You have the rich, then u must have the poor. Well, if u r worried abt making friends at work as i assume its a working scemario, just be aware. I know some ppl wear a mask wherever they go. Well, at least u get backstab by the person, u know he or she cannot be yr true friend. maybe u will realised who is a true friend to u. =)</div>

              <p>There was an event that left an indelible scar, helped shape my future reactions in the event of confusion or betrayal, when I was 18, young, naive and clueless...</p>
              <p>For years, my best buddy for years, my steady gt and I always went out together over weekends. We spent enjoyable times, and never did believe in 'lamp-post theory. We were close, very close. My buddy and I never had any jealousy over my steady gf. He was closer to me than my brother and was like a brother to my steady gf.</p>
              <p>One day, during my NS in-camp BMT, I received a 'Dear John' call from my gf. Guess my best buddy took my words ' To take good care of my gf' too literally. My world crashed, and trust in others lost.</p>
              <p>I shut down my emotions, and didnt care about anything, just simply followed orders, which fortunately BMT helped me. I was the cold emotionless one, doing things others fear or would hesitate, no questions asked.</p>
              <p>In that state was where i hid, to find solace and comfort from hurt, but it was dark and lonely.</p>
              <p>I am glad you realized the loneliness as I found out and want to get out of it. It is never good to remain in that state, for no human is meant to live lonely lives. It is friends that add colour to your journey of life.</p>
              <p>However, the first step out of it is to regain confidence in yourself. Do small things and assure yourself you are capable of achieving success, before moving on. Look in the mirror, smile and love yourself. You are not a loser and never were. Your own success is guaranteed by your birth.</p>
              <p>Out of hundreds of would be brothers and sisters, you won the race to be born.</p>
              <p>Next step is to mix with others. No one is perfect or a mirror image of you. There are still more good people around than bad, and characteristics are relative and only a perception of how you relate to them or how they can relate to you, as friends and companions along the roller coaster journey of life.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, it is self confidence to destroy insecurity. It is your life and only you can achieve it. No one else can do it on your behalf. You are never a loser unless you allow others to dictate/label you as one or act it out on your own free will.</p>
              <p>Only when you start believing in yourself can you begin to live. We humans are not perfect, make mistakes and it is from it that we learn and mature.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              <p>Talking behind ANYONE's back is never a socially acceptable
              behaviour. It denies others the right to counter or defend oneself.
              Yet....most of us human listen or worse, tend to believe in
              careless whispers...</p>

              <p>Be glad you found it out early. Such people are to be avoided as trustworthy friends.</p>
              <p>...But then, I may be guilty of what I had written - humans tend to listen and believe to careless whispers - and I am responding to what you are saying 'behind his back'....sigh.....</p>
