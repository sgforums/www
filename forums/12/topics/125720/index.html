            <div class='col-md body'>Anyone watched channel 8's 9:00pm show? That 'huo xia qu' show? I really pity that Chen han wei, after 7 years of coma in hospital and woke up to find his wife being taken by his friend and daughter calls him daddy. How can anyone tolerate that? It's like after a sleep, the next morning ur wife is married to another friend, ur daughter is not urs.. It's not fair! But for that wife, it's also hard for her to wait upon him for 7 years, who's willing to stay single and serve someone who might never wake up again?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok let's address the topic.<br><br>put myself in their shoes, so i guess since i'm male, i'll put in chen han wei's character's.<br><br>i think i would be ok. i mean if i was still in his condition, cmon, the strongest man will still feel "zhi bei".. so i think i'd have to deal with self-esteem and depression issues FIRST, then worry about the other things later.<br><br>let's say i totally recover, i think no matter how hurt or angry i feel, if her heart has left me, it has left. it doesn't matter if she's in the wrong or not. so what if she admits and says she's in the wrong, it doesn't mean she'll love me back.<br><br>as for chasing her back, well.. aiyah, how far story u want me to write? ahahhahah <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
