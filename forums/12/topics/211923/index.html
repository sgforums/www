            <div class='col-md body'><br>1.<br>There must be something that stirred you to start hitting her. Could your wife be hitting the right sensitive spot on you that makes you lose control and hit her? If you can identify that, tell her to stop hitting that spot or you will be temped to hit her again.<br><br>2.<br>Do you have abusive tendencies? You need to vent your frustrations on someone? Let go in a more advantageous manner. Go running, to run out your frustrations and get fit. Take up a sport to keep you busy instead of staying at home, facing your wife and using her as a punching bag.<br><br>3. If your wife starts to fight back, both of you may end up in hospital.<br><br>4.<br>Your partner should always bring out the best in you. Not the worst in you. Have you considered why she brings out the worst in you?<br><br>5.<br>To start using your hands is a bad sign. If she brings in the authorities, you will be in trouble. Consider the law and the consequences before you start hitting her again.<br><br>6. Both of you may still be immature, that's why the fights.<br><br>7.<br>You both may have differing views? Not enough money? Somone is lazy and don't clean the house? Fighting over who is paying the bills? Find the solution to the problem instead of arguing and giving empty promises.<br><br>8. Last point<br>One person say less, so as not to fuel the situation. In heated moments, walk away and say " We will talk after you have cooled down". Take a walk, do something like listen to soothing music, take a bath. And TALK again later.<br><br>And after the fight, kiss and make up. Say sorry even if it is not your fault. Tough? Then just say "Im sorry we fought". It takes someone to start being soft and nice, and the other person may get softhearted and follow the way you do things. Treat the person how you want to be treated.<br><br>Good luck. Hope you can work it out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm, when your wife scold you......just be patient, listen to what she really mean behind all those words. For instance, she might be stressed because she thinks your money is not enough, or you dont spend enough time, or some other issue. Listen carefully and think what she really mean and why she's like that. Sometimes a person become angry and verbally abuse you, not because they want to, but because they also can't help it, due to pent up issues.<br><br>Next,<br><br>After your wife is scolding you for some time, you just have to acknowledge her, try to mildy interrupt her sentences. You tell her you understand, give her a nod, a smile, a soothing word. You have to let her know that you already 'accept' or 'receive' her grievances, that she already successfully communicate her issues. Dont keep quiet or put up a black face, because that will just enrage her more, and she will continue on to verbally abuse you. If you dont really understand what's the issue, ask some questions mildly. You have to acknowledge it and promise her to resolve the issue. Give her the feeling that you already 'understand' , already 'receive.' Dont let her continue the verbal abuse and make you lose temper.<br><br>Next,<br><br>If you really cant communicate, cant calm her down, cant ask questions, and cant keep patient anymore, and you are just about to blow up yourself, quickly go off to another room or another place, because you yourself need to calm down. Just go off, away from her, better than blowing up there and hit her. Next time try to talk to her.<br><br>Next,<br><br>If you cant go away to anywhere, say in a small room or whatever, and you are just about to blow off, on the last moment quickly vent it on a furniture, dont hit her. Just release your anger on something. If you have a plate, smash the plate down. It will release your anger very well. Furthermore most likely your wife will be stunned and realize you're very angry. Remember this is the last option. This is better than releasing your anger at your wife by hitting her.<br><br>I wish you well,<br><br>Regards,<br>#$%^&amp;*<br><br>PS: for fundamental resolve of the issue, see if you need third party mediation, like marriage counsellors (this is for the issues like not enough money, not enough time, etc, which bugs her in the first place).</div>
