              <p>i just felt so suffocated after doing my first exam paper.i knew my first paper didnt do so well on it and has a high chance of failing it. Due to the time reduced from 3hr to 2hr and the bloody lecturer giving dam advice to study on past year exam paper rather than study the sample exam paper. i felt so stupid for listening to him n didnt go study the sample exam paper <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_frown.gif" alt="icon_frown.gif"></p>
              <p>i couldnt even finished all the question and somehow i dont feel confident that those question i answered are correct. i still got 3 more paper to go and right now i felt so stressed.i know keep thinking about it also no use but haiz ... im still so worried</p>
              <p>told my mum about it but ends up having a arguement about it saying its my fault i go listen to the lecturer. i felt really low about those liao n she keeps bring it up rather than encourage me.keep saying i didnt study hard enough and always go play computer games. i play games to release stress and i dont really like studying. but i still did my studies for around 1-3hr a day.</p>

              <p>Dude.. you are missing the point of examinations.</p>
              <p>What you are trying to do by "listening" to the lecturer is .. you are trying to BEAT the system.</p>
              <p>You'd be better off working on understanding the subjects comprehensively ( whole instead of parts )  and be able to APPLY the knowledge in any kind of situation.</p>
              <p>By "spotting" questions.. you are taking a gamble... but examiners want to know you FULLY understand every part of the curriculum not just pieces here or there.</p>
              <p>Example.. if you go and see a doctor.. you are hoping he is well versed in EVERY aspect of your body.. not just hoping that he can fix what you happen to suffer that day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are not good at retaining information.. and you need to spend more time understanding the subjects.. then you need to put in more hours....</p>
              <p>Hours depends on how fast you can absorb ... not how much you want to set aside.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>. Your mother is nervous because the amount of time you have to study before the exam is limited.. once it's gone.. it's gone.</p>
              <p>But heck.. who cares right..Someone need to flip my burgers..</p>

              <p>Time yourself.</p>
              <p>Attempt the number questions the paper ask for. If four, then answer four, giving 25 minutes for each question in a two hour exam.</p>
              <p>Giving one good answer, with no time left for the rest, you fail.</p>
              <p>Keep to the time, and move on to the next question, until the required number of question is attempted.</p>
              <p>But first you must be prepared for the examinations.</p>

              <p>firstly, what happened, already happened, you can't change it. you still have time, however, the affect the outcome of the exam results that are coming up...</p>
              <p>there's no need to be sad over exams grades, and no use regretting over things you cannot change. exam grades doesn't decide if you will be successful in life. whether you have a successful life, actually boils down to the daily decisions you make in your life.</p>
              <p>i have some friends studying so damn hard, got into law school or medicine, and realize that's not what they want in life. they go to work everyday feeling like suckers doing something they do not want to do and when you're doing something you don't want to do, you feel sad that you're wasting your life this way.</p>
              <p>my suggestion is, do what you can to affect the things that haven't yet happen, you still have time to change the future outcome.</p>

              <p>I recall last time I failed an exam paper. Was so damn disappointed. Yeah like your case, could not answer all those questions. Even I am 23 now, I still have nightmares about it, what it would affect my future. But what the heck. Today I am much better because of it.</p>
              <p>Know what happen? I was so angry with myself when I saw the result posted on the notice board. It said "FAIL".</p>
              <p>I promise myself to work harder and smarter and leave no stone unturn. Next semester, I took teh same subject paper and got "DISTINCTION".</p>

              <p>YEAH!</p>
              <p>As for me, once failed an examination, will never go back to retake, just move on.</p>
              <p>Examination is just to examine you, not really testing you. That is why most of the successful peoples in this world gives up school, like me, now living better than those holding master or Phd.</p>
