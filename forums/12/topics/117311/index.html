            <div class='col-md body'>I have a guy friend, AA. Not very close, but just can get along, can chat and joke, but not close to the extend of can share problems and physically whacking each other. Knew him for half a year, then he got a girlfren, whom he introduced to all of us. At first everything was still alright, but as time past, he seldom join us for meals, and rarely went along for our road trip. And everytime that he joined us, he would definitely bring his girlfren along. But the girlfren would never allow him to talk to me without her presence. He can talk to the other gals in the group, but not me. If there were only 4 of us at a table, and she needed to go to the loo, she'd make him stand outside the loo to wait for her, even though the loo is just like what..less than 10 steps away from the table!?! I have a bf, who is also part of the group, and she also knows him. What possible threat could i be?? This has been going on for 2 years. The last time i met up with the 2 of them, and the rest of the group was more than 6 mths ago. Tomorrow the whole group is having a gathering and i'm of course invited. She had the cheek to call me and tell me to make sure i don't turn up tomorrow. WTF...i have not seen my frens for so long, and she doesn't want me going, just becoz she thinks i'm a threat. I've already given up the frenship with her bf and have absolutely no contact for the past 6 mths. Why is she still doing this?? Can't 2 pple of opposite sex just be frens and nothing more??</div>

She had the cheek to call me and tell me to make sure i don't turn up tomorrow. WTF...i have not seen my frens for so long, and she doesn't want me going, just becoz she thinks i'm a threat. I've already given up the frenship with her bf and have absolutely no contact for the past 6 mths. Why is she still doing this?? Can't 2 pple of opposite sex just be frens and nothing more??</div></blockquote>complicated situation .. are they married? both of them?  if they are then it's really impossible to be friends.. if they're not married then it's OK, this is normal reaction between you and them.. so if she hates you then that's it.. jealous mahhhh... she dont want you to be there and steal her BF lah.. you get me.. well maybe you can still turn up but come a bit later lah.. I mean late lah.. and then just ignore her... pretend nothing happen.. frankly she got no right to tell you like that coz she's not married to him yet..and you got the right to do your way.. think what is best for you.. OK cheer up lah.. anyway there's so many handsome looking guys out there why worry.. smile..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

Not very close, but just can get along, can chat and joke, but not close to the extend of can share problems and physically whacking each other. Knew him for half a year, then he got a girlfren, whom he introduced to all of us. At first everything was still alright, but as time past, he seldom join us for meals, and rarely went along for our road trip. And everytime that he joined us, he would definitely bring his girlfren along. But the girlfren would never allow him to talk to me without her presence. He can talk to the other gals in the group, but not me. If there were only 4 of us at a table, and she needed to go to the loo, she'd make him stand outside the loo to wait for her, even though the loo is just like what..less than 10 steps away from the table!?! I have a bf, who is also part of the group, and she also knows him. What possible threat could i be?? This has been going on for 2 years. The last time i met up with the 2 of them, and the rest of the group was more than 6 mths ago. Tomorrow the whole group is having a gathering and i'm of course invited. She had the cheek to call me and tell me to make sure i don't turn up tomorrow. WTF...i have not seen my frens for so long, and she doesn't want me going, just becoz she thinks i'm a threat. I've already given up the frenship with her bf and have absolutely no contact for the past 6 mths. Why is she still doing this??

Don't let <span class="large"><strong>anyone</strong></span> decide for you what you should or should not do! Not even that girl. It's your <strong>life</strong> and your <strong>rights</strong>! Continue being friends with the guy whom you know. Don't give up the friendship. Every friendship is precious.<br><br>As far as I know, this girl is totally insecurewith herself and her boyfriend. She should not be in a relationship at the first place! The guy is also a dumbass for allowing her to take control of his life. If I were him, I'll give that s.l.u.t. a boot manz! But anyway, continue doing what's right. Don't let anyone control your beliefs.<br><br>All the best!<br><br>S.H.I.N.</div>
