She now on ultra-defensive mode and she always has this exceptionally, uniquely 'attentive' look on her face when i talk to her and this is EXCLUSIVELY towards me ONLY. How 'attentive' is that look? About as 'concerned' as a doctor looking at a patient dying of SARS i guess. stress levels high enough, hope to help her take it easier. as for me? i know the best and fastest way to help myself start to take this easy is after she has taken this easy.</div>

Instead, i feel that it's wearing a mask and smiling at you. Telling you 'You Suck Big Time'<br>There's always a time to have fun, but if heart to heart communication comes....there shouldn't be any mask....<br>It should be clean and proper, no hidden agenda, hinting or whatsoever.
