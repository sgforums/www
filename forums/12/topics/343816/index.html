              <p>Babe, you are still adjusting to the timetable.</p>
              <p>And graduate at 27 is still very young.</p>
              <p>And yes, planning plays a big part to you being able to juggle either.  Future employers, when they see your resume that you sticked things thru and worked at the same time, will be more inlcine to employ you because it shows you can multitask.</p>
              <p>Book yourself for a short holiday, even 3 days at Malaccaa might help you putyour stress behind in Singapore, a cruise is also good, you can sleep, eat and close yourself in the cabin to read.</p>
              <p>Go find a decent and cheap sport massage, steam and maybe yoga lessons.  Preferably in the morning,  Since you start work at 6am, then you can afford to go those yoga lessons that starts at 7am in the weekends.</p>
              <p>And instead of your parents supporting you totally, have them agree to buy you buns, to eat for breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Or cook more dinner such that you can have soemthing to eat (preferably clear soup) when you get home or can tabao to work in containers.</p>
              <p>I am sure your parents will not mind the routine, and once you adjusted, things will be easier.</p>

              <p>Anybody has tried this b4? Im pretty sure alot of ppl has. I have a full-time job which ends at 5.30pm and classes from 7pm till 10pm. 1month into this already am Im already totally burnt out. sometimes i arrived in class as late at 8.30pm, sometimes just in time, sometimes skipping dinner. and my workplace and home are separated across the entire island. I dun even have time to study now..sometimes in class, i feel like so low as most of my classmates do not have to work the next day while i have to wake up at early as 6am to travel to work. The classes are as many as 4 times a week. And projects meeting im unable to attend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But then I read how some ppl can cope with it with no problem and i feel really lousy that this is already my limit. I thought since other ppl can do this, i can too. i was wrong! I feel so damn useless. although my parents wanted me to quit this job &amp; they will support me cos they can also see how stressed out i am, i feel bad, 24yrs old already but still studying. I would graduate at 27yrs old. all this are holding me back. I hate how in the past i failed to plan properly....</p>

              <p>Me too...I also having problem coping with working full time and studying part time. At least you get to attend your class late. Sometimes when there was work to be done, and can be done by other colleagues, my supervisors didn't give a shit and make me stay back to do it. 'Company supporting staff for upgrade' is simply lip-service.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I flunk my exams during my last academic year. So the stress just builds up because it means that I have wasted another year's fee. I am fortunate enough to keep my job due to this global economic crisis, but the bonus I get is too little for me to continue school the next academic year. Very vex as well.</p>

              <p>Everyone is different. Some people can handle stress better than others. If you can't, then take it slow. Teach tuition or do something more lax la. Why don't you learn to be contented and enjoy your student's life while you are given a chance to? No need to be so hard on yourself one.</p>
