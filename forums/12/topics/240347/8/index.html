            <div class='col-md body'>I apologise for being so late in posting in this thread, causing everyone so much anxiety and arguments.<br><br>if you would remember months ago, i started a thread that garnered over 500 posts.  Yes, alexrain is my bf.  we had lots of problems then.<br><br><a href="http://buses.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=224868&amp;page=0" rel="nofollow">http://buses.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=224868&amp;page=0</a><br><br>Back then, i seek the opinions of many forumites and of course, many kind-hearted souls contributed their opinions.  Among them, was the moderator, you-know-who-by-now.  he kind-heartedly suggeted to meet up, so that he can understand my situation better and offer me better and more appropriate advice.  Yes, we met up.  During the meet ups, he advised me about my situation.  In addition to helping me better understand the situation, he told me that my bf and myself are very uncompatible.  he also said that him and i are more compatible.<br><br>My bf's anger stemmed from, him being a moderator, at the time of my confusion in my relationship, advising me on such things are very inappropriate and is very likely to mislead and confuse the confused.  It is very unethical.<br><br>Hope you understand where my bf is coming from.</div>
