I understand you're angry, but please don't let your anger get the better of you. Never did I say he definitely did not harass your gf, neither did I say he definitely did.<br><br>And as I already mentioned, just because we don't side with VK doesn't mean we side with Devil. And whether or not Devil did harass your gf has nothing to do with being a moderator or not.<br><br>I say, ignore the messages and get on with your lives and your dinner.

I certainly don't respect FireIce's viewpoints on adult issues.

It's like saying the mod in Speaker's Corner having the right to determine what government policies are right or wrong or shouldn't be implemented.<br><br></div>
