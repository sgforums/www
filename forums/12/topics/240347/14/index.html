I've personally met up with bee_gal a couple of times and there's nothing of intimacy between us. We're just like friends.<br><br>She's a person who knows what she wants, and I doubt it's really my advice or anybody else's which have made her came to her decision.<br><br>She wanted to show her (ex?)bf that thread initially, though I discouraged her from doing so. Ultimately, I don't know if she could have shown him or he having to find that thread himself... But I can understand how angry he would be if I'm really the one behind helping his (ex?)gf get a clearer picture of things...<br><br>I would also like to believe that he had see this thread as an opportunity to do a 'tag-team' with kitty on me (I know that cat won't rest so easily.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ). For this, I might have overlooked... That it's really not a kitty's clone but a worse scenerio... 2 heads...<br><br>Noted that ALOT of the 'facts' mentioned by kitty and Alex could be read from the threads within Sgforum.. And if they could have asked anyone who had seen me in person before.. It won't be difficult to describe me physically too?<br><br>About the accusations about myself and 'evidences' provided so far... I would see them more like pieces of information about myself gathered for now, mixed with accusations within... If one could note.. There really isn't any strong evidence for the 'accusations' part of the facts brought forward.. Only 'delusions' produced when 'accusations' are well-mixed within FACTS (which are widely acknowledged or projected about me)....<br><br><span style="color: darkred;"><span class="large">In ANY case (should I announce), if it's really bee_gal speaking up on the PC herself so to speak... Which I am to find out to be true.... </span></span>I just want you to know that I can understand you might have your own difficulties... And that I would trust you on your take, and you need not worry about me but take care of yourself...<br><br>And IF... And ONLY IF that scenerio is to be presented TRUE... I would NOT excuse myself from flamings. You can JUDGE and RANT all you want about me... Like I've said, I won't care less.<br><br>My ONLY REGRET would be to have people like viciouskitty have their ways...?<br><br>NONETHELESS.. As I'm CLEAR. I'm NOT AFRAID.<br><br>If people deem my advices unfit for them due to whatsoever reason they choose to believe over viciouskitty to me... It's THEIR OWN LOSS.<br><br>I work as a CO-MOD under the ADMIN JASON. If he deems me unfit as a moderator for AA, he would let me know. Otherwise, like what the other forumites had said.. You have NO say over things KITTY...<br><br>IF people feel that I'm an UNSAFE person to talk to in person so as to ADVISE them... Then don't do. Kitty. Should ANY one of them lost their life due to what you've done for YOUR OWN SELFISH MEANS... You're a FARKING <strong>MURDERER</strong>.<br><br>I JUST WANT YOU TO <strong>REMEMBER</strong> DEEP AND HARD ON THAT <strong>FACT</strong>.<br><br>Anyway, you're not depriving me of MY LIFE. You're just DEPRIVING them of THEIRS.<br><br>Personally, I don't believe in KARMAS but I believe the WORLD is ROUND.<br><br>Let's see what you can do with that little luck you're left over with?</blockquote></div>

I've read through the linked thread and it's, um, interesting.<br><br>Speaking not only as a practicing psychologist but as someone who's worked with abused children for years, I'll come at this from a practicioner's perspective.<br><br>I agree with kitty that textbook answers don't really offer much help.  However, generalising from personal experiences is precipitous as well, and if the person you're trying to help thinks you're being ignorant, you'll be shoved well behind square one.<br><br>The fact is that the motivation for self-harm varies on a case-by-case basis.  Yes, some people are just drama queens, and in such cases an REBT approach, such as kitty's SIA girl example, might work.  On the other hand, REBT, when used in the wrong situation, can lead to things going pear-shaped very rapidly.  For that matter, any approach used in the wrong context will produce detrimental results.<br><br>This leads to the point that, as a rule, any competent practicioner would know to perform some proper fact-finding before attempting to generate solutions.  Self-harm (or any observed behaviour) is only the symptom, not the problem itself.  Fix one symptom and another will pop up to take its place.<br><br>The underlying problem also dictates how effective the solution is.  The DSM-IV (the diagnostic bible) lists self-harm as a diagnostic criteria for Borderline Personality Disorder.  A BPD person would be highly unlikely to have any interest in being a flying waitress for SIA, or any other airline for that matter.<br><br>The bottom line is that what's good for the goose is not always good for the gander, and jumping off the mark to close one door isn't going to do any good if the rest of the building's on fire.  You always need to make a point to find out what's going on before offering solutions - doing so too early is just a waste of time.<br><br>Anyway, for what it's worth (about a hundred bucks by the reckoning of the APS), that's a professional's take on this debate.</div></blockquote></span></div>
