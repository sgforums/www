I can only tell you how disadvantageous the situation is to you now... So why not just leave things for now... Some time later... If you still feel this strong 'anger' and 'hatre' towards me... Come back for me again....? Singaporeans are very forgetful... They'll probably forget what you've done by then.. If you are still persistent then.. Maybe you'll stand a better chance? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>If you REALLY wanna MAKE PEACE.

Yes, alexrain is my bf.  we had lots of problems then.<br><br><a href="http://buses.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=224868&amp;page=0" rel="nofollow">http://buses.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=224868&amp;page=0</a><br><br>Back then, i seek the opinions of many forumites and of course, many kind-hearted souls contributed their opinions.  Among them, was the moderator, you-know-who-by-now.  he kind-heartedly suggeted to meet up, so that he can understand my situation better and offer me better and more appropriate advice.  Yes, we met up.  During the meet ups, he advised me about my situation.  In addition to helping me better understand the situation, he told me that my bf and myself are very uncompatible.  he also said that him and i are more compatible.<br><br>My bf's anger stemmed from, him being a moderator, at the time of my confusion in my relationship, advising me on such things are very inappropriate and is very likely to mislead and confuse the confused.  It is very unethical.<br><br>Hope you understand where my bf is coming from.</div></blockquote>My take on this though I'm really not too sure.<br><br>bee_gal had told me that her (ex?)bf visits AA. My 1st impression here would be a guess that likely somehow her bf has access to her account. If this is REALLY bee_gal herself, then things might REALLY be MUCH MORE COMPLICATED than all these appearing.. In fact, I would bet it is something rather 'deep'? Though I think I still more or less already has an idea of what could possibly be going on... Though I personally hope my 1st guess is correct and my 2nd guess is wrong. Give me more time to find out pls...?</div>
