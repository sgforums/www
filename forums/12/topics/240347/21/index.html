Why? Because your questions were already answered regarding whether moderators are certified and people explained many times to you what a moderator is within sgforums.<br><br>You however kept going on and on insisting moderators should be this, moderators should be that, blah blah blah. Which was basically nonsense and trash. So yeah, thankfully it was closed.</div>
