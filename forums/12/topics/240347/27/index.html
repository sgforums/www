It's just that there is nothing to abuse about being the mod. If anything, Alex's gf really had a wrong idea about what a mod is, and perhaps that ignorance and misconception was exploited. It is not right as a person for the Mod to have done so to betray the trust. But I hope you better understand what being a mod is all about in the first place.</div>

It's just that most of us don't really need the disclaimer (no offence to your gf really). But your suggestion is good.<br><br>Also, if the person involved is young, impressionable and immature, she can be exploited by anyone mod or not mod.

And I've already commented on the alleged misdeeds earlier on. But you seem hung up on my disagreeing with what a mod is or isn't. You insist I am supporting him even when others have said that not supporting Kitty doesn't mean we support Devil. Hope you can get your facts right.<br><br>Maybe you see it as a same, all who don't agree with you what a mod is are all supporters of Devil. If you really want to be so mistaken then go ahead.
