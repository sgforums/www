            <div class='col-md body'>For all those who are interested.. I've personally met up with bee_gal a couple of times and there's nothing of intimacy between us. We're just like friends.<br><br>She's a person who knows what she wants, and I doubt it's really my advice or anybody else's which have made her came to her decision.<br><br>She wanted to show her (ex?)bf that thread initially, though I discouraged her from doing so. Ultimately, I don't know if she could have shown him or he having to find that thread himself... But I can understand how angry he would be if I'm really the one behind helping his (ex?)gf get a clearer picture of things...<br><br>I would also like to believe that he had see this thread as an opportunity to do a 'tag-team' with kitty on me (I know that cat won't rest so easily.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ). For this, I might have overlooked... That it's really not a kitty's clone but a worse scenerio... 2 heads...<br><br>Noted that ALOT of the 'facts' mentioned by kitty and Alex could be read from the threads within Sgforum.. And if they could have asked anyone who had seen me in person before.. It won't be difficult to describe me physically too?<br><br>About the accusations about myself and 'evidences' provided so far... I would see them more like pieces of information about myself gathered for now, mixed with accusations within... If one could note.. There really isn't any strong evidence for the 'accusations' part of the facts brought forward.. Only 'delusions' produced when 'accusations' are well-mixed within FACTS (which are widely acknowledged or projected about me)....<br><br>In ANY case (should I announce), if it's really bee_gal speaking up on the PC herself so to speak... Which I am to find out to be true.... I just want you to know that I can understand you might have your own difficulties... And that I would trust you on your take, and you need not worry about me but take care of yourself...<br><br>And IF... And ONLY IF that scenerio is to be presented TRUE... I would NOT excuse myself from flamings. You can JUDGE and RANT all you want about me... Like I've said, I won't care less.<br><br>My ONLY REGRET would be to have people like viciouskitty have their ways...?<br><br>NONETHELESS.. As I'm CLEAR. I'm NOT AFRAID.<br><br>If people deem my advices unfit for them due to whatsoever reason they choose to believe over viciouskitty to me... It's THEIR OWN LOSS.<br><br>I work as a CO-MOD under the ADMIN JASON. If he deems me unfit as a moderator for AA, he would let me know. Otherwise, like what the other forumites had said.. You have NO say over things KITTY...<br><br>IF people feel that I'm an UNSAFE person to talk to in person so as to ADVISE them... Then don't do. Kitty. Should ANY one of them lost their life due to what you've done for YOUR OWN SELFISH MEANS... You're a FARKING <strong>MURDERER</strong>.<br><br>I JUST WANT YOU TO <strong>REMEMBER</strong> DEEP AND HARD ON THAT <strong>FACT</strong>.<br><br>Anyway, you're not depriving me of MY LIFE. You're just DEPRIVING them of THEIRS.<br><br>Personally, I don't believe in KARMAS but I believe the WORLD is ROUND.<br><br>Let's see what you can do with that little luck you're left over with?</div>
