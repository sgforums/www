              <p>when i was a kid, i always ponder why we need to take O lvls
              etc, since many of the subjects taught were non-relevant to working
              life (e.g: if you aspire to be accountant, then learning literature
              and technical design = waste of time)</p>

              <p>it's a state of mind.  when it happens, it's like fog clouding your whole mind.  sometimes it clears a bit and you feel slightly hopeful.  it may take time for the fog to clear while u  figure things out.  it takes time to find your way to a clearing.. it may also clear suddenly with a light-bulb moment, usually comes with a paradigm shift.</p>
              <p>i had a light-bulb moment this morning when i woke up.  the words i posted above came to me.</p>

              <p>it depends where u derive yr happiness and enjoyment from. differs for every individual. from company of family / frens? from ambition / achievements? from helping others out? (altruism)</p>

              <p>focus on yr 'O's now as it affects yr future alot. even if u feel life is meaningless (happens to everyone sometimes) u still have to take a step forward.</p>

              <p>As you have said, she is your crush, not your other half.</p>
              <p>There is nothing much you can do unless you go after her.</p>
              <p>It will be wiser to focus on your studies now though, so try not to think too much of her.</p>
