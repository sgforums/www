Not all battles can be fought and won.<br><br>Family problems are especially painful and tricky because you can't be entirely unemotional in your approach; you're often bound by duty and love.<br><br>Just try your best to help your mom, don't expect too much in terms of "rewards", and try not to let your sister affect you too much.</div></blockquote>Thank u for ur reply.<br><br>Sis and I grew up seperately when young. I had a nanny and she had grandma. Only got to know each other better when we were older. We went same school, 2 grades apart but hardly talk in school. She's the goodie girl whereas i'm more like a trouble maker. thus, we have different circle of friends, hardly talk in school or let ppl know that she's my sis.<br><br>Always hoped to be closer to my siblings, after all, when our parents is gone, she and my brother will be the closest kin to me.<br><br>Honestly, i just want a warm and nice family. On the surface, we seem so well- to- do, eating high end restaurants, wat u want dad will buy... but beneath all the "packaging" is all broken pieces...</div>

But he rarely comes home. Citing the reason that he works late and gotta attend to stuff early in the morning, so he will "sleep" in his office. Not sure if i should be happy that my mum actually believed him all these years.<br><br>And when my dad does come home, he expects the house to be clean and tidy, neat and nice. I try my best to keep things in order so my dad will come home and my mum will be happy. One of the reasons why dad is going home is mainly because he have to (at least for show), and because of me and my brother.<br><br>Mum has been very very involved in the activities her temple has and is juggling her own retail shop at the same time. Thus, neglecting the housework at home. So when i got the maid to come in to do the chores, it to let my mum have a better peace of mind to continue do what she enjoys, so my dad will come back to a clean and neat home, so i dun have to mop the floor in the middle of the night after my work (i work shifts).<br><br>The best part is that: Dad has another woman outside. Been with him for least 10yrs.<br><br>I know well enough, that this issue will go on and on.... vicious cycle... I just need someone to hear me out, someone whom will know what i'm talking about and share my thoughts...</div></blockquote>Understood. Sometimes things like that happens...
