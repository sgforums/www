            <div class='col-md body'>if you have a elder sister that gives nothing but attitude, thinking that she's way high up coz she holds a Poly Dipolma, been staying at China (her husband couldn't find a job here), working there as a nursery teacher, husband as a Urban Planner, now back for holiday and takes everything for granted, doesn't bother to call the siblings up for gathering, giving all her time to her In- Laws and friends, then finally return home only to make a mess outta it and goes off,<br><br>then a mother that you are totally helpless about... you get a part- time maid to come in to help her with the chores since she's complaining about no one helping (everyone is working, tired, lazy to help), then she start yelling at everyone saying the maid is useless, not doing a good job, then start inspecting the house and says all kinds of crappy stuff eg; wasting of money, this never do, that never do, not clean enough, for 2 hours dunno do wat etc... (the list gets longer and longer)<br><br>a dad who hardly comes home, when he comes home, start bossing ppl around to even pass him the remote control for the TV...<br><br>Ever since my sis left to China with her husband, i know my mum would be rather empty since my sis was the "mother's girl", thus, every now and then i'm free, i would pick her up from her office, bring her to dinner, arrange dinner with my brother and dad, hope to have more family time... BUT!!! my mum can just cancel the dinner because i wasn't on the way to pick her up for dinner, i told her to just come home first and we can go dinner together, she came home, and said she not well, not going for dinner.<br><br>Then on the day my sis came back from China, my mum insist that everyone must go for dinner despite the fact tat i already told her way before hand that it's not a good time as i was working and the part- time maid will be coming home for cleaning. BUT she still insisted on the "reunion" dinner and I again told her, i can go but will be late... so i finally rushed down to the dinner (already 9pm by then), my brother- in- law was clearly unhappy, the whole atmosphere was clearly sour, ate the dinner then home. WHICH then my mum went to tell my brother that i was Deliberately LATE for the dinner coz i was not happy!!!<br><br>Can someone pls pls pls.... tell me what to do if you are in my shoes... I feel so miserable and really dun want to go back to this place called "home"....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well I think in every family there must be some 'pian xin' over another. I know you were upset cos no one seem to appreciate what you have done. But think bout it, there are your family members, someone is blood related to you. Why not you try to talk to them on how you feel or write in a CNY card cos new year coming. Keep everything inside wont solve your problem. This saturday is 'reunion dinner', hope you and your family enjoy it. Cheer up girl.</div>

Just do it. It may not appear now in the near future, but I believe it will come in some kind of other form. Like say maybe romance? I believe that when the sadness and tribulations have passed,  happiness will come through. When you are gone someday, they will probably miss you somewhat. Cheers. Good luck!</div>

"No need to act one, no one wants to watch you act your show." I felt totally wronged. Help her still kena scolded.<br><br>I didnt talk to her for weeks after that.

            <div class='col-md body'><br>People who have the habit to boss/scold you around (or take you for granted), be cold, evade/ignore and don't talk to such people this cny. Why fuel their habit? What you want is to make them realise their bossy habit and see a needed change. The best way I found out for myself is to completely ignore, don't talk to them. When they want to talk to me and if I still detect the same attitude, I'd come up with an excuse and get out of sight. If it means working late, hiding in my own room, taking a short holiday trip away to be happier, I'd go ahead. I've learned not to let such people boss around and spoil my holiday mood and the best way is to bochap them and go do the things that make me happier. Let them go find someone else to boss around and fume themselves.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

They might feel that they've very much dropped in their value, could be easily 'replaced' or might even be redundant. I know somehow these might be very much silly thoughts to us, but most old folks just don't maintain the mental capacity to think vastly like they used to.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear All,<br><br>Thank u all for the very prompt replies...<br><br>Just add on a bit.<br><br>My dad is a business man, quite reputable, considered well- to- do... But he rarely comes home. Citing the reason that he works late and gotta attend to stuff early in the morning, so he will "sleep" in his office. Not sure if i should be happy that my mum actually believed him all these years.<br><br>And when my dad does come home, he expects the house to be clean and tidy, neat and nice. I try my best to keep things in order so my dad will come home and my mum will be happy. One of the reasons why dad is going home is mainly because he have to (at least for show), and because of me and my brother.<br><br>Mum has been very very involved in the activities her temple has and is juggling her own retail shop at the same time. Thus, neglecting the housework at home. So when i got the maid to come in to do the chores, it to let my mum have a better peace of mind to continue do what she enjoys, so my dad will come back to a clean and neat home, so i dun have to mop the floor in the middle of the night after my work (i work shifts).<br><br>The best part is that: Dad has another woman outside. Been with him for least 10yrs.<br><br>I know well enough, that this issue will go on and on.... vicious cycle... I just need someone to hear me out, someone whom will know what i'm talking about and share my thoughts...</div>
