              <p>Rddgrt, since u r from India, I reckon u must be familiar with
              the caste system. I'm quite sure u have a bunch of low level caste
              workers , u yourself or ur family members hav looked down upon and
              abused before.</p>
              <p>Now put yourself in their shoes and u will understand why u r
              being treated such by your superior. </p>
              <p>it is quite amusing to see some higher caste Indians from India
              demanding they be treated equally by foreigners when they work for
              a foreign company. When Indians themselves r discriminatory back
              home. Why the double standard ?</p>
              <p>Treat your own with respect and dignity first before u can
              expect from others. </p>

              <p>Why do you want to still work in singapore when there are
              clearly more better jobs in India's booming IT industry
              particularly in Bangalore?</p>
              <p>Although I have some good indian friends in malaysia and
              singapore, I've worked with them and they gave me a good
              impression, I, on the other hand had bad experiences with indian
              migrants in australia.</p>
              <p>Here is one story. My family and I was about to board a flight
              from australia to home so we called a special hatchback taxi that
              can fit all our big luggages. The driver was an indian migrant. He
              parked his car in front of our apartment, opened the boot, just
              stood there like a stupid statue, while my family and I, struggled
              with our big luggages - he didn't even bother to help. In contrast
              when i got back to malaysia, we got an airport taxi, the malay taxi
              driver, even though he was only a small guy only 5 feet tall, but
              he took the initiative to carry our big luggages into his taxi
              car.</p>
              <p>Then there is another story in australia. I was new to melbourne
              and decided to take a tram to a destination. So I took this tram,
              but not sure if thsi tram is going to this certain street, so i
              asked the indian tram driver (when I boarded the tram) whether this
              tram goes to this street. His answer was "No". Idiot ! When I got
              off, I looked at the tram signboard again and it turns out it does
              go there. Its no wonder the Aussies hated the indian "I don't care"
              culture.</p>
              <p>My third experience, I joined this USA MNC many years ago
              because there was a job opening. It turns out that there were
              trying to outsource this job function to Bangalore, but the
              Bangalore guys screwed up big time and the company complained that
              they were rude like hell. So they decided to hire me to takeover.
              When I tookover, I had to ask the Bangalore people on the job
              handover. The bloody idiot in Bangalore was so rude, when he passed
              down all the job, it was crap messy.</p>
              <p>I don't know about you - but I am sick and bored of the way
              those professionals coming india work - they only think about
              themselves and want to maximise every cent for the little work they
              do - so calculative.</p>

              <p>Because it's discouraging. It really affects one's mentality and performance. I can't perform well when someone pulls a cloak and dagger on me like that. Anyone can call it "tough love" to make less of that situation but it's not. Now I don't like taking the easy way out too but since I can't handle the heat in <em>that</em> kitchen, I get out. Rather cripple myself now than be labeled a complete fool who's out of depth.</p>

              <p><br>Of course, its discouraging. But can we do anything about that? No. Because there will always be bullies that give us a hard time.</p>
              <p>One way to avoid that is going thru interviews. At the interview, you can ask them back to find out what kind of bosses you will be working with. And find out about their HR Policy whether it protects staff to express themselves. Also before joining that company, try asking any of your friends working there how its like.</p>
              <p>Once you start working there, its hard to turn back. Maybe you think the easy way out is to switch jobs. But chances are, you may end up jumping from a hot pot to a frying pan. You haven't build up your career where you are and suddenly you decide to leave in 6 months or one year, you hardly learn anything. New employers will look over your resume and find that you are a job hopper. When they interview and ask you what you learn in your previous job, you can't say much because you only worked there for 1 year.</p>
              <p>I attended interviews and often they ask me why I only worked there for 3 years? I tell you, even when I switch job few times and each job is within 3 years, they see me as a job hopper. If you switch job every 1 year or 2 years, surely they will focus on that.</p>
              <p>So before one accepts a job, do your homework and find out more about them before you accept the job.</p>

              <div>This director called me a couple of weeks back and complained about my timing issue. According to her I was reporting 15-30 minutes late to work. She never took into account the amount of time I spent after the office hours. And I am one of those people who never ever slog (I stay only if I have to). So easily she complained about me to her bosses. This lady from day one has kept a blind eye to ALL the abusive happening around. She herself never stays on her seat. Her schedule is 8:30 – 9:30 AM and 6:00 – 8:00 PM. Between 9:30 – 6:00 she is never in her cabin.</div>

              <div>Now I no longer want to work in Singapore. I just ignore any job interview calls I get from Singapore. Since January 2012, I am trying very hard to get a job back home in India.

I am very sure that it is because of the internal verification done with my present company.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I cannot leave this job on my own, even though I pray daily that the day I resign comes soon. How can I go back without a job? I have seen so many people struggle without a job. That makes things even worse.</div>

Tell me what should I do now?<br><br>Should I leave this job without any other offer (of India) in hand, OR should I wait and work in this company until I get another offer in India?<br><br>And who to reply face to face? There is NOT one bully. It is the whole system (entire project/department team). If you reply to one, then it can be easily taken against you and then you lose all the sympathy that you had. This is what happened with me also.<br><br>To give an example, even my password is NOT secure anymore. Today only I complained to the management for this. But I know I will get no response. The administrator guys are also being used in the bullying process. They just share the password with the high profile bullies and that further is passed on to other bullies under them or with them. The ones to whom I am complaining are the real culprits behind all this. Then on what basis will they take any action?<br><br>I am working in this company since January 2011. Since then I have always ignored these bullies and their entire abusive bullying. Initially there were some sympathetic workers, but those who came forward were bullied to an extent that I do not have words to describe. Eventually they themselves turned into bullies, because there is just no other way to survive here.<br><br>I never said anything which is bad, but sometimes when things are really out of control, then how long can one be silent. So far I have always tried to keep my ethics, my dignity. But there were one/two instances when I also lost my cool, and had to reply to these bullies. Tell me where I am wrong here or what other option I had?<br><br>I am trying my level best to get a job in India. But this bullying by management is completely impacting my job search also. Their negative feedback is hurting me here also.</p></div>
