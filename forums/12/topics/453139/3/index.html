              <p>I think u need to understand you are slave labour. </p>
              <p>Do you really believe that you will be valued in a "first world" country like Singapore? Considering u are from a third world country.</p>
              <p>Do you really believe that no Singaporean is qualified to fill your current job ? Our education level  is above many in this part of the world. So many flock to our shores to be educated in our system.</p>
              <p>Do you really believe that you are a irreplaceable "talent" ?</p>
              <p>If u answer yes to any of above question. U are delusional.</p>
              <p>As a slave labour, you need to abide by the company rules. Listen to your master , do what you are told, do not question your superior. </p>
              <p>since you don't slog, u are not a good slave. You are being punished.</p>
              <p>Know your place in the company and you will be fine.</p>
              <p>As long as your country remain corrupted and fractured by the self serving, rich and powerful, You and your people will always be looked down upon by the others.</p>
              <p>Given your country's current situation, you are nothing but a refugee. So just be glad you still have a job in Singapore.</p>

                                  <div><span>Eventually my annual appraisal (first in this
                  company) is also screwed. As expected because of this isolation,
                  the management has happily screwed my yearly appraisal. On top of
                  it, I have been also threatened to look for another job. Today my
                  director (the classy lady) gave me my bonus letter with ZERO
                  bonuses. I am not at all surprised or disheartened.</span></div>
                  <div><br></div>
                  <div>This director called me a couple of weeks back and complained
                  about my timing issue. According to her I was reporting 15-30
                  minutes late to work. She never took into account the amount of
                  time I spent after the office hours. And I am one of those people
                  who never ever slog (I stay only if I have to). So easily she
                  complained about me to her bosses. This lady from day one has kept
                  a blind eye to ALL the abusive happening around. She herself never
                  stays on her seat. Her schedule is 8:30 â€“ 9:30
                  AM and 6:00 â€“ 8:00 PM. Between 9:30 â€“ 6:00 she
                  is never in her cabin.</div>
                  <div><br></div>
                  <div>But it hurts when I see those bullies getting good appraisal
                  just because they bullied people and made them under-perform. They
                  have shown that they are able to work. And the simple reason for
                  that is their cheap politics and abusive targeted bullying.</div>
                  <div><br></div>
                  <div>Now I no longer want to work in Singapore. I just ignore any
                  job interview calls I get from Singapore. Since January 2012, I am
                  trying very hard to get a job back home in India. But I have so far
                  not succeeded. And the reason for that is whenever I am about to
                  finalize an offer, something goes wrong. I am very sure that it is
                  because of the internal verification done with my present
                  company.</div>
                  <div><br></div>
                  <div>I cannot leave this job on my own, even though I pray daily
                  that the day I resign comes soon. How can I go back without a job?
                  I have seen so many people struggle without a job. That makes
                  things even worse.</div>
                  <div><br></div>
                  <div>If anyone of you have any friends back home in IT industry in
                  India (NCR region), please help me get a job there. I will be
                  obliged.</div>

              <p>1. I use gossip to my advantage to create opportunities for wrong conclusions to be created. Those who don't gossip won't suffer any harm and won't draw wrong conclusions. This ensures all the good guys will be safe and only the players and gossipers will suffer my evil plan.</p>
              <p>2. Evil people like to look at appearances, use that to your advantage (see Ferrari dealership scene in "Gone in 60 seconds")</p>
              <p>3. Never infiltrate with the intention to initiate change from within the ranks (Independence Day infiltrate with virus idea). It NEVER works in real life and will create dire consequences for yourself. NEVER EVER do that. NEVER!!</p>
              <p>Infiltration is ONLY for information gathering only, never for contamination and conversion.</p>
              <p>4. Bosses, even the CEO never hold 100% power contrary to common perception. This might take some faith for those who never work in Management or have access to Management. Bosses don't like each other, and can be afraid of their employees too (especially bad bosses) - be aware of this and the reasons why.</p>
              <p>5. The "bad guy" boss is many times the good guy. The nice guy boss is usually the bad guy. Applies to bosses only, not to rank and file. Although there are exceptions, the 80/20 rule applies here. If you want to strategize something using mathematical probabilities, and with incomplete intel, this principle will come in handy.</p>
              <p>6. Know this: Lunch is never just lunch. It is politics in progress. It may not be a deliberate attempt, even good people are not consciously politicking when doing this, but this is how "wolf-packs" are formed organically. Don't be careless on this, because evil people will exploit this.</p>
              <p>7. Most people will never do this, but I personally always try to pick a side when someone is quarrelling. I do this without getting involved by being like a commentator in a boxing match. I'm a spectator, but I also create impressions through commentary, also exposing some of my belief system and values for people to see, so they know my position - I pick a side subtly. It makes the political game easier for me, in my experience. It keeps evil people on their toes. It disrupts their assumptions and upsets the balance somewhat. Evil reigns when good people keep quiet.</p>
              <p>8. Bullies are bullies because they got bullied. Find out who is their bully is (if that bully is outside work - like a spouse) find their fears.</p>
              <p>9. Use the principle of the counter-punch. Traditional principle is: when you attack, you cannot defend, when you 
                              defend, you cannot attack. The weakest moment is always the moment of 
                              attack.</p>
              <p>Base your offense off on the evil person's offense. Not only is it effective, this ensures you stand on a high morality ground. Do the unexpected - Bully the bully. This is 2 fold, it discourages the bully from initiated further attacks, and you borrow the energy of the attacker to turn it against them.</p>
              <p>10. Never suffer in silence, and pray to God for strength, daily guidance and wisdom if you are spiritual.</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 45pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">How to identify a workplace bully </span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: gray; font-size: 26pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">It's not just a tough boss, but one who gets a kick out of demeaning other people</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>MANY of us would have encountered a colleague with a heightened sense of power who gets a real kick out of demeaning others - the workplace bully, in other words.</p>
              <p>  There may just be such a jerk or two lurking in your workplace, waiting to sap the chosen few of their energy and motivation, while making their lives miserable.</p>
              <p>  Clearly, such people have serious self-esteem problems.</p>
              <p>  The bully "needs to dominate and cause hurt in order to feel in control", said Dr Elizabeth Nair, lead psychologist and chief executive of Singapore-based Work and Health Psychologists.</p>
              <p>  "Actually unsure of his own self-worth, he tries to establish this with such behaviour that seeks to put down another person," she added.</p>
              <p>  These bullies may have been "victims" previously, and are now trying to assume the "powerful" role.</p>
              <p>  It is worth noting what Professor Robert Sutton, an organisational psychologist at Stanford University, once said: "The best test of a person's character is how he or she treats those with less power."</p>
              <p>  Lest you think the jerks are always someone else, Prof Sutton said it could be any one of us.</p>
              <p>  Research shows that people change overnight when they are put in positions of power. The result: a newly minted jerk.</p>
              <p>  "They start talking more, taking what they want for themselves, ignoring what other people say or want, ignoring how less powerful people react to their behaviour, acting more rudely, and generallytreating any situation or person as a means for satisfying their own needs," Prof Sutton has said previously.</p>
              <p>  So it pays to be mindful of your actions. But how do you know you are actually being bullied at work?</p>
              <p>  Your boss may have just yelled at you, and you feel victimised. But that does not necessarily constitute bullying.</p>
              <p>  "The first step is to differentiate a 'tough management style' from 'bullying'," said Ms Deepali Chaturvedi, head of South-east Asia operations at Reed Specialist Recruitment.</p>
              <p>  "In Asia, a tough and demanding management style is commonly seen and accepted as a standard way to manage subordinates and improve their performance."</p>
              <p>  But, she added: "Bullying by nature is malicious, with no positive outcome for either the perpetrator or the recipient, and as such should never be tolerated."</p>
              <p>  Professor Dennis Driscoll, who was invited by Fuji Xerox to give a talk here in July on corporate social responsibility, noted: "Workplace bullying refers to persistent, hostile behaviour against a worker, usually by someone in a more superior position."</p>
              <p>  These bullies do not just target everyone; they choose who to attack.</p>
              <p>  The easy prey are the ones who are not in a position to retaliate. They are more likely isolated - physically, socially or emotionally, said Dr Nair.</p>
              <p>  Threats or insults may be dispensed freely, and there may be unwelcome teasing or social isolation when you find yourself excluded from a gathering.</p>
              <p>  You may be being bullied if, for instance, your boss is always finding fault with you despite you having delivered well, or he schedules last-minute meetings on the days when he knows you have to pick up the children.</p>
              <p>  "Bullying can also take the form of humiliation through such things as the imposition of impossible work deadlines or the allocation of meaningless tasks," said Prof Driscoll.</p>
              <p>  If you are being targeted by a workplace bully, you will know it, because the wound it causes is not just skin-deep. You will feel down, may lose your appetite, and your health may even be affected.</p>
              <p>  "Job-related effects can range from lower job satisfaction and work productivity, to increased counterproductive work behaviour and intentions to quit the job," said Dr Sandy Lim, assistant professor of management and organisation at the National University of Singapore Business School.</p>
              <p>  Bullying is also likely to have a negative impact on the victims' mental and physical health.</p>
              <p>  They may take more sick leave, for example, and these negative effects can also spill over to the employees' personal or family life, she said.</p>
              <p>Workplace bullying is obviously unacceptable, and needs to be stopped.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>MANY victims of bullying suffer in silence or alone, afraid that if they speak up, they may lose their much-needed jobs.</p>
              <p>  Being bullied is no joke as it can take a toll on your health. Something needs to be done.</p>
              <p>  Singapore does not have any legislation specifically covering workplace bullying.</p>
              <p>  But if you encounter unfair treatment or feel threatened, says the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (Tafep), you can approach your supervisor, human resource department or union for advice and assistance.</p>
              <p>  (Not all experts recommend these options, however.)</p>
              <p>  "If the threat involves physical harm, the employee should consider making a police report," says a Tafep spokesman.</p>
              <p>  And if the bully is the supervisor, the employee may want to bring up the matter with someone more senior or approach the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) for advice and assistance, he says.</p>
              <p>  Reed Specialist Recruitment head of South-east Asia operations Deepali Chaturvedi thinks you should meet your boss behind closed doors and highlight how specific incidents have made you feel threatened.</p>
              <p>  If this fails, your next step could be to approach a neutral party such as a senior HR member and seek his advice, she says.</p>
              <p>  Of course, companies also have a part to play. Mr John Harris, the Asia Pacific HR head at Alexander Mann Solutions, says they should have clear guidelines on what constitutes bullying - frequently overlooked in the workplace.</p>
              <p>  "Have an escalation or feedback process available for people who feel they've been bullied.</p>
              <p>  "Be open to feedback about bullying (that is, HR needs to ensure it knows how to manage the research and background process)."</p>
              <p>  MOM also advises employers to "provide grievances procedures to enable their employees to raise concerns or report workplace problems, including unfair or unreasonable treatment, so that such problems could be effectively addressed", says a spokesman.</p>
              <p>  Mr Harris says confronting the bully is not helpful. To him, mediation, which should be part of the interaction process with HR, is the best way to deal with workplace bullying. And it is not a solo effort. His advice is to get independent witnesses or observers who can provide feedback about the situation and how it occurs.</p>
              <p>  "If it is genuinely bullying, then there are processes, corrections or interventions which need to occur to change that person's behaviour," says Mr Harris.</p>
              <p>  Depending on the situation, some may still choose to confront the bully head-on.</p>
              <p>  But for many, this can be difficult. Dr Gary Namie, founder of the US-based Workplace Bullying Institute, has said that a lot of people who are targeted can't fight back as they don't have it in them.</p>
              <p>  Confronting the bully also brings with it a fear of retaliation. The alternative, he has said, is to involve human resources, a higher manager or an outside advocate, such as a consultant or lawyer, and make sure you document the abuse. Also, gather data about the economic impact the bully has had on the employer.</p>
              <p>  A recent blog entry on the advocacy group's website says that before people who are bullied search the Internet for "workplace bullying", they tend to make two common mistakes. "They report the misconduct to HR and they tell their bully's boss. The sequence varies, but relief coming from one or both sources is rare."</p>
              <p>  The reason: The bully-boss relationship gets in the way. "Veteran bullies know how to ingratiate themselves with... people in authority so they will be seen in a positive light."</p>
              <p>  Plus, "you are bringing bad news about someone considered indispensable".</p>
              <p>  The other problem with telling the bully's boss is that he simply does not know what to do. Often, the answer will be: "Work it out between yourselves."</p>
              <p>  "This is wrong-headed. Managers... are ducking responsibility by trying to make victims solve the problem they neither deserved nor invited," says the blog entry.</p>
              <p>  "The bully's bosses are afraid of emotion-charged interactions and worry about the messiness of it all."</p>
              <p>  Doing nothing makes the bully's boss an accomplice.</p>
              <p>  Here are other steps you can take, says Dr Elizabeth Nair, lead psychologist and chief executive of Singapore-based Work and Health Psychologists:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: #365f91; font-size: 14pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">• </span></span>Find friends at work you can relate to informally, so you will not be completely isolated socially and emotionally at the workplace.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: #365f91; font-size: 14pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">• </span></span>Talk to your friends during permitted breaks such as lunchtime. (Use your mobile phone so you will not be accused of using the office phone for personal use.) Have lunch with them if you can so that it is clear you do have friends of your own.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: #365f91; font-size: 14pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">• </span></span>Try to ignore unpleasant behaviour. "Paying attention to bad behaviour is rewarding for the bully and encourages him to repeat it again," says Dr Nair.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>  According to the Workplace Bullying Institute's website, victims should expose the bully but also have an escape route planned as "good employers purge bullies, most promote them".</p>
              <p>  So, you may want to consider leaving the company, especially if it is a small one, for the sake of your health.</p>
              <p>  Says Ms Chaturvedi: "If the organisation culture supports or rewards bullying, then you have to seriously consider if this environment is right for you."</p>
              <p>  If you choose to leave, the institute's advice is to still expose the bully, not so much to get him fired but more for the sake of your mental health.</p>
              <p>  "Targets who skulk away in silence, shrouded in personal shame, suffer the most," it says on its website. "It can take a year or more to rebound to the point of being able to seek work. Those who leave proudly bounce back the fastest."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="line-height: 115%; color: gray; font-size: 14pt;  "><span style="font-family: Calibri;">This is the last instalment of a two-part series on workplace bullying.</span></span></p>
