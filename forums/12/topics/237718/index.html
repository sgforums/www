My experience is, Love is not so difficult like this. If it is so difficult, how can you last a life-time and how can you be happy?<br><br>If your next relationship is as bad as this one, try again. That is what dating is for. Otherwise we might just as well put our names in a hat and marry the one we pick.<br><br>If all your relationships are as bad as this, maybe there is something wrong with you!
