But you need to make the move because she already made up her mind even though she said she will call you later. Its like me asking a smoker to stop smoking NOW! Of course the smoker will say go XXXX youself, how can I quit when I had smoke for so long but that does not mean that they will never quit. Am I right to say that? Such you will feel like crap and depress and stuff but you going to feel it one of these days just get it over with so you can start healing you heart now instead of killing yourself now slowly till that time comes. If U went for NS already your should have know " Serve And fXXX Off " that most army mans moto. Change the " Serve " to "Finish" and what you get? " Finish And fxxx Off " Yea LA! Finish and be done with it.. MOVE ON! Go do stuff that you can't do when you have a GF. NOW you are FREE! FREE is the key word man. If you don't have the education than how come you can try English? Isn't that also part of what we learn in school? Isn't that EDUCATION? Its the new year an its only Feb. Enjoy the rest of the year with FREEDOM! Cheers man!
