              <p>Chris,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My question to you will be.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If it is really the simplest thing.. why couldn't you just agree with her and save yourself an agony ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What's the use if you win the war.. but broke her heart ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is it very important to let her know how "right" you are and how "wrong" she is ? Petty petty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>All you need to do is.. validate her feelings.. save your reasoning for another day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Since you are a NS guy.. and you know she won't have access to you for the next several days.. you should be appreciative that she's still there for you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So instead of whining.. why don't you show her more appreciation ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes. girls do think before they act.. but most of the time.. it's emotions that takes over.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If she doesn't feel anything about you leaving her for the next few days.. then something is wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You have a girl who is emotionally attached to you.. is that not a good thing ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps you are not ready for a relationship that is why you are so disturbed over the simplest of thing. </p>

              <p>Cherish her now , or just split up. Just communicate more and always ask why is she behaving this and that.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>maybe some of you have mistaken me.</p>
              <p>i've yet to be enlisted btw <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>
              <p>the NS thingy is just an example i'm citing out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sometimes i just feel that girls will never ever apologise even if they know they're in the wrong.</p>
              <p>not saying all behave this way but some do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>imo i just feel that it is right to voice out your own stand in an arguement. both the guy and the girl.</p>
              <p>sometimes the girl doesn't even want to hear the guy's stand.</p>
              <p>and understand where each other is coming from. not pointing fingers at who's to blame.</p>
              <p>my meaning of simplest things are things such as,</p>
              <p>getting angry for nothing. and i really mean nothing. because the girl wants to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you will never understand how much pride i've put down in my r/s.</p>
              <p>saying sorry has actually become a habit.</p>
              <p>its like when an arguement spark or when i sense it coming, i'll just apologise, its my fault.</p>
              <p>i've never actually scolded my gf before. i only rant out my fustrations to my closest friend.</p>
              <p>and of course try to seek forgiveness if i'm really in the wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i can understand why my gf flare up at times because i'm so dense.</p>
              <p>don't know how to make her happy.</p>
              <p>don't know how to pacify her.</p>
              <p>don't know how to conclude an arguement.</p>
              <p>can't voice out my thoughts without her misunderstanding.</p>
              <p>and the list just goes on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but i just feel that, sometimes there are some things that are just unnecessary.</p>
              <p>but it just happens.</p>
              <p>i don't know maybe its the way i deal with things?</p>
              <p>maybe its because i grew up in an "all boys" environment thus i deal things and reason out in a "man manner"?</p>
              <p>i finally understood why people always say girls are from venus and guys are from mars.</p>

              <p>i just feel that i feel uber lousy whenever she get upset and she keeps wanting me to play the guessing game.</p>

              <p>Chris,</p>
              <p>Rule of thumb..</p>
              <p>You don't have to give in, or agree with her. BUT you must know how to validate her feelings.</p>
              <p>This is what I posted to another forumer in similar situation as you.</p>
              <p>When she is mad, don't try to reason with her.. BIG MISTAKE ALL
                                      guys make. Learn how to ZIP IT for now. Try not to make it worst by
                                      immediately going into "defensive" mode.</p>
              <p>Wait till she calms down..then you talk to her..</p>
              <p>By then she will realize how stupid/petty the argument was.</p>
              <p>And you too.. will also realize.. if you weren't so stubborn..
                                      there'd be NO argument in the first place.</p>
              <p>By then.. it will be a nicer conversation and a more forgiving
                                      ambience to talk things out .</p>

              <p>I believe you don't give enough credits to your girl. If you really think she is so crazy.. why are you still with her ? Wouldn't it be better you send her off to a mental institute ?<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Jokes aside.. I've got a feeling the reason why both of you argues about the slightest thing .. is because you tend to slight her.</p>
              <p>If you want to gain respect from your girl.. you need to also respect her opinion too.</p>
              <p>What you think is rational may not be rational for her, and vice versa. This is the reason why there's disagreement in the first place.</p>
              <p>When you insist you are being rational.. and she's just being unreasonable.. she's probably thinking the same about you too.</p>
              <p>See how it works both ways ?</p>

              <p>2nd: Do I still continue to sms her and all during the calming
                      down period?</p>
              <p>Re: Tell her " Honey/dear, I know you are upset now, and I really don't want to make things worst. I'll wait for you to call me when you are calm and if you want, we can have a discussion about this issue."</p>
              <p>3rd: How do I conclude the arguement?</p>
              <p>RE:</p>
              <p>Although, not all disagreement requires a conclusion...it is important you resolve the ones which can be detrimental to your relationship.</p>
              <p>And in order to conclude an important disagreement.. both of you needs to be in a calm and listening mood.</p>
              <p>Listen to why she is mad. and learn to hold your tongue.. try to put yourself in her shoes and see it from her perspective.</p>
              <p>Remember.. most of the time.. your girl just needs you to validate her feelings.</p>
              <p>Anyway.. it's easier if you can simply avoid a argument, save you efforts and trouble to pacify her lor.</p>

              <p>Chris, i think its the best if u tell some examples of simple matters that brings any arguement of you both. More detailed explanation will help us to advice you. We all dont know how simple is simple.</p>
              <p> Give some example  and how u and her reacted over the issue. Then we can evaluate whos right or wrong.. WE cant say we guys need to evaluate gals feeling if the gal might be wrong.</p>
              <p> So please leak previous arguements of you and her over a simple matters.</p>
              <p>Then we will know if you always tolerate her or the other way. Or like some ppl said, your gf is just childish that wans everything on her way, never care how the bf will think or feel.</p>

              <p>The first thing you must under is that girls and guys think very differently, so much that sometimes we don't understand each other and misunderstandings happen. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For all instances, we should always try to think in the other party's shoes.  If we can understand how they think and why they react in certain ways, then maybe we can reduce a lot of conflicts. </p>
