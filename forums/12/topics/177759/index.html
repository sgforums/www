            <div class='col-md body'>ok it is of course related to the girl i am chasing la.<br><br>so it is like this,<br><br>one day we were talking then she mentioned that her best friend had an ex who went chasing her best friend , called and talk to her best friend almost everynight. and she thought it was very sweet of him.<br><br>initially, me and her talk on msn almost every night, until 1 day she started finding me irritating.<br><br>so i was wondering, why is it when her best friend had a suitor who calls her daily, she finds it sweet. however when i did talk to her on msn , she instead got irritated. wondering wondering.<br><br>any answers?<br><br>the saying is quite right. when a girl likes a guy, no matter what he does is perfect for her. when the guy who she does not have feelings for do even the most sincere thing for her, she will still think it is stupid and lame.</div>
