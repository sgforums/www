              <p>I had a heated quarrel with my bf last week and since then, he did not reply to my sms, phone calls. He even blocked me on msn. I even found out that he has added 2 new girls on his msn.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dont know whether he wants a silent breakup. I tried asking him over sms and email but he just refused to speak a word. People advised me to look him up at his workplace, home but i dont want to create an ugly scene.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I feel abandoned and cheated. I am in emotional distress. What should I do? I just want a closure if he really wants a breakup</p>

              <p>It is indeed unfortunate, isnt it?</p>
              <p>Well, sometimes we have no control over matters of the heart. Part of the reason I felt so strongly towards him is because he was my first ever - in almost everything. Does that now satisfy your curiousity? It's not like I wanted/asked to take a year to get over him and the relationship (oh trust me if i could i would have wanted it to end in like a second); maybe I just take a longer time than you (or others, i dont know) to heal emotionally.</p>

              <p>Maybe TS has very strong feelings towards bf, don't want to let him go.</p>
              <p>Malaysia and Singapore was a marriage of convenience...some couples marry to enjoy tax breaks, get HDB flat, etc. So no feelings lost.</p>

              <p>Before my wife married me, she had a bf who broke up with her, it was her first relationship too and she could not take the emotional pain and attempted suicide because of it.</p>
              <p>We have now been happily married (of course we have our arguments &amp; adjustments because we are two completely different people trying to live together as one ) for 6 yrs with very adorable kids. But unfortunately the bf ( was a good friend of mine ) had divorced his wife.</p>
              <p>If you find the right one, it will be heaven on earth, but if you find the wrong one... it is better to remain a single</p>
              <p>Hope you find the right one for you</p>
