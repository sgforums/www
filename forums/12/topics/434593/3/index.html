              <p>Saying they don't wanna hurt you anymore is just their way of buffering your fall.</p>
              <p>I suppose your personality has a lot to do with frequent abrupt breakups after the initial lovey dovies.</p>
              <p>A.It's either you are like that sweet juicy apple on the outside, but nasty and rotten to the core after they peeled off the skin.....</p>
              <p>B.Or.. those proclamations of forever love are just ways to get inside your panties. If you are those promiscuous type.. then it's no wonder men tend to use you and dump you.</p>
              <p>Are you A, B or both ?</p>

              <p>Forgive me if I'm blunt, but as a guy I figure I'll just drop my 2 cents. If he's doing that to you, chances are he don't love you anymore. He wants to find a new partner and is probably sick and tired of you. It's pointless to try to contact him, his message is clear. You should move on, It ain't the end of the world yet. And don't be so persistent, It will make him even more irritated and nothing good will ever come out of it. There are plenty of nice guys out there (and I don't mean those "nice guys" who are usually neither nice or guys whom are more like attention seeking and desperate bastards)..</p>
              <p>What you can do for yourself now is to make him regret the decision of walking away from you, and find yourself a better partner, one who loves you more =P Pick up a hobby/ interest (for e.g. swimming, rock climbing or scuba diving, go on a vacation because you really need a holiday) to keep yourself busy so you don't have to think so much about it, sooner or later the feeling of being hurt will just fade away. At the end of the day, It isn't us guys who pick our partners, all we do is offer you a chance to pick us. Hehe, you should try to smile more, days ahead will only get better.</p>
