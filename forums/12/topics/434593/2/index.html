              <p>Before my wife married me, she had a bf who broke up with her, it was her first relationship too and she could not take the emotional pain and attempted suicide because of it.</p>
              <p>We have now been happily married (of course we have our arguments &amp; adjustments because we are two completely different people trying to live together as one ) for 6 yrs with very adorable kids. But unfortunately the bf ( was a good friend of mine ) had divorced his wife.</p>
              <p>If you find the right one, it will be heaven on earth, but if you find the wrong one... it is better to remain a single</p>

              <p>It depends also on what was the heated debate about. If you have done nothing wrong, you do not need to feel bad about this. Let the relationship have a cooling off period, if he really wants to maintain this relationship, he will come back to you.</p>
              <p>If he choose otherwise, it is better for you to let go. In the meantime, go meet other friends, widen your circle of friends, you will find that your life don't to revolve just you and your bf. That would occupy your mind for a while at least.</p>
              <p>Hope this helps.</p>

              <p>It is indeed unfortunate, isnt it?</p>
              <p>Well, sometimes we have no control over matters of the heart.
                      Part of the reason I felt so strongly towards him is because he was
                      my first ever - in almost everything. Does that now satisfy your
                      curiousity? It's not like I wanted/asked to take a year to get over
                      him and the relationship (oh trust me if i could i would have
                      wanted it to end in like a second); maybe I just take a longer time
                      than you (or others, i dont know) to heal emotionally.</p>

              <p>It is well that you know the reason for your heartache. When I was 20 I had a 10-month arms-length relationship that never went past the dating stage and which my ex took very long to get over.</p>
              <p>There is just so much misunderstanding out there over what relationships are about. We can't have marriage coming overnight. Some people however are satisfied with having a lifetime of dissatisfaction.</p>

              <p>It's a normal reaction.</p>
              <p>Be sad about the whole thing.<br>Then be sad because your ex acted in this way.<br>Then be sad because your ex is such an asshole.<br>Then feel sad and sorry for him because he doesn't realize he's crap.</p>
              <p>Never feel sorry for yourself.</p>
              <p>Go get some ice-cream, stuff yourself silly for one day, go to bed telling yourself over and over again that tomorrow will be a brand new day!</p>
              <p>Just don't eat so much that it makes you put on weight cos that will make you feel even crappier.</p>

              <p>I wonder why did you have a heated quarral ?whose fault is it ?</p>
              <p>Is that all his fault ?maybe you should calm down and think carefully.if it is your bf fault,</p>
              <p>wait for several days until your bf come back to apologize.If he doesn't ,then there is no need to stay with him.</p>
