            <div class='col-md body'>I had an ex that was with my for a couple of years back in secondary school, but during that period of time she cheated on me twice. Her reasons were valid... I accepted it, but the second time I just left her. After about another couple of years with minimal contact, we met up again when she returned to Singapore for a week. Although we only spent 2 days and nights together, the feelings flourished again. She apologized for the things she had done, saying that she was immature, reckless, etc. But it's the past, I've let it go.<br><br>And so, we got back together. At the same time, she's trying to struggle free from a relationship that doesn't work out. She claimed that she has broken up with him. She did say we shouldn't shoot off so fast this time. During the days in melbourne, the chats we had were so convincingly about having a future. She said she needed sometime to be alone, to settle things with her ex. Just a few days ago, she messaged me that and told me to ignore whatever messages her ex send me. But during that night, either her ex forced her to type the following, or it was her ex using her msn account. The questions asked were very probing, asking what we've done back in Sg, etc and said we have to cut ties completely so as not to complicate matters. It totally contradicts what she said to me before that. It all dictates to this poem :<br><br>Do not be infuriated at my response,<br>For my heart yearns for thy love,<br>I long to be in thy arms night and day,<br>But time and distance keep us both away;<br>I struggled and broke myself free,<br>From a love that i discovered was not to be,<br>So here i sit and mend my heart,<br>Gather the pieces that he tore apart;<br>Thou art so perfect in my eyes,<br>A being that holds no disguise,<br>That is why i keep away from thee,<br>For what i want is true love to be;<br>I cannot love when my heart is dead,<br>I cannot smile when i cry in my bed;<br>All i ask is time for me,<br>To get over this tragedy,<br>So i can love thee with all honesty,<br>And not hurt thee again.<br><br>Since that 'confrontation', i haven't seen her online... and I refuse to call her.. don't feel right...

Time does not permit you to do that..<br><br>She was overseas for a couple of years i assume.. As mentioned by you.. There was very minimal contact and things only "flourished" when she came back to SG for that 1 week.. Spending 2 days and nights together does not mean anything.. What you both may have gone through are the happy times which you all had back then.. But have or rather, did you both look at the worst senerios where you 2 broke up and the reasons behind it? Not saying that you 2 won't be or will be repeating history again, but anything is possible..<br><br>When she was in overseas, she may have a major conflict with her bf.. Which she <strong>MAY</strong> have come back to SG for a breather and at the same time catch up with family and friends.. If a r/s did not work out well, she will need time to be free from it..  She has a point in saying that both of you should not start off so fast this time.. Cause she may be afraid to hurt you.. Ask yourself.. Did you think u 2 started off too quickly? My personal view.. Minimal contact, chatting over MSN when she was overseas, meeting up only when she came back, does not mean you know whats has been lost and needs to be caught up.<br><br>Regarding her ex, you mentioned that his questions are very probing.. Which also clearly states that you have the right NOT to ans his questions.. Esp if they are private questions.. He may or may not have used her MSN to msg you.. What is best adviced is meeting up face to face to clear the air.. Call her to ask what happen and you would wanna meet up with both of them to clear the air.<br><br>She MAY be using u as a "sub" for the time being..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
