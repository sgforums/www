            <div class='col-md body'>Oh i feel like i could kill right now. I am going back to school next week, and I already am feeling depressed about going back. Back to that island with me as Tom Hanks, all buy myself being the only one of my accursed kind dat is. I can't really talk to my classmates and all, well I can, but they don't talk to me, its happening all over again. I am stood up this shit for 5 years now, I doubt I can stand it any longer. My heart really aches you know? I've got no one to ask stuff about hw and shit, not that they would tell me anywayz.<br><br>Someone told me it was because i hardly hung around them, well whenever I WAS THERE around them, I still got no communication so like what the fuck? Its not my fault. Yet I can communicate easily with my other friends, my white friends, and they tell me I gotta get outta there. But its like, if that's true then it really is a CLASh of civilisation and species, i feel so ashamed sometimes and confused.<br><br>Whatever, I am just rambling, helps me to unload you know? Otherwise it would be just me talking to the 4 walls of this room.<br><br>I don;t want to go back, but I have to, oh lord help me for once.</div>

But I believe things can be done. There're Asians overseas for studies... Work... They face almost the same problem as you.. Yet, they learn to overcome it.... Instead of just complaining about it, think of ways to OVERCOME it.... As a Devil, even I can mix around with humans... (though not very well usually...) I don't see why you couldn't?<br><br>For a START, try to mix around in a smaller and closer group? Maybe even 1 or 2 to start with... People who can more readily accept you..? AND... DON'T give them trouble... At least that's a start?<br><br>Then you can also try changing your 'style'.... Every now and then, not too awkward... Until you FIT IN....?<br></div>

Its not my fault. Yet I can communicate easily with my other friends, my white friends, and they tell me I gotta get outta there. But its like, if that's true then it really is a CLASh of civilisation and species, i feel so ashamed sometimes and confused.<br><br>Whatever, I am just rambling, helps me to unload you know?
