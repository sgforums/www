              <div>I was planning a trip to a city in Aus, either late Apr or May, and my ex, whom I have not met for more than 10 years, happens to live there. She's now happily married (as far as I know) with 2 kids. I sent her an email recently, to let her know of my intended trip. Her first reply was that: "I'm thrilled to know you are coming. Are you coming to see me? Ha ha".</div>
              <div>I took that as a joke and replied: "I'm taking the trip to take a break, visit friends and of course, to see you".</div>
              <div>Just got another reply from her: "I'm getting sleepless nights thinking you are coming over. Is it excitement or nervousness. How am I going to tell David (her husband). Anyway, I'll work that out when you are here". She sounded serious this time.</div>
              <div>I would love to meet her while I'm there but there's no telling what might happen when we meet, esp if in private. Afterall, I'm still a hot blooded male and we did have something good going before.</div>
              <div>Maybe I'm reading too much into what she has written but she has stated previously that she still feels indebted to me for all that I've done for her.</div>
              <div> I'm divorced and have no obligations to be faithful but it's different in her case. It could turn out to be just a casual meeting of former lovers and I think too much about what might evolve when we meet. But what if something do happened? I haven't book my flight and I'm now re-thinking whether I should go.</div>

              <p>If her hubby ever finds out you have intentions to meet up with her in a secret and dirty rendezvous, you better be careful he don't bash your brains out and bury you in the outbacks.</p>
              <p>She's just excited a friend is visiting, that happens to any overseas singaporean.</p>
              <p>Just go and visit as a friend, enjoy the place as a tourist.</p>

              <p>This 'lack of self-control' thing is easier said than done. A friendly peck on cheek could lead to a hug, and so on &amp; so on.</p>

              <div>I was planning a trip to a city in Aus, either late Apr or May, and my ex, whom I have not met for more than 10 years, happens to live there. She's now happily married (as far as I know) with 2 kids. I sent her an email recently, to let her know of my intended trip. Her first reply was that: "I'm thrilled to know you are coming. Are you coming to see me? Ha ha".</div>
              <div>I took that as a joke and replied: "I'm taking the trip to take a break, visit friends and of course, to see you".</div>
              <div>Just got another reply from her: "I'm getting sleepless nights thinking you are coming over. Is it excitement or nervousness. How am I going to tell David (her husband). Anyway, I'll work that out when you are here". She sounded serious this time.</div>
              <div>I would love to meet her while I'm there but there's no telling what might happen when we meet, esp if in private. Afterall, I'm still a hot blooded male and we did have something good going before.</div>
              <div>Maybe I'm reading too much into what she has written but she has stated previously that <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>she still feels indebted to me for all that I've done for her</strong></span>.</div>
              <div> I'm divorced and have no obligations to be faithful but it's different in her case. It could turn out to be just a casual meeting of former lovers and I think too much about what might evolve when we meet. But what if something do happened? I haven't book my flight and I'm now re-thinking whether I should go.</div>
