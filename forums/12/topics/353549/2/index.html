              <div>I was planning a trip to a city in Aus, either late Apr or May, and my ex, whom I have not met for more than 10 years, happens to live there. She's now happily married (as far as I know) with 2 kids. I sent her an email recently, to let her know of my intended trip. Her first reply was that: "I'm thrilled to know you are coming. Are you coming to see me? Ha ha".</div>
              <div>I took that as a joke and replied: "I'm taking the trip to take a break, visit friends and of course, to see you".</div>
              <div>Just got another reply from her: "I'm getting sleepless nights thinking you are coming over. Is it excitement or nervousness. How am I going to tell David (her husband). Anyway, I'll work that out when you are here". She sounded serious this time.</div>
              <div>I would love to meet her while I'm there but there's no telling what might happen when we meet, esp if in private. Afterall, I'm still a hot blooded male and we did have something good going before.</div>
              <div>Maybe I'm reading too much into what she has written but she has stated previously that she still feels indebted to me for all that I've done for her.</div>
              <div> I'm divorced and have no obligations to be faithful but it's different in her case. It could turn out to be just a casual meeting of former lovers and I think too much about what might evolve when we meet. But what if something do happened? I haven't book my flight and I'm now re-thinking whether I should go.</div>

              <p>that said. i think it'll be awesome if she brings her hubby along to dinner AND invite you to a threesome - but of course the odds are pretty slim there, EVEN if you have a big ..</p>

              <p><br>If she really had the intentions to make crazy love to you, then she would have invited you to stay over at her place.</p>
              <p>Because that is what I would do if I were her and I really want to hanky-panky around. But I don't see any reason why she should be attracted to you.</p>
              <p>Booking you a hotel near to her place is the MAXIMUM hospitality she can extend towards you....keeping you at an arm's length distance away from her.</p>
              <p>She probably pity you. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
