            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Don_gn,<br><br>Internet relationships bear a huge risk on both you and her in terms of feelings and expectations.You should respect the idea that via the internet or telephonw, you can never fathom exactly what either one of you are conveying as communciation.<br><br>Another stumbling block appears to be the &gt;10 year age gap that both of you are facing. Though love knowsn no boundaries but in this highly sophisticated world, unconditional love , unfortunately isn't that widely-accepted as a commited goal.<br><br>Ask her truthfully if what she is conveying are not mixed signals but indeed, true and sincere feelings. Work things out with each other and meet up. (IN A PUBLIC AND CROWDED PLACE!)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>And, if things does not go according to plan, dun  be disheartened because such things are not meant to be and you ought to deserve better.<br><br>Good Luck and Cheers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have a few questions which I hope you have the answers to them yourself...<br><br>Do you think you know her well? (Her characters, outlook, etc etc etc) You said you felt good when she called you, is it becoz of her voice? (Did she possess a nice voice, etc etc etc)<br><br>Given the advanced technology where people are really lacking in real-time interpersonal r/s, it's no surprised that you guys communicate in every form except meeting up face to face.<br><br>Then again, what is the reason for not meeting? Are you hesitant coz you are not sure if you can accept the superficial side of this girl? What if she turns out to be under your expectation? What if her voice don't match with her looks?<br><br>No real r/s can develop without having real time communication and meeting up with the each other. Is there something in reality which you're afriad of? Maybe not just you, but the girl as well.<br><br>Think about it, how can you fall for an ascii character? Someone behind the screen?<br><br>Meeting her in reality is always the best way out if you want to test for yourself if you're really into her.<br><br>p/s: Age is no barrier, besides age does not equates to mentality.<br><br>Cheerz...<br></div>

It's not only different - it's hell of a different when you speak to someone real life and someone virtually. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>What you know about her is the impression she creates from merely words and probably with one phone call. Her voice sounded pretty sweet (totally bowl you over) and you 'think' that you fell in love with her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Truth #1: You love her impression, you don't love her.<br><br>The big age gap is a problem - True love surmount all (Yes, I agree), however is it true love for you? Difficult to say, because you <strong>can't guarantee</strong> she can turn out to be what you expect her to be. (Subconscious, your mind has implanted a vision and image of how she would be like when you see her - this included character and physical looks)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>What she wants in a bf emotionally, physically, mentally is VERY DIFFERENT from what you want vice vista. For a 32 years old guy - probably you will be thinking of marriage, but <strong>how sure can you say for a 21 years old lady?</strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Before you attempt anything, be sure to understand what you are doing. Its foolish to woo a girl based on impression alone and with 11 years difference - this is indeed very high risk IF you are looking for a fulfilling relationship. You can heed your heart - but don't ever think back and regret what you have did. <strong>Life is full of decision</strong>, just make sure you always look forward and never turn back.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
