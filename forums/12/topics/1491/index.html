            <div class='col-md body'>I think the whole thing is so SICK. From the transcript, anyone can see that Pokemon is having fun posting and he is the one who asked lexelle what to post. And no, I am NOT siding with lex. Just don't understand why everyone pushes the blame to her when she is not the person who gossip about it FIRST (NOT targetting at anyone). Lex is guilty but so is Pokemon and whoever that starts this whole shit thing, if not more guilty. So why are you all shunning and pushing it all on lex? It's just so SICK that Pokemon posted the transcript and here we are talking about intrusion on someone's privacy. So now, what has been proven? That lex is in the wrong and Pokemon innocent? Oh please, if Pokemon is that INNOCENT, he won't be having the fun of his life posting those messages up and asking lex what to post. So he has his fun and now what? Say SORRY and pushes the blame to someone else? *SHRUGS* That's such a lowly act.<br><br>And yes, Pokemon has been a pawn in this game. But whoever it is that instigates or asks Pokemon to post the transcript is using him too. Oh yeah, I forgot, maybe Pokemon finally can SEE the light and DON'T let people influence him anymore. Whatever it is, someone must have spoken to him and yes, it's a good thing that he come out and clear the whole thing but is there a need to push the blame away just to save his skin by posting the transcript? And now that everything is over, someone else has to start gloating about it and talking about some power shit. Don't you all think that's so sick. ALL of you are just as guilty, telling tales on others behind their backs. The ONLY difference is that now, someone got caught and you are the one gloating. So now, at least I know who I should be more wary of in future.<br><br>------------------<br>=================================<br>Do Pixies like a rainy day?<br>A-piping through the dell?<br>The Pixies must enjoy the rain;<br>Thats when they weave their spell.<br>Rain drops, rain drops<br>Play a Pixie-tune<br>=================================<br><br>[This message has been edited by pixie_gal (edited 10 November 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This should be turned into a sitcom man. Who needs to watch Friends when they can watch this. Lots of things was unnecessary, but they do add up to the tensions you feel around. Hmm...... at least it is within the forum, those of us who dunt know the involved parties will just sit back and laugh at all the drama happening. Those who know them will be angered, saddened, or what do you have. Anyway, as all sitcoms, alls well will end well, hopefully it is the same here.<br><br>------------------<br>Style is knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn. - Gore Vidal</div>
