            <div class='col-md body'>my parents are also together because of me and my sis.<br><br>then my family got 0 bonding totally. the only way we communicate is thru quarrels previously. now i just dont talk to them unless needed.<br><br>and somehow or rather, i developed a very lonewolf character. friendships very few. prefer to keep to myself. dont like crowds ba. sometimes i envy those who always have a big clique to hang out with. then i think back what for hang out and waste so much time when i can do stuff that i like, namely gaming lol.<br><br>romance wise, kinda despo. yearning for the feeling of someone to love and care for and to receive in return without the shoutings and quarrels. maybe is not that someone that i yearn for but the feelings ma.<br><br>ya i also envy those family with very strong bonds. i dont know how to talk to my parents. is like the action of talking doesnt exist.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well , look at the bright side. At least its an experience we can learn from it. I mean my sisters learns a different lesson from it , so did my older bro ,me.. i used to hate my parents. Then slowly, as u grow u realise , u start to think , well.. at least they loved us.. or commited in thier relationship to make sure we did our best. N at least me n my siblings didnt turn out to be fuked up ppl.<br><br>But then again , makes u wonder , to be happy in the future , or to continue ur parents legacy n forsake ur own happiness. mmmm~ Both my parents are workaholics. I remember they used to try to out do or buy our loyalties with material stuffs.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  come to think of it , its like having double ang pow... or double the money.<br><br>Hardly see my parents , except my maid. Since young , been transferred here and there to live with mum or dad. THen got thrown overseas alone. Hell i hardly even knows my siblings!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Come to think of it , i am only close to my older bro n sis cause we have similiar incidents. But they are doing way better then me. N i have decided to forsake my own happiness to try to better things with my parents. Did i make teh right choice ? Maybe~ maybe not. BUt i can only say whatever path i chose it has given me different experiences.<br><br>anyways i think i of topic just wanna rant~ how i feel.</div>
