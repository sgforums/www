There's no use in coming here seeking advice and reading posts after posts, theories after theories. U need to go out there and and socialise and find out what works well for u.<br><br>U dun come and read this forum and expect to be a casanova right? Experienced guys are able to attract gals because they have failed the most.<br>We can only share our experience.<br><br>But if u ask me my personal take is that gals like guys who are comfortable in their own skin and not being desperate, definitely not attention-seekers to try all sorts of ways to impress them. Impress urself, not gals. After all, if u try to be what u are not, after the gal finds out who u really are dun accpet u, isn't it back to square one? U need to find one who likes u for who u are...ur interests ur hobbies ur ideals ur opinions etc. U get what im saying?<br><br>Again its my humble opinion. U need to find out urself. It's more rewarding that way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>10 Traits i believe gals are attracted to:<br>1. Confidence<br>2. Patience<br>3. Courage<br>4. Decisiveness<br>5. Assertiveness<br>6. Humor(includes teasing them for fun)<br>7. Able to say 'no' when you think you are right<br>8. Smile<br>9. Ability to communicate<br>10. Creativity in imagination and pulling them into your world<br><br>10 Traits I believe that will turn off gals:<br>1. Showing of Desperation<br>2. Trying to get their attention at all costs which is very obvious to them<br>3. Calling them and msging them every day<br>4. No social life<br>5. Being too nice to them by saying 'yes' all the time, meaning too boring<br>6. Trying too hard to impress them<br>7. Giving gifts too early to try win their affection<br>8. Being impatient<br>9. Inability to communicate well and can't seem to make ppl laugh<br>10. Trying too hard to impress<br><br>The above listed are not in order of priority. Notice that physical looks are not<br>mentioned because it depends on the gal's taste. My personal belief is that gals look at u as a person rather than as based on ur looks alone unless u are extremely handsome like Takeshi Kaneshiro. Even nerds can get laid.</div>
