Most people here are probably in their teens and early 20s who have not started out working or seeking a life of their own.<br><br>You have a complicated situation, at least seek comments from a more mature forum. I will not give comments on how to solve, i am sure you already have  a plan of your own.<br><br>I am sure real life friends and real life family are your real source of consolation and advice.<br><br>Cheers.<br><br>p.s. my family has been in that kind of situation b4, somethings are easier said than done. especially from what i read from these inexperience forumers.<br><br>p.s. the rest do not flame me. u probably know what rubbish words u can spout to influence a depress mind like dear lostboy</div>
