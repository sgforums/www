            <div class='col-md body'>Wow. Must be sad.<br><br>Before you do anything else, please think about your kids first.<br><br>From your point of view, it does seems like your wife is enjoying her freedom. And thus made you feel a little bit insecure.<br><br>But on another hand, maybe she is just being harmless. Like you know, hanging out with friends and such.<br><br>True she is not supposed to do all that as she is has a role of a mother still if not wife. This kind of cases normally I guess you have to really sit down and talk to her. Be careful in not incurring any wrath from both of you.<br><br>Maybe you would like to hire a PI? Sounds harsh, but I guess thats the only way to actually find out the truth what she is really doing outside.</div>
