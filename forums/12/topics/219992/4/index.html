If she is the kind don't have many friends to talk to regarding her problem it's very easy for her to fall for guy who know her needs.

She maybe the kind dun really tell u her problem unless you dig out or discover by yourself.<br><br>Cool man u only 29, blood boil easily.</div>

And you seemed to have issues with the two qualities or at least the manner which you bring your message/idea across communication.<br><br>It might be a strong possibility.... that the reason behind wanting a part-time employment could actually be an escapism/avoidance tactic to certain unpleasant, yet unmentioned issues in the house, or namely your relationship. Albeit I do not condone lying, through yunhaier's analysis, it appear that she may have wanting to work with an intention to get away from your love.<br><br>You mean all it takes is only 2 months for her to find an interest for promiscuity?<br><br>There is already gnawing dissatisfaction in the marriage - the extra-marital affair is just a catalysis to blow things out of proportion, probably out of emotional suppression. You may have confirmed your finding, but I hope you will still read what I may have to say.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Let me ask a simple question, which you could have been thinking all day long:<br><br>WHY CHEAT?<br><br>Why would she cheat?<br><br>I read through your posting - your previous break ups were due to serious arguments, not exactly because of infidelity. I must say that the communication style in your relationship (before and after marriage) is horribly unevolved and you also have a strong tint of chauvinism.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by lostboy1978:</div><div class="quote_body">How to cheer up <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> ..  women always said you only know work and give money only, <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>But if i dont work how to support family??

Or do we acknowledge part of this 'blame responsibility' in a cracked marriage? When we talk about the trust factor - you can easily claim that she lied to you and that's distrust, while I can also point that you married her and wondering if the child was indeed yours.<br><br>So what will happen if the child turns out to be somebody's flesh and blood? Perhaps some one night stand? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What would you do?</strong></span> You think that your child looks a bit like you and you decides that he/she is your child - now... how accurate would that be?<br><br>Mistrust existed all over - even the hasty marriage began on dubious grounds, therefore, I don't expect this marriage to be harmonious or smooth flowing.<br><br>The act of infidelity may actually be more of a push factor from you than a pull factor from external environment because I don't seriously think that someone can go out there, work a fringing part time work (perhaps that's only few days in a week kind?) and end up in extra-marital affairs. It almost seemed like a 'desperate' measure to do something drastic.<br><br>She already has that vulnerability and the desire to free her suppressed emotional condition. I also must add the fact that this suppressed condition may have probably first taken place when she realized that she is pregnant and was left with little choice other than telling you about it and hoping that you would marry her. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Even if she was unhappy with you, what choice does she has?</strong></span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> To be an unwed single mum?<br><br>Bad reason for marriage will beget tumultuous marriage - No relationship can escape the cosmic lesson Love will attempt to teach. Elements and qualities that one has failed to learn in BGR, shall learn in marriage - probably at twice the cost.<br><br>P.S: Before you sentence your marriage to death, allow yourself and her a chance to talk like matured adults. Yes, she has cheated on you, but always talk first and judge later. Find out what's wrong and see what options you might have first, before throwing your finale move.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
