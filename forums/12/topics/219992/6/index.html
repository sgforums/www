You've known your wife for so many years, based on your understanding of her, do you think you can trust her?  I'm not askin you to trust blindly, but im sure you have built a certain degree of understanding through the years, no?<br><br>Why not take the 'friend's' story as a signal, a sign to clear the air with your wife.  Communicate with her, forge a better understanding of her and your relationship with her.<br><br>Since she is denying that she had an affair, she might not be ready to give up on the marriage yet.  Talk nicely with her, see if you can work something out?<br><br>Always remember, hold your rashness.  Anything rash you wanna say, <strong>DONT</strong> tell your wife.  Come here, talk to us, before you even blurt it to your wife.  For words said in a fit of anger, can be really hurting.  And sometimes, once the harm is done, it is very difficult to be undone.<br><br>Take care okay?  We are behind you.</div>

This doesn't work in a male-female relationship. Normally if you two are NOT married and with kids especially, I will ask you to dump her. No forgiving and taking her back, period. You need to know that your pride as a man has been broken. When you forgive, you are allowing her to disrespect you. And when she disrespects you, you think she will like you more? Nah~<br><br>But since we are talking about a marriage with kids here, it will be a different game altogether. I will then have to advise you to stay as long as you want because of your children. They need a happy family.<br><br>See, the problem with this woman is: she wants to play. She lied to you. This is a BIG deal not to be overlooked. How is she going to be a good mother in the future? How is she going to teach them the proper values of not telling lies? She is not very committed in this marriage. She is causing you mental and emotional hurt. And she is outside enjoying herself? Come on! Where's her responsibility as a mother? Talk about commitment!<br><br>She is apologising for lying to you for going clubbing. But why is she not apologising for causing hurt to you? Why is she not asking you along to go clubbing? Aren't you her husband? Even if she is not having any affair? Why is she not apologising for not being responsible to the family? Why not for the happiness of the family? I question her attitude.<br><br>I don't want to get into reasons why she did this or that. We don't know if it's true or not. The fact is, she did it. Result: you were hurt. That's all that matters.<br><br>To be fair to her, start to bring her out and have fun and show more concern in her life. Spend some time listening to her. Women like guys who listen. She is your wife you know? Meaning you don't just come back home and pretend nothing happens. She is still your girlfriend. Marriage is not the end of everything you know?! Marriage is the start of many things! And please, don't get too possessive and uptight. Give her the benefit of the doubt and trust her(even though it's difficult I know because the trust is broken). Next time,  suggest going clubbing with her. See if she prefers to go with Mr. Handsome T or you?<br><br>doko</div>
