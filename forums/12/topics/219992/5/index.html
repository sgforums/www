            <div class='col-md body'>hi guys here,<br><br>Seriously i can onli hope that TS will have the things all resolved. I've been thinking abt all these stuff....just how do we judge whether a guy is indeed possessive and suspicious? This is a serious question i'll like to hear some constructive comments on...<br><br>To frame the question, i have to state that i believe that true love between a man and woman must and should have a jealous element. In fact exclusiveness is one of the key attributes that makes marriage so special compared to other human relationships.<br><br>Secondly, trust must be earned. Trust is grounded upon reasoned faith, and is not blind. Partners who feel loved seldom feel suspicion.<br><br>So just to ask, can we have some examples that straddle the line between being possessive/suspicious and being justifiably jealous?<br><br>PS&gt; Please, anyone who wants to present the "two-sides-to-an-argument" take note, the guy seems to have a tough time doing his job, keeping the family going and coping with the job stress and fear. He's sacrificing and we do not know if he can fulfill the needs/wants of his wife without losing the job. Why doesn't the suffering of the husband engender similar displays of sacrifice on the part of the wife, elicit empathy from her instead and cause her to dote more on the family??<br><br>I can only conclude that character wise, the wife is far more flawed than the husband. The "two-sides" is pretty one-sided actually.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have the same situations before.<br><br>Modern life there is a lot of comparing. Marrying young is highly depends on a stable mind to to set it out. From my days at family court, all I can say is now a day this cases are very very common no matter what age married couple are. Worst part laws most of the time cannot fully cover the situations. Example if wife is proven having an affairs she only lost her own maintenance upon divorce. There is a high chance child of the marriage goes to the mother even she was proven having affairs. And to proven this mother cannot fulfill the responsibilities is too difficult. Example the emotions of care towards child have no prove. Sadly our famous "Women Chapter" have proven to be effective against man without holding my against women even if women was proven the heart breaker.<br><br>I hope "lostboy1978" is lucky enough to get out the situations strong. It is an painful experiance &amp; involved party usually are inflicting more pain against each other.<br><br>Be strong, many people have the same situations like you. Hold your mind cool. The best solutions may not be easy to swollow. Look forward, life is an wide path in front. And I never look back to my ex-marriage. In fact I am much happier with ex-wife &amp; am very very sure ex-wife still is suffering from her "Affairs" experiances. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

One of the reasons was that the man was questioning her seeing her friends some time ago. She was fed up and the two broke up. I see it as a point where the woman is beginning to get turned off by the man's actions. And she remembers it even after marriage. She will carry it into their marriage life. The mistake the man made was asking her to patch back the relationship. It doesn't usually work in real life except for rare cases, because the woman still remembers his stupid mistakes. So it brings it over to the marriage.<br><br>And it is possible that giving him a second child might still mean nothing. She could still not love him at much as all the way when they met each other before marriage and they can still have sex. One thing is for sure, the woman does not like him as much as before, in fact, I dare say, very low feelings.<br><br>doko</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I kinda agree with the_fallen. I known talk easy, but I think when you marry and have kids, it's no longer just about the two fo you, it is about the kids. I believe that any solution to this must factor in the best situation for the kids. I believe, to that, you are the best judge of that. I know of people who grew up from broken families who turned out to be useful members of society and in fact, treasure their families well because they knew the consequnces of screwing the whole marriage up. What I am saying is that you know your kids best and you know your wife best and of course you know yourself well. Make a decision which would settle it amicably, but at the same time have the best result for your kids.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think you should first question why your wife is doing such stuff and ask her to stop because of the kids. Keep your cool and dont get too worked up first. Then u wait a few more months before deciding, Its in human nature to sin what... correct?<br><br>You have to ask yr wife why is she doing stuff like this after years of marriage and you can try to win her back by doing nice stuff for her....but if it does not work then i thik the last resort would be a divorce<br><br>If you are planning for a divorce, please... please think about the children first. If you read the news, survey results shown that kids who have broke families and stuff turn out to be either academically or socially poor. Children are the poor ones that always get affected in the divorce</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Take a step back and put yourself in her shoe, do you as her husband give her support emotionally when she needed. You maybe busy at work, sometime she may need your love and care. You may think by earn enough to support the family will be enough, that's a mistake liao. Why other guys can get close to her, becos of $$? She can tell you anything she want to buy, but she won't tell you she need your love and attention. Bro, be romantic abit, sometime woman are just like a little girl. Do you tell her " I love u" after marriage?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>people keep saying to stay together for the kids.. imo, if u and ur missus do not even have feelings for each other, why stay on? separation is even worse.. Divorce her on grounds on adultery... custody will ultimately be yours and you will be paying very minimal maintenance. She has all of herself to bring her to this predicament. She took you for granted the way i see it... and even if she apologise and promises she wouldnt do it, you think she won't?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>A new day has come for you...have a close rapport with your children...bring your children overseas sans ur missus....have ur children bond with your parents...it's cruel...yes.. but what she done to you..is much much cruel and sad...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
