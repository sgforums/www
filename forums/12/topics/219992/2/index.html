She said i'm getting too sensative and dont trust her.What can i do.We quarrel and she leave home .Went to my in laws place.<br><br>2nd incident, yesterday i called up my in laws and she told me my wife went to work.Then my friend sms me that he saw her at boat quay... I double check with him again and he is very sure its my wife.<br><br>I confronted her but she denied again... bu lastly admitted (she sound like i 'm forcing her to admit one)<br><br>I think our relation is coming to and end..We should i do?</div></blockquote>This woman is fishy. 3 times in a row she displayed bad signs. Everything starts from the day you met her before she married you. Was she like that before? Did she lie to you before?<br><br>Stop accusing her of anything yet. That's a mistake. Keep it to yourself how many times she lied to you to have some track record for yourself.<br><br>Depending on you, I won't recommend divorcing if I were you because of the kids. But then again, living with a woman for 40 years in the future who lied to you is a NO-NO. How are you going to trust her in the future and place your kids in her care? She going to teach them to lie in the future?<br><br>doko</div>

So the problem carried over to the marriage. Let me tell you something: women remember everything you do even subconsciously. For your case before the marriage, you were also displayin signs of insecurities and the woman remembers this. Also, this woman is not good long-term marriage material because she is a very stubborn person and she tried to BS you.<br><br>doko</div>

U can jus tell her u think it will b best 2 seek help not only for yourself, but for the kids and most importantly for her.  She will listen if she is a human being.  Whether it works out or not highly depends on how things turn out.  In the case where S H I T happens, life still goes on.

But i do not fault TS entirely as lying is always wrong and bad.  By lying, she has shaken one of the fundamentals of a relationship, trust.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>your story sounds like everything in very uncertain. would u hire a detective in this case? if you're so worried...<br>like elindra said, do u over react to certain things?before making a conclusion u should investigate thematter, dont go around texting and scolding other people like its their fault, u dont want to make your wife hate you right?<br>in the meantime stay cool and find out whats the REAL prob. dont assume too much, it will only make matters worst!</div>

You should not be focusing on me. You should be focusing on why. Point out what's wrong and don't let your emotions cloud your judgement by saying one liners. It's not helping his cause.<br><br>Why is the woman doing all these things despite being married and having kids? Is she putting effort to make the relationship work on a consistent basis? Im not saying the guy is totally correct here as well. Both sides make mistakes. But I see the guy putting a lot of effort trying to support his family.<br><br>doko</div>
