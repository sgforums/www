I am a guy and I do have a close female friend. The situation is somewhat different in that she knows that the guy is the worst scum the world has produced cos she did catch the guy in bed with someone else and openly flirting (in her presence). But still she stuck with him.. took a great deal of effort to talk sense into her and paint her real dark and glommy images of her doomed "marriage" with this guy if she continues til marriage.. Well she bought into the idea and so decided to not continue the relationship. She's with someone else now (no not me) but she still pines (occassionally for this guy)..<br><br>So my point is the victim must see for herself and preferably witness some of these accounts. The best friend can (at best) psycho her continuously. But at the end of it, it can be exasperating cos the choice is really hers..</div>
