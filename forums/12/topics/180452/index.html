            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there,<br>dun be upset over it. love takes time to blossom, and likewise for all the other linkage to your loved one. Love is like a flower and the parents, siblings, uncles and aunties are like the leaves and roots. You need a lot of time and patience to shower them with sunlight, water and fertilizers to make them grow. Only when it grows healthily will you have a love in full bloom. And all this takes time, maybe short maybe long. It took me 5years of courtship to win not only her heart and soul but as well as the parents, siblings and so on!So dun lose heart, it may suck a little while but persevere and u shall excel!<br>Good Luck...</div>

They are looking at you carefully and do not rush things.<br><br>2) Do not do any silly stuff like kiss or hugging in front of the parents that will ban you from the house.<br><br>3) Her parents have a right to protect her as they have raised her. Respect the right and they will give you the same respect in return.<br><br>4) Run errands for the family and show that you can be trusted to do stuffs. That will earn their respect.<br><br>5) Take good care of her when she is sick and it will show that you are able to be there for her.<br><br>final advice take things slow and steady.<br>Do not rush and show that you are the man of your words when you do things by completing each assignment given to you by her parents.<br><br>P.S.<br>at least you got to be her special friend. My ex mother slam the door in my face and refuse to let me in or give me a chance.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dun go against her parents. give them time to accept you. just remain as her 'special' frd till ur old enough and proof to them tat ur serious bout ur gf. this way u win their trust. it's nt an over night thing anyway. it may be a difficult time now but it'll be beautiful at the end instead of going against her parents now and makin them have a bad impression of u.. they're probably too conservative. all the best!</div>
