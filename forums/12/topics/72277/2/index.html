A high percentage of it should be her own decision or maybe in a way an unwilling decision by 'force' of circumstance...<br><br>Well... I guess there's no definite say on either side of this board...<br><br>Let things go so that it won't hurt her so much (maybe?)...? Or ask her to show that you really care for her...? Sometimes the real sad thing is not when a relationship ends... I think one of the worst is when both parties are unwilling to set apart but situation leaves them with no 2nd choice... Then again, nobody would ever know if that's really for the better or worse? Oh well...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

You are self-absorbed, constantly thinking and feeling the way you always do. You are likely MCP (possible Taurus, Leo, Scorpio or Aquarius). Understanding this: your story may contain important/critical issue that you never realise/know. You don't understand why she left you - quite serious if you fall under (I) which I hope you don't.<br><br>II) There are concealed environmental factor that 'forced' her to make that decision. She keep mum about important/critical issue because she doesn't know how to tell you/doesn't know if you could take it - gulity, etc/doesn't want you to share certain burden. A seemingly good way is to leave you, then tell you to release her if you loved her. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>III) She truely wants to leave. She is drained/bored of the current relationship. She is like a caged bird - wishing to soar and fly in the free sky. Your presence restrain and restrict her desire.<br><br>Regardless, I support your choice in trying to understand why she is leaving you. There may be more than meets the eye. I suggest you employ emotional tactics than to go-straight and make demands. A concern emotional voice does wonders.<br><br>Cheers</div>
