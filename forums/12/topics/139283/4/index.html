What did she do in the relationship?<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> In the one year she did what normal couples do. Both of them go out for shopping, watch movies, go have fun with both side of their friends, eat with parents from both side. What makes this case, so surprising is that one day she just told the bf over the phone the relationship is over. </span><br><br>100% love put forth does not mean 100% success in a r/s.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> Totaly agree with you on this point that 100% love does not gives 100% success in a r/s.<br><br>Can I ask how much love % should a person put in order to at least try to get<br>a 80% chance of success? or what should a guy do to get a good love relationship with a girl?  </span><br><br>Anyway, define 1)100% love.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> 100% love to the guy in the case was<br><br>1) willing to work hard for the relationship<br><br>2) try to make the girl happy<br><br>3) what she wants the guy will get<br><br>4) willing to get himeself killed in an accident in order to protect her .<br><br>5) never allow anyone to touch her in terms of sex.<br><br>6) never go out with girls whom she might get the wrong idea<br><br>7) Always think about her when he does things.<br><br>I may not have the best description for the 100% love but this is what the guy did for the case.<br></span><br><br>2)Define Ugly<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><br><br>Someone who is not able to attract much attention from anyone around him, especially girls due to possible resons like<br><br>1) shyness<br><br>2) looks<br><br>3) character<br><br>4) sense of fashion<br><br>5) age<br><br>6) not rich<br><br></span><br><br>3)What happened during two years as friends?<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> Both are 24 and are working in the same company. Both are dip holders and were working  in the same department. Guy joined the company for 1 year before transfering to her department. Both meet as friends first and did the usual things like  go ktv, go for dinners, attend birthdays, go out for shopping, sms each other at nite, chat till morning, no quarrels. After 2 year of friendship the guy asked her to be his gf she agree.    </span><br><br>To me i think this case study<br>1 - is not a complete study<br><br><span style="color: blue;">  Agreed with your point that is not a complete study. I should have given more details about the case to help you understand what is happening.   </span><br><br>2 - is not of bad judgement instead (refer to point 3)<br><br><span style="color: blue;">   Maybe you could suggest a better case study to help me understand what is bad judgement?   </span><br><br>3 - This scenario only tells me that the guy is inexperience and naive.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> The guy is inexperience and naive? humm lets see.<br><br>He had one past relationship before breakup due to girl leaving singapore to study. Girl got one past relationship breakup due to the character difference.<br><br>Guy tried his best to love his gf in the best way that he could, so I should say he is too naive in thinking that by putting 100% of his love for her, he should get back 100% of her love.<br><br></span><br><br>I advice you to put up a solid case scenario or just drop the whole case.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"> I am really sorry that I did not put up a solid case scenario as I have left out too many details which are important factors in point out whether this is a case of bad judgement or not. In future I will put up more details to the cases to help people understand.<br><br>I have given u the full detail of the case I would like to ask a few questions.<br><br>1) Did the guy make a bad judgement by asking this girl to be his gf?<br><br>2) What went wrong?  The guy give her so much love and there were no quarrels in the love and friendship stage so why did the girl left him?<br><br>3) If you say maybe he is inexperience and naive but what should he have done in order to lower her chances of her leaving him?<br><br>4) lastly I really hope that you could provide a case study for me in understanding the meaning of " bad judgement". I really do not understand this part, thats is why I would ask for your kind help in providing me some pointers in avoiding a bad judgement.<br><br></span><br></div>

This is <strong>NOT </strong>a question of 100% giving, nice guy or whatever - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>this is the question of suitability and needs.</strong></span> Say I dislike eating pasta, although eating pasta will definitely fill my stomach, but that doesn't mean I must eat pasta because I know it can fill my stomach (Nice guy is nice, but that doesn't mean her needs is such that she would desire a nice guy).<br><br>And before you go 'Ok, I am going to become a bad guy (in whatsoever definition you thought of a 'bad guy') - its useless as you are trending on foreign land. That region is completely alien to you and if you try to walk that path, you end up belonging to nowhere (In marketing sense, you merely spolit your original branding - you can't have mix messages in your branding).

You make a bad judgement only if your relationship is deeply karmic and create more than just a mess in every aspect of your life (E.g. falling in love with a flirty woman - it's probably a high risk if you are looking for some kind of stable relationship). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>To simply lose a relationship doesn't constitute a bad judgement</strong></span> - it probably would, in some lesser degree, if you don't even know why you lose it in the first place.<br><br>To some extend, there isn't any 'wrong relationship.' In my studies, it's only benefic or karmic. (Relationship that is harmonious and one that is disruptive - both of them can also serve to built or ruin you).<br><br>YOU think that she is the one for you - great. But that thought isn't mutual. Till the day when you find someone with this mutual thought, you will probably end up in marriage with her. <span style="font-style: italic;">Probably</span>.<br><br>But in Love, it's more than just a civic minded/technical way of looking at a relationship. One plus one equation doesn't always mean two in Love, which is how you are trying to apply that in yourself. In Psychology, we mimic our behaviour based on what behaviour that works and rewarded. We continue to mimic those behavior until they become an integrated part of our personality (or in this case, our definition and preception of Love). WHEN those behaviour don't work or gain acceptance, the mind is frustrated and the human takes on defensive measure to protect it's self image. Then in Love, the mind gradually form a 'logical equation' to appease the confusion, but the heart continues to bleed unconsciously because the heart do not see the way the mind do. But as long as this adjusted behaviour pays off - we will maintain them... we work to maintain sameness.<br><br>And when too painful rejection or whichever processing system (mind or heart) don't work, it explode and causes a system breakdown. Our self preception is greatly affected and we lose track of who and what we are.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You looked so lost. Seeking answers everywhere.<br><br>P.S: If you ain't the man your love is looking for - remaining in the relationship usually promise much misery. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Find a woman who likes and appreciates the qualities that you bring out... and not be a man you think that a woman would appreciate. </strong></span>Think is assumption... only knowing is truth.

Yeap, I agree, it not simple, but after one fell, one have to pick oneself up some point in one's life, isn't it?? But whether one choose to pick oneself up earlier or later, depends on oneself. I choose to pick myself up earlier, I never said tat was easy, treat it as a training, cos it'll make u stronger, applies to both sides of the sexes.<br><br>And from the previous posts, yeap, good looks counts. But itz not just good looks, but also the ability to present oneself (Jeez, I've been repeating this for the past few months). Let me put it this way, if u are the boss of a certain big company and is in charge of interviewing those tat are applying for a senior-manager post, watz the 1st thing to look out for?? Yeah, the way the interviewee presents itself, which includes the way one dresses, the way one walks, the way one talks, confidence and style(please, no R&amp;B Hip-Hop), this shows whether one respects the company. But the interview is only the 1st impression, whether u can keep the job, itz up to u.<br><br>So i believe u pples get my meaning??<br><br>Dun believe me?? Hmmm... then those friends of mine who are just Average Joes, dun drive big cars, dun own condos, dun have credit cards can get gf who look like those babes out of the FHM mag, are just paid escorts?? I dun think they lie to me about something like tat. Although they r not those guys those gals can drool at in Sunset Bay, they put in alot of effect in presenting themselves and looking good, tatz admirable.<br><br>Ok, u've put in the effect, passed the interview, got the job. U worked hard to keep the job, but u got retranched. Tough luck kid, f**k the boss and beat ur chest, felt great, but still no job. The earth won't stop spinning for u. Time to get a new job. Catch my drift??<br><br>To sum up, time to grow up, have the courage to stand up, I dun believe u just wanna sit around the same spot where u fell. Between a winner and a loser, u choose, the choice is urs to make, bruddah.</div>
