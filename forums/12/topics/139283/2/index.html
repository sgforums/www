            <div class='col-md body'>Whoa.. sounds like we got some issues going on here ! both sides have thier side. What i think is.. its true how girls can change heart faster then guys.The guys have longer mourning period. GIrls have less.. coz when they just broke up n are lonely ..they are most vulrnable. Thats when the wolves move in to claim the lamb.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  Sg got high rate of girls changing hands..  its like community soup. Everyone having a sip in it... i feel sorry for the dudes who says thier gf ran off because the other dude got a car. Well, u can always smash his car to make things even  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
