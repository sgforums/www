            <div class='col-md body'>I think it is an undeniable fact that girls will lose out more in a relationship compared to guys. Remember the fact that "In a relationship" means they were in mutual love and it doesn't means one-night stand kinda relationship. So basically the Conned/Cheated factor does not contribute to the foundations of the relationship, and there is no arguement regarding fairness because the guy is the provider/giver in a relationship and the girl is the protected/receiver in a relationship. Both have to come to this understanding before entering into a relationship...and that is the norm.<br><br>When things goes bad in a relationship like the above, it will depends on who is the person who betrays the trust of the other in the relationship. Regardless of who is right or wrong, the victim of the relationship will of course have the sympathy of many and it could be either the guy or girl. There is no such thing as a winner or loser in a relationship, love afterall has no trophy.<br><br>Other than the above example that I've cited, the rest of the non-mutual relationship will usually put the girl at a greater risk than a guy. Guys should be gracious enough to love a girl and provide unconditional love to a girl if he truly loves her. If love comes with an expectation, then that love is no longer free, unconditional and the intentions behind the love is no longer pure or  true. If the girl returns the love to the guy, then both will be able to move onto a mutual relationship together.<br><br>Love is a very difficult topic to learn in life itself, and it will take most people a couple of years or perhaps a lifetime to truly understand love and displays it graciously. Love is not sex, and neither it is possessive. Love is free...and should be free.<br><br>Good guys should never suggested/pressured/persuaded pre-martial sex before marriage to a girl if he truly loves her. Even when the girl offers pre-martial sex before marriage to a guy, the guy should not accept the offer. Reason is because abusing sex before marriage will not only destroy the purity of the love shared between the guy and the girl, it will also destroy the esteem, dignity, confidence and trust in the relationship. IF any guys accepted pre-martial sex before marriage, then they do not deserved any sympathy for destroying the purest love that a girl can ever provide for a guy...that is her body.<br><br>Guys who can't say no should go masturbate and say NO to the girls that they love.<br><br>And guys who are not able to love a girl unconditionally and graciously should not deserve to be loved or suitable to be in a relationship.<br><br>So I hope that guys will consider responsibly for the girl that they really love  before initiating any form of courtship.<br><br>Good Luck all. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

I know they are sly , they can be conniving , and they can lie to u until the very day u get married with her . I have known girls that at age of 23  , very pretty and yet still virgin , always confused about their sexuality , saving it for the right moment and right guy when i was being so pessimistic towards them. After u know enough girls , n been with enough , u can almost tell which are and which arent virgin. I have banged 'virgin' girls that are not so virgin..  i have almost banged real virgin girls when it was at the last minute. If you are sensitive enough sometimes u will know.<br><br>And in terms of respect , its respect ... just like respect for some people who can not smoke when he couldve also just social smoke with us.I not talking about those smokers who quit like me because of some big reasion, i talking about those that associate with smokers 24/7 and is the only one that dont smoke even if its his last day on this planet kinda person. Friends that all smoke.. that go out , go wild go crazy drink n so on.I talking about 99.99% and he is the 0.01% Its the respect of able to stand their own ground and the belief and their solid principle in doing or not doing what they do.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by parn:</div><div class="quote_body">I think it is an undeniable fact that girls will lose out more in a relationship compared to guys. Remember the fact that "In a relationship" means they were in mutual love and it doesn't means one-night stand kinda relationship. So basically the Conned/Cheated factor does not contribute to the foundations of the relationship, and there is no arguement regarding fairness because the guy is the provider/giver in a relationship and the girl is the protected/receiver in a relationship. Both have to come to this understanding before entering into a relationship...and that is the norm.<br><br>When things goes bad in a relationship like the above, it will depends on who is the person who betrays the trust of the other in the relationship. Regardless of who is right or wrong, the victim of the relationship will of course have the sympathy of many and it could be either the guy or girl. There is no such thing as a winner or loser in a relationship, love afterall has no trophy.<br><br>Other than the above example that I've cited, the rest of the non-mutual relationship will usually put the girl at a greater risk than a guy. Guys should be gracious enough to love a girl and provide unconditional love to a girl if he truly loves her. If love comes with an expectation, then that love is no longer free, unconditional and the intentions behind the love is no longer pure or  true. If the girl returns the love to the guy, then both will be able to move onto a mutual relationship together.<br><br>Love is a very difficult topic to learn in life itself, and it will take most people a couple of years or perhaps a lifetime to truly understand love and displays it graciously. Love is not sex, and neither it is possessive. Love is free...and should be free.<br><br>Good guys should never suggested/pressured/persuaded pre-martial sex before marriage to a girl if he truly loves her. Even when the girl offers pre-martial sex before marriage to a guy, the guy should not accept the offer. Reason is because abusing sex before marriage will not only destroy the purity of the love shared between the guy and the girl, it will also destroy the esteem, dignity, confidence and trust in the relationship. IF any guys accepted pre-martial sex before marriage, then they do not deserved any sympathy for destroying the purest love that a girl can ever provide for a guy...that is her body.<br><br>Guys who can't say no should go masturbate and say NO to the girls that they love.<br><br>And guys who are not able to love a girl unconditionally and graciously should not deserve to be loved or suitable to be in a relationship.<br><br>So I hope that guys will consider responsibly for the girl that they really love  before initiating any form of courtship.<br><br>Good Luck all. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div></blockquote>If everybody thinks like you , Maybe there may even be world peace. But the fact is there arent good guys out there. And the good guys will eventually lose out to the 'bad' guys. I think it more as what kind of person you are will draw what kind of girls. If you eng eng want a certain kind of girl and when u get it... sh|t goes bad then dont go blaming. Same goes with the girl.<br><br>I know to girls , pre-maritial sex sometimes means a lot to them. The whole feeling of feeling she is yours , while i will just... shrug it off as cute talk or sweet talk from the girl. I just hope you guys that have girls like that really treasure and love her lo, cause to her it means alot and how she feels towards you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

You don't give a shit about it but I give my all about it!<br><br>Keeping your virginity for that right person in your life is more of an act on how much you love and trust the person... and sex should come after love, and not before love! Sex should come after marriage and not before marriage!<br><br>Who gave you that kind of mentality to treat the issue of virginity so lightly? Even if the rest of the world takes it lightly and are proud of being able to go through pre-marital sex/one-night-stand once in their lifetime, I think it is something they really ought to be ashamed about! Safeguarding your virginity is not something too primitive or too traditional for us to follow... if you really want to experience true love with your future partner, adhere to what we make a stand for and not be as corrupted as the world...<br><br>A caution to girls out there: Watch out for lecherous guys who are only out there to hunt down innocent girls to go to bed with. They cheat the girls to thinking that only after sex can love be developed... it does not work this way! Please take a stand for yourself and safeguard what belongs to you dearly and not let it be taken away from you that cheaply. To all the ladies in this thread, your virginity is worth safeguarding.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dokono:</div><div class="quote_body">I have been trying to hammer this point all along.<br><br>Girls are not angels. They are not as soft as we make them out to be.<br><br>To be fair, not all are bad. But those who consent to sex on the first date with a guy they hardly know when in fact, they are really attracted to the guy and then to complain she was cheated? Hey, girls are also horny creatures as well.<br><br>No. Sad to say, it doesn't really put them in a good light, like what Focuspoint said in another thread. Such girls are not even worth considering a second look, unless they are for flings. Flings are strictly for flings only.<br><br>Bottomline is, they consented to sex and they only have themselves to answer for it. But don't whine they got emotionally cheated. Hopefully, their next boyfriend doesn't know about it or doesn't mind.<br><br>doko</div></blockquote>Hmmm... actually the reason why some girls can consent to have sex with the guy on their first date is obviously because she placed her trust and love on that guy who convinced her with a pack of lies that he will stay with her if she allowed him to sleep with her that night. These girls are definetely being cheated by those despicable and morally-unsound men. I hope to bring light to women of this age that these kind of guys are not worthy of you... they do not treasure you or your love for them, they just simply bluff you that they love you and steal something precious away from you that will never ever be returned or replaced... They lust for women, and know not what true love between a man and a woman really means or feels like. The girls may or may not be angels, but the guys who cheat them or agree with their requests are certainly baddies!<br><br>It is not right for you to actually call them 'flings', why do you say that they are not worth considering a second look? Since they got the meaning of love totally wrong, someone ought to teach them what true love actually means. Don't make them like some kind of outcast. They are cheated because they felt betrayed of their feelings for the guy! I am not talking about those girls who just seek to sleep with the men they find in pubs or clubs... I am talking about those girls who innocently fall into sexual immorality and do not know how to get themselves out of it. They need help to get out of it, and should not be considered worthless... Even God sees more worth in their lives than how we perceive it to be!<br><br>Before I end... I have something to say to all the ladies and guys in this forum:<br><br>For ladies who had been cheated before in their lives...<br>I really hope you can come back to your feet and stand up in the midst of sadness, grief and regret. Start making a stand for yourself not to carry on sleeping around with any other guys whom you are not married to and determine in your hearts to find that right guy for your life. Be wise and not be cheated ever again! Do not fall back into the same vicious cycle of sexual immorality! You are not bad or dirty, you just need help to come back to your feet. Seeking help from counsellors is a good way to help bring you back on track...<br><br>For ladies who still have their virginity kept with them..<br>I thank you for keeping your virginity safe from all harm (your future husbands will also be thankful too!) and I sincerely hope that you will not fall in any way into sexual immorality. Be wise and do not be cheated by men who are of lecherous intent. I wish you all the best in finding a good man to marry and experience love abundantly with him...<br><br>For guys in this forum...<br>You all ought to really improve and upgrade yourself, especially those who thinks losing virginity is not a big deal - what kind of thinking is that? Learn to respect your fellow sisters (the ladies) and do not allow yourself to fall into sexual immorality. Stop reading all the crappy articles you see n FHM, Maxim and Playboy Magazines - the articles you read in them do not help you get better love lives, they RUIN you! Learn to nurture the true and perfect love to grow within your heart and let not the lust of the eye rule over your judgement of finding the right woman for your lives. It is true love that help bring couples together and bond them together forever. Lust is often mistaken to be love, you do not love a woman full of sex-appeal, you lust over her! Lust is not love, please do not confuse this two points! Lust only keeps a guy and a girl for a night or two, before regret and depression sets in. Be someone upright and shun all evil!<br><br>I hope that I reached my point here in this post, if there are still some of you whom violently object to my 'primitive' way of looking at things, you are really beyond-hope... and I pray that God will open your eyes!</div>

True love needs time to develop and needs the cooperation between both parties to help build a stronger relationship.<br><br><span style="color: red;"><br>In order for love to grow in a relationship, several factors are needed to be found in a relationship in order for it to be successful:<br><br><strong>1) Patience</strong><br>Love needs time to develop, and both parties must have that amount of patience to take time to bring their relationship to the next level.<br><br><strong>2) Care and Concern</strong><br>Caring for one another, staying concerned about your partner's conditions and be ever-ready to help him/her out whenever the need arises.<br><br><strong>3) Mutual Respect</strong><br>Mutual respect is very important in a relationship. Respecting each others' rights in the relationship and not stepping over the line.<br><br><strong>4) Assurance</strong><br>Giving your partner the assurance that you will be with him/her no matter what happens. Assurance is an area of trust that you are giving to your partner that help keeps the relationship on stable ground. Even in the midst of crisis, if you can still assure and place that trust in your partner, your relationship will be stronger than ever before...<br><br><strong>5) Tolerance</strong><br>In any circumstances, especially those that are bad, do tolerate with whatever displeasures your partner is giving you due to his/her moodiness. Do not get angry or frustrated with your partner's attitude but do understand his/her plight and help him/her.<br><br><strong>6) Selflessness (not Selfishness)</strong><br>Selflessness is another crucial factor in a successful relationship, both parties need to be selfless and not selfish in a relationship. You cannot be always the one receiving the love and adoration from your partner and not give love to your partner as well - that is being selfish, where is the mutual love? Give it your all to your partner, no matter how much it will cost you... Doing thigs that may go beyond your conveniences to meet the needs and address the issues that your partner has and/or is going through. </span><br><br>The main point of my post after sharing so much regarding the components needed for love in a relationship, I want to talk more about <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>mutual respect</strong></span>...<br><br>To girls out there, if the guy you are dating requests you to go to bed with him on the night of your first date with him, he is obviously not respecting your rights and he just wants to take advantage with you.<br><br>Don't give him any respect either and just give him one tight slap/splash water on him to wake him up and immediately leave the scene! Such a guy is not worthy of your love and adoration! He does not deserve your love, your attention or your respect because he does not even love or respect you! He is just lusting over you! So do not let them take advantage of you just because you are the 'weaker' party... show them that you are strong and make a stand for yourself!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by rainee:</div><div class="quote_body">When you do give it, make sure you will not regret your action in the future, no matter what happened.

The reason why they do such a foolish act of acknowledging and attempting pre-marital sex is due largely to the fact that they made a rash decision which comes without much thought or consideration. A rash decision usually leads to regret, so it is not that right of you (rainee) to say that since they have decided to do it, they should not regret it.<br><br>I know that one has to face up to their consequences and not run away from it, but surely there is a degree of regret in them for the wrongdoings that they committed which led to the eventual consequences to occur.<br><br>In a relationship, sex is part and parcel of love... it is just one small sector of the entire body of love! That is why sex does not play a very important role in a successful relationship, we mustn't consider sex an option to keep couples 'hot' for one another or to keep the relationship from breaking - it does not work that way!<br><br>In my opinion, love has to come first before sex does... in a successful relationship. Sex never comes before love... Whereas love comes first, then the other sectors of love will start appearing... My view on pre-marital sex is that... the relationship between the two parties sadly does not last, because they failed to understand what love is and how it operates...<br><span style="color: red;"><strong><br>Sex should never be considered a quick-fix method to keep a relationship together!<br><br>Sex is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">never</span> the spark that sets off the love and affection for one another in a relationship!<br><br>Don't listen or follow the lies some magazine articles talk about - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">love always comes first in a lasting relationship</span>, not sex!<br><br>Don't listen to what some people think or say regarding how unimportant virginity is - it is disgraceful to lose it before a marriage! They simply do not understand the importance of virginity! (All their wrong mindsets, mentalities and distorted point-of-views are caused largely due to pornography and materials from sex-related magazines. Shame on them!) Virginity is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">important</span> and should be protected from any harm before a marriage!</strong></span><br><br>Nothing in this world can be compared to the love for one another in a relationship... Only love and the components that helps it to stay strong will see you through a lasting relationship with your partner, nothing else!<br><br>I am very grateful that you have such an understanding and upright boyfriend, rainee... It is quite rare these days to see men who are upright and just. Pre-marital sex is morally wrong because it does not contribute to a healthy, stable and loving relationship between two partners. I am glad that you and your boyfriend understood what it means to love, and not to cross over the boundaries before marriage. May both of you continue to respect one another, and may your love for one another abound still more and more!<br><br>I'll end my post here, any questions or queries... feel free to send me a message or reply to my post!</div>

Though that poor girl's virginity is being restored physically, there is still a psycholoical and emotional virginity that has also been broken, yet it can never be repaired or be replaced.

Do not let just any guy take advantage of you, the consequences of your rash decision or choice are heavy... usually heavy enough to drive someone to utter depression. Make the right choice for youself and your life! Make a stand for yourself and give yourself a set of core values to follow!

For every wrongdoing that you commit, the consequences of your action will be the next in line to come pouncing on you to haunt you and make you suffer! If you decide to collect some 'experience' so that you can have better sex with your loved one - you completely miss the whole point about love!<br><br>Why are you people so distorted in your thoughts regarding love and relationships! As I have already said in my earlier post... sex does not contribute to more love between a couple. Why do you care so much on trying to be a professional in the area of sex? I am terribly disgusted by the way you look at things! What matters most is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> the sex experience which you have collected from previous dates or your professionalism of being able to conduct sex 'effectively'. <strong>What matters most in a relationship is love...</strong><br><br>You (luvelle) think very lowly of people like me who has decided to make a stand to safeguard our virginity for the person we love and marry...

Are you going to go to bars and clubs looking for a potential prey to practise your sexual techniques on so that you can be a professional in the area of sex? That is really disgusting! Knowing the expertise on how to engage in 'hot' sexual-intercourse does not help contribute in creating a lasting relationship with your partner... you are just wasting your time and energy doing something not needed or beneficial in a relationship.<br><br>Things like sex comes part and parcel in a relationship, you do not need to be a rocket scientist to understand the basic procedures of it! Even Adam and Eve (the earliest form of Man) know how to do it, without any form of reference help!<br><br>Keeping one's virginity for the man you marry is an act of giving the very best that you can offer only to the person who really loves you, really adores you, really respects you, and accepts you the way you are...<br><br>Let me give you an analogy: <span style="color: green;"><br>If you are going to give your best friend a present, you will go and buy for him the best gift that you can find that suits him, you will later wrap it up nicely and give it to your best friend.

Along the way while going to give your best friend the gift, some hooligan comes around and tears your gift apart, rendering it rather unsightly to be given to someone special to you... but you still decided to give it to him since you told him to prepare for something special to be given to him... you gave it to him despite how ugly-looking it is and how ruined a gift it has became, he starts to feel very troubled and starts questioning you if you ae really sincere in giving the gift or not...</span><br><br>I am keeping my best for my future wife, and I do hope she keeps hers too! Offering each other our best as a sort of reward both gets for loving choosing each other as our better-halves...<br><br>Before I end... To each his own... If you guys still think virginity is not a big deal, if you guys still think that having the experience and know-how on how to engage in 'hot-sex' is important to your life, I will not force you to change what you feel is correct.
