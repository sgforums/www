He asked for the date. Because you liked him, you accepted the date. He asked you to his place and you consented to sex (without knowing more about him) because you still liked him. There is attraction.<br><br>From the beginning to the end, you caved in because you like him. Don't say you are naive because seriously, you do have the choice to do a check on a guy you hardly know.

People with low self-esteem craves attention, affection, admiration. So sweet-talk is all flattery.  Especially so when a gal is not so pretty, lonely, unwanted ..... along comes Prince Charming (according to fables, PC is ang moh or other ethnicity), says hello to her, invites her out, tells her that she is the love of his life, and then she is in Cloud Nine, ready to <strong>consume</strong> anything, mind, body and sex!
