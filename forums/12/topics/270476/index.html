They are not as soft as we make them out to be.<br><br>To be fair, not all are bad. But those who consent to sex on the first date with a guy they hardly know when in fact, they are really attracted to the guy and then to complain she was cheated? Hey, girls are also horny creatures as well.<br><br>No. Sad to say, it doesn't really put them in a good light, like what Focuspoint said in another thread. Such girls are not even worth considering a second look, unless they are for flings. Flings are strictly for flings only.<br><br>Bottomline is, they consented to sex and they only have themselves to answer for it. But don't whine they got emotionally cheated. Hopefully, their next boyfriend doesn't know about it or doesn't mind.<br><br>doko</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>as a girl, i know many guys cannot empathise with it. when girls make such a mistake, they know that they are not absolved completely from blame. but to them, it's really embarrassing because ppl who are narrow-minded and judgemental might say that they're cheap and stupid. it's ok for the guy who cheated them, 'cos the guy doesn't lose anything what.<br><br>how many guys can honestly say that they dun mind being with a girl who got cheated of sex by a bastard? most of you guys just think that these girls ask for it since they consented. but seriously, kenna conned means tio pian. means she didn't know she shouldn't have trusted the guy. a lot of girls are still very naive. sometimes u guys need to be more sensitive when talking about such stuff, 'cos this leaves a bad mark on the girl. i know 'cos i got friends who kena conned before and until now they still cannot get over it. quite traumatising, really.</div>
