            <div class='col-md body'>2 mths is a little short.  Are you sure you wanna rush into this?  You're still so young.. I've always believed than men who want to have a higher quality, stable life in future shd focus on career first.. and I'm female by the way.  Once you get married, your priorities will change and career options/advancement will be limited for you.. remember that.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Maybe as a girl, she sees opening a joint account it as ok, like a sign of mutual trust and a promise of sorts.. but you are a guy.  You do have to consider the full implications of opening a joint bank account with a girl u just knew for 2 mths :<br><br>- Ask yourself if you're ready to have your finances scrutinized so early in the relationship.  If the answer is maybe or not really, you're not ready.. and you NEED to tell her this.  Just explain that you'd like to take it slowly, to plan further... if she's understanding, she won't push you (at least that will buy you time).<br><br>-  If the answer to the above is yes, do consider opening a seperate, individual account of your own.  She shouldn't try to bug you about that account if she has any respect for you.. if she cannot accept it, she's too insecure - insecurity from either partner can be affect a relationship's future greatly so have a think about it ....<br><br>hope this helps, all the best <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
