            <div class='col-md body'>mod. which part?<br><br>nbm i edit everything into proper english<br><br>The reason behind under the actions of physical abuse from these females of our society could be because of various reasons<br><br>Firstly. These females are unable to find better methods to express their love to the person which they love. Reason behind inability to find better methods maybe due to shy, fear of rejection, Friend is also in love with that particular guy.<br><br>Secondly. The guy who this female love may already be attached. Therefore, their love/sadness get compressed in their heart as time goes by. Reason for compression is due to the fact that they are unable to express their feelings to the GUY as he is already attached and the female do not wish to be a 3rd party into the relationship. When finally the compression in their heart gives way, they feel extremely sad and their inability to rally the courage to express their love and relieve the burden on their heart<br><br>thirdly. When these females finally muster up the courage to express their love to the guy. The guy rejected them due to some particular reason(no interest, another girl in mind, concentrate on studies, juz broke up not in the mood etc) They feel that the guy do not realise that this particular female is the best for them. They also may feel that the guy do not understand and realise the effort they have put into this 'relationship'. In order to gain the acceptance of the guy, they inflict physical abuse to their own body just to PROVE to the guy that they are really in love with him, and her love is 100%.<br><br>The following simple true life conversation explains it all<br>Girl - Mary. Boy - Tom<br>Mary approach Tom<br>Mary - Tom, you wan go steady with me?<br>Tom stunned by her comments<br>Tom - Err. i call you tonight can?<br>Mary taken back by Tom reply and feels anguish<br>Mary - Is there any need for you to think? If you wish to have this relationship, just agree, if u do not wish to have this relationship just reject<br>Tom mind is currently in turmoil. he does not LOVE mary but she may be a good girlfriend. should he. or should he not?<br>Tom - Can give me time to think anot? i tell u later??<br>Mary now feeling sad and angry, gave tom her piece of mind<br>Mary - WHY must u think? AM i unworthy of your love? IF SO. FORGET IT.<br>Mary runs off with tears in her eyes and feeling the sharp pain in her heart<br><br>Due to the fact that MARY has been rejected in her love. She reflects on herself, for some females, they may feel that, Tom need time to think because he dunno how much i love him. as long i show him i LOVE him 100%, he confirm will wan to be with me. therefore Mary will resort to means of inflicting physical abuse to her own body just to prove her love. in wich Tom knowing of this incident will feel totally disgusted. Mary will only sink deeper and deeper into this phyiscal abuse condition.<br><br>I seen this MARY-TOM thing in my own eyes in my secondary school class with my buddy as TOM. Mary came to school with lines on her left wrist and had a heart on her shoulder. i see liao also dunno wad 2 say. TOM after school went to talk to her. she finally understood. luckily for us, she found a better bf.<br><br>Girls. for those in this forum(if there are) do not ever be afraid to talk with ur jie mei about matters of heart. they will be ur BEST support in this period of life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by corebooster:</div><div class="quote_body">mod. which part?<br><br>nbm i edit everything into proper english<br><br>The reason behind under the actions of physical abuse from these females of our society could be because of various reasons<br><br>Firstly. These females are unable to find better methods to express their love to the person which they love. Reason behind inability to find better methods maybe due to shy, fear of rejection, Friend is also in love with that particular guy.<br><br>Secondly. The guy who this female love may already be attached. Therefore, their love/sadness get compressed in their heart as time goes by. Reason for compression is due to the fact that they are unable to express their feelings to the GUY as he is already attached and the female do not wish to be a 3rd party into the relationship. When finally the compression in their heart gives way, they feel extremely sad and their inability to rally the courage to express their love and relieve the burden on their heart<br><br>thirdly. When these females finally muster up the courage to express their love to the guy. The guy rejected them due to some particular reason(no interest, another girl in mind, concentrate on studies, juz broke up not in the mood etc) They feel that the guy do not realise that this particular female is the best for them. They also may feel that the guy do not understand and realise the effort they have put into this 'relationship'. In order to gain the acceptance of the guy, they inflict physical abuse to their own body just to PROVE to the guy that they are really in love with him, and her love is 100%.<br><br>The following simple true life conversation explains it all<br>Girl - Mary. Boy - Tom<br>Mary approach Tom<br>Mary - Tom, you wan go steady with me?<br>Tom stunned by her comments<br>Tom - Err. i call you tonight can?<br>Mary taken back by Tom reply and feels anguish<br>Mary - Is there any need for you to think? If you wish to have this relationship, just agree, if u do not wish to have this relationship just reject<br>Tom mind is currently in turmoil. he does not LOVE mary but she may be a good girlfriend. should he. or should he not?<br>Tom - Can give me time to think anot? i tell u later??<br>Mary now feeling sad and angry, gave tom her piece of mind<br>Mary - WHY must u think? AM i unworthy of your love? IF SO. FORGET IT.<br>Mary runs off with tears in her eyes and feeling the sharp pain in her heart<br><br>Due to the fact that MARY has been rejected in her love. She reflects on herself, for some females, they may feel that, Tom need time to think because he dunno how much i love him. as long i show him i LOVE him 100%, he confirm will wan to be with me. therefore Mary will resort to means of inflicting physical abuse to her own body just to prove her love. in wich Tom knowing of this incident will feel totally disgusted. Mary will only sink deeper and deeper into this phyiscal abuse condition.<br><br>I seen this MARY-TOM thing in my own eyes in my secondary school class with my buddy as TOM. Mary came to school with lines on her left wrist and had a heart on her shoulder. i see liao also dunno wad 2 say. TOM after school went to talk to her. she finally understood. luckily for us, she found a better bf.<br><br>Girls. for those in this forum(if there are) do not ever be afraid to talk with ur jie mei about matters of heart. they will be ur BEST support in this period of life.</div></blockquote>Ok...i'm certified stupid.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br>There are points which i differ. But Well done.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers</div>
