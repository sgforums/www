            <div class='col-md body'>Your case sounded so similar to mine.  I was in a destructive relationship for a whole damn year. He was abusive, scold me in front of his frds, never failed to put me down. My parents disapproved of our r.ship as well cos i'm a uni undergrad but he wasn't highly educated.<br><br>He treated me like sh**..always asking his frds if i looked better than his ex or worse, compare me with his pal's gf. I was suicidal. Didnt dare to break up, cos like u, i had the teeniest glint of hope. Hoping he would change, hoping he would treat me like he did during the honeymoon period.<br><br>But believe me, they will never change. I managed to muster all my courage &amp; broke up. I felt such great relief. Not the slightest regret. You would be better off. Really. You might not think so now but u will in future.<br><br>Take care gal.</div>

Obviously he thinks he's got you now, so he's dispensed with all the niceties.. please prove him wrong.<br><br>Perhaps my story might help you decide.  My mother was from a very wealthy, influential family with an educated background.  Her family disapproved of it.  She inherited her family business and married my father, a poor car salesman with many siblings, even though he showed problem signs.  He grew abusive shortly after that and began to exploit her weaknesses.  He threaten our lives constantly, hours on end (at knifepoint), chased away business and blew exorbitant sums of money on mistresses, wine &amp; dining, luxury cars.  My mother could not leave him and risk our lives.  Even the police could not help.  "Family affairs not our concern" they said.  My dad had to commit the crime before they would intervene.  HAH!  And now my mother lost her business, is bankrupt, and is still picking up the pieces of her life.<br><br>I don't wish for anyone to suffer the same fate.  So, I wish you all the best, be strong, do what's best for you and leave your toxic boyfriend, while you can.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: violet;">Thank you everyone for your advices and concern... Some have been harsh while others have put it in nicer words, but the ultimate advice would be to break up with him..<br><br>Recently he has been nicer to me, ever since he's been winning from the worldcup betting. Stopped taking money from me, and even brought me to eat Swensens with his friend and the gf... Feeling so confused because the hope is appearing again.<br><br>Actually, there was once I did not contact nor meet him for nearly a week, and he didn't contact me either. I felt I was growing a little stronger, but one night he called me to inform me he got into a road accident (bike buang)... I went down to hospital with his friends. and from then on things have improved...<br><br>I really don't know what should I do cuz I'm not sure if I should believe in that gleam of new found hope... Sometimes I really wish to 24/7 take down our lives on video and let ppl judge whether its me or him that is the problem. hais! I'm always getting blamed for things that went wrong. why?<br><br>But then I miss him when we are not in contact... </span></div>

Know more ppl. You dun need to make any choices as he is not your spouse...... he is juz a companion in one part of your life thats all or what you will call more than a friend.<br><br>As a boyfriend he is already so irresponsible, how can you depend on him and spent the rest of your life with him. WHen you have drawn to this conclusion..... Move on and contribute to the world , your family and your friends more........<br><br>Here is something for ya.....<br><br>The Right One...<br><br>Somebody once told me that, "Finding the right person is very hard and very wrong..."<br><br>It is best to be the right person for the one you love and start from there... you'll always end up disappointed when you set standards and define a "right person" for you... and don't rush things coz somewhere somehow God is preparing somebody for you."<br><br>Don't be in a hurry to get into a relationship because you can never find love if you insist that you are already into it.<br><br>Try to find time to really understand your real feelings, to know who you really are, and what you really want in a relationship.<br><br>You're right, there's no such thing as a perfect relationship, but there's a compatible partnership that goes along with it.<br><br>If you already knew that you're too big to fit into a small sized t-shirt, don't give it a try.<br><br>You'll probably break it and pay for the damages you have made.<br><br>If you knew and felt that the relationship will not last, don't go deeper into it.<br><br>You'll just suffer the consequences and live like hell for the rest<br>of your life.<br><br>It's really hard to say goodbye though, but you can't make it any better by just pretending you still have the same feelings.<br><br>Try to let go and give yourself a chance to live life to the fullest.<br><br>Give yourself a chance to grow and give your heart a much needed attention. Then you will find that you have made the right decision and you made it all by yourself.<br><br>We call it love when we can't leave someone and see them crying as we try to let go. We are wrong, it's just pity.<br><br>We call it love when we're too attached and to think that losing the one we love will somehow make us weak and unable to face the storms of life. We misunderstood, its just that we're too dependant on them.<br><br>We call it love when we give our whole life to them, the wholeness of us and, imagined that if they leave, no one would accept us and our past. We are mistaken, its just insecurity.<br><br>But no matter what the definition is, the truth still remains that, love isn't something you can buy or beg.<br><br>It is real and existing.<br><br>You can't touch it but you can feel it in your heart.<br><br>You can't find it, but it will knock before you when you least expect it to come.<br><br>It can make you the happiest soul in heaven, but don't forget that it can also make you the most miserable person in the whole galaxy...<br><br></div>
