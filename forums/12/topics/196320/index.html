You shld know very well that in the modern society of Spore, paper value places an important part in our lives. Do you wanna live a comfortable life or do you wanna slog thru your life?<br><br>*I'm not looking down on those lowly educated ppl, but it's a painful fact that they have to face the reality in order to lead a comfortable life in Spore. And when i meant by comfortable life, it means that there's no need to worry abt financial difficulties. Your parent, for sure do not want their daughter to slog thru her life.<br><br>2ndly. why does he want to borrow money from you? 3k is not a very big amount of money, but is definetely very useful when you'll to need it. To you, it may sounds alright for lending money to your bf whom you love very much...but not returning back your money which he owned you is not right.<br><br>3rdly, if he can scold you vulgarities now, what makes you think that he won't beat you up in another year's time? Imagine yourself in one more year's time... (You've only been with him for less than 2yrs n looks like he doesn't cherish you...)<br><br>Your friends, for your own sake n well being, are giving you good advices...Of coz, it doesn't come easy for you to break it up with him coz you're a very affectionate girl....However so, this does not gives you the reason of staying with him with that kinda treatments he has given you so far...<br><br>As always said by many ppl, it takes two hands to make a claps...<br><br>When you say you love him n dote him....a typical question will be asked n you need to ask yourself, 'What do you love him about?'<br><br>Also, one very important thing you need to know which will answer your question of 'Why this kinda things always happen to me de??', &gt;&gt;&gt; It's your life....you've the every right n authority to choose how your life's going to be...what decision you've to make for your life....No one can ever make a decision on your life, perphaps your parent...but your parent won't be pressing so hard on you, otherwise, i doubt you n ur bf can still stay for these period of time...<br><br>Cool down...go to the beach alone, look at the sea n sky, ask yourself....Do you wan to lead on with this current relationship n your life or shld you make a decision for yourself towards a life which you seek for..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

I really don't even dare to think about it. And I don't think dropping hints is an effective solution because he already knows he's hurting me. Sometimes when I'm angry or crying, he just tells me to "just go and be angry/sad all you want, and don't irritate me anymore"...</span><br><blockquote>Originally posted by gohkatkatoh<br>forgot to say this......most guys in singa have been through army.....and in the army...they grill you with the words like fcuk and all those crude languages.......so just listen ....but do not take to heart.....</blockquote><span style="color: violet;">He's already been used to these vulgarities even before army. But the problem is he used to abstain from swearing and smoking in front of me. But somehow as time pass he seems to think that he doesn't have to respect me anymore, doing all that he likes without caring how I feel. But I really don't understand why all these is happening, cuz i dare say I treat him well. Should I say too well? I give in to all the arguments so that he will not be unhappy anymore. When he's unhappy he always take me for a punching bag, but when I'm unhappy I have to keep it inside me and not show it.

Why do I always attract ah beng guys de? ppl say I look ah lian. but i am not. and i don't speak vulgarities or broken eng all dat. =( don't smoke don't club don't gamble. www.wishinguponstaries.blogspot.com<br>www.princess-starlet.blogspot.com</span><br><blockquote>Originally posted by dcx<br>Cool down...go to the beach alone, look at the sea n sky, ask yourself....Do you wan to lead on with this current relationship n your life or shld you make a decision for yourself towards a life which you seek for.....  </blockquote><span style="color: violet;">I'm quite dependent on him, don't go places on my own de... suddenly feel so lost, like a xiao meimei in an adult world where I'm not supposed to be. and $3000 is alot to me, its my life's hongbao money.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Honeymoon period just one year??? That's too short, give this man up and before that get your $3K back. Is better to donate it to SPCA, those animals than to him. Bear in mind in future, don't lend anybody money no matter how good both of you are. Money is the root of all evil. Treating men need technique, is not that you treat them good then they will reciprocate. In fact they may take for granted, remember they are hunter, they need sense of excitement.</div>

Honeymoon period has been over long ago, and for months, I have found myself engaging in quarrels with him almost every other day.<br><br>He used to be so sweet and gentle to me Â– whispering on the phone, caring about my wellbeing, bringing me home every single time we meet up etc.<br><br>But now, fourteen months down the road, he seems like a totally different person. He doesnÂ’t respect me anymore. Scolding me vulgarities whenever he likes. Like ch**bye fcuker bitc* etc.<br><br>I really love him, and put a lot into this relationship. Friends tell me he is using me but somehow I just cannot bring myself to believe this. He borrows money from me all the time, now totalling up to more than $3k and he never ever returns them.<br><br>We come from very different background. I am quite educated, and my parents disapprove of our relationship actually. He is a very typical ah beng. So actually I am really not sure what the future holds for us. But as I've mentioned, I really love him and dote on him. Friends all tell me to stop wasting my time and to break up all that. But it is much easier said than done  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>What should I do? My ex boyfriend also treated me very badly, after months of debating with myself, I finally took the courage to break up with him. But he came back after all. I didnt want to patch, and he threatened suicide twice. Why this kinda things always happen to me de??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Please help! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </span></div></blockquote>Seriously, get out of the relationship girl. There is no point putting yourself in an abusive relationship because it will slowly erode away your self-confidence and self-respect if you continue letting him abuse you.<br><br>It is not easy. It won't be easy but you will have to be strong.<br><br>At the same time, DO NOT LEND him anymore money. It is like 100% you will have to write does off as bad debts. Cut your losses now, both emotionally and money wise.<br><br>You may be educated but not streetsmart.<br><br>Anyway, was in kinda similar relationship as you before. I moved on. Yes he threatened sucide, call up at weird times at night and started stalking. Seek support from your close friends. If your friends know him, get them to call him to tell him off. He will think twice if he knows that you have strong support from your friends.<br><br>Btw I was in the relationship for 3 years before he became abusive verbally and resorting to emotional blackmail. It's a good thing too because our relationship might have proceeded further.<br><br>Anyway, be strong.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
