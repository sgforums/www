Shouldn't 'ok times' be a NORM instead of something wondrous?<br><br>You have invested far too much and your fear revolves partially around this failed investment that is causing you much liability to maintain. Whatever ray of hope you may delude yourself, thinking that everything will turn out well is like praying for a miracle for this liability to transform into assets - to restore your loses.<br><br>That's impossible - considering you can't even 'break-even'. It has become a sunk cost.<br><br>Cut your loses and learn what has gone wrong, instead of finding what's wrong while you bleed heavily.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Instead of breaking up, they rather the relationship dissolves "naturally." They do this by purposely treating their GF badly and expecting their gf to break up with them. That way he does not need to feel guilty about it.<br><br>Relationships are not like that, like what you are going through.<br><br>When you hear about people successfully working out problems in a relationship; the problem is usually of an external source. It is not a problem with each other and the relationship itself.<br><br>That is to say, both parties love each other but there are some problems affecting the relationship like finance or parental objections. When they resolve these "external" problems then they successfully continue their relationship till old age.<br><br>I know of a couple who fought constantly during courtship and kept on breaking up. Finally they got married and divorced after having 2 kids.<br><br>Sucessful relationships are easy. It is almost boring if you know what I mean. There are no major quarrels and any minor quarrels, both sides try to resolve it immediately and it gets solved in no time.<br><br>So you see, even if you manage to get this bf to marry you, you will probably end up in the divorced courts.<br><br>Remember this; when people talk about working hard at a relationship, they are not talking about working hard at liking each other.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>shining*star, as you have said, you are educated.<br><br>Regarding your current relationship, honestly, whether or not he is making use of you, and whether or not there is a future for both of you, i guess it is more than obvious and im sure you urself know it.<br><br>Somethings are indeed easier said than done, but it is really not that hard if it is your life you are talking about. Two scenerios:<br>1) You stick with him, start working, lend him more money only to be abused.<br>2) You leave him, cry the shit out of yourself, then move on with life.<br><br>If it is hard to leave him, then stick with him, and all the consequences that are to come with that decision. Ultimately, it is your life so live it and don't regret.<br><br>=======================================================<br><br>Then it comes to that wonderful "EX" of yours.<br><br>Suicide? let him die. If he doesnt treasure his own life, why bother about his life FOR him? He deserves to die.<br><br>Remember, if you have to marry him to stop him from dying, you have already suicided the next half of your life. So it is either YOU die...or HE dies.<br><br>But then thinking back, since he wants to die, why don't you just let HIM die. He gets what he wants, so do you, PERFECT. =)<br><br>=======================================================<br><br>Once again, decision of your life can only be made by you. One life, live it well.
