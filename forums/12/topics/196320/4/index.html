"<br><br>As for relationships, I prefer to to think of relationships as essential. It is not "essential" only in the sense that you will not go into hospital and need ICU attention when you break up. You can form relationships with some other or have some other types of relationship. For an abundant life, you need relationships; relationships with bf/gf, friends, cousins, father, mother, uncles, aunties... and yes, relationship with God too.</div>
