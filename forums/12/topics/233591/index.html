            <div class='col-md body'>No worries there..... Paying employees their salaries is top priority under the law for companies. If the co owes you too long, you cab demand for salary payment through the Ministry of Manpower. But the process is quite a lengthy &amp; troublesome one. But there's no chance of the company avoiding payment of your salary if it is still a live company. So if co kena wound up..... good luck! The process will be even more lengthy and difficult. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>If you need further advice, pm me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
