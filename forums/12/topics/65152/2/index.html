            <div class='col-md body'>First a confession, the gal as per mentioned is me. I know most of the people here already know but IÂ’m just saying it so it is easier for me to reply the post.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Yunhaier, this is a shortened version of my original reply that was lostÂ… <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Yunhaier:</div><div class="quote_body">Ok, I am pretty sure you don't understand this in full.<br><br>The Woman Law of Love has absolutely nothing to do with how she treat Love, how she likes to be treated, etc. Nobody minds having to love and be loved of course. Kinda difficult to explain really, but anyway here a little clue: Woman are affected by Romance because its the nature's glue of physical effort for attraction to foster and grow. When a man fell in love with a woman, he will go the extra mile to make her fall. Romance exist because of The Chase for The Chase exuded forms of Romance - though different people expressed them differently. Without the chase, you can't find romance. Friendship don't give romance because if it does, it weakens friendship.<br></div></blockquote>ErhemzÂ… The Woman Law of Love seems pretty profound. Where can I get more information about this? I have not seen it in any of the books I read.<br><br>I agree with what you said about romance but it also makes me conclude that romance is a weapon of deceit. But women are still swept off their feet by itÂ… LOL.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">The Woman's Law of Love is explained by:<br>Love is like playing in the rain<br>Has been disregarded and taken for granted,<br>But when that rain stopped over,<br>People begin to remember<br>How fun it was<br>And they want it to experience it again.<br><br>Its is the subconscious womanly instinct that will build upon them after they explore their first love.<br></div></blockquote><span style="font-style: italic;">Love is like playing in the rain</span><br>If rain = blessings (in some culture it is considered so), then I would agree, for Love is a blessing.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Has been disregarded and taken for granted</span><br>Not all take Love as disregarded and for granted.

But we seldom do that after he went overseas to study and broke my trustÂ…<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"> But when that rain stopped over,<br>People begin to remember<br>How fun it was<br>And they want it to experience it again. </span><br><br>I agree too.

I admit I am guilt of this wrongdoing thus time to straighten my life.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Its is the subconscious womanly instinct that will build upon them after they explore their first love.</span><br>Is it the same with guys?

Because of two things:<br><br>I) Karmic bonds with one another instill great chemistry/feelings/attractions between one another.<br><br>II) Nature. Man and woman. Yin and Yang. Man are chasing them because of biological and spiritual needs. In love, we are constantly looking for our Twin Self. An analogy would be if I have a mysterious key, I would be sourcing for the lock I could open. When Twin Self come together in a relationship - people experience what the folk calls it True Love. This theory is often mistaken because people feel 'True Love' effect (TLE), but in the end, it turns out to be terrible suffering. TLE is very similiar to karmic love and lust (This form of lust is catergorized under the inability to differentiate Love and Lust. You may 'feel' that you are loving someone under the Effect of Lust.)<br></div></blockquote>I am lost in all that karmic bond jargon.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>TLE: Agreed<br><br>True Love: I thought faithfulness, devotion, selflessness, sacrifice, support, giving, care, concern, wanting the best for the other person, being there for him, hope and patience were the components of True Love, but IÂ’m proven wrong. In your opinion, what is true love?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"></div><div class="quote_body">No sweat yeah?<br><br>Cheers<br></div></blockquote>Erhmz.. Lots of sweat! But thanks for taking the effort to post your replies.<br><br>I started to reflect upon my past relationship and am making some headway. As of now, what I know is:<br><br>a) I am stupid.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>from this i conclude there is no good reason why a woman should be with a man...</strong></blockquote>Everyone in this life search for their Twin Self. This comes in a form of another human being regardless of whether is a male or female. (Here's a little complication. People who are gay/lesbian seek for the same gender. So how could this be? - Really, another long story to post, another day bah) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Seriously, its about paying and repaying. Harmonious love or conflicting ones. If we see our final marriage (the last person you stop at marriage), as our final destination, the steps are the process we go through. Each level we reached, represents a higher cosmic conscious we got enlighten and of course, the ending of the old chapter. Once we reach level 3, there is no reason and possibility that we should walk down back to level 1 again. In fact, is no longer possible.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> We matured and our thinking/personality evolved.<br><br>Some steps are longer than the others (Refering to short-lived relationship to longer ones). Comparing the 12,346 steps we took to reach the level say 6, and the 15 steps in level 5 - which one leave greater impact in our life? (A two weeks relationship or a 3 years relationship has more impact?)<br><br>Some steps are spiral because the direction in love is so fogged. We can't see the top and it seemed that we are going in circles. (Problems and emotions always clouds the mind/heart). Many a times we chose to leave the spiral stairs and blame ourselves why in the first place we took that route - well, it seemed pretty and unique wor, spiral leh. But when we go through it ourselves, it seemed otherwise. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>When we under-go break-patch relationship, each time we break and patch, there is stagnant in our progress. We walk hundreds of steps up and back down again repeatedly. At first we tell ourselves, its totally ok because we liked that level. But as it goes on: we get very tired. So tired that your vision only has that level. Furthermore, you slip off and injured yourself badly. You feel that say Level 5 is the best and you refuse to move to Level 6.<br><br>'Please lor yunhaier, Level 5 has the lighting and Level 6 is pitch-dark,' (Future can't be seen, people stay around for security reasons) - I rather hang around this level.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> In the end, we discovered that our relationship plight comes from our own decision.<br><br><blockquote><strong>erhmz.. actually i let my ex/relationship go. i admit his neglect of me made it easier to let him go but it still hurt none the less. I had known for some time my relationship will and should end but i still chose to love him. i could sense his heart is changed and is no longer willing to settle down. so does that mean he is my true love? that is a scary thought. </strong></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> No you got me wrong. This is when the relationship is on the declining mode. You left him go because you have to unless you wish to inflict suffering and pain into your mind.<br><br>When a woman accepts a man (vice vista) - she doesn't automatically loves him totally/truely/fully/completely. It takes time for this love to foster and blossom. Time passed and he/she is able to achieve that - we feel that we can't live without that person. He is our 'THE ONE.' <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In this situation: if you able to release him regardless of events - you achieve my definition of true love. (You don't have to leave him, you smile and respect his decision IF HE WANTS TO LEAVE. Love has changed us - what we would love to possess and keep, we would want to see blessing and happiness bestow upon them if it was their choice and it is what they want.)<br><br>This is the definition.<br><br><blockquote><strong>I think man are hard creatures to understand. when u are there for him, he treats u like grass. when u walk away, he treat u like gold</strong></blockquote>Poor communicators in relationship brings about this effect - when you had the chance to talk and solve problems mutually, you don't want. When you don't have that chance anymore, you think back and discovered that you could save the relationship if you had done the former.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote><strong>karmic debt?!?! *blur*. i don't believe in retribution leh.. i believe i can be forgiven...  </strong></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Not retribution like the Buddism theory. Our relationship has invisible bonds that keep us together karmically.
