            <div class='col-md body'>i think we have all heard about "the more one tries to forget, the more he or she will remember".<br><br>friends of her can always advise her to take up several activities, slog in her work and meet up more friends to keep her mind so occupied that she has no time to think about what she doesnt wanna remember.<br><br>these are the practical propositions but i believe we are not dealing with the cause of the problem here.<br><br>there has to be a point of time when she gets lonely or encounter something that subconsciously recalls the past.<br><br>as such, the proper solution here is how one should learn to accept that what's done is done and accept it as a history.<br><br>if she cannot bring herself to think like that, she will forever be at the same state.<br><br>but one thing's for sure. time will heal. no, there is no standard duration to the question but time will heal.</div>
