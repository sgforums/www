              <p>Confess , but tell her you are unsure about it :) At the same time, ask her how she feel. If shes sure she doesn't like you, or no feelings or whatever negative, let it go. Since you are unsure about ur feelings still.If she also likes you, ask her if both on you should be tgt. And ask her to give u some time to think about it</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sometimes, is better to let go off things which is impossible, don't make yourself suffer.</p>

              <p>Ohh.. sorry ppl, was busy for these few days, so dint really see the posts up to now. Thanks everyone for your comments. Well.. Actually, we were already friends for quite some time, in poly times to be exact(Now we have both grad). And i have had a liking for her since then. But she had a bf in the past, so i decided to let go.</p>
              <p>But as time goes by, we started to contacted each other once more, and got closer this time round. It kinda re-ignite the feelings i had for her in the past. So i decided to tell her i like her. I donno if the right choice, but she makes me feel like doing everyting i can, just to be able to see her smile. Haha.. Silly har.</p>

              <p>ok... fr a girls' point of view:</p>
              <p>DO NOT CONFESS yet.... u will stun the girl.. and seriously things will not be the same anymore. however u can try to drop hints 1st. until u sure she is a little interested =)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>fr a guys' point of view:</p>
              <p>as some have mentioned, no guts no glory.... but the girl will feel u are moving too fast n pressuring her to make a DECISION. which might backfire...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so whether u wan to think for the girl or u wan to tink for urself... up to u =)</p>

              <p>make friends with her, know her inside out. once then, if you think she is perfect for you, ask her out. if she shows sign that she likes you, then confess.... i'm a guy and i did just that. if she is not what you're looking for, don't break the friendship, just know another person and still be friends with her... you will never know if she may like you in the end???</p>
