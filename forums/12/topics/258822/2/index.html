I think a lot of folks are too quick to see idolatry and other supposed sins where that's not really happening."</strong><br><br>Yes, majority of us do that without thinking about our own idolatry perception or misconception. I looked at the 'Kiblat' as a form of connection of "Insaf" or repentance. All the Moslems would look at it as a congregational meeting point for them to see the Image of One God and One "Ummat" or Believers of Islamic Faith, devoting themselves to Allah. The picture (praying mattress) of the 'Kabbah' is layout in front of those Moslems during their prayers and they must face the direction or 'Kiblat' for this meeting of poignant repentance. This is to let them see Mecca or Holy Land in Saudi Arabia and I must emphasized here, it is not the domain of Allah. The forms of their thoughts during praying is not to see that the 'Kabbah' is their idol or a place where Allah lives but it is a form of managing their faith as One Mankind in the Teaching of Prophet Mohammad ways and Allah, which is stated very clearly in the Al Qur'an. Nobody in the Islamic World would take that Kabbah as a stone of 'Insaf' until they see what Prophet Mohammad had seen inside that 'Kabbah' himself when he destroyed all the idols within it. It is a formula for them to see themselves as 'Insan' or created beings with flaws and Allah is their Master, King and Ruler of Mankind in the seen and unseen world throughout the whole universe.<br><br>I'm watching while you read and write...<br><br>Joe<br></div>

If you were to indulge in that spiritual law with your belief alone, then it will be another spiritual law that will branch out from there, sooner or later. Some other Teachers and Masters will improved its precepts and insights. It is a fact when you look back, as far back as 2000 years ago or more. It is just like when Jesus brought that knowledge of Fatherly Love and what it was or is. Many Jews were caught by surprised of His Teachings.<br><br>In Spiritual termed, I will call that non-existence spiritual law as LIVING AND LOVE all LIFE as much as you can. Coming together as One Human Kind is one law that we should try to fulfil, if it is possible. It is a spiritual law that does not involves Orthodox and Doctrinaires adherence alone but more to The Moral Laws that we need to amend as time pass day by day throughout the ages.<br><br>With Love,<br>Joe<br><br><strong>"Let us be patient; the truth never suffers from honest examination."</strong><br></div>

It is the human being that makes it unpure. About Kufr...this is an Arabic word that described a non-Moslem or a Moslem who does not believe in Allah. I can also regard you as Kufr should I am a Moslem who believes in Allah, that is not BIAS. He has no forms or shapes or name or human behaviour. He has only pure Light or An Nur and He is the essence of Life in everything in this world and the next. Can you see that my brother.<br><br><strong>You </strong>wrote:<br><br><strong>"If we are Muslims we can tolerate the kuffar but not support them."</strong><br><br>I think you should not see their faith or religion but help them by seeing them as a mankind that have a good intention to promote harmony with other religions and ethnics.<br><br><strong>You</strong> wrote:<br><br><strong>"So tomorrow, if they build a temple, will Muslims support them to build one fiinancially?"</strong><br><br>If you live in a society of multi-racial with multi-religion, I would say this to you, "WHY NOT?" This would only promote better co-operation and it makes a strong statement here that every religion teaches Good Principles or Moral and Good God. If they wish to help Moslems build a Mosque, would you reject their help then?<br><br><strong>You </strong>wrote:<br><br><strong>"Where are our limits?"</strong><br><br>There are no limits my brother, because you have chosen that only a Moslem should help a Moslem. That is your limitation my brother but not mine or others who are like myself or those who are from other faiths beside Islam.<br><br><strong>You</strong> wrote:<br><br><strong>"Yes, we are living multi-religious community, there are many ways to live peacfully with Non-Muslims, it is not be done by supporting them this way."</strong><br><br>I feel that Jamiyah Singapore has shown Moslems in Singapore and outside Singapore that Moslems of Singapore are functioning as a member of a family and as a Nation. If I have a sibling who is a Christian and Hindu, should they asked for my help, financially or in matters of promoting good relationship within a family, should I ignore them.<br><br>As a Father or Mother of children with different faith, would you like to see your children asunder just because each of them has a different principles of philosophy or religion.<br><br>Wassalam.<br><br>Zulkifli Mahmood (Joe)<br><br><strong>Anwar Pillay </strong>&lt;<a href="http://anwarp@singnet.com.sg" rel="nofollow">anwarp@singnet.com.sg</a>&gt; wrote:<br><br>Well said Bro Zul<br><br>I totally agree with you.<br><br>I am a Muslim convert and my siblings are either Hindu, Catholic or Protestant.

My late mother was from Chinese origin but she was given away to a childless Javanese Moslem couple for her own safety during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore in WW2. She was raised by this couple and converted to Islam and became their adopted daughter. My late father was a Malay.<br><br>I have six siblings. My eldest brother is married to a Chinese Christian and he converted to Christianity. My second elder brother is married to a Thai national and she was formerly a Buddhist and converted to Islam. My eldest sister is married to an Algerian and both of them are Moslems. My second elder sister is married to a Chinese Christian and he converted to Islam. My third elder sister is married to an Indian and she converted to Hinduism. I am married to a Malay. My youngest brother is still a bachelor and what I know was that he had a Japanese girlfriend. So...I just like to wonder sometimes whether inter-marriages for Moslems or other religion believers in this world with other ethnics and faiths would actually promotes better understanding, harmony and peace among mankind. I reckon it will.<br><br>Thanks for your understanding Brother Anwar.<br><br>Wassalam and best regards.<br><br>With Love,<br>Zulkifli Mahmood (Joe)<br></div>
