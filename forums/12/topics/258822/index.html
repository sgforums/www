            <div class='col-md body'>Religion ?  you can live without it.<br><br>patgoh<br><br>(There are some very insightful postings in our forum about religion but I think it is not nice to place the link here.)<br><br>Copy and paste 1 of them here :<br><br><blockquote><br><br><strong>Uncle Lai, let me try to humor you, please.<br><br>Lai CF wrote:<br><br>if you are not of the Book, you are an Unbeliever</strong>.<br><br>If you believe in The Book, then you should also believe that Adam and<br>Eve were the first couple or humans created by God. And they bore<br>two sons, Cairn and Abel. When Cairn killed Abel, God punished him<br>into exile east of Eden. There he met a girl and have children. How<br>come suddenly one girl came out of nowhere? Because the story teller<br>at that time never thought that his people were so smart la.<br><br><strong>Quote:<br><br>If you are not borne Jewish, you cannot be saved.</strong><br><br>If God only created the Jews, then who created the Negroes, the Russians,<br>the Chinese, the Malays, the Indians, Red Indians, Polynesians, etc.?<br>If God also created all the rest, why The Book never say so?<br>Even if it is true God created all the rest, then why he only wants to<br>save the Jews, not all the rest? Because the story teller never traveled<br>outside his well, so the thought of the existence of other races could<br>never cross his mind la.<br><br><strong>Quote:<br><br>But those Taosits, Buddhists, are there any Gods to them?  </strong><br><br>The Taoists believe in the Heavenly Jade Emperor as the Supreme God,<br>with countless numbers of big gods and small gods, demi-gods, angels,<br>asuras, spirits, ghosts, spirits, etc. etc. etc.<br><br>The Buddhists believe in the one and only Buddha and His Teachings.<br>The Buddha taught that there are six types of beings, i.e. gods,<br>semi-gods, human beings, animals, ghosts or spirits and hell-beings.<br>The gods reside in 37 heavens and in each heaven, there are different<br>types of gods. But all these gods will die also once their time is up,<br>though they can live for millions of years.<br><br><strong>Quote:<br><br>Is savage men "atheist", not knowing gods?  </strong><br><br>Savage men also believe in gods of the sun, moon, mountains, rivers,<br>trees, rocks, etc. etc. etc.<br><br><strong>Quote:<br><br>If God created everything, are living organisms "atheist" simply they do<br>not know God?  </strong><br><br>Living organisms are born from 4 different kinds of births: womb-birth,<br>egg-birth, heat-and-moisture-birth and spontaneous birth.<br>That would include bacteria, germs, microbes, viruses, protozoa, amoeba,<br>etc. They are usually parasites. They need a host to survive. So, in the<br>end, either they destroy the host of the host destroys them. If God had<br>created them, how come God so cruel?<br><br><strong>Quote:<br><br>Or God is the sole preserve of Man?<br>And if it is, then isn't it is Man created God, not Beast of the field, Beast of the Forest, Denizen of the Sea? </strong><br><br>Is that your final answer, Uncle Lai?<br><br>If it is, I fully agree with you that it is Man that had create the concept of<br>having a Creator God. The Book is nothing but a collection of fables to<br>indoctrinate and frighten the uneducated people of ancient times into<br>obedience and submission to the Authority, probably a very cunning<br>person who must be very lazy to find food for himself and who wanted to<br>manipulate and control everyone else to his will. That was the beginning<br>of dictatorship, despotism and tyranny. And it went on for one generation<br>after another, until today. If LKY were to live a few thousand years ago,<br>he could have been mistaken as a God, even more superior than<br>Abraham, Moses, Jesus, etc.<br><br>According to The Buddha's teachings, the gods also desire to become<br>human beings, because Man is the most precious thing on Earth. Only<br>Man can become a Buddha. And when you become a Buddha, you<br>are out of the 6 realms of beings forever. You won't have to take any<br>more rebirths. Thats why it is called "Rinpoche", meaning Most Precious.<br><br></blockquote></div>

If in the relationship to my parents I was only seeking gratification and comfort as a son dependent on them, now it cannot be anymore. Because God/truth is calling me out of my blood ties, my home, my luxurious living and is asking me to head towards Him/it.<br><br>Nevertheless, I still have a responsibility towards my parents. But my belief cannot be a stupid belief where I call myself Pastafarin and my parents call themselves Sushinist and we slaughter each other psychologically/emotionally. I understand I have to love them regardless, while finding my own way out of my own struggles.<br><br>You have my support MrSotong!<br></div>
