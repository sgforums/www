            <div class='col-md body'>It has been long since we last met and I can see you are leading a very good life now baby. Although I am not laughing and celebrating my rejoice, there was peace in my inner soul. At least, I knew what I did was farking good for you. I thought for the greater good and I knew that my idealogy was right. I acted evil and I knew it was good for you. Chances are, at that time, the world had an second opinion about me, but their preception meant nothing to me - I knew what I had to do.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> What is love?<br><br>I acted, thought and react upon your behalf. That is my love to you.<br><br>Everything went according to what I had knew about love, relationship and its effect. I knew much, which sets in a premium standard I have to impose on myself. I thought I knew all things, but in fact I knew nothing. Time passed and I learned that you were the catalysis and the founder of my discovery. I had to begin somewhere; fate clings you to me.<br><br>Five previous lives incarnation - is what we had once before. Karmic debts and cosmic lesson must be repaid I guess. *Sigh*<br><br>I ask myself am I happy to learn about this, my answer came up to be.....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I have to do what I know would be farking good for her. Anything else, doesn't matter.<br><br>P.S: Yes, there is nothing wrong with me. I just need to pen this down somewhere first before I re-enter into CloUdiSm remix III.<br><br>Cheers</div>
