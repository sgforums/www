Instead, they are usually happen because 2 individual feel that they can no longer carry on, bound to each other by faith. But feelings lives on, sometimes hidden in a corner of your heart, but nevertheless, very much alive.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In all the 2 years we're together, I've never felt that I 'own' him. Love is just not 'owning'. I gave (past tense*sad*)him space to grow and encouraged him to pursue the things that he likes. I always believe that in a relationship, each must compliment each other, they should help each other to grow and bloom.<br><br>Now, he has chose to leave me. Hard as it is, I can only accept that. All that I know I can do is to hope that fate will bring us together again.<br><br>It is his reasons that I find it very difficult to accept...he said that he wants to be alone. Be alone from what? Me?<br><br>In all the 2 years that we've been together, we've never had a major quarrel. Our relationship was (arghs, past tense) based on trust and understanding each other. If either one of us wanted a certain thing to be done a certain way, we'll comprimise.<br><br>Now, I simply don't know anymore. I still love him. I asked him if he loved me. He didn't say no, he didn't say yes. He said he doesn't know.<br><br>He's flying off for some training next month for 3 months. He maybe flying off for 2 years for training as well. I've told him that I will wait for him and I know that I can. But, I just don't know why he's brushing me off...<br><br>So sad.</div>
