              <p>I'm 18, a poly student. Not long ago I finally went to seek help, saw a psychiatrist and he diagnosed me with dysthymia, more specifically, double depression. This has been affecting me for years...and I have social anxiety as well. I skipped classes because I couldn't handle the thought of having to meet a class of people, and there's the fear that I would be called up to answer a question in class so I didn't go..and when I was asked, I began to perspire.That fear is horrible..I would just stone in class. It's as good as not going, because I cannot listen and absorb anything...</p>
              <p>It's just so damn hard to get things going...I've tried, thrown myself outside of my comfort zone to tackle my social phobia but it just keeps on coming back...I'm on antidepressants, supposed to go for talk theraphy too but as it's not subsidised I can't afford it. &amp; no one in my family knows about my condition, because I already tried telling but no one believed me. Only led to quarrels. Family situation is screwed anyway, I give up on this relationship. I'm not close to anyone of them.</p>
              <p>It's not because I don't want to work hard, why can't anyone believe me..and who can really understand...I'm so tired</p>
              <p>I've asked some people what's the point of living. They say it's for their loved ones. Then I think, yes I am grateful that I have a family, I have friends, and people who are kind to me..life is the greatest gift given to us, and we have the responsibility of treasuring it. But what if you don't feel anything actually ...no motivation to strive, haunted by the thought of wasting the life. I've previously posted similar posts in this forum, I've realised. &amp; I think the most useful advice is to 'Don't give a damn,just study hard, work to the top' </p>
              <p>life...so damn unfair. Been restricted and robbed of a lot of things because of my condition. &amp; I have no one to turn to. I can't tell my classmates or lecturers because they'll treat me differently..</p>

              <p>To want to live and do things for others is a beautiful thing.. I wish I want to, but I can think of no one..maybe I'm just too self-centred from the start</p>
              <p>Well..he told me since I have financial problems to pay for appt with psychologist, I should just take the antidepressants for a month to see if it helps..if it doesn't I'll just have to go for therapy sessions. I've searched through the net..talk therapy is a generally better option. Can't rely on meds..also, the anxieties can't just be cured, only by practice and more experience to curb. </p>
              <p>I had an even smaller social circle in the past, but I wanted to change last year, as I entered poly. So I joined a sports CCA hoping to make more friends and gain more confidence in dealing people, started out OK but it became too much for me to handle and I left. Then, I also signed up for a camp which lasted 2 weeks but I was most of the time like a mute because I was so mentally exhausted..and people wondered whether if I was feeling well. .. </p>
              <p>-.-</p>
              <p>So actually. I don't know how to deal with my anxieties. Seriously, they have been with me for as long as I can remember, and even my close ones, my kin believe that it's just part of me. A shy girl. She's always quiet, should speak up more..I hear that often..it's been so long. The counsellors that I went to told me that there's hope...but when?</p>

              <p><br>Do you have any hobbies? Any things you enjoy doing? Maybe you're different. Most people got depressed because they measure their lives by the social norms (social norms &gt;&gt;&gt; must have this that, must be this that, then can be happy). Some are depressed because they expect too much from themselves. Some chose to be depressed (don't ask me why). Some are depressed for no good reason.</p>
              <p>So anyway, one way is to know what you enjoy doing, and do something along that path. Like if you like fashion, could you work in a fashion related line?</p>
              <p>The last thing you want to do is to be what you think others want you to do... for example, if they say, you're so shy you need to be more outgoing... but that's not how you should be... you should just be you, whichever is most comfortable, if you're shy, then it's ok, you can still live a happy and good life with a small social circle.</p>
              <p>Be someone whom when you look in the mirror, you see the real you and you have a clear conscience. Don't be like this conman who claims to be christian and go to church and yet cheat his best friends' money, totally no conscience. When he looks in the mirror, I think he only sees a dog face.</p>

              </p><p>Leixee</p>
              <p>Firstly remember that there is no cure. You cannot be cured. </p>
              <p>But it dosen't mean that you can't do anything about your condition.</p>
              <p>You have been conditioned to be the way you are now. You can contition yourself to be the way you want to be. But you can't do it over night, or even in the next few weeks, because your conditioning took place years and years ago. What ever you think of yourself now, do not let it bother you. You are going to be the new you.</p>
              <p>The first step, is to stop your mind from thinking about yourself. Blank out your mind. Say to yourself, (telling your mind) " Don't say anything." Stop your mind, for a few seconds, then progress to a minute. Stop your mind from saying anything. You may think about how to fix a broken machine, how to tackle a problem, how to do some work,  but you must not say anything about yourself in your mind. Cultivate the habit of not saying anything about yourself in your mind. Keep your mind free and uncluttered with thoughts.</p>
              <p>You will then develop a focused mind, focused on what you would like to do, in getting results to that end. And as time goes by, you would be the expert in your field. If you think about yourself, about why this about you and why that about you, you will get nowhere and you will have trithymia.</p>
              <p>As for your personality, you will remain the same person as you are, but you will accept yourself as you are. You will be contented, (forget about happiness) you can be happy for a short time only anyway, never permanently happy.</p>
              <p>Be an expert in the field of your choosing, and be useful to other people, thats the secret to contentment in life.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><strong><span style="line-height: 115%; font-size: 14pt;">New study finds that living at home with family does not mean elderly people do not feel sad and lonely</span></strong></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;">Staying holed up at home in old age, even when living with family, could leave a person sad, lonely and even depressed.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>Closed to one in five of 412 elderly people surveyed for a new study showed signs of depression. They were all aged 75 and above, and living at home.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>That result in the study by the National University Health System (NUHS) has raised the red flag on old-age depression, given that Singapore is ageing faster than most countries in the world.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>Nearly 21 per cent of those over 80 – and 16 per cent of those in their mild to late 70s – indicated that they are sad, lonely or in low spirits in the study by the research team from NUHS’ Department of Psychological Medicine.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>Significantly, nine in 10 did not live alone.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>Previously studies have shown that those who live alone tend to be more depressed than those who do not.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>“What our new study shows is that you might live with others, yet still be alone,” said Associate Professor Rathi Mahendran, who will present the findings at a conference on ageing here on Thursday.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>“We need to take heed, given that we’re likely to see a rapid rise in our 80-plus population pretty soon-and most will live with family at home.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>There are now 73,000 people aged 80 and above in Singapore. This is likely to rise to 108,000 by 2020 and to nearly 180,000 by 2030, according to projections by the Institute of Policy Studies.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>“Families sometimes take sadness and loneliness for granted in elderly, saying these are a part of growing old,” said Prof Mahendran. “That should not be the case.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>She added that more resources were needed to focus on studying the needs of the “old-old” – those aged 80 and above. Past studies have tended to look at those aged 65-plus.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>Her colleague, Associate Professor Kua Ee Heok, who has spent more than three decades studying depression and dementia in the elderly, agreed.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>“The big concern is that a rise in elderly depression could cause suicide rates to spike too,” he said.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>While suicide rates among the very old here are not readily available, raw numbers indicate an upward trend.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>Forty-one people aged 75 and above killed themselves in 2010, the latest year for which data is available, compared to 34 in 2006.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>That same year, 14 men aged between 80 and 84 killed themselves, the highest figure for that age group in nearly 20 years. The figure for women in the same age group –eight – was the highest in 12 years.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>After reaching one of the highest suicide rates in the world for those 65 and above – at around 50 per 100,000 in 1995 – the rate dipped to about 24 in 2004, rose to 27.6 in 2007, and stabilised.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span><span> </span>In 2009, the elderly suicide rate per 100.000 for men was 28.7 and 19 for women. While this is lower than the peaks of the late 1980s and mid-1990s, it is much higher than in countries such as the United States, where suicide rates have hovered around 14 for those aged 65 and above.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>   </span>Given the rapid increase in the elderly population, it is possible that Singapore’s suicide rates per 100,000 may well remain stable or come down.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>But that does not impress Prof Kua. “The point is that suicide is preventable,” he said. “And that’s what we need to focus on.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>He agreed with Prof Mahendran that particular notice needs to be paid to depression in the very old, saying there were two key reasons to do so.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>First, unlike dementia, depression can be prevented and treated more effectively.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>The prevalence of depression is double that of dementia and it is associated with a host of physical health problems in old age, he said. “Families tend to notice signs of dementia and come forward for treatment ,“ he said. “Not so with depression – and this needs to change.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>Prof Mahendran’s finding on depression are markedly higher than 7 to 7.5 per cent of respondents in a similar age group who showed depression symptoms in a larger study published in 2009.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>The key different, she said, is that the earlier study surveyed elderly people in community settings, such as those who attend senior activity or day-care centres, whereas her study was conducted door-to-door in Jurong and Bukit Merah with people at home.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>Studies here have shown that older adults who stay employed or retirees who volunteer have better mental health, Prof Kua pointed out. “The key is to talk to people – your family, friends, colleagues or churchmates – and remain engaged.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>   </span>Volunteers working with the elderly agree.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>Ms Jane Lim, 48 has been running socialisation programmes at the void decks of one-room flats in Bukit Merah, Toa Payoh, Hougang and other places.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>Her “Happy Angel<span>  </span>Seniors Programme” offers lonely elderly a change to know their neighbours, make friends and remain alert and active.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>Encouraged by volunteers, they sing, dance, perform skits and discuss current affairs as part of the programme. There are 400 participants islandwide.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>“We try to reach them early, when they are in their 50s and 60s,” said Ms Lim. “If we wait till they’re 80, it might be too late.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;">Older people now fitter than before</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;">The 80s may well be the new 60s.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>   </span>A new study of 412 people aged 75 and above has shown that people are fitter than they used to be.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>Only one in four people aged over 80 needed help to do one or more things such as feeding, bathing or dressing themselves, or climbing stairs. This is sharply down from the proportion of nearly two-thirds found in a study 15 years ago.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>But there is a marked decline in physical and cognitive abilities when a person crosses 80.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>For instance, only one in 10 of those in their late 70s could not perform these essential<span>  </span>“activities of daily living”, compared to one in four of those aged 80 and above.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>Similarly, about 44 per cent of those aged between 75 and 79 were unable to do one or more tasks such as cooking, shopping or making telephone calls. It was 62 per cent for those past 8 years old.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>The latest study done by researchers from the Psychological Medicine Department at the National University Health System (NUHS), also found that cognitive impairment climbed from 28 per cent in those in their late 70s to 44 per cent in those aged 80 and above.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>Respondents were asked questions like what time it was, where they were and how to spell words like “world” backwards, to gauge their cognition in accordance to an international tool to screen for cognitive disabilities.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>While people are living longer and are in relatively better physical shape, more heed should be paid to their mental health and their concerns, says eldercare expert Kalyani Mehta.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>“We need more studies that look at the social and economic well-being of older folk, not just health issues – and these concerns, often inter-linked in the minds of the elderly, should be studied together,” said the head of the Gerontology Programme at SIM University .</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>There was also a need to make older folk “feel valued”, she said. “We should look at increasing opportunities for older folk to volunteer, help their frailer peers and feel valued<span>  </span>at the same time,” she said.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>Senior citizens like Mr Wee Char Lee, 85, are already leading the way. The retired father of three visits two activity centres for the elderly run by Presbyterian Community Services for three to four hours nearly every day to chat with residents.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>“We laugh and joke, we sing, we gossip,” he said. “Companionship makes us forget the worries of the world.”</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>Mr Wee, who spent 40 years working for a global technology company, takes special care of those who have been touched by tragedy.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>   </span>A woman in her 60s in his group recently lost her husband to suicide. “She was very very depressed at first, and even had to seek medical help,” he said.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span>“But these days, being with others her age is making her heal slowly.”</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I guess so... I've been thinking a lot about myself and so I landed up with more and more realisations..you reminded me. I used to control my thoughts and try not to think so much, that was when I had a simpler approach to life and was happy often. Then came this isolation period when I stayed indoors during the holidays that I began to think too much. The new semester started and all the stress started cramping in, anxieties start kicking in and it resulted in an even lousier mood...You know what, I really don't know...skipping classes again, not studying..lousy mood. I want this to stop. Anxiety as well..I want to be normal..to have conversations without feeling restricted, and to really enjoy going out with friends. But who can really understand it actually..can one function with nothing to look forward to? Don't think about myself..ok can. But then about what? A purpose to live..not to live for myself, but I can think of no one else to live for. Everyday.. it's just another passing day. No motivation, get tired so easily..always yawning, letargic. Sleeping all say. Disinterested. So this is really me? No drive.. and I can't tell anyone..it's suffocating..then you'll say I'm not alone, but in actually fact, the reality is that. I also don't want to dwell more on this, but just saying. Who can understand how lonely it is, how much emotionally handicapped I feel I am inside, how empty it is. The worst thing I've experienced, is to feel nothing at all..a zombie, a robot. And it's not only to me, but to others also. The more I think the more miserable I get, I understand that fully that in order to prevent that I shouldn't keep thinking about myself. But it's just so hard to break out of the vicious cycle. That now I can't..too weak. I'm a coward..feel like giving up on my studies but I can't..just hanging there because I have no choice.</p></div>

              <p>I'm 18, a poly student. Not long ago I finally went to seek
              help, saw a psychiatrist and he diagnosed me with dysthymia, more
              specifically, double depression. This has been affecting me for
              years...and I have social anxiety as well. I skipped classes
              because I couldn't handle the thought of having to meet a class of
              people, and there's the fear that I would be called up to answer a
              question in class so I didn't go..and when I was asked, I began to
              perspire.That fear is horrible..I would just stone in class. It's
              as good as not going, because I cannot listen and absorb
              anything...</p>
              <p>It's just so damn hard to get things going...I've tried, thrown
              myself outside of my comfort zone to tackle my social phobia but it
              just keeps on coming back...I'm on antidepressants, supposed to go
              for talk theraphy too but as it's not subsidised I can't afford it.
              &amp; no one in my family knows about my condition, because I
              already tried telling but no one believed me. Only led to quarrels.
              Family situation is screwed anyway, I give up on this relationship.
              I'm not close to anyone of them.</p>
              <p>It's not because I don't want to work hard, why can't anyone
              believe me..and who can really understand...I'm so tired</p>
              <p>I've asked some people what's the point of living. They say it's
              for their loved ones. Then I think, yes I am grateful that I have a
              family, I have friends, and people who are kind to me..life is the
              greatest gift given to us, and we have the responsibility of
              treasuring it. But what if you don't feel anything actually ...no
              motivation to strive, haunted by the thought of wasting the life.
              I've previously posted similar posts in this forum, I've realised.
              &amp; I think the most useful advice is to 'Don't give a damn,just
              study hard, work to the top' </p>
              <p>life...so damn unfair. Been restricted and robbed of a lot of
              things because of my condition. &amp; I have no one to turn to. I
              can't tell my classmates or lecturers because they'll treat me
              differently..</p>

              <p>This..I have to defend all the way, is totally wrong. Depression is caused by chemical imbalance in the brain...chemical imbalance..repeat after me. It's not by selfishness zz fyi I did try to reach out to help others eg. doing community service but it sort of backfired on me, I got even more depressed when my anxiety acted up. o.0 <em>All the depressed people</em>, no no no. </p>
              <p> I like what JelloPoop posted. Conquer it and help others get out of it. And raise awareness. Yep </p>
              <p>Some days it gets quite bad, like the day I started this thread while other days like today it seems alright. ^^ so okay. Yea...learn to let lose, meet new friends, discover more interests....</p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;">Staying holed up at home
              in old age, even when living with family, could leave a person sad,
              lonely and even depressed.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> Closed to one in five of 412 elderly people
              surveyed for a new study showed signs of depression. They were all
              aged 75 and above, and living at home.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> That result in the study by the National
              University Health System (NUHS) has raised the red flag on old-age
              depression, given that Singapore is ageing faster than most
              countries in the world.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> Nearly 21 per cent of those over 80 – and 16 per
              cent of those in their mild to late 70s – indicated that they are
              sad, lonely or in low spirits in the study by the research team
              from NUHS’ Department of Psychological Medicine.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> Significantly, nine in 10 did not live alone.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> Previously studies have shown that those who live
              alone tend to be more depressed than those who do not.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> “What our new study shows is that you might live
              with others, yet still be alone,” said Associate Professor Rathi
              Mahendran, who will present the findings at a conference on ageing
              here on Thursday.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> “We need to take heed, given that we’re likely to
              see a rapid rise in our 80-plus population pretty soon-and most
              will live with family at home.”</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> There are now 73,000 people aged 80 and above in
              Singapore. This is likely to rise to 108,000 by 2020 and to nearly
              180,000 by 2030, according to projections by the Institute of
              Policy Studies.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> “Families sometimes take sadness and loneliness
              for granted in elderly, saying these are a part of growing old,”
              said Prof Mahendran. “That should not be the case.”</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> She added that more resources were needed to focus
              on studying the needs of the “old-old” – those aged 80 and above.
              Past studies have tended to look at those aged 65-plus.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> Her colleague, Associate Professor Kua Ee Heok,
              who has spent more than three decades studying depression and
              dementia in the elderly, agreed.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> “The big concern is that a rise in elderly
              depression could cause suicide rates to spike too,” he said.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> While suicide rates among the very old here are
              not readily available, raw numbers indicate an upward trend.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> Forty-one people aged 75 and above killed
              themselves in 2010, the latest year for which data is available,
              compared to 34 in 2006.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> That same year, 14 men aged between 80 and 84
              killed themselves, the highest figure for that age group in nearly
              20 years. The figure for women in the same age group –eight – was
              the highest in 12 years.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> After reaching one of the highest suicide rates in
              the world for those 65 and above – at around 50 per 100,000 in 1995
              – the rate dipped to about 24 in 2004, rose to 27.6 in 2007, and
              stabilised.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span><span> </span>In 2009, the elderly
              suicide rate per 100.000 for men was 28.7 and 19 for women. While
              this is lower than the peaks of the late 1980s and mid-1990s, it is
              much higher than in countries such as the United States, where
              suicide rates have hovered around 14 for those aged 65 and
              above.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span> Given the rapid increase in the elderly
              population, it is possible that Singapore’s suicide rates per
              100,000 may well remain stable or come down.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> But that does not impress Prof Kua. “The point is
              that suicide is preventable,” he said. “And that’s what we need to
              focus on.”</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> He agreed with Prof Mahendran that particular
              notice needs to be paid to depression in the very old, saying there
              were two key reasons to do so.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> First, unlike dementia, depression can be
              prevented and treated more effectively.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> The prevalence of depression is double that of
              dementia and it is associated with a host of physical health
              problems in old age, he said. “Families tend to notice signs of
              dementia and come forward for treatment ,“ he said. “Not so with
              depression – and this needs to change.”</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> Prof Mahendran’s finding on depression are
              markedly higher than 7 to 7.5 per cent of respondents in a similar
              age group who showed depression symptoms in a larger study
              published in 2009.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> The key different, she said, is that the earlier
              study surveyed elderly people in community settings, such as those
              who attend senior activity or day-care centres, whereas her study
              was conducted door-to-door in Jurong and Bukit Merah with people at
              home.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> Studies here have shown that older adults who stay
              employed or retirees who volunteer have better mental health, Prof
              Kua pointed out. “The key is to talk to people – your family,
              friends, colleagues or churchmates – and remain engaged.”</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span> Volunteers working with the elderly
              agree.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> Ms Jane Lim, 48 has been running socialisation
              programmes at the void decks of one-room flats in Bukit Merah, Toa
              Payoh, Hougang and other places.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> Her “Happy Angel<span> </span> Seniors Programme” offers lonely elderly a change to know their
              neighbours, make friends and remain alert and active.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> Encouraged by volunteers, they sing, dance,
              perform skits and discuss current affairs as part of the programme.
              There are 400 participants islandwide.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> “We try to reach them early, when they are in
              their 50s and 60s,” said Ms Lim. “If we wait till they’re 80, it
              might be too late.”</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;">Older people now fitter
              than before</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;">The 80s may well be the
              new 60s.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span> A new study of 412 people aged 75 and above
              has shown that people are fitter than they used to be.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> Only one in four people aged over 80 needed help
              to do one or more things such as feeding, bathing or dressing
              themselves, or climbing stairs. This is sharply down from the
              proportion of nearly two-thirds found in a study 15 years ago.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> But there is a marked decline in physical and
              cognitive abilities when a person crosses 80.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> For instance, only one in 10 of those in their
              late 70s could not perform these essential<span> </span> “activities of daily living”, compared to one in
              four of those aged 80 and above.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> Similarly, about 44 per cent of those aged between
              75 and 79 were unable to do one or more tasks such as cooking,
              shopping or making telephone calls. It was 62 per cent for those
              past 8 years old.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> The latest study done by researchers from the
              Psychological Medicine Department at the National University Health
              System (NUHS), also found that cognitive impairment climbed from 28
              per cent in those in their late 70s to 44 per cent in those aged 80
              and above.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> Respondents were asked questions like what time it
              was, where they were and how to spell words like “world” backwards,
              to gauge their cognition in accordance to an international tool to
              screen for cognitive disabilities.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> While people are living longer and are in
              relatively better physical shape, more heed should be paid to their
              mental health and their concerns, says eldercare expert Kalyani
              Mehta.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> “We need more studies that look at the social and
              economic well-being of older folk, not just health issues – and
              these concerns, often inter-linked in the minds of the elderly,
              should be studied together,” said the head of the Gerontology
              Programme at SIM University .</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> There was also a need to make older folk “feel
              valued”, she said. “We should look at increasing opportunities for
              older folk to volunteer, help their frailer peers and feel
              valued<span> </span> at the same time,” she said.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> Senior citizens like Mr Wee Char Lee, 85, are
              already leading the way. The retired father of three visits two
              activity centres for the elderly run by Presbyterian Community
              Services for three to four hours nearly every day to chat with
              residents.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> “We laugh and joke, we sing, we gossip,” he said.
              “Companionship makes us forget the worries of the world.”</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> Mr Wee, who spent 40 years working for a global
              technology company, takes special care of those who have been
              touched by tragedy.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span>  </span> A woman in her 60s in his group recently
              lost her husband to suicide. “She was very very depressed at first,
              and even had to seek medical help,” he said.</p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"><span> </span> “But these days, being with others her age is
              making her heal slowly.”</p>
