            <div class='col-md body'>I understand the plight u are in, but sometimes u got to face the reality. If he treats u bad or betray the love u gave to him, leave him.<br>BTW its really not very wise for u to buy so much expensive gifts or stuff for your love ones. If he/she love u its the thoughts that counts not the amount of material given.<br>Mutal trust is very important in a relationship once its broken it very hard to convince the other party about the feelings u had for him/her.<br>I seriously advise ringy to leave the guy.</div>
