            <div class='col-md body'>ok. seemingly, u have just learnt your lesson. i have learnt mine 6 months ago. i think we kinda experience the same thing. i treated this girl so bloody nice like im ready to marry her anytime. i even saved to buy her a ck watch on her bday and in the end, she still went with another guy. let me tell you what i've learnt. sometimes, love is an irony. if you put in 100% dont expect to receive 100%. that would be pure recipocation out of obligation. true love is unconditional and that's why love is free. and in this human race, you never get back what you give. (if you're lucky u probably would)<br><br>you sound really sad in your tone. take some time to cool off like what i did. if u really hate him, well, (feelings are so real), but you can't really hate him for life. take all those things that reminds u of him and trash them away. and take some time off alone. don't bother to contact that jerk. <span style="font-style: italic;">we know most men are jerk but bitches do exist too fyi</span>. be determined to stay away from him. he doesn't deserve you <strong>AT ALL FOR GOODNESS SAKE </strong>! if what you mentioned earlier is really true, then i believe soon, or someday, someone will behold you. someday, someone will be the one whom deserves you a million times more than mr jerk.<br><br>i hope u take some time to consider what i said. i hope i dont sound like i'm counselling. take comfort in the fact that almost everyone has gone through what u experienced. some encounter worst situations. i read earlier in the forum of this man who lost his daughter cuz his wife ran away and took her away. the man did nothing wrong. he was a good man. bad and good things happened everyday. but most importantly, God loves you. take care.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think you were so good to him till the point that he got sick of it.. some pple are like that, you treat them too well they will 'fan gan'.. for guys.. if girls too good rite, they might feel as though they lost the place in the relationship cos it's suppose to be them who are the one who help you buy food, look after you.. bla bla blah.. they want to be in control in the sense.. so if the girl too good, they also dun like.<br>basically it's very hard to understand.. too good, too independent, too nice, too emotional.. everything also must strike balance..<br>me also treat my past bf very well.. than he said something like i don't make him feel like a man, cos i do too much for him liao.. than as though he no need to do anything for me like that..<br>now i think you should just go do something, something so bad that it's like a slap to the face, like appear out of nowhere and tell the other girl the truth, hope that she dunnos and gives the boy a tight slap. it really hurts la.. but you have to live through it. fill your life with your friends.. dun think about guys first.. just some time of fun.. slowly u will forget one take care <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yes yes. those curses and words of hatred are suddenly so familiar to me. i'm still using them now. (less seldom of course) now girl, the best thing to do now is to calm down your mind. talk to your parents about it and let them help u. (it might sound weird but they're a good source of strength and love fyi) i remembered when i lost her, i got so caught up with my emotions that i really went haywired. it was really bad .. how bad ? bad enough that my parents received letters from my school due to my absence and i failed two freaking modules for my first semester that i had to repeat. im in my 2nd semester now studying real hard. then, i was so afraid to go home after school cuz i was simply just afraid that those memories will haunt me when i'm alone. it was a terrible period of time. BUT HEY ! thinking about it right now, it isn't worth it yar ? for someone who doesnt deserves my love yar ?<br><br>now what you can really do for yourself is to pick yourself up ! and YOU CAN'T do it alone ! NEVER ALONE ! you'll just find yourself falling deeper if you try. go mix around with those friends you once neglected (during the period when you had that jerk). mix around with people and build up your confidence. not all men are bad. at least i dont think im bad. (im not good either, learning to be better) as time passes, you'll soon get over him. it's a sure thing. but for the time, we won't know. maybe a year or two. but take heart that you will see this to pass. it will probably happen when you least expect it. get all your tissue papers now and cry all you have to tonight. tomorrow will be a better day. tomorrow will be a stronger and firmer day for you. don't say no. don't tell yourself you can't. those are just lies generated by your emotions. you're a stronger girl now because you've learnt something that so valuable. love isn't a fantasy. love is genunie care and concern. take heart. God cares.</div>

MAKE HIM FEEL REGRET BY HAFING A HAPPY LIFE ? that's dangerous man !! you dont have not make that person regret of anything seriously ! if he leaves you, that's his loss !! AND FULL STOP ! have nothing to do with him anymore !! if u want him to regret or to make him feel bad, you aren't actually letting it go ! you;re like plotting revenge sub-consciously ! and u know whats the danger ? if u try hard to be happy (just to make him regret and feel bad) but u fail to, oh man, i'll promise that you will feel even worse ! you'll feel that you're even more useless than before. i think you should just leave go everything and just <strong>CUT IT</strong>. two separate lives and that's it. seek happiness for yourself. don't think about mr jerk. he's unworthy. and the more u try to hate him, the more he will be embedded in your heart. so just let go and let God.
