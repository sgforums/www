            <div class='col-md body'>hi Ringy,<br><br>sorry to hear your story..<br>i can fully understand how you are feeling right now...<br><br>few months back, the same time happened to me too. My bf of many years also betrayed my trust. Have been flirting behind back until i found out. Unlike you, I made a big rage &amp; i confronted him.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Though on the surface the thing seemed to be solved, but the feeling that i experienced was exactly the same as yours. I totally lost trust in him. I was shattered &amp; started to wonder if what i have done for him was insufficient.<br>problems started to surface &amp; on many times, our relationship was on the verge of breaking up.<br>i was miserable.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>an online friend~ here gave me his analysis &amp; somehow showed me a clearly picture of the whole thingy.<br>i tried to salvage by communicating with my bf only to realise that nothing can really help as the mental &amp; emotional trauma that i was undergoing overwhelmed all advices given by people here &amp; my online friend...<br>until finally i seeked self-salvage. i asked myself what i realli want. To remain or to leave? There was no way of pretence. if i were to remain, i have to do forget.<br><br>but it was not at all an easy thing to do.<br>finally, one particular incident made me realised that my bf has realised his mistake &amp; he meant not to repeat it again &amp; that he loves me too. i still love my bf very much. so i told myself that i will forget about it &amp; start afresh.<br><br>N the good news is, I am finally able to walk out of the shadow already. we are now starting afresh. Till now, everything is still going on fine. But if things are to go wrong again, i am always mentally prepared to leave without turning back already.<br><br>dunno if my online friend~ here manage to read this or not...(guess you know who I am referring to) but still, would like to delicate a million thks to him for stooding by me, to be always ready to listen to me &amp; give me advices. thks fren...~~~  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>ringy, hope by sharing this experience of mine, it can give you some pointers.<br><br>my advice to you is to confront him. Don't suffer in silence. See his reaction &amp; judge for yourself if he really loves you.<br><br>pte msg me if you need further listening ear.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
