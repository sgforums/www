Unless of course you know she got at least a slight interest in you. Try to get to know her more first like wad other forumite had says.</div>

[/b]</blockquote>Man, i would suggest that its better not to do that. You had barely known her, and your understanding of her is basically next to zilch. Telling her that is the same as kissing your chances of knowing her better next time goodbye. Don't be impatient. Its too early to tell if she's interested in u or not. The late or no sms'es replies, I had learnt from experience, is NOT a good way to indicate if she's interested in u or not. Look at where u and her are now in this stage of friendship.<br><br>Look, she is probably afraid, because she doesn't know you well, and here you are, smsing her, and trying to confess to her. You wanting to get a group outing is good, because in a group, she will feel less inhabited, and that will be  a good chance to ask her out alone the next time, after she knows u better during the group outing. Pls try to talk to her, and know her a little more, during the group outing.<br><br>And, be more confident of urself. Gals, unfortuntately, tend to like guys who can express themselves well, and are confident of themselves. Being shy and not letting the other person know u well won't win u her heart. Jia You!! U can do it!</div>
