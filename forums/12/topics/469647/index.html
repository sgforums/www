              <p>to me, her response is like she cannot take it or accept what i told her. not too long ago like a few weeks back, she took out the soursop from the fridge and left it out on the table for more than 24 hours. when i saw the soursop left it in the open for so long then i questioned her, why did she do it? she said she can't eat it cold and wanted to eat it after the fruit was dry enough. then i told her, "u want to eat it dry ok can but why u left it out for more than 24 hours? now it's already rotten and all the ants are all over it." then she told me to go throw it away.</p>

              <p>She divorced.. already depressing.</p>
              <p>Just buy a basket full of soursop and strawberries.. leave it on the table for 1 month.. let her go deal with it her self.</p>
              <p>Tell her.. "mom i know you loved strawberries and soursops.. here is a basketful.. you do what you like with them."</p>
              <p>After the first basket rotted... you buy another basketful of strawberries and soursop .. keep doing it until she tells you to stop.</p>
              <p>At the mean time.. you just stay out of her way lor.</p>

              <p>FYI: perhaps your mother does not understand that Strawberries will not continue to ripen once picked.</p>
              <p>If she is hoping the sourness in the strawberries will go away if she leaves them out for a few days.. she will be disappointed.</p>
              <p>Unlike soursop.. soursop will continue to ripen if you leave it in room temperature.</p>
              <p>If your mother likes fresh ripen strawberries.. the best you can do for her is grow a strawberry plant in a pot.She can pick them once ripen, nothing beats a freshly picked strawberry !!</p>
