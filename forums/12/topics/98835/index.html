As a motivating example, there's this fren who underperformed in Pri Sch and was retained for 1 yr. He went on to Normal Stream in Sec 1, a path that most ppl think is 'the end'. However, he realised one day that if he chose to work hard and do well, he could actually do it. Just put in the effort to understand what the teacher is teaching and do according to the examples. Isn't it all? He really became an outstanding scorer and was transferred to the Express Stream. Ace-ing his O-levels, he went on to a reasonably gd JC. Ace-d his A-levels and went to Uni. He graduated with a gd Honours degree and is on his way to a shining career. How can anyone imagine that this outstanding graduate actually flunk his PSLE before!?!?<br><br>After Prelims, there's still the actual O's. Another fren who flunk his A levels retook all the papers while in NS. Impressive determination!!! Of course he succeeded and is now happily attending Uni. Another fren flunk almost 2-3 yrs in Uni and finally succeeded in his 4th yr, another happy graduate. Many turnaround stories that we can learn from.<br><br>Do your best and all the best!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
