Judging by the level of disgruntlement, I guess they have a short fall in both.<br><br>Now before dismissing the statements above as just another load of crap, think carefully about what YOU value in a women. Surprise, surprise, guys are as shallow as girls. We're all shallow. Regardless of all the emphasis that "a sense of humor" is all so important, a hot looking chick is the desire of every normal hot blooded male, and it even becomes all the more important as guys get older.<br><br>So ditch the load of bull about how life is one sided. If the rules have changed from fifty years ago when all girls were simpering weak minded props that rested conveniently on burly male shoulders, then deal with the change. Or give up and go get a bride from a third world country and prove to all who know you that you didn't have the balls or the ability to court a true Singaporean Woman.<br><br>Last words of advice. Looks can be enhanced by simply being confident or with a wardrobe change. Extreme cases can be refered for going under the knife. Ambition can always bring financial success. Stop whining and go out and grab the things that you deserve.</div></blockquote>You give an inch, she wants a mile.<br></div>

Da girl must be good looking, sexy, intelligent, subservient, witty, companionable, dress well, go to a good school, and the list goes on.<br><br>times have changed and the rules of engagement are still the same at the very core. I don't think they have changed much since the 50's.<br><br>if a guy gets ditched too many times, then hey, they must be doing something wrong right? What we hear here is only their side of the story, wonder how we would feel if we knew what the otherside went through...<br><br>singaporean men can be too whiny at times, grow up, get on with your life... if there is something the matter with your life, instead of crying and complaining do something about it, you are the only one who can coz other people sure are not going to do it for you.</div>
