But a little far reached to make you jump into your conclusion (i). Before I continue, just to clear my doubts... Can you better define (ii) as to what 'wrong path she might take' are you suggesting?<br><br>Yes. (1) &amp; (2) can easily make a person comes to a decision making of (i). But one thing I would like to point out in conclusion (i). You're not exactly 'helping' her. This 'error' is probably made in the light that you're quite an 'advance' creature. Humans tend to think alot for their future and the future of others around them. Which is... Not always practical. Your 'helping' her in (i) is more like 'defending' her. In a way against yourself (which you probably think you are so familar with). 'Helping' haven't comes in as the problem isn't there yet. Though you might see much of a potential for the things to happen, future is more often like a mist than not.<br><br>Every relationship holds a risk of leaving a scar behind a person's life. May it be you or someone else. How can you tell if she would to get into a relationship with someone else she won't be hurt more? The fact is probably you can't. Question 1 I wanna ask is, do both of you really love each other for NOW? Forget about the future. Nobody can really guarantee much for the future of a relationship. Life is always so unpredictable. If you're both for it, why not? At least the situation is still partially under your control? If she's with someone else and hurt badly, it really don't make much sense for you to tell her bf what he should be doing. You would just be an outsider then?<br><br><strong><br>is it fair for her? for me?<br>fair for the frenship?</strong><br><br>It's not really fair for her. Because you don't really know what she wants in her mind. You simply can't make a decision for someone and blindly says its 'fair' to that person.<br><br>For you? Probably only you can tell for certainty? But my guess is it's not.... There's a 'struggle' in you. Often when there's a struggle between what you desire and reality may offer you, 'fairness' is in question.<br><br>What relationship? Both of you are not an item yet. The relationship itself probably has yet to 'exist'. Without 'existence', fairness to it is just draft question.<br><br><strong><br>need help here, cause..... i seem to find myself in the same scenario everytime... in the recent.... 1 yr +.........</strong><br><br>Point to take note. You tends to worry too much about the relationship of a newborn relationship. It's not that you shouldn't. It's just that life is unpredictable. Sometimes when the circumstances come for both of you to fall apart, you just can't stop it from happening. The least you can do is try your best. Avoiding a relationship is sure an 'energy' &amp; 'emotions' saving way for both parties. But so would it be if we all ain't born in this way.... We're not born to save 'energy' &amp; 'emotions'... Understand that for good...<br><br>All is kinda like an 'investment'. Do you see the 'fruit' in the future? Or sometimes it's not really about the 'fruit'... How about the 'worth'? Hmm... You reminds me of my childhood again... The drain which caused me the 'fall' when I was only around 4...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Right infront of my doorsteps... For years I dare not cross it... The phobia of it immediately when I stepped out of my house... Always going a big round detour to avoid the whole stretch of drain... Really SMALL drain... With a few more years to come you'll probably get so conditioned to it like I did....<br><br>You can't tell the future, but somehow you think you do.<br><br>Before the actual 'battle' you've already withdrawn yourself and lost much of your 'battle'. You should be concentrating on working things out instead. Failures are inevitable in life. Whatever they may cause you. Whatever they may cause the others. You just need to know and let her understand. Whatever may happen in the future... Don't hurt each other for you've truly love each other... Things sometimes happens... Unplanned for and unintentional... Live to understand that and face it....<br><br></blockquote></div>

Probably everything which has a beginning would have an end... Unless you're talking about something which has a much longer period to be really determined by us (something like universe, but not a very good example...). Or something too ABSTRACT. Anyway, back to the point....<br><br>Since ALMOST everything would have an 'end' to it, people somehow have this delusion that 'EVERYTHING IS FATED'. What if we can do something about our fate and the fate of others indirectly? What if fate might be able to be altered or control in some circumstances? Makes you wonder... What is 'fate'? What is 'fated'?<br><br>Personally, I think that SOME things are 'fated' while others are not.
