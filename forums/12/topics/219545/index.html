Where exactly in the UK will you be based. Yes the southern parts of the UK is in general more expensive but expenses will vary quite a lot depending on where you are.<br><br>Now, for London, you should expect to spend at least 100 pounds per week for a bedsit (student standard!).  I see that you have been advised to go for 3 month leases so expect to pay a premium for short term rental. try Gumtree to get an idea of the rental involved. <a href="http://www.gumtree.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gumtree.com/</a><br><br>On top of rental, you have to pay:<br><br>1) water -- Usually dirt cheap. Usually less than 60 pounds per year per person (should be much much lower!)<br><br>2) Electricity -- Quite expensive. expect to pay on average about 20 pounds per person per month. Less in summer more in winter.<br><br>3) TV licence -- about 130 pounds per year. If you live in a block of flats you might be able to get away with not paying but the penalty if caught can be a fine of up to 1000 pounds. (remember they need a warrant to enter your property! Dun invite them in or give them reason to enter!)<br><br>4) Since you are not a student, I -think- you have to pay council tax. It will depend on the property you are living in.<br><br>If you eat out, McD value meals cost about 4 - 5 pounds each, a kebab and chips about 4 pounds. If you buy groceries and cook at home, budget about 30 pounds per week though you can certainly spend less - i know someone who uses just 10 pounds a week on groceries!<br><br>All in all I think your 2000 (about 630 pounds/month) will just (or barely) be enough! the coy obviously did their sums. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Btw, I would definitely take up the offer. I tend to give very little weight to parental objections since my philosophy is to live for oneself. You have only one life and I would say it is easier to live abroad for extended periods before you have a gf/wife/kids or a mortgage.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dun think this offer is good. If you are going to fork out your own money for the living expenses in UK, it is really unfair cos it should be provided by the company. I think even the overseas allowance by SAF is more competitive than that offered by your company.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by isosceles:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: darkblue;">[color=brown]hey guys.. this is my 1st time posting. been a reader all these while..<br>hope to be able to hear some advice..<br><br>I just graduated fr Uni this July.. well , got a okie but stagnant job.. recently i got a new job offer.. its a Training and attachment programme organised by a govt board and this foreign pharmacutical company fr US.. The catch is, i have to go overseas for training for 1 year.. upon completion, I will serve a bond with the company in Spore for 2 years.<br><br>I was super elated when i was notified.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>All these are perfectly capitivating, to me. Cos I love to have the experience of life overseas and wad more, only 1 year.. and working in a Sci industry seems like a good experience.<br><br>I will be spending most of the time in UK,  den Some months in Germany, some weeks in US n india.<br><br>But there are some issues that are bugging me..<br><br>[color=darkblue]I will be leaving my parents alone in spore, and 1 year isnt too long.. but its not too short either..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>I am given a 2000 allowance and additional 2000 cost of living expenses. I need to settle my accomodation, food, travel and other stuff with this 2000.<br><br>i did a brief research on accomodation in Uk , southern Uk the rent as advised, is between 600 to 700 pounds, (PER month) which is about  S$ 2100, groceries 60 pounds per week.. ( 1 month about S$712) and public transport per month is S$225. In total , a month's stay in UK will cost me S$2867, that is excluding other cost of living like. internet acess, electricity and utility bills etc..<br><br>And the HR told me that, sometimes i may be only stayin in the country for a few weeks and most lodging rentals need to go for quarterly rental, prob i will need to settle in a Hotel.. Den.. how much i will need to fork out, she also duno. Where I can find good lobang lodging, she say she still working with overseas office. also never promise will have a conclusion.<br>just told me, i need to be really independant..coz the other trainee will be posted to another country so prob i wun have a companion.<br>She told me, when I am there, should i have any prob. i can always call her..<br>erm.. not veri useful right..<br><br>Upon completion of the programme, I enquire about the pay revision. she say not sure.. shld be ard S$2200 to $2600.. all depends.. On wad?? she say.. erm.. performance, market value blah blah..<br><br>my parents are abit against this idea..<br><br>and i am not more than ordinary in academics.. why will they wan to offer me.. prob the prev candidates rejected them or smthg??<br><br>Guys... if you were me.. would u take up this offer?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> </span><br><br>I took up the TAP program last year and has been in USA since. I can tell you it's good industrial experience if this is what you really want to do in your life.<br><br>On living expenses, I think it's enough but it's never gonna be close to what your counterparts in UK earn. Think of it this way... 4k a mth is a lot more than what overseas singaporean uni students spend living in the same country (like US, UK). However, it is not expatriate pay, so you will have to be frugal.<br><br>If you are really interested to sign, you gotta negotiate hard with the company itself (get the living expenses sorted out... you'll be surprised how much they are willing to do for you). Of course, you will have to bug the representative from your govt agency a lot (my experience is... they are usually very very passive with negotiation... i.e. they don't help you a lot). It could be a good or bad deal depending on what you want in life and how you go about getting the terms sorted out.<br><br>[/quote][/color][/color]</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My advise is to go. Dont think about the money too much. It's the chance of a lifetime to experience life abroad and being paid to do so at that, on top of that you get some industrial experience.<br><br>Insofar as bond is concerned, 2 years is nothing, you still have 40 years to work. But 1 year experience of living abroad will give you memories for a lifetime.<br><br>Please do not pass on an opportunity like this.</div>

But whatever they've said to you about the company would cover the excess on accomodation and such...? Try to get it on BLACK and WHITE.... Who was the one who told you that anyway? You new in the working society? Careful with what people tell you with their mouth only especially when you're still fresh and new to them...<br><br>What is the effective date for your contract to start? Read through the contract carefully... So long as there's no case of breach where you have to pay a huge consequence to it, it should be okie...<br><br>Btw, pharmacutical field is expected to be on the growth in years to come and UK is indeed a rather prospective place to have you properly trained.. A year of training and 2 years of bond to that in Singapore shouldn't be too bad even if you're seeing it beyond...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Based on my experience, they will only start to talk to the company after you signed on the letter of intent. Then the govt side will email correspond with them to settle your visa and stuff... it could take a few mths to get everything sorted out depending on the situation. If the company has operations in S'pore... I'm sure things will be smoother than mine. You really should talk to them properly to settle all these... don't get intimidated by the govt agency people... they usually like to rush you but then they take their own sweet time... so sit down and talk terms with them properly.<br><br>Lodging-wise... what happened was my company 'bao' me a nice hotel for 1st mth (FOC... my best time!)... during which i have to find my own lodging and stuff... which was a pretty stressful period (tog with homesickness and stuff). If ur company HR guy nice... you may have a smoother time than me too. Chances are they can set u up to share an apartment with other employees or rent a room from an employee. I really don't think you will have to spend like 2k on lodging alone if you are street-smart.<br><br>One interesting good news is... they pay u in advance and they pay u per quater (3mths pay at a go)... u will be looking at a 5 figure sum in ur bank suddenly! But then again they will be spent! =P<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm sounds ok, but I think the reality is you wont be able to save much from this training stint.<br><br>It is only 1300 pounds or so per month. It would be too expensive to stay alone. You will need to find someone to share. If not, 200 pounds per week flies away pretty fast.<br><br>When you are overseas there is always the temptation to travel somewhere during the weekends. ALWAYS. That will cost something, so always look for deals.<br><br>One last thing. Give yourself some treats occasionally. Dont always count the money - it is really important to enjoy your stay, otherwise you will start to dread the place sooner than you think. Psychological factor counts too!<br><br>Good Luck!</div>
