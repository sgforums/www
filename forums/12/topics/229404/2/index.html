            <div class='col-md body'>As for girlfriend, I can advise you, but not sure if you agree to my philosophy.<br><br>No big deal not having a gf, but a bid deal not having enough money especially in Singapore.<br><br>Since you are a grad, you can join SDU, or other paid dating agencies for their services. SDU have a lot of activities for their members, and if you join their activities regularly, I am sure you will find your soulmate soon.<br><br>If you want to get married before 30, how about getting a wife from Vietnam, Myanmar if by then you are not able to find a soulmate.<br><br>Sad to say this, appearances does play a part. If you are handsome, no lack of gfs, but if you are ugly, thats it, thats the nature of the world isnt it. Money also apply to this logic. If you are ugly, but rich and drives a ferrari, I guess girls will stick to you like bees attracted to honey.<br><br>Heck why do you have to think you have to get married before or at 30 and start a family. There are people who are married at 30, 30 plus or even 40.<br>If you have this concept of marriage before 30, you are putting yourself under alot of undue pressure and stress.<br><br>Would you want to rushed into a marriage, then find that the girl is not your type, or vice versa, personality clashes,  no common interests and so forth.<br>A divorce is both time consuming and expensive for man. Also marriage does not mean married happily after. There are a lot of divorces in Singapore.<br><br>Thats life for you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>"and most importantly I think I cannot handle rejections. "<br><br>I think you must accept rejections slightly more positively.<br><br>I see rejection this way:<br><br>Rejections are very painful but are they are parts and parcels of everyday life.<br>It hopefully leads us to the one we have been waiting for.<br><br>It is impossible that each time you go into a shop and you definitely buy the thing you want. The shopowner may be disappointed by your rejection of his goods, but the next customer may buy or the next shop could offer what you want. Just make sure you know what you want. Rejection is just parts and parcels of life.<br><br>When i got rejected, my thoughts are:<br>1. She thinks I am lousy.<br>2. She might be lousy, because she don't see my virtues.<br>3. Both are OK, but we have differences or due to some circumstances.<br><br>Since the reasons for rejection is subjective and usually personal. You should never be affected by it to the point that commit suicide is comtemplated.<br>But we should reflect on why things don't work.<br><br>If you have family and friends that are concerned about you, you should be quite OK. You should feel good about yourself.<br><br>Don't start a relationship by expecting to fulfill your dream of marriage and children by 30. You will frighten every gal you meet.<br>Just treat them like normal guy friends. Don't have too much expectation too soon, you also won't feel rejected this way.<br><br>But starting to wait at 8.30 when the time is 10.00 while does indicate you cares, is a little bit excessive.<br>The opposite party may feel a little bit controlled. If before marriage, things are like this, after marriage.......We all need to breathe.<br><br>Finding the right person is most important, not finding the right time (if there is such thing as the right time to marry.)<br><br>Life deals you quite nice cards. Take up some sports to take your thoughts of out of this suicide issue for your parents' sake.</div>

She's a cheerful, jovial person, someone I truly feel happy and comfortable with. I thought she's the one for me even though she's older by 2yrs.<br><br>She's currently taking a part-time degree and she told me whenever she has class she doesn't take dinner. This afternoon I ask her if I can meet for her dinner after class at 10pm.  She agreed yet and I went there at 8:30pm, worrying that the class may end early. Yet at 9pm, she asked me to go home first even though I told her I'm already there waiting for her. What's wrong with me???!! What have I done to deserve this??!! Why must it bring pains and disappointment for being nice to someone you like??!!<br><br>Perhaps I moving towards depression or maybe I'm already into it. Nevertheless, I have still harbour the dream to marry and have kids before 30yr old. I really don't know if I can hang on long enough to see this day comes.<br></div></blockquote>This shows God is fair in his arrangement of everybody fate. Got career and money but no love. Got Love but no money and career.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Ok joke aside! I think what u really lack is confident in yrself. With a good career and consider good look. U shall feel yrself ,capable of getting a gal u required. If the r/s turns bad. Don feel bad or pessimistic. If u have good confident of yrself, the gal rejecting u shall be the one making the loss and not u in the lossing end. Plus, try to avoid sources like pub of friendster for yr future wife as mostly likely they r quite problematic and attitude when comes in r/s or in their personal life!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">You are giving yourself too much pressure.<br><br>I dun understand why so many ple are so depressed due to the fact that they do not have a bf/gf.  You know that you have parents and sisters who love and care for you.. and I think kinship is the most precious type of relationship in this world.  Bcoz since the day u were born till the day u leave this world, they will always be with you.<br><br>You probably scare that girl away.. arranged to meet up at 10pm and u reached at 8.30pm.. you might have given her the feeling that you are too desperate.<br><br>Go engage in some healthy activities.  Widen ur social circle and let nature take its course.  Relationship is something that you really cannnot hurry into.. and it's also not something that will give you good results even tho u really worked very hard.<br><br>Life is not just above love relationship.  Treasure what you have before they are gone.  Whatever will come, will come.  </span></div>
