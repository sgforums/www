              <p><br>R u a gal in the first place? Is it true that a gal will not go take up a job in a massage parlour? Why? Degrading? Or just lame? But then hor, quick quick $$$ isn't? I thought all gals are like that? Let's put it this way. Maybe a SG gal will not work in massage parlour (in case their dads visit such places), but they go ard sleeping with all the guys at pubs n discos. Isn't much worst? Much worst then giving HJ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I tried loving local gals. But local gals lack the style. They don't give SG guys a chance. Yet, still some local gals still blame us for being lousy. Come on man!!! We SG guys are WORLD CLASS standard, just that they don't understand. So don't blame us for going for foreign brides.</p>

              <p>Anyway, why will you fall for her in the first place? is it lust that you are aftering? How true do you think your own love is towards her? Like you said, you barely know her for a mth or so, how much do you know her, such that you can fall for her?</p>

I must congratulate you as i think not many can really know what is fall in love. But wait, have you ever think of to remain as single?</div>
              <div class="name">I married a girl that i know clearly she worth my love. Meaning she does not involved in any form of intimacy or whatsoever that makes me lose face when i met her ex. N yes i mind alot as my heart will feel hurt when we quarrel and if we brought up this kind of topics and divorce will be an exit if i have nothing to cling on this marriage.</div>
              <div class="name">So haha, if i were to remain single is better, play and let go with no responsibility to anyone.</div>
