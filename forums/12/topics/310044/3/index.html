              <p>Bro,</p>
              <p>From what i read from ur post.One word of advice from me.</p>
              <p>Dun even bother to test whether they love u or not.Working ladies that come to spore are after money, be it viet, thai or prc.</p>
              <p>If u determined to test, most likely u will fall into their KC trap.</p>
              <p>I fell into their trap once,and i'm not alone so u need advice from experienced cheongster .</p>
              <p>Go and register in Sammyboyforum and get help from bros there.</p>
              <p>U will grow and better advice will be given to u then u find here.Trust me..</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Ps: For those who advise him to test or provide ways of testing, pls dun be smart alex.The TS is seeking for help as he is new to this kind of situation.One step wrong and he will fall into the trap.ie: like giving him a M16 to fire which he never handle before.Can all these learn by teaching or training?</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I do acknowledge that when we, Singapore adopt a free open door market policy, society tends to be shaky especially witht the entry of foreign young gals, who came here to earn a living and that our sing guys fall prey to them. Let TS go on and learn his lesson, it part of a social lesson to bring him back to his senses, the day he sees this girl with another man or disappear with his money, i hope he can withstand the agony and not end up in rash action as some singguys do, ie by killing, stabbing or even chopping. From a good family guy to having to be hang at prison,  all because of PRC gals.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just to highlight TS that behind and within the PRC gals, they also talk about sing guys and teach each other on how to cheat them and get the best out of them. Especially those senior who had cheated many willt teach the younger ones to cheat further, and i can guarantee you that all hv husband or bf back home waiting to be fed</p>

              <p><br>I think all of us are just mentioning here to TS so that he need not take the harsh knock or experience the anguish of being cheated in the end.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think all of us meant well. I can see that a lot of ppl here, is helpful and concern. It is up to TS to heed or not to according what he may seem fit to the current acquaintance and situation.</p>

              <p>i would suggest dat u do not drop any further.</p>
              <p>i am not generalising PRC gals, i have friends who gotten PRC ladies as their wife (they went to China to work and got to know them) and they are doing very well now.</p>
              <p>it is because so many of these forumers here have already experience the pain, we are teaching u to beware of those who are trying to cheat you. Those who come here to work as a massager or wadsoever probably didnt had much education back in China.</p>
