              <p>To begin with her life is really going to be a complicated one. There are a lot of unknown facts and pages to be filled. Looking at her will be looking at several sets of accounts of a typical Chinese business - you just don't know which one is the actual one. I think there are endless stories and news about them, sad to say these news are spectacular from another perspective. So, which leads to the inevitable question - Who is she really? Also, the job she is holding at the moment is really very questionable.</p>
              <p>Having said the above, I think much is left at your end. What do you intend to do with yourself? What are your feelings for her? Love or Pity? Do you see yourself as a redeemer here than a lover? Can you afford to support her? Can you take whatever "shit" that may come? Can you pay that price - ultimate sacrifice? Are you broad minded enough? I think you will need to sit down and really come to terms with yourself before you venture out. I know of friends who thought that it was love and thought he could bring a better world to them - a redeemer. Yes, they are married to this day  but I cannot say the words of a fairy tale ending - "And they live happily ever after." - as they have yet to complete their lives journey. But, let me warn you of a redeemer who ended up crucified and forsaken - that my friend will be the ultimate price. Can you afford it? If you cannot at any one of the above questions, then I suggest you do not take a step further</p>
              <p>Today, you are doubting if she is dating other clients. What about tomorrow and the times to come? I think I do not have to spell out any further, the longer she remains in that environment and work, the more complicated it will be for the both of you.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents worth.</p>

              If he refuse to accept what his friends says and keep beliving in the PRC does it really matter whether we sent 100 people to test her?

              <p>Question is, does the TS want to accept the truth or not?<br> If he refuse to accept what his friends says and keep beliving in
              the <span>PRC</span> does it really matter whether we sent
              100 people to test her?</p>

              I was in the cab to meet my boyfriend the other day and i count myself unlucky for meeting the taxi driver. I hopped on from bukit gmbak and told the driver that i want to go to woodlands. He took the wrong route and we ended up at changi because he took the wrong exit at bke. And so, we began to chat.
              
              He told me that he has 2 wifes. 1 in Singapore, the other at Philippines. He met the Filipino at a pub one night and apparently, it was love at first sight despite already being married with a son. 
              
              He told me that, the Filipino is a decent woman and was forced to be in the trade of working in pubs in Singapore due to poverty. Ever since they started dating, he has began to invest in a business in Philippines and she has been running it eversince. The revenue from the business also goes to her account as she knows the country better than the singaporean driver who doesn't even know the Singapore road well!!
              
              Also, she is reluctant to come to Singapore because she insist that she has a business to look after. The uncle said that he has decided to divorce his Singapore wife as a result of the fact that his wife insisted that he only could choose one woman out of the two. 
              
              In my opinion, the philipino may have cheated him of his money. To him, it was love at first sight and because he loves him, he is willing to give him everything, even if it means to lose his Singapore citizenship to live in the rural area of Philippines and also his family.
              
              The moral of the story here is that, it does not matter if she will cheat you or not, considering the fact that you are already so in love with her. Instead, only you can povide yourself with an answer of whether if she will cheat on you, in a clear mind and conscience as if you have no affections for her. 
              
              Also consider if your relationship will be one that will be long lasting and if your family will accept her! Or maybe, even your friends!

              <p>China girls?Can they be trust?Yes, i do think that China girls not from those night club or Geylang place can be make fren and develope into a love story.</p>
              <p>If you China girl is from a those red light district or a massage girl, most probably they won't think of love but money!Just use your brain and think, why they work in a massage?For money!</p>
              <p>And, unless you can feed them with money every month, do you think they will want to be with you if you are not able to do that?</p>
              <p>Or let's say she also like you and yes she don't want to depend on you, so you let he be a massager.But, are you so generous as to let your lover or wife or girlfren whatever name you call and let them getting meat to meat rubbing with a stranger?Or worst, that guy might be some handsome guy with a big honey mouth or worst of all, he's rich and able to feed your lover with money.What will you do?Go crazy at home thinking of all this possiblity?Think about it! Better get a Vietnam wife in a Vietnam agency at least that is a much more wiser choice than to love a massager PRC girl!!!</p>
