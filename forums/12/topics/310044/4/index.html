              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> Actually it doesn't matter what the rest of the forumers think. In fact,
              here in Aunt Agony, we always have similar-related topics posted by random
              forumers every now and then.</p>
              <p>Yet, none of those posted, return back with a victoriously post to denounce
              all the warnings issued by other forumers in here. (Yunhaier has been here
              since late 2000, so go figure and do a search of related post)</p>
              <p>Their decision to consider dating such woman as an option is already doomed
              from the start.</p>
              <p>Surely, not all PRC are like that - but if your wisdom has not desert you
              entirely and your mind is still clear enough to think, this whole controversial
              issue has nothing with do with whether she is PRC or not - it's basically about
              you trying to date a woman engaging in some dubious trade. It can be Thai,
              Malaysian or any nationality you can think of - the result hardly differs.</p>
              <p>Eventually, no matter how many people are here to dissuade you, you will
              still go ahead with your 'decision' because you will probably think that 'she'
              is different or you are 'not like the rest'. </p>
              <p>So I will say something different - make that choice, go get yourself
              screwed badly and come back to share your tale.</p>
              <p>P.S: Neptune affliction cannot be dissolved by logics
              - the delusion of the heart and mind is far too insidious to eradicate with
              some simple forum post/s. One must face his consequences, if his development is
              not complete and holistic enough to understand the failure of his choice. Then
              he will fall and bleed a river, before one can learn to pick himself up. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p><br>Who dun want a simple life, i also want a simple life lor, to PRC gals, a simple life means a rich life that dun have to work and just take/cheat money from husband or bf can already.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If she dun sell her body, why she took up such a job here??, there are many other operators and factory jobs available.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a gal, i will rather die or be kill than to take up such a job in massage parlor ok.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look dude, the life is yours to take, but i can tell u that PRC gals are nos 1 in acting and sweet talks, and especially with guy like you, who are blinded by sympathetic feeling, beauty, sweet talks and love, you are nothing but an easy prey on target.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I still feel very funny, why not you put your energy and love on a local good gal, borne a good family, live the singaporeans way and life goes on in peace, why need to mess up your life...please lah, i worked with all these PRC gals, i knew them well. </p>

              <p><br>R u a gal in the first place? Is it true that a gal will not go take up a job in a massage parlour? Why? Degrading? Or just lame? But then hor, quick quick $$$ isn't? I thought all gals are like that? Let's put it this way. Maybe a SG gal will not work in massage parlour (in case their dads visit such places), but they go ard sleeping with all the guys at pubs n discos. Isn't much worst? Much worst then giving HJ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I tried loving local gals. But local gals lack the style. They don't give SG guys a chance. Yet, still some local gals still blame us for being lousy. Come on man!!! We SG guys are WORLD CLASS standard, just that they don't understand. So don't blame us for going for foreign brides.</p>

              <p>It is not about massage parlour.  There are really prim and proper spas which provide clean massage services ie NO special, NO HJ.  Which chaste and self-respecting girl will sell herself and give HJ just to earn quick bucks?</p>

              <p>Are all gals like that?  Please do not accuse all the gals just cos you fall into a women who will sell herself for money.  If all girls are like that, why do i need to study so hard for my degree, work so hard to climb the corporate ladder?  if all gals are like that, why are there gals working in factories as factory workers?  Open your eyes and just visit any factory and you will see alot of female working very hard, regardless they are singaporeans, malaysians, or PRCs.</p>

              <p>So local gals lack style or they dont give you a chance? just because they dont give you a chance doesnt mean they lack style.</p>

              <p>Yes, the vast majority of SG guys are really world class.  Committed and pragmatic, and generally they respect the weaker sex too.  Seriously, im not sure if anyone had said you are lousy, even if that is so, doesnt meant she is referring to other SG guys.  That comment is probably only referring to you.</p>

              <p>Well, To Ts,</p>
              <p>I might be naive here, but I think you should give it a go,  there is a high chance you might be cheated, not because she is from PRC, but her job she does is questionable(she might have her reasons). Be prepared to get cheated, that is all you have to think for now. Dun bring her to posh places, bring her to local places, let her know you are not a rich man. The first reply to this post pretty much sums it all up what you need to do.</p>
              <p>Due to the nature of her work, its best you get her screened before you do anything with her(incld sharing of utensils and kissing), else regret is no use. If she rejects screening, then you will have to curb your desires till you are sure she is cleared.</p>
              <p>Trust your feeling, take it cool if you get cheated, and share your story with us here, be it success or failure.</p>
              <p> </p>

              If she loves you, she will borrow from loan sharks to get it from you asap. 
              
              Even $1000 she already want to give excuse liao haha...

              <p>Today i feel something fishy about her. When I asked her
              something, she needs a while to come up with an answer. Something
              is not right.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I wanted to leave her but then I long for a good hug and kiss

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>I think you need to be a little more specific here, just what did you ask her that took her a while to answer? What is it that made you feel not right?</p>
              <p>After reading much, I feel that you have sort of decided to follow your intuition that things might just be not so bad for the both of you and I wish you well too.</p>
              <p>Although, she may be seemingly simple than SG girls but I beg to differ. Just be objective and open minded about things. A person's outer appearance can be deceiving as there is always an unseen inside. Just be careful.</p>
              <p>I agree this is a forum, not all of us have the same views and impressions of your situation but no matter what and how, the decision and choice is ultimately yours to  make. Just be objective at all times.</p>
