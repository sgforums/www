            <div class='col-md body'>Regarding about the blog issue:<br>Next time just post some entries as draft so people wouldn't be able to view it except u, the author.<br><br>Anyway, if u don't wan inrelevant people to visit ur blog and give critics or negative comments, make ur blog private or use a password system.<br><br>Regarding the boyfriend issue:<br>Although this isn't the main point but I find it disturbing. Since other posters post about this too... I think there's no harm adding another opinion of mine?<br><br>1) If your bf cares about you, he wouldn't have "abandon" u when u're in pain.<br>2)Even she has tumour.... she is currently definitely doing fine at that moment because she even have the mood to go KTV. And u, on the other hand, is experiencing pain -.- . wat kinda person is he to say reasons like "because she's sick so we have to blarblarblar" then wat about u?<br>I would lose my temper if I were u. It's normal.<br>I might even say "and then because I fall, I injured my spine so I'm bound to stay in bed all day long while you, who don't care about my pain, went singing in KTV"<br><br>She's sick but she can walk, talk, go<span class="large"> KTV</span>. Whereas, u can only stay in bed. wth<br></div>

I believe bf must give gf priority especially the gf not feeling well.   YOu bf is very questionable.  Don't trust him totally.
