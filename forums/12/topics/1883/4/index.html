It was his character.<br><br>That very nite.. very late in the nite.. the phone ringÂ… it was show on WÂ’s caller IDÂ…. a no. it look very familiar.. it was K..<br>To W surprise.. she stare at the ringing phone along period of time.. but still she did not pick up. She was confuse.. she dun really remember his phone number as clearly as last time.. so she might have really got over him. But on the other hand she was so afraid that he call not because of her but rather the thing that was left at WÂ’s place..<br>What was on her mind? She was so confuse, so contradicting .. she allow the phone to ring.. till it finally stop..<br>Tears drop were falling.. she wanted so much to hear his voice. But .. there is always but in her mind.. Â‘ be more rational! He was not the guy for you. You have already more or less get him out of your life.. why are you stepping back again.. and it might hurt more if u pick up the call.. will have make that you are really prepare then it will be the rite time to sort it out..Â’ this voice was in her all the while.. it was a voice of her will. Strong will,you call it.<br><br>At times she really feel like having some one there all the time to listen to what she want to say.. a shoulder to lint on but she know herself that only she could get herself out of this mess. No matter how much friends you have, there bound to be tines where you are all alone.. to face the problem.<br><br>K did not give up and he keep on sending message to W and her friends wanted to find out how was W getting on.. but W never reply any of his message nor pick up his call. She was not ready..<br>She went on with her life as per normal trying to get him totally out of her mind..<br>Till one day that W could no longer stand it any more! With all that calling from K and message especially one which say..<br>Â“ if a person cant love you the way you want him to be does not mean that he dun love you with all his has.Â”<br>What a message! W felt that K was trying to push all the blame to her. By this time W had decided.. she is willing to let go K completely now! She just want him to leave her alone.. and she know that if she dun pick up his call he will not give up.<br>W was so tired.. so tired off thinking what he want and this kind of dragging thing.<br>K even went to WÂ’s work placeÂ….<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>K went over to WÂ’s work place but to no avail as.. W had quit.. she will no longer be there..<br>K went around some of the places that they have been and was really missing W but still he is uncertain of himself.. wandering whatever he do is rite or wrong..<br>At the same time but different place, two different people were once a couple thinking of each other but no party is certain about themselves.<br>This went on for 2 monthsÂ… K had never stop messaging W or call her. But still W refused to pick upÂ…. Till one final day where W had really tired of all these nonsense of K.<br>Â“ what you want actually?.....Â” It was the first time after the break up that W had heard K voiceÂ… same to K..<br>Â“ ah,Â…. Nothing much.. ahÂ…Â…( he wanted to ask W outÂ…) ahÂ… just want to see how are you getting onÂ… no ahÂ… actualÂ…Â”K was stunÂ… he could not believe that W would actually call him.. He was at a lost he duno what to sayÂ…(he wanted so much to tell W that he love her and would want her back but he was still uncertain.. even till this mins.)<br>Â“you call just because you want to know how am I? you want to take back your thing?Â” W decided to break up the slient.<br>Â“no no no?! I Â… iÂ… I am sorry, I need to go off now.. I am rushing out, I call you again toniteÂ….Â”he was so afraid of facing herÂ…<br><br>W was really disappointed in his reactionÂ… all this while K has been calling W but nowÂ… he just run away again.. he still duno what he wantÂ…<br>To W, all these no longer matterÂ… guess that W would oso take this chance to really think about it.<br><br>On the other hand, K is thinking as wellÂ…..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>K was happy yet worry that W had finally reply to his callÂ…. He wanted to tell W how much he need her and how important to him.. but would he stay with her forever? Would W accept him back? Would W leave him? Could he promise to take care of W forever? All these question were rolling in his head..<br>Once again he was in a dilemma. But he is sure enough that he really love W and does not mean that when W is around he cant do its workÂ… he is even worst without W aroundÂ…<br><br>W had been waiting for K that whole day, she duno what she had in her heart that she could actually do nothing apart from waiting his call. K did not call that nite..<br>W could no longer hold back her anger anymore.. once again she call KÂ’s home the following nite.<br><br>Â“ hÂ….hi aunti ( it was K mum) I am sorry but is Kxxx around?Â”<br>Â“ nope,he is not aroundÂ… you are Wxxx rite? What happen to the two of you?(before W could say anythingÂ… his mum start to bomber her with a lot of Question that she herself also duno about it.) Kxx seem to be so depress the day he told me that you two have break up.. all of us felt so pity and hurt as we have already treat you as our daughterÂ…Â… and we all know that Kxxx dote on you a lot but why does this thing happen so quicky? Why?Â”<br>W was stun at what she say.. and as she was already on the fire even before she calledÂ….<br>Â“ auntieÂ…. Please dun ask me anymore! You should go and ask your son!!!!!!!! ( there was silent in-between them I am sorry aunti.. but I was too feeling very hurt by him even till nowÂ… I duno what went wrong between usÂ… I was really in a very bad situation when we just break up up and nowÂ…. Your son Kxxx is looking for me.. I m tired of all this I decide to find out what he want and to end this stupid relatuionshipÂ… could you ask him to call me Â… and if he dun please ask him to disappears forever in my lifeÂ…Â” W slam down the phone after bidding a good bye to his mumÂ….<br><br>For that whole day while waiting for K to call or I should say while hopping for Kxx to call W try to get herself busy but she still cant get him out of her mindÂ…<br></div>

Why? You seem to give things up easilyÂ… you might want me back now but how would I know when would you leave me again.. if there is a first time there will be a second time..

I was so unreasonable in the past .. even the way I treat my friend . They were still there for me despite the way I treat them in the past.. I never expect that there are still a lot of people out there who care for me apart from you. And money means a lot in the past last time but I guess it does not really matters now when I am doing some thinks that I like..<br>Life is so short! How many chance would I have to make myself happy ..<br>I would not want to regret for not doing the things that I like when I only left the last breath of earthÂ… I have come to understand that the most important thing in life is to be happy.<br>K, I dun deny that I still love you now.. you can never doubt my love for you.. but I really had enough of all these.. I would not want a husband, who was afraid of facing the reality.. cant take pressureÂ….<br>Could you see the point, I love you and thatÂ’s why I am letting you go.. when you are happy, I will be happy tooÂ… I will be contented.. love does not mean that I will need you by my side but having knowing that you are happy. As no matter how heartless a person will be I believe there were times you will still think of me, you will leave a small space in your heart to bury our four years of relationshipÂ…..<br>Take care..<br>If you ever found other gals like me.. do take good care of her and to love her with all your heart.. Remember do not treat her the way you treat me.. it hurtsÂ…Â”<br><br>W, by this time all her tears have dry up and she dun see the point in crying any more as it will not solve any problemÂ…..<br></div>

But was being held back by the other sisÂ… By this time all of the other family member were all staring at K. The whole house went silent till her brother-in-law could not stand the sight of him Â“ What do you want? You were the one who want a break up and now why are you here? Why do you still want to look for her? Are you a men? Stop behaving like a kid! You are old enough to think! We hope that you will take care of her but look at what have you done? Could you just leave her alone?Â”<br><br>By this time K was really upset .. he had brought it upon himself!

I could not make clear my mind at that time!Â” Tears were rolling around KÂ’s eyesÂ…<br>Â“ Then the more you should leave her! We like you is because we thought that you would be able to take care of her! We would not want guys that depend on gals! If you cant take the pressures now how are you going to take the pressures next time? If the two of you want to be together there will be more pressure coming along! How could you solve it? Whether are you able to take care of her or not depend on how you look at it! if you really love her you would strive hard to give her a better life! Do you understand! You know what happen to her in the past she had already been hurt enough! So stop hurting her!!!!Â”<br><br>Â“ I am sorry but please do give me a chance to make things up with her? Please.. I will never never going to hurt her again.. never I will give her all I have.Â”<br><br>W went home with pairs of eye staring at her!

We were just friends.. dun tell me that you have never believe me?Â”<br>W did not response to K Â…. Deep in her heart she find that no matter how much she say she could never change KÂ’s mind.. She could only feel hopelessÂ…<br>As W have to work the other day, they went up to pick up some stuff before heading to KÂ’s place.. while they were on the way back to their car KÂ’s phone ring again.. he did not pick upÂ… at that point of time W already know is LilingÂ… she could no longer take it anymoreÂ… she walk up towards..

Do you understand ! No gals would tolerate this kind of things! Who am I to you?
