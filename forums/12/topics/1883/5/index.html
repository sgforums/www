Just like me! I have never forget what happen in the past .. the past that will haunt me for life! But K have thought me how to leave with it!<br><br>No one will realize how short their life would be. But they would be able to have all the time they want now to do things of what they wish for.<br><br>Even if you have fall out of love and even everything you could not be compare to those that are disable and even celebrities. Actor and singer! No matter how unhappy they are they would still have to be strongÂ… and when something bad happen to them. They could not just find a place to hide! They would face more of humiliation then any other people!<br><br></div>
