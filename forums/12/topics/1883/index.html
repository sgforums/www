            <div class='col-md body'>K last message to W was "if we have the fate we will get to sms again....And they did it was K who make the first move by messaging W, some how or rather K was feeling rather bore that make him do it. They have a long night messaging each other. This went on for a few weeks.... K was feeling rather bad for neglecting his gf but he enjoy messaging W.K try a lot of time in the night not to sms W and as for W she didnÂ’t really bother so much as K mean noting to her and she was just feeling bor. But no matter how hard K try he just sms her very nite. Strangly enough both of them did not ask for each other phone number. Most of the time they were messaging each other jokes and what happen in their daily life. K growth to be more attracted to her and would hope very night that they would be able to sms very night.<br>(Even thought they did not meet each other.)<br><br>Things change when K was feeling sad one night as he was having a bad time in the army. He need some one to talk to him badly, he did not call his gf instead he call When find that his gf would not understand what he is going throught. W was the person he would think of ,he oso cant explain why. K try calling W a lot of time but there was no response. K feel sad but he did not give up.K just have this feeling that he wanted to talk to W. Finally by late in the night W reply. W told K that she was busying doing her school work (it was a lie ,she was with one of her bfs.) K was so glad that he has found W. They chat on the phone for a long long time. K found himself so happy when he talk to W on the phone and is looking forward to every night on the phone with her. W think otherwise she never like NSF as they dun have must income and time for her. But W continues to talk to K if he calls.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In their conversation they talk about some of their past. K has been with quite a lot of gals but he love his first gf the most. His current gf had give up a lot for him. He was on the run for 2 years deal to some traffic case. and this gal was with him through that difficult period of time. K grow up in a wealthy family but he was very rebellious deal to strictness of his parent. He always top the class with flying but it was still not good enough in the eye of his parent. He found his first love when he was in Sec 3. There relationships turn out well in the first place but tins start to change when K took things for granted. They broke after 2 years of relationship.<br><br>W a simple gal but she had a very bad experience in childhood time she started to hate guys. She had many many relationships but she was never true to them. She is very open minded meaning at times she does go for one night stand. She wanted to fool all those guy that go near her. To her, staying with guys does not mean love or liking but is just a game.<br>In the conversation, however W could sense this guy is quite a nice guy and seem to be drawn to her. In her mind, she know that she should not stay so close to him as he already has a gf.(no matter what W would not break up others people relationship. But rather out to have some fun only.)In the other end K felt so comfortable in his heart that he just would not bear to hang up. They were on the phone nearly 6 hours when W is rather tired.<br>W thought to herself Â‘nope, I should try to avoid him, would not want to ruin his relationshipÂ’ Where else K was hoping to talk to W more often, but on the other hand he felt so guilty towards his gf .He start to wander why is he attracted to a gal which he has not met before. For the following few days W was avoiding K phones call and refuse to reply to his sms. But K did not give up, he call W house phone in one of the late nites. He wanted so badly to hear her voice .K askÂ’ Â‘are you very busy recently? I have tried to call you many times but there was no ansÂ…Â… I really wish to talk to do pls Â…Â…Â….Â’ W wanted to hang up the but she cant bear too.this time round,W was trying to hint K Â‘goÂ… I am not suitable for you. I wun be serious in any relationshipsÂ’ But all this does not sink into his mindÂ…. W had decide since he donÂ’t wanna let go, she should play along, she wun be responsible. After few weeks on the phone they decide to meet up.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In mid-1998, it was the first time K and W had meet up. Â“HI,are you Wxxx?Â” This is Kxxx!Â” There was a long silent between them (W was abit shock, as it is not what she imagine.)before K say Â“hey I am sorry I cant get any tickets except Liang Po Po.would it be okay with you?Â” Â“Yaw sure no problem!Â” deep now WÂ’s heart Â‘what the heck!Y you like to c such a stupid show?Â”W did not say anything but just pretend to be happy with the arrangement. Through out the show she was just staring blankly at the screen and was thinking how come he could enjoy such a show, as he was laughing awayÂ…Â…Â….Till today W still remember he is wearing a black long sleeves t-shirt printed FBI and a blue bell-bob jeans. He wears a very thick spect. He is not the guy I want! (This is what I think at that time.)<br><br>The show finally end at around 1 plus! Â“Finally the show has ended!Â”W thought to herselfÂ….. W was so tired that she had say something that really let him and her face plush! Â“Can we find some place to sleep?Â” say W! Â“Huh?!!!!Â” K was so shock!! Â“OHS nope is can we find a place to sit as I wana have a smoke!Â” Â“OhÂ… A-OkayÂ” OH god, what a shame!!! They sat there talk for awhile. Thought out from the start of meeting till then K keep looking at W that make her feel so uneasy that she wanted to leave the minutes she finish the smoke sent her to the taxi-stand and to W disappointment that K did not present himself as gentlemen to offer to sent her home, instead to close the door behind her. Whatever it is W just wana get home fast to catch some sleep. K stood there till he lost the sight of the taxi. Actually he wanted so much to sent W home but he was afraid of rejectionÂ…Â…<br></div>
