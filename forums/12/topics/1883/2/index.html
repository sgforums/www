            <div class='col-md body'>K could not get to sleep when he reach home. He cant get W out of his mind..He was waiting for W to call him but to no avail. He felt very much guilty for going out with another gal. He start to wander about his feeling for his gf as their relationship been 2 years and he never had this kind of feeling before. He did not really get to sleep that night.<br><br>Few days had past after their first meeting.K did not call W as he dun want to be ungrateful to his gf.As for W she had forgotten the whole thingÂ…. K had been trying not to call W but he juz canÂ’t let her get out of his mind. So he gives up conquering himself and calls her. Â“Hi! This is K here,How are you?wana meet up for coffee?Â” Â“oh! Hi ! I am fine !coffee? I would really love to but I am rushing as I will be away to china for about a month.and now I am rushing to my work place to pick up something.Â” Â“co..ulds I accompany you? If you dun mind?Â” W find it hard to reject so she is meeting K at somewhere near his work place.<br><br>Â‘Oh god! W was rather surprise! Is he K? Y he looks so different? He looks much better without his thick lensÂ… (Wearing contact) He is quite attractive!! Infact! Oh pls I canÂ’t be thinking of all this!!!Â’ W thought to herself when she saw him. Â“hi! Now I know why you were saying that day you look sloggyYou look great now!Â”K was happy with all that compliment. They went to starbuk for a drink. This time round W start to pay more attraction to himÂ… K and W were talking happily when his phone ring. It sound like his gf but W would have been in no position to ask was quite rude on the phone; he even slams down the phone. W asking if K need to rush off as W overheard KÂ’s gf is going over to his place. Guess no matter what happen K would not want to leave at that moment as he will be missing W when she will be gone for a month. The worst thing happen when they left to have some fun in the game room.as they were playing Â‘Photo HuntÂ’ a gal tap on K shoulder.IT was his gf!!!! But instead of stopping the game,K requested that she should wait outside.W was shock and was at a lost,but quickly K divert WÂ’s attraction to the game.some how K was quite guilty and they decide to end the game. W wanted to leave the place ASAP! As she cant stand the look on that gal face! She looks like an ah-lian at a very young age! When W was about to leave,K run over to her and Â“ I am sorry,butÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â…Â… anyway could we meet up after you come back?would you call me? PleaseÂ….. I will be waiting.. plsÂ…Â….Â” W gives him a warm smile and nock. Implying that she will call K and ask him to go back to his gfÂ…. W did not think must as she was rushing to the airport and once again she donÂ’t wana get involve.</div>

K break up with his gf within that month as he finds no reason why he should stay on where there is no love. But this break up is slightly affected by W as K felt that his feeling for W is strong. He was determined to wait for the return of W.And W did call K up after a few days. They meet up at Bugis again and his pal had played a plank on him. On the day of meeting itself W ask K to wait for her sms,but W always like to use different hp no. to sums K as she was afraid that her other bf would find out. KÂ’s pal just got a new hp no. and they sms him telling him to go now over to bugis.Never did he realize that W is still working and would only be able to meet at nightÂ….. K got so anxious when he canÂ’t find W.. but when he found out that it was a plank by his pal ,at the same time that he know he really like WÂ…Â…Â…Â…Â….<br><br>When is time to meet up with W,K waited anxiously to c W.The minutes K saw W,W could saw the happiness in his eyesÂ…. K looks really cute as he keep staring at W with a gong on kind of smile. They went for a movie at Bugis again,(btw W fav-cinma is UA)but this time round is W who suggest the show.And they went for supper after that,is from there den W come to know the break up of K and gf.W felt so bad but remember It was mention that W hate guy and to her any guy who come to her ,she would just play along.

            <div class='col-md body'>That night they did not go homeÂ…..they went to the KTV which K works in and left to book a Â…. To stay over night. When they were in the room K was not like other guy who just want to go to bed with you when they heard you saying you wana stay over night. We chat like a couple.. As they were talking W lead over to kiss K (Guess she might have some feeling for K after all.)K was abit shock but did response to W and theyÂ…Â…Â…makeÂ… that night. It was an unforgettable night for K. As W was sleeping ;ieing on KÂ’s arm.K could feel the warmness and sweetness that he never had. K did not sleep the whole night. He spent the whole night looking at W.He is in loveÂ…Â…Â….He would really want W to be with him foreverÂ…. So the next day morning K held on to W when she wake up and sincere telling W Â‘I love you,dun get it wrong is not becauseÂ…Â…..Â’ W had cut off him Â‘sorry I wun be good faithful gf to you. You will find someone better. Is late I need to go to work could we go no and continues to be friends? LetÂ’s forget about what happen yest.nite and go on?Â’<br>Sadness! Is all in K !<br>After hearing all that K did not give upÂ…Â…he call and sms W every night. But she just refuses to do anything about it. She wants him to give up, but K didnÂ’t. This should not carry on! W sms K that she will be leaving to china again and ask him not to wait and learn to let go. Do not take every thing so serious.<br>In that month it was the slowerest time for K.K miss W a lot. Never did he know that W did not go to china in that monthÂ’s was trying to get away with K. but fate runs in a circleÂ’s call her pal R and it was K who pick up.! There is no way for W to run anymoreÂ…Â…Â… she would have to face it.(W did run into this kind of situations before but she cant be bother but this time round maybe she really feel something.)K requested to talk to W on phone.

Â“thanks for talking to me. I miss you a lot when you will outstationÂ…. I am glad that you would give me a chance! GIVE ME A CHANCE!Â” ????? W know that he had give K the wrong impression again and this time round is even worst!K has assume that W had agreed to be with him. But this did not bother W must so long as the other of her bf knows nothing about tis.As for K Â…Â…. He miss W a lot and was happy that W could give him a chance. K know that if he really love W he would have lots more to bears with.K also know that W had other bf out there but he dun mind and just hoping that w would truly accept him. he will wait till that day come.<br>K starts to talk to W every day.and they do things which all couple would do. this went on for few months till that fateful day which W went who one of her female pal to meet some guy that she like.W had nothing to do so she tag along.but she did not expect what is going to happen is going to stir up promble.they went to a fastfood rest.andchat for quite some time till W wanted to go first as she dun wana be light bulbsÂ…Â… moreover most of the time is W who is doing all the talking!!! W find it so weird as she use to listen to her pal saying that normall she will talk to this guy till late in the night.but now both of them seem to be mute!!!! But can see that WÂ’s pal really like this guy ! Btw this guy is Delen he is in his mid 20s look quite charmingÂ….

Does look and size really that matters? W decides to keep this matter away from her and instead tell her that she canÂ’t find himÂ….<br>Meanwhile w enjoy the company of K,but she still fool around with guys.And although K knows everything but he would rather keep quite then to confront as he was afraid that W would just leave him. He is willing to do anything for WÂ… but W dunooÂ…. How to treasure itÂ…Â….<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In the middle of the show W drop a tear as it was a sad love storyÂ…she want someone to reach out to hug her at that time and K did itÂ….!! W felt so comfortable in his arm for the first timeÂ…. W wanted to free herself from him in her heart but instead she reaches out to hold his handÂ…. K whisper in W ear Â… Â“let me take care of youÂ…Â” they lint against each other till the show endÂ… till K send W homeÂ…<br>(K was afraid that if he let go her hand she would be gone foreverÂ…)<br>In front of W door step K release W reluctantlyÂ… W gives a kissÂ…Â…before her walk inÂ….<br>W sms K Â‘I dun want to lie to you, I m still uncertain of myselfÂ….. If you ever find someone better, goÂ…. If not you will have to wait till I change. It might take weeks, months or even years.. it might not even happenÂ… you should know that I will still be fooling aroundÂ…and no one would me from doing thatÂ…. Would you be able to take it?.....<br>K felt really down after seeing that, but he was contented that W is willing to give him a chanceÂ… Â“ no no no!!! I wun stop you from you from doing anything..and I say before I am willing to try.. and dun worry I wun do anything silly like last time asÂ… I m going to give my best now.. and if I still fail I would accept it.. pls give me a chance to try for the last timeÂ…Â”<br><br>K try all his best to make W happyÂ…for the following months.W continues to flirt around.. her feeling towards K is still uncertain.. K has accepted everything of W including letting her to stay over night with others guys. There was once where W was at K house and they will going out but some other guy called and they would have to call off with KÂ…. K know that althoughW lie that her pal got something important to tell herÂ… KÂ’s tears dropped when he saw W got into some other guys carÂ….

            <div class='col-md body'>KÂ’s love for W grow each dayÂ…. K would spend all the time that W wants.. but K Â‘parent dun really like WÂ… guess is because they know that their son was so engross with this galÂ… to make him look so sad very dayÂ…. Whenever W went over to K place, she will get no respond when she greets them. But W cant b bothersÂ….<br>Few months has past and W birthday was round the corner. K wanted to give W something she really like so he went to ask her wat she want and W say jokingly Â“ money!! I want that!Â” but to her surprise! K was all prepared! W always wanted surprise... on that day K decided to fold W $142 bucks of a single dollar note to heart shapes but it fail so he went to change it to 1 dollar coinÂ… make a pop up card using W/s fav colorÂ… he book a hotel room full of balloons in there with flowers as well.. with a candle light dinner.(despite he was broke as he was still with army pathetic pay.. it took him a few months to save by skipping mealÂ…) It was all ready for W. but when K ask W out that day he was being rejectedÂ… K told W that he wanted to have a dinner and to catch moviesÂ…with herÂ… it was all fated.. W rejected as she thought that it was so boring.. so she went out with her pal instead of K.. K was so sad and thought that W really want to enjoy with her palsÂ… he went over to pass W the present and sent her over to meet her pal. And went back to the lonely hotel room to wait for the time to send W home. In that room he really feels like giving up \but he canÂ’t imagine the life without WÂ…<br><br>When W reach homes then she realizes that K had done a lot of things for her.<br><br>The $1 coin and the cardsÂ… she was so touchesÂ… (not because of the money but the cardÂ… and despite the incomeÂ…) she start to think of what she had done in the past and present that had hurt him so must W pick up the phoneÂ…<br>Â“ Dear,Â… thanks for all the things that you have done for me.. I miss you Â… could I go over your place now can you accompany me for the last minutes of my birthdayÂ…?Â”<br>K was so happy and surprise that W call him DEAR! It was the first time in that half a year..(K had been suffering in silent in that half a year.) I<br>Â“I will come over rite...Â” they went to a hotel to stay over night but it was not the earlier oneÂ… K has canceled that room; throw away all the things in there. But he was contented that he could be with her for the nightÂ…. The happiness in him had conquered all the sad that he had earlierÂ….<br>Before W fall asleep in KÂ’arm she sayÂ… Â‘ I love you.thanks for being here with me..Â’<br>They both were in each other armsÂ…Â… W had never tell anyone in her life Â‘I love youÂ’! W start to really have some true feeling for K.. K was delighted .. how K wish that time could stop at this point of timeÂ… he would want to give W all he hasÂ…<br>they held tight to each other till they fall asleepÂ…..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The story did not stop thereÂ….<br>W begin to spent more time with K even if she is out with other guy she would try hard not to let K know.. W does not want K to feel sadÂ…<br>K would sent W home from work everyday as she work till very late , and she is doing her part time course. K feel hurt when he saw W being so tired. And at times K would send W to meet her friends ,would wait till she finish den send her homeÂ…( w dun like the idea of having K around with her friends.. she did ask K to go first but he always wait..)<br>Although everything went well but KÂ’ parent still cant accept W.( till now W never get the ans.) she has been trying all her best to get into a topic with his parent but no ones bother about her guess is because they find that W had hurt their son too must.. W did not let K know how his parent as she does not want K to fall out with his parentsÂ… moreover K had already in bad terms with his parentsÂ…<br>Actually K is having the same problem with WÂ’s parentsÂ… W parents never allow W to go with a bikers.. their relationship had always been in the dark..<br><br>Weeks and month had pastÂ…. Their relationships carry on in this wayÂ…Â….. W had always had other guys out there. But this time round is not because she want to have fun is because she realizes that her love for K had grown but she wants to stop itÂ… she was afraid of getting hurt. W is being real selfish. She never thought that K was even more hurt den her. She wanted the best of all worlds but there will be no such things on earthÂ…<br>She try to get involve with other guys hopping to spread out her feeling but each time she blow off with a guy she got closes to K.. W try from time to time Â….and fail from time to time.. it hurt her deeply when K felt sad about her.

W keep mumbling Â‘ dear pals forgive meÂ… I love you I love youÂ… Pls forgive me if I had done anything wrong.Â’ Alvin since something is wrong but decides to wait till W is more awakeÂ… .Alvin went home after sending W homeÂ… he too know that W fool around often but he too choose to lie to himself as he like W a lot tooÂ…<br>W had a bad dream that nite, she dream about the past of herÂ…Â….. she cryÂ…. She know well enough at that point of timeÂ…. She love K,she love him deeplyyyyyyyyÂ…Â…Â…Â….<br>She had know wat to do nowÂ…Â…..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True love never run smooth<br>They have proof their love for each other butÂ…. They would still have to face other thing.<br>WÂ’s parent would be great barrier to them.. . Is the second Chinese New Year since they have been together was still in the dark of WÂ’s family. W decide to let k meet of her close sis First. To her surprise she didnÂ’t say anything instead she invite K homeÂ….<br>K was at a lost, Â‘what if they dun like me? What if Â… what ifÂ… all sort of questions pop up on K mindÂ…. He dun wish to go but guess he got no choice as he love W deeply.<br><br>And to his surprise they had accept him! Just that he was bomba with a lot of questionÂ….<br>As for KÂ’s family W is still trying till one day when she greeted his dad,his dad turn and smile to her!!!!!!! That year was the best Chinese New Year. For themÂ….<br><br>It has been 2 years they were as loving as ever, they would still sms each other before they sleep.sms! this is how they got to know each other. They would say I love you dear, everynite without fail. But W was too ambitions she wanted to earn as muz money as she can but for K, he think likewise. W start to work till very late at nite. She went to pub, lounge with her clientÂ… from there their relationship started to stray a bit. K dun understand why W wanted to work so hardÂ… infect K was worry about WÂ’s health. They would start to talk it out at first but most of the time they would end up quarreling. But K would always be the one to give inÂ…Â…. although they manage to calm things down slowly but there was a gapÂ… they give in to each other not because they understand is that they would not want to end up screaming at each other. They still stand at their own point of viewÂ…. As time past by they stop messaging each otherÂ….<br><br>K changeÂ….he was not as nice as last timeÂ… as for W she had stop fooling around since that time she divert all her attention to KÂ… but to K all W care is her work and nothing else.. W love K a lot she wanted to work hard so that when they got marry they would have enough.. there will time where W would be missing K so muz that she would wait up whole nite Under KÂ’voideck for him but most of the time K would let her wait for hoursÂ…. Whenever K appear he would act as nothing had happenÂ… didnÂ’t he promise to take care of W?? Because of K, W had stop contacting all her palsÂ… including her 8 years of best friends. All her friend blame her for neglecting themÂ… only W herself know that she only have a little free time left she would want it to be spent with K.. but W would have in the end is waitÂ…. Waiting for k to appearÂ… just like last time when K was waiting for herÂ…. W was very sad Â…Â…. She almost cry herself to sleep every niteÂ… she was under a lot of pressure by her boss and she got no one to talk to Â…. She drink herself to sleepÂ…..<br><br>What happen to K? what have W done wrong? K was less sensitive. Once he is so engross with something that he like, he would totally lost touch with all ard him including W. when W need him most he was not there. W try talking to him.. but K will always say Â“ you never change. You are still so thick in your mind.. why cant you live normally? Why muz you always think of this think of that? Whats wrong with you?Â”<br>W felt really hurtÂ…. She change so muz for K but what she get in return? nothing but cry herself to bed every nite. K duno wat happen to himself he still love W as muz butÂ…Â….. Maybe he is juz trying to get more of W attention?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Â“ dear Â…..Â” K heart break when he saw W tears rolling downÂ… K pulled W against him.. K was so stupid to make W cry with all he words..<br>Â“ dear please forgive me.. I didt mean what I sayÂ… I didt.. Â….. I am sorry.Â”<br>W still hugging on to K tightly Â… but fall to the chair Â…. Â“ dear why must you lie to yourself and me? You have not forget the pastÂ…. Why Why Why!!!!!!!!!Â”( W had really lost control of herselfÂ… Â“ dear tell meÂ… if you really canÂ’t forget the pastÂ… tell me whole heartedly.. please.. I am willing to let go of you.Â”<br>K knee down to WÂ… Â“ no no sorry dear I really didnÂ’t mean what I sayÂ…. How could I do to prove it to you?... dear I know you dun like me to be always on the com.. I would stop.. please dun say you dun want me anymore.. I would rather lost the whole world then to lost you.. please.Â”<br>Guess K tears had soften WÂ…<br>Â“ could you leave without me?Â”<br>Â“ no! no! I would never will, when my first gf left me, I give up everthing, I fall hard , but I did pull myself up . If I ever going to lost you I will never get upÂ… DearÂ…Â”<br>once again their love become deeper.<br><br>Quarrel. It might turn human being relationships worst but to some other it make them speak up their mind and to understand each other better..<br>In the case of W and K, their relationship turn stronger in this wayÂ… Quarrel let their love grow, make them grow up.<br>W wanted to make K happy and wanted to do thing together with him.. she try to play around with her com. She is try to get into it. On the part of K , he too wanted W to be happy.he start to cut down on his com. To be with WÂ… they have reacted to each other loveÂ…<br>They would spent time with each other every nightÂ… W would be at K house doing homework and K would be using the com. Alought they did not say much to each other but it warm up their heart to have each other around.<br>W was a girl who changed because of K W would try her best to give in everytime,and she put in a lots into the relationship. But W was an insecure girl. She was the most insecure girl in the world. This is partly the reason why she was afraid of relationshipÂ… since the first day W told K that she like him too, she was afraid that K would leave her one day..so she would try her best to do anything just to keep K.. If only she know that K loved her that deeply too, maybe she might not have felt so insecure but anyway that was her. She still cant let go of the pastÂ…. She would ask K every day Â“can you live without me?Â” K would take it jokingly.. Â“ haÂ… ya, nope ya nopeÂ….. dunoÂ…. What you think?Â” W felt that she would never can the true ans but deep in K heartÂ… his ans is nopeÂ… he cant live without herÂ…</div>
