I will never grow tired of blood fish.<br><br>I haven't forgotten the times when I need to wake up real early in the morning, the sandpainting's artist would prepare my breakfast.

She will always sleep first while I will read some books first before going to sleep.<br><br>When I was in Thailand, I have placed her picture in my bed table. My NS friends felt that we are totally inseparable. She will always wait for my overseas calls. Then I will always call her at least 4 times a week.

            <div class='col-md body'>I have saw her this year during my MRT ride to ExxonMobil. I wanted to call her but I didn't. Because I just doesn't wish her to remember me anymore. It's all in the past. I know that it will be painful for her to see me or to recall me...<br><br>If things haven't changed now, things should have happened in these way...<br><br>1) She would have married to me already.<br>2) She should be expecting or already has our first child.<br>3) All my v-friends know that she is the only girl in my life and I loved her dearly.<br>4) She would has gone to Malacca with me.<br>5) I will bring her to Australia when my brother suggested in going for holidays this year.<br>6) We would have gone to Sungei Buloh, Gun City and Mu Chuan.<br>7) I would have gave her a diamond ring now.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> She would be the most happiest girl by now because I have finally attained my status.<br>9) We would have applied for a 5-room HDB flat.<br>10) I would have whip out a dinner for her at least a week.<br>11) I would have spent a day recalling with her the things that we have done together and expressed my feelings for her.<br>12) I would have gave her all my everything to her.<br>13) I would have gone cruise with her family.<br>14) I would have imparted all my IT knowledge to her.<br>15) She would have been my closest aide in CareHearts.<br>16) She would have carried my nephew.<br>17) I would prepare lavishly for our aniversary on every 27 July.<br>1<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> I would always see her sleep first and cuddled her xiao xiao tau tau mi mi.<br>19) I would give her a hug everyday.<br>20) I would give her a massage everyday she came back from work.<br>21) We would have saw movies at Balestier Point and drinking Ice Mocha there.<br>22) She would be the first and only person to listen a chinese song I sing for her.<br>23) I would always draw something on her palm everyday and asked to guess what is it.<br>24) We would have rollerbladed together.<br>25) We would have shared our volunteering experience together.<br>26) I have promised to her long time ago that I will bring her to "chiong" but I didn't.

It's painful to recall all these memories and my eyes are really felt like crying now. I have made nothing great to her when I was with her. All I can do now is to recall all these painful memories from my heart to show that I was sincere all the way and knew her existence in my life. This is the greatest thing that I have done for her so far.... Although I do not harbour thoughts of going with her again, I wished to tell her that I loved her alot in the past. If I dun loved her, I won't do so much with her and I won't remember so many things about her. She never knew that she stood a higher place in my heart than that one. I have never told her that she was the one that I have done so many things for her. I dun wish to step into her life again and I hoped that she will forget all about me. Please take care. I won't be able to take care of her again... I will spend my days meaningful and her memories will be my motivation. She is the only girl in my life that has done so much for me. The day that I have given her the card, she was no longer in my heart anymore. Today, I have spoken all my thoughts out, I won't mention her again. She will be my memories... I will pray that she can find a much more better husband and her true happiness which I cannot provide for her... It's all written in the card. True feelings of ----------- for ---- ------.<br><br>What most important now is that she hasn't wasted her time with me all this time because it still stay in my memory.<br><br>What is done is cannot be undone.

            <div class='col-md body'>It has been close to two years that we have broke up. Each time, when I felt down, I would always look at the sandpainting for encouragement. Each time, when I look at my diary's memoirs, it seems that I have missed out several things in our relationship. I'm really afraid that I will lose your existence in my life. No matter what you are doing, I have always wished that you are always be happy. All I hope is that you know that you are the only dear in my life which I have given the most. No matter what happened in the past, my heart has always stood on your side and your goodwill. I will make another attempt to write a better memoir about Sinyun... Each time, when I feel down, I will always read the memoir again...<br><br>The most dearest person in my past was Sinyun. She was two years younger than me and my junior in my Diploma course. She is a Navy regular, likes to swim, rollerblading, making bears and handicraft stuffs.<br><br>The whole relationship started when we sat down at Orchart MRT station. From the start, she was the girl that I wanted to stay with. I finally asked her to be my girlfriend. She placed her her hand on my hand. The rest was history. I knew that in a relationship we are bounded to quarrel. That day, I have told her that no matter what happened in the future, how much we quarrelled, no matter whose fault it is, my heart has already decided to be with her and will be with her.<br><br>The first present that I gave her was a pair of Pio Pio coin box. It was bought at Clementi. We placed fifty cents in our own respective coin box daily. My Pio Pio is still with me now. I have placed the Pio Pio in a plastic bad and placed it beside my bed. I just doesn't wish any dust settled on the Pio Pio. I still doesn't has the courage to throw the Pio Pio away.<br><br>The big wooden box... It was bought at Bukit Merah Ikea. This box contains all our movie tickets, receipts or anything that we do things together. The wooden box is still beside my bed. She will always dig up the box and recall the memories. I have bought a love container and will always make a "star" for her everyday.<br><br>Not long after, I took her to a Dinner &amp; Dance. It was that day, my good friend, Chia, saw her for the very first time, the girl that I often talked about to him. That night, I sent her home and sat at the open area, near her house. We chatted till very late. I popped her this question whether she regretted in going with me. Or any things that she felt unhappy about. She said no.<br><br>After three months have passed, she decided that it was time for me to meet her parents. I met her parents at Bukit Merah Ikea for the very first time. Her parents nodded their approval. For my parents, I told her the biggest secret. My father likes to eat chocolate. We went to Marina Metro to buy a box of chocolates for my father.<br><br>Chinese Garden... During the inital stages of the relationship, we went to Chinese Garden to take photographs. She surprised me by placing the photograph in her self-made keychain. She has also gave me a keychain containing her photographs.<br><br>The 3000 pieces Lassen puzzle... I have bought the puzzle before she became my girlfriend and have been trying to solve the puzzle in my free time. We decided that we placed the puzzle in her house and will try to solve there together.<br><br>Each time when she returned back home from my house at night, I felt worried. I would always bring her back home. Not long after, she asked me to stay with her.<br><br>During the two years staying with her, it was my happiest time in my year. Everyday I could catch a glimpse of her, I would feel happy. During the initial part of staying at her house, I would sleep on the mattress on the floor and let her sleep on the bed. However, as time goes by, she asked me to sleep besides her. She has always complained that I slept like a pig. The moment that I closed my eyes, I would sleep all the way to the next morning.<br><br>My Thailand trip... Until now, I still doesn't know whether did I make the correct choice in going to Thailand and leaving her back in Singapore. No one really can understand what's my situation like during my NS. Nobody wanted to go to Thailand. All my friends gave all those stupid reasons in not to go. As for me, I dun wished to lie and gave a very weak but true reason. In the end, I can't stand all my friends' attitude and I decided to go. That day, I gave her a call and told her my final decision. I cried...<br><br><span style="color: orange;">To be continued.....</span></div>
