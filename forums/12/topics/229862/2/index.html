            <div class='col-md body'>Halo,<br><br>This thread interest me.<br><br>Let me share with you my experience.<br><br>Once I asked a young woman for her number, because our team wanted to contact her and ask her to join us (join the company).<br><br>She looked at me in a funny way, asked why, and then declined. She offered to take my superior's number to call him instead.<br><br>I didn't have a good feeling after that, and I sensed something was abit wrong.<br><br>Then I thought to myself, and realized she probably misunderstood. I think she thought I was trying to approach her.<br><br>So....<br><br>Moral of the story:<br><br>Sometimes it is a misunderstanding only.<br><br>For your case, I think it is possible that as a team leader, he is just trying to keep an eye on you, and make sure that as a newcomer you can fit in and adjust smoothly.<br><br>It is very possible.<br><br>So I hope you dont think too much about it.<br><br>I disagree about telling him you dont feel comfortable etc. I think it will be very awkward, and probably will have unintended consequences. Maybe he will think you are weird, or you have big ego, or you are too soft, etc, I don't know what it will be like.<br><br>Just see how it goes. Try to be cautious, vigilant, but keep a professional attitude, don't be too sensitive.<br><br>Meat Pao.</div>
