              <p>i've also been feeling like this lately except for me, its because i feel i have acomplished nothing in life. However, i tell myself that i WILL acomplish something in life and in the past, i have always slacked at school, so i tell myself that after NS, i will do my best to ace my modules if i can get into poly. It also doesnt help that i've developed feelings for another guy who was a really good friend of mine. I'm not gay and neither is my friend. As a result of this, I am trying my best to stay away and not contact him at all and for me, its as though I'm trying to break up with my girlfriend. If you want a long-term solution, maybe just take some time, do some soul searching. Mine was done on a particularly long busride. Ask yourself, do you know what you are here for? Is there anything you wish/need to acomplish? You say that when your friends leave it happens too. Could it be that you're lonely? Maybe you just need to find your someone special.</p>
              <p>On another note, religion does help. Dont listen to Canny's rubbish. God will never put you through this just because you dont give him your full heart. I'm a christian too and i will say that i have found peace when i go to church. I will admit that i am not close to him. I only go church like once a month... seldom pray... hardly read bible... but i will say that the time i spend in his presence is always rewarding and refreshing. Try spending more time with your church. Serve them, be it ushering, sound, or even allowing your house to host a cell group. It may open you to many possibilities that you never noticed.</p>
              <p>Btw, if you want a short term solution, just listen to (enter your favourite music genre) and get your mind immersed in the music. Blast your headphone if u need to. Just make sure its those outside your ear not in-ear otherwise ur hearing may suffer. For me if i feel empty, i just listen to techno at night until i so tired that i can fall asleep. Hope this helps <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p><br>I duno abt U, but I thot church goers or the avid Believers in God will not feel the sense of emptiness since what I have been told that all they need to do is to "invite HIM to their hearts". </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, sense of emptiness is common among the commoners.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Our heart / mind is perhaps, undergoing a change or facing another phrase of our life.  It does seem to come "out of the sudden", but little do we know, it is actually building up inside us for a period of time before it burst. </p>
              <p>Different people experiencing different kind of emptiness.  To others, it may be accomplishments.. To u, it may be people. </p>
              <p>I duno, you go figure it out urself ba..T'is one thing not outsiders can help us.</p>

              Hmm is it possible that you linger with the wrong types of friends? Just a thought anyway.
                                                  
              Try to be true to yourself. You wrote that you are Christian try to develop a personal relationship with God. Start by being true to yourself, read the bible periodically or every one or two days, pray with sincerity helps too and make time to pray daily. By being true to yourself you develop a sense of self worth and self respect. Know that you are special both to God or to anyone else you meet even if you feel you are not now or even when others put you down in the past. Remember your self worth is not what you've achieved or haven't achieved or what have you become or what you haven't become but it is who you really are. And nobody can be a better judge of that than yourself and God and belive me God knows who you really are. Try to be content with yourself. If you feel you've been slacking then try to build some character into you. Beef up.
                                                  You can meet some of the lowliest persons in the highest places of this world and some of the noblest persons in the lowest places on this world. The first is living a life of a fraud while the latter knows who he really is. That's how it is with this world, be smart and be wise.
                                                  
              If you like organization try to join one.
                 
              Try to pick up a hobby. Do you have something that you really like? If not then you haven't found what made you tick i.e. You haven't done enough exploring in your life. Doing the thing that fascinates you makes you a passionate person.
                                                  
              Make a commitment in your life start by planning your commitment. For example building a good career. This will give you some sort of a sense of purpose.
                                                  
              Life is a blessing not a burden so lighten up cheer up. be glad and celebrate life. I don't mean partying but I mean being thankful of life even in the simple little things of everyday. Don't worry about the future as worrying doesn't make it better. Put your focus on the present. I don't mean disregarding the future but rather to stop worrying or being anxious about your future. The future will take care of itself when you take care the present. Always be optimistic. You don't know what tomorrow is going to bring. Really. As a Christian do not rely on your own understanding.
                                                  
              Read this sentence below,
                                                  
              Impossibility is an impossibility
                                                  
                                                  
                                                  
              What do you think?
              To a pessimist the sentence means negative. Because his mind choose to see it that way 
              
              To an optimist the sentence means exactly the opposite of that of the pessimist. It means nothing is impossible.
                                                  
              Your choice.
                                                  
              Be blessed. Live a blessed life. Live well.

              <p><br>Yes, if you felt like this....it means that you haven't found GOD yet in your life.</p>
              <p>You may believed in GOD, but not 100% yet.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>why is everyone so intent on eliminating the emptiness, sometimes, it does you good. embrace it.</p>

              <p>anyways, it helped and still helps me to discover a whole lot more about the world and myself, it kind of makes you think a little more instead of just accepting things.</p>

              <p>loneliness and emptiness are mutually exclusive. that said, my feelings of emptiness finds its trigger in bouts of loneliness. are you feeling lonely, or empty? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">i</span> am lonely - i know this because my feelings of emptiness goes away with rare company, which stops my wandering mind.</p>
              <p>if you have the means to make friends, use it. i no longer have such opportunities and my social life is non-existent.</p>
