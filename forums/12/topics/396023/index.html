              <p>my favourite topic again ........</p>
              <p>INSECURITY in women from cave man ages till now...its in their bones...even after giving them equality and so much protection and spoils from the govt...they will still ask for more....no matter what u do women will never got enough....and let me tell you guys this - the govt is heading in the wrong direction in such biased policies...not only it affects us ...it also increases greater hatred and opposition against them..</p>
              <p>we see govt turn it back on us asking us to be even more accommodating to women whims and fancies to eliminate their insecurities  ....to be more proactive and solved the rise of singles issue which is largely due to the biased policies indirectly ...</p>
              <p>it is a feminist country and to think they want to create more lions...they are actually killing the pride of the lions to feed the lioness...lion city? or lioness city?  </p>

              <p>How well do you think you've taken care of her emotional needs such as giving her attention? How much attention did you pay to her before this happened and for how long? When did it start changing and why? Has she ever talked to you about it? Have you taken the time to understand this change of behaviour in her? Try asking her in a mature, firm yet loving manner. There's something you're doing that does not sit well with her, and it's probably your work and the toll it's taking on you, and when you're stressed out and busy with work, you spend less time with her.</p>
              <p>So talk to her. Tell her that you've noticed this change in her and that it's not sitting well with you, and that you'd like her to be a little more understanding of your schedule. If she's matured and understanding, she'll understand that your work is the reason behind your actions. For all you know, she probably might even suspect that you're having an affair with someone else, hence the insecurity.</p>
              <p>Good luck bro.</p>

              <p>the girl i m seeking is one who is emotionally independent, can take charge of her emotions well.  i never started out looking for someone who is emotionally dependent.  i never said this to her, but she is actually not my type.  i'm not attracted by looks (per se).  character and inner beauty are more important to me. </p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">there was once when i thought that she is Ms Right.  for a while i thought so and stuck with her despite all the shit.  unfortunately it never took off.  even as i posted this thread, i still could accept going through life with her.  but i think she has many issues to sort out.  thus i'm now inclined to think she is Ms Right Now.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">it's good to have a shift of paradigm once in a while</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: black; font-family: Arial;">it's sickening when you have to witness her thoughts as she sorts out her past, present and future.  the way the "relationship" is conducted was never normal in the first place.  </span></p>
