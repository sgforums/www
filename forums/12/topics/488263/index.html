              After thought for sometime, decided to write in here.
                  I'm a local guy in my late 20s, currently working as part time for only 2 - 3 days per week. During the time when I'm not working, I stayed at home and play computer games. Has been in this lifestyle for a couple of months now.
                  Tried looking for a full time job but doesn't know what to work and can't find any job I wanted. Don't really know what to do in life. 
                  My life has no direction. 
                  Anybody has the worst situation as mine?

              <p>I think it is actually perfectly normal to feel lost and having no direction in life when you haven't really tried jobs out.</p>
              <p>For a starter, you could try to find jobs that is in your field of study. If you do not have any interest in what you study, you can try out jobs you think you might have interest in. You have to start from somewhere. </p>
              <p>For now, you can start looking for jobs while you are not working instead of just playing computer games. Try looking for a permanent job if not, a contract one.</p>

              <p>Hi Rock_Sugar</p>
              <p>You must be really miserable and have nobody to talk to thus resort to this platform to vent your frustrations.</p>
              <p>You tried looking for jobs but failed and that must have demoralised you. Thus you turned to playing computer games to hopefully get some comfort out of it while you grieve in your current situation.</p>
              <p>Sometimes life is like that. You are stuck and you just need someone or something to pull you up.</p>

              <p>I'm new here. If u don't mind, I would like to share a part of misery that happened in my life from Jan to May 2015.</p>
              <p><span style="background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);">2 months back, I’ve known this guy. I don’t feel like going into details on how we met and how the meet up was. Lemme just get straight into the point. It all started where I liked him based on empathy. He told me he had a son, not yet married. He is 1994, had a son with his ex-gf. I was shocked in the first place, but I keep calm. I remembered he even told me he was once a head of gangster. His face looks innocent to me and he even told me he wanted a changed in his life. Thats when I end up with him in a relationship. Thinking that I could give him motivation to change for better. But I’m wronged all this while. I was blinded by his bullshits and “world” stories in his life. I admit I was stupid &amp; foolish that I have stayed by his side for all this 5 months. He kept saying I’m such a waste of time and all. Even when we are out for “dates”, we pay our own separate bills of foods &amp; drinks. I had once confronted him asking if he treat his previous gf like this, he said yes. I’m like wow okay. I tried breaking up with him countless times cause I can’t stand his behavior. But always end up patching back because he knows to console me well. Unfortunately, things didn’t went well on 14 May 2015. I found out that he were contacting other girls even when we were in relationship. Still contacting his ex whom he had son with saying just for the sake of his son. When I confront his ex, she doesn’t even know that our relationship existed. All I want to say here is, beware of this guy who going around playing with girls’s hearts. I am not here trying to get him back to me, never at all. I just don’t want other girls to be in the same place as me. Nevertheless, I would like say thank you to him, a guy whom initial name starts with A. Thank you for making a fool out of me for 5 months long, u did a great job in that ðŸ‘�ðŸ‘� Thank you for your effort and time wasted on me. Thank you for your “good deeds” towards me. Thank you for “loving me” and “cared” for me. To end this, please stop finding for me. Stop calling from different numbers you get through your workplace. Stop asking your mum or sister or your ex to even contact me. Don’t do any extra account on twitter just to contact me. Just focus on your current gf or gfs? Well I don’t know but yea I know you’re not single now. To his current gf, please be extra careful whomever you are. Well if his love for you is true then lucky you, but please tell him to stop looking for me. Details for the guy: he is a malay guy living in the Lion City, had a son with his ex-gf and is a 1994 human being. May you still stay as “world” as you areðŸ‘�</span></p>

If your loney you can always try to find ways to make friends like going clubbing, joining some events...etc. if your more of an introvert maybe you can have a habbit of going to the library and reading books or even do some one-man sports if your interested like swimming and cycling? I'm an introvert and I like cycling. It keeps me from feeling bored and I feel relaxed and peaceful when I cycle.</p></div>

              <p>Hi Rock_Sugar, perhaps you should start sitting down with yourself, writing down what you want in life. </p>
              <p>
              </p><ul>
              <li>short or long term goals</li>
              <li>what do you like or not like now</li>
              <li>what can you do to change it. </li>
              </ul>
              <div>Bascially, is to get yourself aware of your situation, it isn't that bad. many times we get unhappy with life w/o knowing why or seeing how small or big the problem or not is. </div>

              <p>doesnt mean you are better if there is someone worse than you.</p>
              <p>you live to answer to yourself. so buck up and find something that motivates you. maybe you start with some social activities, no need to find the perfect job immediately. which, just to let you know, may not exist. there is no perfect job, but you should aim for a job that gives you satisfaction. </p>
