              <p>Well, im one of those people who have scored badly for the O lvls this year.. Im a sec 5 student and i can't afford to lose anymore time now.</p>
              <p>My score for O lvl this year.</p>
              <p>26 point. English - B4</p>
              <p>                Maths - D7</p>
              <p>                Combine sciences - D7</p>
              <p>               Combine Humanities - D7</p>
              <p>               Geography - C5</p>
              <p>               Mother Tongue(CL) - B3</p>
              <p>               CCA - B3</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well.. i am appealing into NYP and RP on the DAE application located in their website. RP DAE application have started, i have already handed up the application form in NYP.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What if im not been selected as a student. Can anyone give me some alternative routes...</p>
              <p>I will blame no one else but myself, for not studying hard even at the last moments.. Thinking that it will be a breeze. I don't wish to retake my O lvls again as it is a waste of time..</p>
              <p>Unless im being choosen into a poly, retaking my maths and science is no problem. I will put in double effort to make sure i pass them. Even my maths and sciences are weak...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Should i choose to go Private Poly instead if im not being choosen, Or aim for Higher Nitec..</p>
              <p>I am not from a rich family, so i have limited choices to choose from.. Can someone guide me through my path..</p>

              <p>Well, I'm not sure about whether will your DAE be accepted, partly because your science and math (which is important) is D7 but it all comes to what diploma did you choose when you apply for DAE. Of course, if you are accepted, be prepared for retaking O-level Math and Science.</p>
              <p>Anyway, regarding what you decision you should make if you are not accepted through DAE, I seriously think you should retake your O-level.</p>
              <p>Private Poly, in my view, is not worth your time (You are concern about time, aren't you?). Its expensive and its hard to compete with people who have a non-private diploma. High chances you will hit a non-private poly graduates or University graduates when you throw a stone down the street, so how are you going to compete with them? So, this option is out of question.</p>
              <p>ITE - Higher Nitec, in my view, its not a bad decision. You can at least get a cert that is more recongised than private diploma and if you work hard, you can still get into non-private poly. However, thats if you are not concern about time. If you are concern about time and you seriously want to get into a poly. You will need 2 years if you go through this route, whereas going through the route of retaking O-level requires only 1 year.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, if your aim is to get into poly or even better, into university, retaking your O-level is the best route. Yes, you may say its not 100% you can get into poly even if you retake your O-level, that goes the same for the route of ITE. However, I don't see the point why can't you get into poly if you work hard for that 1 year. My friend did it with L1R4 of 15, why can't you? And worst, he's first O-level scored worst than you, I remember is some where around 35 to 40 for L1R4.</p>
              <p>In the end, its up for you to decide which way you want to go. Remember, walk down a path which you will not regret when you look back in your later part of your life.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I rather that you think about what you would like to do for the rest of your life. What excites you. Then go and take up that course and study it or maybe take part time work in that line of work to find out more and learn some skills on the job. That way you will make a better decision rather than study what is available in school or make decisions about school course without knowing much and regretting and doing badly again... you see. A lot of my computer line peers regretted taking computer science. It became just a piece of paper to get a job, any job. And sadly almost 80% of my peers are no longer in computer science.

              <p>Our school curriculum is geared to teach the majority in the most efficient way possible. You are not one the majority.</p>
              <p>Without knowing more about you, I don't know what other style of teaching/learning may suit you better. You've already wasted some time in the system. I'd suggest you leave the system in order not to waste more time. Leave before the constant failing due to a misfit between you and the school system leads to your loss of self esteem and confidence.</p>
              <p>I'd definitely recommending exploring the other alternatives available to you. You sound intelligent and should be able to make your decision. Parents tend to think we need a certain "level" of education or they have failed us so you may need to be educated some more for them to feel they have not failed you.</p>
              <p>It will also be more time and opportunity for you to decide what you want to do with life and what skills you'd need and how to obtain those skills.</p>

              <p>The routes for me to choose are much more limited compare to yours. Therefore I have already consider retaking O lvl and hopefully next yr I could get into poly. Same to you too ! All the best to you !</p>

              <p>Retake ols is the best choice for u.</p>

              <p>But their fees will be a little higher than poly.</p>

              <p>Den its good for you! Really.</p>
              <p>Practical used to take up about 15% overall, so now you have better chances of scoring with only needing to take written papers.</p>
