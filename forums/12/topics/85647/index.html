I guess one of the worst chores would be SIGNALLERS... Especially if you're a COMBAT one... Have a store to man.. And still have to take care of ADMINs...<br><br>Yeah... SAF always have these kinda 'sh|t'... When you need store mans, they're not there... (not that they lobo lah... They have other things to do usually...)<br><br>And COMBATS... OUTFIELD... Talking about staying LATE at night? How about staying COLD OUT at the 'fields' at night? Different people have different roles... And things might often not work out... But eventually if you're within a UNIT and you're quite CLOSE to each other... It's always easier to be more understanding and hence easier to get jobs done...</div>

But as I've been crossed from a combat fit soldier, I can tell you being a clerk is really much better compared to being in a COMBAT.<br><br>Just vent it all out here if you want...
