            <div class='col-md body'><p>Recently a close friend of mine was caught by the police for "rioting". This is what happened. He was walking to the nearby shopping centre when a group of ah bengs approached him. They called out to him and mocked him as he walked past. He ignored them  and walked faster away, only to find out that they were cornering him. After mocking him, those ah bengs gave him a punch in the face. My friend reacted by giving him punches too as he had taekwondo experience do defend himself. All of them were caught, and charged, including my friend for "causing hurt". That happened around january-february. Recently, his court date kept getting postponed until now, where he was told that he would have to stay in someplace for three weeks to be "supervised", and they would see if he was suitable for RTC. However, earlier, his lawyer claimed that the worse sentence would be probation. So i would like to know like what they would do to him for that three weeks and for those who had similar experiences, please share what happened. i am really worried for him and he is too.</p></div>

              <p>Your story a lot of gaps. Why Ah bengs want to attack your friend? Is it to extort money? If not, don't tell me they attack him for no reason? Your friend may have prior dealing with those Ah bengs or he may have earlier provoked them.</p>
              <p>Moral of the story is, if somebody slap you on your left cheek, you offer your right cheek. You don't punch him back. If somebody threaten you with a knife. You give them the money they ask for and then report to police. Or alternatively you run. If somebody call you names and insult you, you punch them? No. We live in country with laws. We must abide by them. We got police and their job is to protect you, so if you are threaten then you call the police after that. But for your "friend", too late. Now he has to pay the price. Will he learn his lesson? It is all up to him not to repeat this again.</p>

Those people have admitted in their statements for being bullies ALREADY. Meaning they are in for even more trouble for provoking on purpose. There is NO NEED for any sort of evidence in this case because its just hitting people. ONCE AGAIN I SAY, THOSE PEOPLE HAVE ALREADY ADMITTED TO CORNERING HIM ON PURPOSE.
