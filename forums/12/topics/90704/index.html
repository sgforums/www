If you truely can't accept the fact that you will be wasting your time pursuing a relationship from this, avoid hanging too much around her. Because she has no feelings for you, its simple for her to do that - but for your case, if your emotions can't handle it, avoid putting yourself in situation where you can't control.<br><br>But of course, if I was you, its unneccessary for me to do that because I was forged in such a way that it wouldn't be affected much. <strong>So eventually, it boils down to yourself</strong>... your preception... your emotional structure... and your mental capability.<br><br>Cheers</div>
