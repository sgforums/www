            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Note: All names are made up for reason of personal interests</strong><br><br>I am 19 years old.  I am facing a problem, which not many people have.  This frustrates me seeing that limits to the amount of people I can turn to.  Thus, as my last resort, I come to you.<br><br>Two years ago, I met a wonderful girl named Rachael.  She is very sweet, rarely cuss at all and cares a lot about her family.  I seen a lot of girls showing disrespect to their parents and siblings nowadays, but not her.  She is very intelligent, one of the smartest girl I met.  Her looks are very alluring and she never fails to make me go into Â“the moodÂ”.<br><br>At the same time I met Rachael, I met Wendy.  She isnÂ’t as alluring compared to Rachael in the looks side.  In fact, I donÂ’t find her sexually attractive at all.  We first started out as normal friends. Eventually, I got to learn more about her personality and quite frankly, I am impressed.  My heart just grew for her.<br><br>Wendy is an independent woman.  She doesnÂ’t need a guy to tell her what to do.  She has a mind of her own.  She is no older then me, yet she works part time to help SUPPORT her family.  She even knows how to cook great meals.  Compared to Rachael, sheÂ’s lacking in book smarts, but her street smarts are brilliant.<br><br>In short, Wendy is the kind of girl that a family man needs.<br><br>Two years later Â– today.  The year has been quite good for me.  I started a new leaf in life and certain areas of my life have drastically improved.  And I met two ladies.<br><br>Whitney and Jamie are their names.  Whitney has my eyes the moment I laid them on her.  Her personality is that of an ah-lian, but such attitudes donÂ’t scare me.  SheÂ’s quite sweet and dropped her ah lian personality once we get to know each other.  I think the only reason I am remotely interested in her is because sheÂ’s very hot.  I even warned her that if we were ever alone in a room, things are GONNA happen.<br><br>I guess the only reason that I like her is because she's attractive.<br><br>Unlike Whitney, JamieÂ’s looks donÂ’t interest me at all.  She got into the Â“plain JaneÂ” list the moment I laid eyes on her.<br><br>Jamie didn't liked me at first.  The feeling was mutual. We were "enemies" within the first week we met.<br><br>Circumstances changed and we began talking.  I figured itÂ’s better to have more friends then enemies, so I happily started socializing with her.  Eventually, I started to learn more about her personality.<br><br>Jamie is most probably, the sweetest girl I have ever met. She doesn't drink, she doesn't smoke and the best part, she actually behaves like a lady.  A GREAT change of scenery from all the other girls who tries desperately to imitate Paris Hilton.  She has both book and street smarts. I enjoyed reading between the lines whenever I talk to her and it seem she had bad experiences with men (which explains her defensive stance against me when we first met).<br><br>That basically summarized all the ladies so far in my life.  I love them all and they love me too.<br><br>Singapore is a small place.  Eventually, they learnt of each other existence.   I canÂ’t even go out with them nowadays, without being blasted with commitment issues.  Frankly, I am getting very annoyed and pissed off by it.<br><br>I practice the Islamic faith. According to the religion, a Muslim man can marry up to <strong>four</strong> women.  I figured out that applies to courtship as well.  So, I don't really see a problem in having four girlfriends.<br><br>The problem for me now is <strong>choice</strong>.  They want me to choose.  I canÂ’t do that, dammit.  From my POINT OF VIEW, itÂ’s either I am with all 4 of them, separating myself fairly, or <span style="font-style: italic;">I go back to singlehood and casual dating with random girls again</span>.<br><br>State your opinions and advice.

I am facing a problem, which not many people have.  This frustrates me seeing that limits to the amount of people I can turn to.  Thus, as my last resort, I come to you.<br><br>Two years ago, I met a wonderful girl named Rachael.  She is very sweet, rarely cuss at all and cares a lot about her family.  I seen a lot of girls showing disrespect to their parents and siblings nowadays, but not her.  She is very intelligent, one of the smartest girl I met.  Her looks are very alluring and she never fails to make me go into Â“the moodÂ”.<br><br>At the same time I met Rachael, I met Wendy.  She isnÂ’t as alluring compared to Rachael in the looks side.  In fact, I donÂ’t find her sexually attractive at all.  We first started out as normal friends. Eventually, I got to learn more about her personality and quite frankly, I am impressed.  My heart just grew for her.<br><br>Wendy is an independent woman.  She doesnÂ’t need a guy to tell her what to do.  She has a mind of her own.  She is no older then me, yet she works part time to help SUPPORT her family.  She even knows how to cook great meals.  Compared to Rachael, sheÂ’s lacking in book smarts, but her street smarts are brilliant.<br><br>In short, Wendy is the kind of girl that a family man needs.<br><br>Two years later Â– today.  The year has been quite good for me.  I started a new leaf in life and certain areas of my life have drastically improved.  And I met two ladies.<br><br>Whitney and Jamie are their names.  Whitney has my eyes the moment I laid them on her.  Her personality is that of an ah-lian, but such attitudes donÂ’t scare me.  SheÂ’s quite sweet and dropped her ah lian personality once we get to know each other.  I think the only reason I am remotely interested in her is because sheÂ’s very hot.  I even warned her that if we were ever alone in a room, things are GONNA happen.<br><br>I guess the only reason that I like her is because she's attractive.<br><br>Unlike Whitney, JamieÂ’s looks donÂ’t interest me at all.  She got into the Â“plain JaneÂ” list the moment I laid eyes on her.<br><br>Jamie didn't liked me at first.  The feeling was mutual. We were "enemies" within the first week we met.<br><br>Circumstances changed and we began talking.  I figured itÂ’s better to have more friends then enemies, so I happily started socializing with her.  Eventually, I started to learn more about her personality.<br><br>Jamie is most probably, the sweetest girl I have ever met. She doesn't drink, she doesn't smoke and the best part, she actually behaves like a lady.  A GREAT change of scenery from all the other girls who tries desperately to imitate Paris Hilton.  She has both book and street smarts. I enjoyed reading between the lines whenever I talk to her and it seem she had bad experiences with men (which explains her defensive stance against me when we first met).<br><br>That basically summarized all the ladies so far in my life.  I love them all and they love me too.<br><br>Singapore is a small place.  Eventually, they learnt of each other existence.   I canÂ’t even go out with them nowadays, without being blasted with commitment issues.  Frankly, I am getting very annoyed and pissed off by it.<br><br>I practice the Islamic faith. According to the religion, a Muslim man can marry up to <strong>four</strong> women.  I figured out that applies to courtship as well.  So, I don't really see a problem in having four girlfriends.<br><br>The problem for me now is <strong>choice</strong>.  They want me to choose.  I canÂ’t do that, dammit.  From my POINT OF VIEW, itÂ’s either I am with all 4 of them, separating myself fairly, or <span style="font-style: italic;">I go back to singlehood and casual dating with random girls again</span>.<br><br>State your opinions and advice.  Greatly appreciated.<br>[/b]</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> It's not about your faith nor the women; it's about your commitment.<br><br>I believe you are not ready for commitment; this commitment issue will hit a climax later in your life, should you continue such lifestyle and mindset.<br><br>Short-term fling or relationship shouldn't be a problem - of course, you won't be able to maintain them for long. When you scatter your energies, your focus is weak.<br><br>P.S: when you chase two rabbits, you lose both - what's more there are four in the story.<br><br>John Tucker must die?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Cheers</div>
