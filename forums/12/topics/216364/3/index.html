I guess the answer is clearly shown here.<br><br>To the OP, imho you are in this dilemma is cuz... you bite off more than you can chew.

I am facing a problem, which not many people have.  This frustrates me seeing that limits to the amount of people I can turn to.  Thus, as my last resort, I come to you.<br><br>Two years ago, I met a wonderful girl named Rachael.  She is very sweet, rarely cuss at all and cares a lot about her family.  I seen a lot of girls showing disrespect to their parents and siblings nowadays, but not her.  She is very intelligent, one of the smartest girl I met.  Her looks are very alluring and she never fails to make me go into Â“the moodÂ”.<br><br>At the same time I met Rachael, I met Wendy.  She isnÂ’t as alluring compared to Rachael in the looks side.  In fact, I donÂ’t find her sexually attractive at all.  We first started out as normal friends. Eventually, I got to learn more about her personality and quite frankly, I am impressed.  My heart just grew for her.<br><br>Wendy is an independent woman.  She doesnÂ’t need a guy to tell her what to do.  She has a mind of her own.  She is no older then me, yet she works part time to help SUPPORT her family.  She even knows how to cook great meals.  Compared to Rachael, sheÂ’s lacking in book smarts, but her street smarts are brilliant.<br><br>In short, Wendy is the kind of girl that a family man needs.<br><br>Two years later Â– today.  The year has been quite good for me.  I started a new leaf in life and certain areas of my life have drastically improved.  And I met two ladies.<br><br>Whitney and Jamie are their names.  Whitney has my eyes the moment I laid them on her.  Her personality is that of an ah-lian, but such attitudes donÂ’t scare me.  SheÂ’s quite sweet and dropped her ah lian personality once we get to know each other.  I think the only reason I am remotely interested in her is because sheÂ’s very hot.  I even warned her that if we were ever alone in a room, things are GONNA happen.<br><br>I guess the only reason that I like her is because she's attractive.<br><br>Unlike Whitney, JamieÂ’s looks donÂ’t interest me at all.  She got into the Â“plain JaneÂ” list the moment I laid eyes on her.<br><br>Jamie didn't liked me at first.  The feeling was mutual. We were "enemies" within the first week we met.<br><br>Circumstances changed and we began talking.  I figured itÂ’s better to have more friends then enemies, so I happily started socializing with her.  Eventually, I started to learn more about her personality.<br><br>Jamie is most probably, the sweetest girl I have ever met. She doesn't drink, she doesn't smoke and the best part, she actually behaves like a lady.  A GREAT change of scenery from all the other girls who tries desperately to imitate Paris Hilton.  She has both book and street smarts. I enjoyed reading between the lines whenever I talk to her and it seem she had bad experiences with men (which explains her defensive stance against me when we first met).<br><br>That basically summarized all the ladies so far in my life.  I love them all and they love me too.<br><br>Singapore is a small place.  Eventually, they learnt of each other existence.   I canÂ’t even go out with them nowadays, without being blasted with commitment issues.  Frankly, I am getting very annoyed and pissed off by it.<br><br>I practice the Islamic faith. According to the religion, a Muslim man can marry up to <strong>four</strong> women.  I figured out that applies to courtship as well.  So, I don't really see a problem in having four girlfriends.<br><br>The problem for me now is <strong>choice</strong>.  They want me to choose.  I canÂ’t do that, dammit.  From my POINT OF VIEW, itÂ’s either I am with all 4 of them, separating myself fairly, or <span style="font-style: italic;">I go back to singlehood and casual dating with random girls again</span>.<br><br>State your opinions and advice.  Greatly appreciated.<br>[/b]</blockquote>one love.</div>

So let me talk a little bit about myself(my favourite topic).<br><br>I was [b]nothing</strong> at 15 years old.  No friends, no girlfriend, nothing.  My dad is different.  When he got hospitalized for a minor heartattack, flocks of people came to visit him.  It even impressed the nurses there.<br><br>My dad emphasized the importance of having the ability to make others feel for you.  Basically, he just told me I need to bulk up on my social skills.  So he taught me stuff like eye contact, remembering peopleÂ’s names, having a good listening ear, making others feel important while showing them I am of high status myself and so on.  Those are just the basics that most people learn as they get older.  The old man taught me more.  His teaching, time and me going out experimenting all over the place, gained me much wisdom.  I got to know many people who otherwise, be total strangers in my life.<br><br>ItÂ’s a natural flowÂ… my social skills became more polished,  I started mixing with the opposite sex and I keep learning.<br><br>There are many dudes with GREAT social skills.

            <div class='col-md body'><br>You may have a great personality in attracting people and you treasure that skill. But how u commit and behave in the long term is what makes a long lasting and true relationship. You may be the envy of many teenagers and young adults around you but as an adult I will tell that you heading for disaster in finding your right partner who can live happily with you till old age.<br><br>You got to be realistic Mr. Attractive. Your inability to rationalise shows there is much for u to learn and understand about life and your own abilities. A simple question is do you think you can mentally, emotionally, physically and very importantly financially satisfy 4 girls + yourself!

            <div class='col-md body'>I've talk to my dad.  Told him bout the girls.  No advice, but reminded that it's my problem and only I can find the answer.  But he gave me a VERY frightening comment.  It's right on the bulleyes.  He can read me like a book.  I'll post bout it later when I feel like it.<br><br>An update. Got into tons of arguements.  Inevitable, nothing I couldn't handle, so it's not serious.<br><br>Whitney &amp; Jamie studies at the same place as I do.  Both are aware of each other existence as I'am not those who hide things.  I try to treat them equally.  If I don't spend the day with Whitney, I would spend it with Jamie.  No such thing as spending time with both.  If they both are busy, I'd just spend time with the other girls I know in the campus. (I don't spend much time with the guys; all my buddies outside are 25-30 years old... get the drift?)<br><br>About girls maturing faster then guys, jackpot.  Let's talk about the two older girls.  One of them has a mutual understanding.  I allow her to see other guys, in return, she allow me to see other girls.  The relationship was great with alot of loving, but it's dying down.  It's like a couple getting married, years old, relationship just get into a plateau.  I think we're together is because we enjoy each other company.  We know each other inside out.  I guess, that just means, we're just friends with benefits.<br><br>The final one started working a month back and met other older guys.  She told me she's feeling attraction for one of them.  I felt jealous, but I let go of it.  She tried to run, but after seeing me reacting the "same", I guess that drew her back closer.  All of this is a game.  She's trying to break away.  If I play my cards right, I can get her back.  I am starting to think she's just better off with some other dude like you all suggested.<br><br>More of this later.</div>
