I'm guessing you already tried talking to your brother about his behaviour and how he is affecting the family right? What about talking to your mom? The main problem is your brother, and frankly, he needs to be discipline real bad. Few things you can try.<br>1) Turn him in to the police, that is if he do something really bad. Make sure you explain to your mom first.<br>2) Get a counsellor to talk to him, that is if you can get him to go to the counsellor. If not, idea no good.<br>3) Next time he is in debt, get some 'gangsterish' looking people to act out a scene in your house whereby they will act holding you and your mom hostage with your face fake bruised, fake blood and all. When he comes home, see his reaction. If he 'wakes up' good. If not, convince your mom to disown him. Make sure your plan is foolproof and that no police is involved or it will get complicated.</div>

He can locked his bedroom when he goes out so that his bro can't "take" things from him again and he still can look after his mum.

            <div class='col-md body'>Its sad to hear that u have such a leech in yr house. Hes yr brother and she is your mother therefore whatever the decision u make cant be too cruel. I wld suggest that u try to strike a deal to buy over the house so that it will be in your name when yr mother pass away (touch wood). You cld also make a police report (if i remember correctly) when things (of course the things musr be exp like rolex) in your room went missing or yr brother force entry into your room. If u are planning to move out better pay yr utility bill through Giro. U wld also want to do the grocery shopping for yr mother too. It serve 2 purpose, one u can give yr mother less allowance, two ppl will see u as a filial son. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

How much less is for you to decide.  Anyway its your life, nobody can help you but yourself.  You have to make a decision.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm....I have something to say. Why should you be the one moving out? I assume you are having a joint tenancy with your mum. So instead of moving out, I suggest that you offer to buy over your mum's share of the house.<br><br>If your mum agrees to it, all should be fine. As the master of the house, you can allow who to come in and who shouldnt. So let your mum stay and ban your brother from your house.<br><br>If the loan sharks come, direct them to the police.</div>
