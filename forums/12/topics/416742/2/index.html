              <p><br>There are alot of indians out there in this world, and there are also many chinese, eurasians, malays and other races out there.</p>
              <p>You must understand that there is no way you can ever hold onto their tongues, you can expect them to do so but I won't even trust them to give respect and understand to their own loved ones, and it's normal to me if they don't know how to give respect and understanding to people who are not their loved ones.</p>
              <p>If you're chinese, then you will also understand that there are many people in this world that looked down on chinese. And you get insulted even more when you're a girl.</p>
              <p>Don't take it to heart if they didn't insult your boyfriend by his real name and I don't encourage you to reveal his real name and allow anyone to make fun of it.</p>
              <p>There are all sorts of UNIMPORTANT people in here, try taking them seriously and you will only end up as the person who is going to be hurted.</p>
              <p>So welcome all advices with open arms and be it polite or impolite, because you are really the person who is asking for help in here and this is really the only risk that you would need to take anonymously and not straight in your face.</p>
              <p>If you can do that for your boyfriend, I'm sure you will eventually be able to find out the way that is suitable to resolve your situation.</p>
              <p>Continue to persist and don't give up easily and you will succeed. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>President Obama is half black half white. And people VOTED him in to become president.</p>
              <p>Black skin, brown skin, yellow skin, pink skin, are any of them any less human ?</p>
              <p>So far, all the mix race babies I've seen are beautiful. Prettier than pure breeds. Tiny Singapore is having too many inbred babies, and are starting to look uglier and uglier every new generations.</p>
              <p>Go to England, and you will see too many ugly white people walking around the streets. That's the result of generations of inbreding among their own race on that island.</p>

              <p>Still young, it's not like marriage or engagement is looming, so I'll say, just resume activities as normal and if possible, don't engage your BF with your family, such as festivities, gatherings and if you do so, then ensure that he can charm others with his sincerity or endure the negativities.</p>
              <p>Regarding going out and being afraid of your mum catching you, don't worry about it, I mean what are the chances of that happening anyway. But as customary, 17 IS a young age, you can't even do certain things without your parent's consent or by law and it's irritating to see young people thinking they're adapt to overcome many worldly adversary.</p>

              <p>Once you go black you never go back.... Anyways on a Serious note nothing wrong with having a different race partner... Most people who are against this are mainly narrow minded people,</p>
              <p>Chinese guys with other races are really rare.. Cos we all know they cant Fark well and are boring as hell (J/k).. Chinese guys also cant play sports well, cant fight and have problem being accepted by other races and they look like they have permanent jaundice.</p>
              <p>But they are defiantly smart at finding money. Which is not really important as alot dont have a life outside work... Going to cashbox or restaurants daily and hanging out at pubs and clubs and owning a sports car is not life and its not important.</p>
              <p>I forgot 1 more, THEY CANT DANCE, they cant move their body naturally.. So that says alot about sex.</p>
              <p>They also have problem socialising with others...</p>
              <p>The list can go on and on, Not only for chinese but Indians and malays as well. So you see If you love someone, Please disregard his race, cos race is nothing special.. Its only for people to claim glory for their skin color or stereotype others for theirs.</p>
              <p>You choose yourself, Wether you want to be a Chinese or a Singaporean. I choose to disregard my race and be a Singaporean.</p>

              <p>Like me, learn to eat buffet instead of getting just one bf, I also got indian, eurasian, chinese, ang mo, black, US marine bf,..every weekend take a new one, new condition, new dating, so exciting. As for indian and black, i think you mother worry that if she at nite wake up and go toilet, may scare to dead if she see them. Take care, and remember, marry yr own race, you will never regret. Think far, not now hor, me chop men first, later than get marry if my prince arrive</p>

              <p><br>of course lah. many guys want to chase angie you know how i 'protec' her? not protect. i have to bring the other guys down so that she can be mine, forever. this is natural. if you like him like that then you should consider other guys too, they all like that. what i worry is how he execute the action of 'protec', hope next time everything he do is 'protec' and ended up in police station.</p>
              <p>have your family or relative been through iinter-racial relationships before? you know how his family is like and his lifestyl;e and friends in details? how about his family? they know your backgounf also?</p>
              <p>until you know mpore about it i am with your mom. if i have children i will worry too, especially if they are still childish and have to come forum post for help and advice.</p>

              <p><br>from this thread i know this coming but i don;t care anyway. if indians only know how to doll up themselves to want to look good, only know what to be powerdefully in sex then i can say chinese are better off many times over. in the mind. the brain been the central of a human, the most important element in a man. lookat bollywood movies, even action ones when music and dances usually have no place tthey also can slot one two scenes in it. lame <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
