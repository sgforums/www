I need to give him something in return..but...I was miserable..and that made him miserable. I dont think it's right to stay with someone you dont love - you're basically lying to them(thus hurting them even more when they eventually find out you didnt love them) and keeping them attached to you when they could go on and start over. They deserve to find someone who truly loves them and they cant do that as long as you still hang on to them.</div>
