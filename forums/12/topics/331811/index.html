              <p>this is what had happened to my parents. let me start from the beginning.</p>
              <p>couple of months ago, my parents had a cold war. both of  them refuse to talk to each others. there was once my mum shouted she wanted a divorce while my dad was in the bedroom. i'm not clear what had happened to them that time. so after a couple of weeks, they patched this up again.</p>
              <p>but, after a few more weeks. my dad invited a female insurance agent to our house to talk about some polices. my mum was at home that time. after the agent finished discussing, she wanted to buy "dont know what thing", so my dad know where to get it, he accompany the agent to the shopping mall to get it.</p>
              <p>when my dad get home, my mum started screaming "You(her kids) will be getting a new mum). while my dad kept quiet. after that, my mum when to kitchen n start breaking all the drinking mugs while shouting vulgarities. and so, after a few weeks, they patched up again.</p>
              <p> they started everything again since about 2 months ago. my mum keep telling my sis that my dad treat the agent meals. which i dont know how true was it.</p>
              <p>and now, everything get out of control, jus an hour ago, my mum threw knives in front of my dad when he was reading newspaper while my dad still keeping his cool.</p>

              <p>sorry to hear.  it seems your mum is feeling insecure hence her suspicion about your dad.  but honestly, we don't really know why she is feeling that way.  is it really menopause or there have been reasons for her to be feeling what she feels.</p>
              <p>communication, patience and support will be very important during this period.  it can be tiring but i hope you and siblings can comfort your mum.  and as the solution to their issue, only your parents can deal with it.  but they need to have a clear head to do that.  and if your mum is feeling out of control, it may be difficult for her to be rational.  hence, support is key for her.  to balance her with her thoughts.</p>
              <p>don't give up.  we go through many trials in life and with each hurdle that we jumped, we become stronger.</p>
              <p>stay strong and hang in there.  all the best to your parents in resolving their current issue.</p>
              <p>God bless!</p>

              <p>Unless you dad comes to you for advice. Then you tell him what you think he should or could do.</p>
              <p>If your mum comes to you for help, then you tell her what you think she should or could do.</p>
              <p>Other than that, you only need to watch that they do not injure each other.</p>
              <p>Why should they fit into your notion of a good marriage?</p>
              <p>They have a marriage, whether it is good or not good, its you who is judging.</p>
              <p>And you judge according to what you have learnt. And you learnt that every thing have to be namby pamby "pleasant". Not necessary so. Emotions are neither bad nor good, they are just emotions, but we categorise them as bad or good, according its desirability. Each person have their own standards.</p>

              <p>Your dad is going through a mid life crisis.</p>
              <p>And your mom is upset because she thinks he is going to abandon her.</p>
              <p>Even if he knows where to buy the stuff.. he could have just given the agent the address and location of the store where the stuff can be bought.</p>
              <p>There is no need for him to "accompany" the female agent all the way to the store.</p>
              <p>I suggest you have a chat with your father.</p>
              <p>Chances are.. your father is doing all these "insensitive" things to piss your mother off.. so she will initiate a divorce.</p>
