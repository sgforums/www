But if you are close friends, do something to signal a change of your intentions. Start buying flowers, refer to her as your girlfriend. Give her some time to adjust her mindset to being your girlfriend. Then she'll either stop you or let you continue in your courtship. Otherwise she'll feel like she was molested by her brother.</div>
