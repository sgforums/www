              <p>he always seems to try to delay 1 by 1 day,claiming tat he will transfer me the money later,or his mum will transfer now,he will pass me tomorrow and end up taking a MC to avoid booking in.im nt so concern about the money actually but now my parents wanted the money.they have been pressuring me to get it from him but my friends doesn't seem interested in returning me.</p>
              <p>i feel tat he had betray my trust,it been nt the first time he tried to pull a fast one.he had borrow a few hundred bucks frm different people and didn't return any of them.i dunno why he do tat.anyway he had a "bad" background as well,been in jail for drugs offences and joins gang and stuff like tat.i actually accept him as quite a nice guy but didn't expect that i wont be seeing my money/laptop again.</p>

              <p>Police won't care if you got no proof of purchase to show that he still owes you 900.</p>
              <p>Next time make sure he fully paid up first before you hand him the item.</p>

              <p>im feeling dam stress right now.i sold a laptop to my ns platoon
              mate for 900 sgd.he was suppose to transfer me 450 every month
              during payday.it been the 3rd week since payday and he is still
              trying to delay paying.i haven recieve a single cent yet and i had
              already pass him the laptop for 1 month plus.</p>
              <p>he always seems to try to delay 1 by 1 day,claiming tat he will
              transfer me the money later,or his mum will transfer now,he will
              pass me tomorrow and end up taking a MC to avoid booking in.im nt
              so concern about the money actually but now my parents wanted the
              money.they have been pressuring me to get it from him but my
              friends doesn't seem interested in returning me.</p>
              <p>i feel tat he had betray my trust,it been nt the first time he
              tried to pull a fast one.he had borrow a few hundred bucks frm
              different people and didn't return any of them.i dunno why he do
              tat.anyway he had a "bad" background as well,been in jail for drugs
              offences and joins gang and stuff like tat.i actually accept him as
              quite a nice guy but didn't expect that i wont be seeing my
              money/laptop again.</p>
              <p>i was tinking of bringing tis case to the police if he don't
              returns me the money by this week.is this possible?is there a
              better idea than going to the police?</p>

              <p><br>u don't always need black &amp; white for contracts/agreement/transaction to be enforceable, even if it is b/w private individuals &gt;&gt; yr friend is liable for breach of contract since he did not pay you in return for giving him the laptop</p>

              <p><br>but then again..the police really can't do anything abt it..</p>
              <p>that's what they told my friend previously..my friend (A) passed another friend (B) a few hundred bucks to purchase laptop from him, as A is in overseas during the COMEX show..</p>
              <p>After he came back to SG, B denied saying that A passed him any cash before!</p>
              <p>Naturally, A's response was to make a police report..But, there's nothing the police can do either cuz there's no proof that A really did pass B the cash..</p>
              <p>That's why i made that comment as in...is redundant to make a police report as there's no proof at all... O.o</p>

              <p>followed by being charged than if he still doesn't return, can request MP go his house search for your laptop and have it return to you de ma.</p>
