            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Mike,<br><br>Can pple of different interest be together? Well let me put it this way (what i think only).<br><br>Can of cos...... if you know how to share the difference between the 2 of u, she might end up thinking that u r an interesting guy. Different poles attract remember? She might find you very 'fresh' and can really learn a lot of different things from you.<br><br>Of cos, pple of the same interest get along much more easlier in the 1st place, but that doesn't mean they wun find each other monotonous after that. Though, of cos, things might work out as well. It really depends on the person but not the difference in the 2 of you.<br><br>But back to yr story, i think she's really making it quite clear to you. What i suggest to you now is carry on with yr own life, and at the meantime wait for her....... you dun have to do much cos time will tell her that u r sincere, and then will also tell u if she's worth waiting for.<br><br>Guess that's all u can do now. Oh yah, u can also ask her out once in a while for coffee ...... if u want to see her of cos. Or u can always send her good nite every nite using sms....... hopefully she will be touch one day. the rest u can't do much also.<br><br>Okie, guess that's all the advise on my part. all the best to u......take care!<br><br>------------------<br>nOthiNg iS ImpOsSibLE In tHiS wOrLd<br>EvEn tHe wOrD ImPoSsiBLe SaYs "i'M pOsSiBLe"<br><br>[This message has been edited by Atti (edited 28 April 2001).]</div>

She's so afraid that her frds knw I like her, why? Once I dedicated a song to her as well as her frds.  I inform her to tell her frds and she say that if she tell them, they might suspect something, girls r really difficult to understand, in the end, I asked her gd frd to pass the message to the rest of her gang, why is she so defensive? Sometimes I wonder if we r still frds? We only communicate thru sms liao since the time I express my feelings to her.  r frds in touch by sms "friends"????<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>

What you've proposed for Mike is TRUE for some cases.... Sadly and shamely to admit MANY of us could have been WRONG...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>"The 1st blind man touches the trunk of the elephant and says the elephant is THICK n LONG. The 2nd blind man touches the tail and says,"No, the elephant is SHORT and THIN... " The 3rd blind man touches the elephant's body and says... "NO you STUPIDs... Elephant is BIG and FLAT..."<br><br>-There are usually too many 'sides' and 'truths' to a story but we just never get to see the WHOLE PICTURE. We're just like a 'BLIND MAN' in this universe, but many of a time we simply never realise it OR failed to admit it.... YES, we're all 'seeing the truth' and 'telling the truth'... But the EARTH is ROUND and the universe is BEYOND our arm's reach....<br><br>------------------<br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>
