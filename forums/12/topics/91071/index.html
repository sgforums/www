Those words she said during the break up. Haiz..all lies..my relative told my mum that she saw her holding hand with another guy while we're still together. Really hurts,but what's the point? Heaven is toying me or training me? Got to be strong or she'll "diao qi lai mai".<br>That's fate...which everyone actually waiting for. He/she is only be ur's when you're dead and their by your side.

She had went for singing performance and not getting any calls or even sms from her for 2 weeks. My this young girl going to be 20 yrs old, mind concept will change. Or maybe 3 yrs liao, she feel sianz with me,then look for other guy. Her character like this , marriage won't last long too.<br>But bare in mind we're just looking for advice or just telling sorrow here, don't think too much liao, i'm trying real hard too.

And Yes, her reasons are always she's busy.<br><br>We lost contact for more than 1 yr plus. I finally found her in April &amp; i was so darn happy. we celebrated her bdae, she sms me that nite, everythk went so well.<br>But the next time i asked her out, she always agree but on the day itself came up with a reason for not coming. The last time she stood me up, she didn't call me. i waited frm evenin to nite, strollin Orchard like a drifter..<br><br>So busy that she cannot even giv me a call to say she's nt turning up.. I feel so shattered. i mean, u wouldn't treat a normal fren tis way, wat's more after what we been thru.<br><br>Anway i hav always been amazed how easily &amp; thoroughly my ex forgets me. Too busy?? i am also in the uni nw, &amp; always wonder how busy can life actually be..<br><br>ultimately, its jus how much that person means to u rite?<br><br></div>
