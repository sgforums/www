I did told him about my view but he still think I am wrong. He always find my behaviour wrong &amp; impolite &amp; trying to correct me.

I will smile when I see Y sms but I always tell myself I cannot "hiew" Y as I already got a boyfriend. I cannot have a chance to be in the kind of temptation at all. I should be loyal to my bf but frankly speaking my bf often ignores me when he is busy at work. He seems to be able to live without me.

My advices are always hash thats why many people could not take it.<br><br>From the above story only proves I am rite, you love your bf too much.<br>With my very own eyes I saw gals and guys like you who tolerate this kinda of behaviour for years. The results sadly is the same, only 20% end up in marriage and 80% end in seperation. Others like you put up 12 years... but in the end lost the battle cos they woke up one day to ask themselves why should they put up with it? They give so much in the end the other half just take it for granted and only hope for more.<br><br>In you I saw myself, I too love very deeply and given my life for the person I love. In the end I found out that she is only using my love for her own wants and needs. So what is love ? keep on giving knowing that she is using me or give up and find another gal? I took a brave step and ended my suffering.<br>I broke up with her and she finally realise her mistake. She tried to patch back with me but I refuse, the damage was done, I did my best and decided that was it.<br></div>

He will always think I still did not correct my mistake &amp; think I am right whenever I tried to reason out with him. And also I do not want to spoil the years of relationship with him. No one is perfect anyway. I just have to tolerate with him.

No guy does that to his gf !!! it's very damaging to ur self esteem if u stick with him. Are u willng to tolerate this ur whole life just cos u've been together 5 yrs ? Just cos of old memories sake? Break up with him and find someone new cos u deserve better .. guys like this should take a life lesson .. take it as u are making him a better person.<br><br>sometimes u need to be cruel to be kind..<br><br>btw, r u with him .. cos u r of marriable age, and u're afraid that if u leave him .. u won't be able to find another suitable life partner? do u feel that since u've been with him for 5 yrs .. u can withstand another.. 50 ? or .. do u sincerely love him for what he is, and accept him for whatever he's not. Think about it .. if u can find the answers to my question, i think u'd see the light at the end of the tunnel.<br><br>Good luck !!!<br></div>

I should be loyal to my bf but frankly speaking my bf often ignores me when he is busy at work. He seems to be able to live without me. But still he is with me for 5 years and I should not be in love with someone else. I am confused. Can anyone help me?</div></blockquote>Look at the way u talk about X and Y. Your boyfriend X, seems to be an imperfect boyfriend, because from what u are saying here, he seems to be a person full of bad points. Yet, ur description of Y is nothing but praise.<br><br>Ask urself this, what make u fall for ur boyfriend X in the first place? Why did u agree to become his girlfriend back then? Is he still the same guy before u entered into a relationship with him? Or do u think he has changed?<br><br>Also, ask urself if u like Y because he treats u better than ur bf? If ur bf were 2 be as nice as him, would u still like Y? Do u think its just a case of infauation? That u are merely treating him as a substitute because of ur bf's indifference towards u?<br><br>I would advise u to talk to ur bf. Tell him that u feel u are not being appreciated by him, that u wish he can treat u better. Don't tell him about Y because that would make him think that u want 2 leave him. Just ask him where u are in his heart, and whether he still loves u? Or is the relationship now stagnant, and u 2 are just together because of being used to it, and not because u two love each other anymore? In the end, I advise u 2 solve it quickly, because u are not only hurting urself with this problem, but also X and Y.</div>
