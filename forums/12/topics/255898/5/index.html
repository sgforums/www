            <div class='col-md body'>I dont noe if this helps.<br>Love is never one sided. It is always two sided. Whenever, yr bf indirectly hurt u, it hurts him too. It is just one of his ways to express his concern for u. If he is to change his character, it will even make the situation worse.<br><br>I am not saying that gal should tolerate guy or guy should tolerate gal. But I am saying that there is a root cause behind this kind of behaviour. I feel that yr bf has many feelings and thoughts locked up inside him. Feelings and thoughts that have been accumulated over years without sharing with some1 that resulted in this behaviour. Example : His mind is probably thinking that what he do is right coz he is thinking in a few more steps further than you.<br><br>This kind of relationship is probably :<br>1) The guy has difficulty in expressing<br>2) It is always the guy that solved the the girl's problem<br>3) Whenever, feelings and thoughts that are slipped out of the guy, it was never captured by the girl.<br><br>Haha... probably, what I say above is not well-appreciated.

He introduced his wife to me. She is very pretty and classy lady.<br><br>Due to work purposes, I had a lot chances to work with Y. Sometimes I wondered why I will start to search for him if I cannot see him within my sight in office and when I get home I tend to think of him also &amp; next minute conincidently his sms will arrive. I know its wrong to think of another guy especially when he is happily married with a nice wife. But maybe i should tell Y not to treat me so nice or I should avoid Y myself. Workwise how to avoid, unless i quite my job..There's once when I fell asleep on his shoulder while working overtime we both fall aslep together. I felt my face red like ang ku kuah when I wake up &amp; he also kept quiet...&amp; we both kept quiet...<br><br>anyway my boyfriend &amp; I are okay now, so far no arguments yet , just that I have no idea why my heart start to sway although I keep telling myself I cannot do that. </div></blockquote>Actually the real reason is simple. You long for your bf to be like him but you know Y is your friend only. If I guess correctly you have not told anyone else about this. Is a dream come true for you but I must warn you the more you play in this dream the more you will wish it will come true.<br><br>I can only advice you from my point of view but I know is hard to change.<br>In reality life still goes on, whether you like it or not.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you must keep your distance from Y since he is married. maybe he is trying to be friendly. you keep thinking of him because you are unhappy with your boyfriend and using Y to fill up your emptiness. if one day if you really break off with your bf, do not blame yourself, as you have many problems between the two of you, not because of Y.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I read all of your replies and here are my thoughts.<br><br>I canÂ’t really tell if your BF is an MCP or simply has difficulties showing you his affection in a kind way. He sounds like a proper lad so far if he treats his friends well and has stuck with you 5 years faithfully. It may not be a bad thing, waking up and smelling the coffee knowing you've got to make do with what you have. The perfect knight in shining armour isn't out there. Every relation we have with the ones around us has it's pros and cons. Some parts about them we like, other parts we don't. If you are the settling kind and looking for marriage, this boyfriend of yours sounds like decent material.<br><br>***<br><br>So you've been putting up with his bad behaviour for some time now and suspect it may have gone on for too long for you to put things right again. Why don't you start ignoring him the next time he disrespects you in public again? Respond to him after 2 weeks and let him know you've given things a careful thought. You love him but you don't feel respected and that's very important to you.<br><br>If you've got the guts to tell him what you expect, he might just give it to you. If you don't, be prepared to mull over an onslaught of power play for the rest of the time you're together. Relationships are mutual but you've got to realise what you expect and you mustn't be afraid of asking for it. If he knows he cannot get away with treating you badly in public, he might respect you more and things may change.<br><br>Avoid letting your self esteem take the needless beating. The boyfriend is nasty sometimes because you let him.<br><br>I had an ex who was a little like that. I bailed because he was verbally abusive, I responded with the same verbal abuse though after a few years, I realise I was living and struggling to keep up with his expectations in other aspects of my life. It was terrible. I figured in the end he was good for company and friendship, but detrimental for the loving. We are still friends today and in some ways, the conflict during that period of time was good for me. I would never have accomplished some of what I have today if he hadn't set high standards back then. It's all a matter of perspective and afterwards, a matter of choice.<br><br>***<br><br>As for Mr Y, your fellow colleague, he may have sensed your interest/crush in him, which was why he reminded you he is married before introducing his wife. Any married man in need of an affair with you probably would never have done that. Which is why I am puzzled by some of your posts.<br><br>Did Mr Y send you clear signals of wanting to pursue something romantic or sexual with you? Is it important to you? Because we all know itÂ’s a dumb move mixing business with pleasure unless heÂ’s your boss and youÂ’re guaranteed a swell promotion afterwards. Even dumber if it is a one sided walk.<br><br>Male friend of mine, Mr Peter found himself in similar situation. His girlfriend of 5 years was being pursued by her colleague, who was about to be married back then. The colleague had the cash, the car, the apartment, a doting wife, whilst my mate was just a struggling working guy. Mr Peter placed his trust in his girlfriend, allowed her to go out with that colleague for nightly suppers and wine sessions etc. The unspeakable happened and now Mr Peter is still with his girlfriend though he seems to have begun placing more emphasis on his own life than his girlfriend because she cheated. I think he has forgiven but couldnÂ’t forget. As an onlooker, their future looks bleak to me.<br><br>Mr Peter may not have what his girlfriend is looking for right now; stability, security and faithfulness as compared to the attention, passion and thrill her married colleague could spare, in a few years time though I think she would want a man like Mr Peter. Just not now. I think itÂ’s her age. Different girls want different things at different phases of their lives. Relationships are results of a poo poo platter of time and chance.<br><br>***<br><br>If you do want to pursue something with Mr Y for whatever need, and he responds, just remember youÂ’re both going to end up each otherÂ’s side trip. He has his wife to go home to and you, your boyfriend. And there are consequences behind everything we do. Have fun and good luck then girlie.<br><br></div>

Sometimes, due to some occasions which will make him lose face, he will scold me &amp; ignore me for a while, and always point that I am wrong. I did told him about my view but he still think I am wrong. He always find my behaviour wrong &amp; impolite &amp; trying to correct me.

            <div class='col-md body'>To VampireX,<br><br>I have one principle to share :<br>"It is natural that women need to feel loved, cherished and pampered by men. It is best that the man whom she loves and is in a relationship is going to be the guy that gives her the closest attention."<br><br>To restate your problem: You need tender love, but your bf is not giving enough of it to you. Y seems a good alternative, but like u said, it's not really about Y.<br><br>In some pple (in this forum's) eyes, Y is a bad guy. Well I would say that each situation is unique. I would say that there are plenty of guys out there who are similar to Y but unmarried, but are willing to try to love you the way you want. It's not about choosing between Y and ur bf. It's really about choosing a man whom u want . And believe me, you (like everyone else) is entitled to ur happiness, even if it means leaving ur bf.<br><br>How best to resolve ur problem: communicate. tell ur bf about all ur concerns (maybe u can show him this forum). write a list of his good and bad points, and ask him to do the same... and discuss each other's expectations. From ur MRT post, u may sound a little selfish, and he thinks that's wrong. But maybe his way of transforming u is hurting and faulting, as opposed to being loving and patient.<br><br>There is a whole world of difference between<br><br>"Dear, you should let others out first so that you can get in easily later" and<br><br>"Why do you always not let people out first all the time, don't be so selfish".<br><br>Give him a chance since like u said, you have been together for 5 years and he has his strong points. Tell him ur concerns, and if he still refuses to address it given countless chances, decide what you have to do, to seek the love a woman rightly wants.<br><br>To the guys out there,<br><br>Men who understand the above stated principle go a really long way to making their ladies the happiest and most fulfilled women in the world. It took me years to realize this, and years more to learn to apply this principle. And now I still consider myself an apprentice.<br><br>Men are stewards of their gf/wife's love.<br><br>My personal experience to share:<br>I used to take my wife for granted, doing some of the reprimanding things VampireX's bf did. And after a while, I realize she is quite perfect in my eyes but very unhappy. She started to unconsciously seek attention elsewhere, and believe me, there are many good guys out there willing to give it to her. I learn to be more humble, and less judgemental and "principled". Now she's my lovely sexy happy angel.<br></div>

Y undoubtedly is seeking an affair with you and if you like him, more importantly, if this is making you happy, whats wrong?!  especially when your relationship with your current boyfriend is taking you nowhere.  X has taken you for granted and you will forever be at the receiving end in the relationship.  I dare say, if this relationship works out in the end, it can only happen at your dear expense!</div>
