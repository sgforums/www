            <div class='col-md body'>i am so angry with my bf . Yesterday I called him and a girl answered his phone. He said he has forgotten his hp at her home. I ask him what is he doing at her home? he answer that he send her home as they just had a gathering with a group of friends. I also discovered the girl's photo on his handphone  when I tried to use his hp to take photo of the rain today, I saw alot of the girl's photograph with different pose somemore ..different smile at different capture .damn act Cute but Not Cute!.<br><br>see liao also feel like vomitting , is he trying to hint me to break with him? So pissed off! I ask him how come got girl photo he answered that he is not aware of it and probably the girl has used it to test the camera effect. I did not check on his sms as I do not have the habit.  when I ask him more than 3 questions, he say i don't trust him , making a big fuse on this matter. Now become he angry with me.<br><br>Also he will be going on a week's trip with his this group of friends (including the girl) to Taiwan and not letting me to go with him. He say he know I am busy at work so did not ask me along. He never even ask me and all he do is he make decision himself. Everytime also like that. with his busy schedule at work, he never ask me to go holiday with him but he can always go holiday with his family and friends or colleagues. I wonder if he really treat me as his gf. He can even forget my birthday and went out with his friends. He refused to go out to celebrate on valentine's day saying its crowded. We never celebrate valentine's day for about 3 yrs!He also did not help me celebrate my birthday for 2 years.<br><br>You think I should still trust him?</div>

Settle down before it's too late.<br><br>BE WITH someone you truly love and wish to marry. Not someone who can just give a moment of sweet love.<br><br>Change your character to match each other and carry on customizing till forever. By then you would be perfect in each other's heart.<br>Always believe that your partner makes you a better person.<br><br>But i do know of guys who really sux to the core.<br>girls please protect yourself and always be aware of a guy's intention.<br><br></div></blockquote>You are a dinasour liao!  At least your frens change for the better.</div>

Yesterday I called him and a girl answered his phone. He said he has forgotten his hp at her home. I ask him what is he doing at her home? he answer that he send her home as they just had a gathering with a group of friends. I also discovered the girl's photo on his handphone  when I tried to use his hp to take photo of the rain today, I saw alot of the girl's photograph with different pose somemore ..different smile at different capture .damn act Cute but Not Cute!.<br><br>see liao also feel like vomitting , is he trying to hint me to break with him? So pissed off! I ask him how come got girl photo he answered that he is not aware of it and probably the girl has used it to test the camera effect. I did not check on his sms as I do not have the habit.  when I ask him more than 3 questions, he say i don't trust him , making a big fuse on this matter. Now become he angry with me.<br><br>Also he will be going on a week's trip with his this group of friends (including the girl) to Taiwan and not letting me to go with him. He say he know I am busy at work so did not ask me along. He never even ask me and all he do is he make decision himself. Everytime also like that. with his busy schedule at work, he never ask me to go holiday with him but he can always go holiday with his family and friends or colleagues. I wonder if he really treat me as his gf. He can even forget my birthday and went out with his friends. He refused to go out to celebrate on valentine's day saying its crowded. We never celebrate valentine's day for about 3 yrs!He also did not help me celebrate my birthday for 2 years.<br><br>You think I should still trust him?</div></blockquote>Please lah, Dun let us gals down lah, just kick his ass and dick and dump him far far away. Get real gal, why stick to one rotton banana when there are so much other much nicer, big and strong bananas around.<br><br>Bring out the gal intergrity and pride in it, for boys today, you dun have to please them one lah, the more you please and beg, the more they ya ya and go do their own way. Be tough and tell them off, they will come begging on knees before you...make them know we gals are not so easy get bullied, dun be so desparate as tho the world is left with one boy only ya.<br><br>Be strong and tough ya, if not they will eat you raw, like me, if bf dare to cheat me, that's it, no more call, no more answering, no more talking till he confess and admit it, even then, I will try to make his life difficult so that he has to wake up his damn bloody mind.<br><br>That is why me still no steady bf lah. All run like coward liao.</div>
