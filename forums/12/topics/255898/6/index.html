            <div class='col-md body'>I mentioned that I did not have feelings for Y and should not have feelings for him. These few weeks, I feel so bad, I don't know why. I seem to start to have feelings for Y now.  when we are together, we are always happily laughing and chatting like as though we are 1 couple..<br><br>if Y still continue to treat me so nice I don't know if I will accept him but as what ?Mistress? and I already have a bf!Sometimes I really think as long as 2 person happy can already, why must we still think for the surroundings ?  ...but cannot..I know its wrong. I am confused. Never faced such a problem before. Anyone here have same problem like me?  Anyway I must try to resist my temptation &amp; treat him as a friend and thats All ! no more than that..The most I am sad and keep all my feelings beneath me and act strong.... ..and of course can pour out my feelings here only. Sorry to hear my pourings here. Maybe someone feel like slapping me right now after hearing what I had said.But still, I will continue to write here as I can only be my real self here. Maybe I should not have ask for so much, I am not fit to ask for more since I may not be around anymore one day  but will not be gone so fast.as long as it does not arise again..nobody knows about it in real life.... Anyway everyone has to go one day I already look at the bright side...if it arise again, I will give up everything I have &amp; spend the last few moments alone myself.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">   thanks for being my audience everyone! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>VampireX,<br><br>it seems that your situation has evolved from being dissatisfied with ur bf to resisting temptations from Y.<br><br>Temptations are everywhere. Don't blame yourself.<br><br>It is obvious Y is "following his heart" and doing the wrong thing (No married men should lust after another woman's bosom). But do you want to resist him? Your head says "Yes!", but your heart says "No!".<br><br>What can you do? I have 2 proposed solutions for you:<br><br>1) Break off with Y. Quit your job if you think your job is worth the sacrifice.<br>2) Do nothing and continue ur status quo.<br><br>Number 1 is the only way you want to avoid doing something wrong. Everyone here can see that more and more romance would build up between you and Y, eventually leading to passionate acts. And I'm sorry to say that this is going to be very very difficult but the correct thing to do when you look back 3 years later.<br><br>Number 2 is to wait and see. This puts your own fate out of your hands. If Y desires you enough to seduce you, you would end up naked in his bed. If Y stops short of seducing you for the love of his wife, you may end up with a bitter sweet taste of what could have been, but would be glad things turn out that way in the long run.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i used to have an ex who is also like ur 5 years bf- always think strangers is right.<br><br>i remember there was once i got into a car accident- i was stopping at the traffic light when someone guy bang onto my bumper of my car.<br><br>the 1st person i called was my ex. he didnt even ask me how i was.. whether i was hurt etc etc.... and start accusing me of not driving properly... and insisted that i stop suddenli..... tats y the car bang onto my bumper. SO according to him- all accident is my fault.. and no words of concern.<br><br>another accident happen 2 months after this... my hsemates have all graduated and moved out and i was alone at home then. i was scared tat day because there were two houses near my place being robbed in the afternoon, yes in the afternoon!!!! and the police haven caught the robber yet but they suspect the robber is still in the area. i called the same ex again... and all he can sae is- is ok ok one.. never mind- dunno y u make a big fuss out of it..... i insisted this time for him to come over to pei me... but all he can sae is that i am making a big fuss out of everything and no calls after to check to see if i am ok...<br><br>i broke up with him after wat happen the third time.. when i was at his place asking him to direct me to a pharmacy... and he called me stupid and useless because i cannot understand what his instruction was, and i went home crying.<br><br>my advice here is, if he treats stranger better than u.... and not being understanding... situation will get worse as time goes by. even though 5 years relationship is not something that is easy to let go off, but think in the long term- wat if his attitude towards u get worse?? wat happens?? y drag on??<br><br>just my opinion for u.</div>
