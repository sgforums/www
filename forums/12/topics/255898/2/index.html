Not that i'm trying to break you guys up. Ask yourself whether is this the man you want to be with for the rest of your life or you want to know better ones out there. Tolerating isn't going to last forever so he needs to understand you and is he doing it at all?<br><br>Next, never ever shit where you eat. Believe me, always check your surroundings &amp; the colleagues that you have. Somethimes office environment &amp; comments passed can be very unfriendly. Guys normally dun bother so its you who need to make that concious effort to observe 1st.<br><br>Best of luck  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

I was speaking in reference to my situation on yr general statement on SG girls stepping on 2 boats at the same time. In no way was it a reference to the TS.<br><br>You have a very immature view of things by stereotyping everything together and think you know alot about love from what you have written to be able to be so critical of others  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I know what love is, that was why I gave him chance after chance hoping that he will change for the better.<br><br>It did not take me 2 yrs to realise that I cannot take the abuse. But every time I tried to leave he will cry and beg and my heart will soften.<br><br>The sad thing is after time, it became a habit and I reflect back now and did think why was I stupid to waste so much of my time. Humans are afterall creatures of habit and by that point of time my self-confidence have already dropped to a big fat zero. In the end I believed what he said how useless I was and how no guy will ever want me and accept me for who I am. That was how bad it got and how my self-confidence dropped.<br><br>Then I met my husband. He was everything my ex was not. He never once put me down and encouraged and supported me and I was lucky to meet my ex-boss who advised me and pointed out that the relationship I was in was not normal. Finally I made up my mind to break it off once and for all cleanly. You have no idea the hell I had to go through coz he turned into a stalker and hounded me everyday cried and begged and turn up at my house and called me at weird hours in the night.<br><br>I can tell you that everyone is a nice chap at the beginning in a relationship. It is only when you are in it for a while then things start to change past the honeymoon period. Sure she will also try to justify why she should remain in the relationship like I did in the past like me finding excuses on why he is nice when everything nice he did before was like months or yrs ago even before we became bf n gf.<br><br>What I want to tell the TS is that the ultimate decision lies with her but if a guy is abusive verbally and breaks down your self-confidence it is really time to move on because no man does that to a woman he truely loves.<br><br></div>

I find many ppl who say she is trying to step on 2 boats at one go is not looking at the deeper issue of how she is being treated by her current bf.<br><br>I believe TS should search deep in her heart and ask herself some questions. I am sure she has her share of good times with her bf before, especially in the beginning. However, TS needs to ask herself whether she loves her bf more or her bf loves her more or whether she is reluctant to give up her current relationship because it is what she is comfortable and familiar with. To me at least, the definition of love is to put the other person's interest before one's self, irregardless of what others will view you. I won't really call constantly being put down by her bf when he should be the one at her side supporting her a good definition of 'love'.<br><br>Well TS, just ask yourself whether your current relationship is going anywhere. For most ppl I know, they will probably be married by now after 2-3 years of dating. Also, ask you yourself whether you are able to live with a guy for 10-30 years who is constantly more concerned about how ppl view him than supporting you.</div>
