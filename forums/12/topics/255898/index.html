I did thought to do that. But somehow i don't want to quarrel over these tiny small things with him. He is stubborn &amp; always think he is right.<br><br>Sometimes, its really pointless to talk to him. He will always think I still did not correct my mistake &amp; think I am right whenever I tried to reason out with him. And also I do not want to spoil the years of relationship with him. No one is perfect anyway. I just have to tolerate with him. He is very nice most of the time just that temper bad only.<br><br>There's once happened 2 years ago, when I accidentally fell down a block of stairs &amp; roll down. My legs were bleeding &amp; so pain till I cannot walk properly, he scolded me for not paying attention &amp; did not walk properly. He even added that I totally throw his face in public.<br><br>He walk off rapidly &amp; I just lipping my leg following him. I am angry but still I tolerate. I apologise to him saying I should have walk carefully next time. I also don't know how long can I stand him. I can always advise my girlfriends this kind of man don't want suak suak ki, but when happen to myself, I really don't know how to handle. Actually I am quite afraid one day I may let off everything &amp; ignore him, then it will really be the end of our relationship.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a couple in a relationship takes some years to really know each other. since you both are together for 5 years, he would be thinking that you should know him very well by now. that's why maybe when he treats you that way, he is assured that you must be understanding enough and won't get upset cos that's what he is. i believe your bf still loves you alot and maybe too comfy with you and also get carried with work that he may overlook your needs and attention cos i guess he's too assured that you are always there for him. sometimes problem can arise from here when the other party is neglected.<br><br>having crush is normal and it creeps in when especially your situation now cos what you want so much now is some attention and understanding. it's ok to be friends but still gotta draw a line if you know who u still love. remember, it takes years to get to know a person well enough and a new guy is a new beginning and sometimes he would turn out to be better or worst. you choose. but before anything, it's best to really sit and talk things over a dinner. organise a get away holiday, shower him with pamper and nice soothing moments and tell him you also love to be treated this way.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  hopes this helps a little in some ways.<br>i'm not good in relationship sometimes, but at times it is also not that difficult to bring back the attention from the guy u love.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think everyone has some flaws in many ways, no one is perfect. i've been married for 7 years and been through the rough and good times. sometimes i also can't tolerate my hubby but what keeps me going is love and love sometimes cannot be described or explained. walking out is the last last last resort and also NOT the best solution. if you have done all your very best and you think you have enough and need to move on, then one advice from me. by all means P&amp;G - pack and go...! with, a smile. take it cool, leave it cool.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Take time to evaluate what's going on and pay mind that you've been with your current bf for 5 years.<br><br>Although 5 years' not a long time, it's not a short period either. I'm not surprised your heart fickle a little when the nice guy from your company came along, especially when your bf isn't all sensitive.<br><br>But ask yourself why do you stick with him for a period of 5 years, surely there is something that you cherish. I wouldn't tell you that your good feelings for the new guy is just passing or anything along that line. But I hope you will take time to evaluate the situation, don't let emotions cloud your head and destroy something you build up for 5 years.<br><br>In conclusion, I quote from bontakun "Love without committment is passion; committment without love is duty."<br><br>May you have the wisdom the tell the difference <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I realized my previous post was alittle biased towards your bf.<br><br>So to add on,<br><br>You should also ask yourself whether you're still in the relationship because it's your comfort zone or you truly love him.<br><br>Humans are creatures of habits; we can get so comfortable with an uncomfortable routine. And that is dangerous, be clear-minded when handling matters of the heart.</div>
