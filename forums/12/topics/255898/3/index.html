In the beginning, you fell in love with<br>your  spouse. You anticipated their call, wanted their touch, and liked their  idiosyncrasies.<br><br>Falling in love with your spouse wasn't hard. In fact,  it was a<br>completely natural and spontaneous experience.<br>You didn't have  to DO anything.

It's a passive and  spontaneous experience.<br><br>But after a few years of marriage, the euphoria  of  love fades. It's the<br>natural cycle of EVERY relationship. Slowly  but surely, phone calls<br>become a bother (if they come at all), touch is not  always welcome (when<br>it happens), and your spouse's idiosyncrasies, instead  of being cute, drive you nuts.<br><br>The symptoms of this stage vary with  every relationship, but if you<br>think about your marriage, you will notice a  dramatic difference between<br>the initial stage when you were in love and a  much duller or even angry subsequent stage.<br><br>At this point, you  and/or your spouse might start asking, "Did I marry<br>the right person?" And  as you and your spouse reflect on the euphoria of<br>the love you once had,  you may begin to desire that experience with<br>someone else. This is when  marriages breakdown. People blame their<br>spouse for their unhappiness and  look outside their marriage for fulfillment.<br><br>Extramarital  fulfillment comes in all shapes and sizes. Infidelity is<br>the most obvious.

He will always think I still did not correct my mistake &amp; think I am right whenever I tried to reason out with him. And also I do not want to spoil the years of relationship with him. No one is perfect anyway. I just have to tolerate with him. He is very nice most of the time just that temper bad only.<br><br>There's once happened 2 years ago, when I accidentally fell down a block of stairs &amp; roll down. My legs were bleeding &amp; so pain till I cannot walk properly, he scolded me for not paying attention &amp; did not walk properly. He even added that I totally throw his face in public.<br><br>He walk off rapidly &amp; I just lipping my leg following him. I am angry but still I tolerate. I apologise to him saying I should have walk carefully next time. I also don't know how long can I stand him. I can always advise my girlfriends this kind of man don't want suak suak ki, but when happen to myself, I really don't know how to handle. Actually I am quite afraid one day I may let off everything &amp; ignore him, then it will really be the end of our relationship. </div></blockquote>wah. nvr even help u up? if this were to happen to my gf the first thing i will do is to carry her on my back and put her down in some place where i can seek more help. scolding only comes later lo. coz similar incident happened to my gf and the first thing i did was to carry her back(lucky she is light weight) to somewhere else to treat her injuries.<br><br>i think he is more concerned abt his face den u. consider carefully whether do u still wan him or nt. a nice guy doesnt mean he is gd. some guys can treat u v nice but when u are in trouble or needs help, dey simply walk off and leave u in lurch. such guys are bastards, in my opinion. i dunnoe abt u. 5 years VS rest of ur life. choose one.<br><br>sure, some guys have high ego but doesnt mean dey can do anything dey wan. =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>See which one you are happier with lor. Romances and crushes are always beautiful in the beginning (the truth hurts) and tend to fade as time goes by (just like you and your bf relationship). Will this also happen if you choose your colleage and dump your boyfriend? So, think twice before you really think he is the one and not your boyfriend. Anyway, you are not married, and you can still choose.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, I am so touched by all your advices, no matter is good or bad . Thanks for scolding or encouraging me. After reading all your replies, I got many thinking from different directions. Really thanks !Different people give different opinion.<br><br>Sorry I started the topic without thinking what topic to put as I am too concentrate to write the content so just anyhow type "in love with another guy" , actually i treat him like my colleague only or maybe just a friend . Y is a popular guy in my company and he encourages me in my studies &amp; my work. We contact through email &amp; sms mostly. We sometimes went for lunch but not often. Really a good friend. Me like his character not love lar. He ever date me out but I rejected. As I got a bf already, how can I go out with other guys on a date. I cannot be unloyal to my bf anyway.<br><br>I agree my bf is a MCP. he can be very nice. he is very friendly and fillal , always help his friends or others and even strangers. He can't stand rudeness especially he see kids nowadays behaving so badly. He is caring but is not mushy type and not romantic. When he went overseas to work, he will not contact with me much, maybe 1 or 2 phone calls over 2 months &amp; he will not say "I miss you" those kind of words. when he is back,I realise he often buy back alot things for me. He always care about me but does not show out. He will often say I am troublesome but in the end still will give in to me at times when he knows my heart.<br><br>He is those cool cool type not those sticky kinda guys. But  I am disappointed with him when there was once I asked him if he can be without gf. and he say he can be alone even without gf. Its okay to him. So i am quite sad about this.<br><br>Of course, other things like many times he will scold me when I did not use my brain to think before asking him questions. one example is when he already told me he is meeting his friend and I later ask him if he wana go his home for dinner. He will scold me for not using my brain like he already told me why I still ask somemore. Sometimes I really forget. I think of what I ask what. seems like I tend to make him angry easily.<br><br>Zeny mentioned some things which i agree. Maybe that's why I still tolerating him is because I love him more than anything. by the way, i am 25 my bf is 29. i always hear people says that guys are career minded. I guess my bf is trying his best in his career.<br><br>Everyone has a temper i guess. Sometimes he did go out to karaoke with his colleague girls and I used to nag at him saying how come he's the only guy. He will reply me saying that its all about trust and we should have mature thinking. If I kept restrict him  like this means that I don't trust him. Later I did not question him as I thought I should trust him. and yes so far he never betray me before.<br><br>I like him as he give me a security feeling he shows no interest in other girls  , his normal hobbies is watching soccer &amp; playing playstation just like normal guys. I would say only thing bad about him is his temper. Whenever he cannot stand my action, he will turn suddenly from smiling to an angry face telling me what i did wrong &amp; I am always apologising to him. He can also scold me in front of his relatives &amp; never give me face also. He always want me to socialise with his relatives but I often smile &amp; did not talk much things.<br><br>for his temper, actually everyone always say I am patient  but nowadays I start to wonder how long can I be . Yes can I tolerate this kinda behaviour for 10 more years? I really don't know.<br><br></div>
