              <p>This is probably because <strong>YOU ARE VERY FULL OF YOURSELF. I rather pick a fat nerd than you.  </strong>Being full of yourself is a huge red flag and girls don't like it. Maybe some maturity and growing up will make you realize that looks isn't everything. </p>
              <p>Your shallowness shows how much of a douchebag you are. I bet the so called, "fat nerdy loser" guy has a superior personality than you. </p>
