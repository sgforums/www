              <p>4) do u only love someone because u received the same token of "love" is that love or selffish that u seek?</p>
              <p>nobody in this forum can predict your relationship...nobody can tell future. But relationship needs both hands to clap.</p>
              <p>Do u feel that relationship with her only is important when during Your bad time u need emotional support from her?  Once your emotional needs are over you don't need her support anymore........ but when u don't need her emotional support....It maybe that she is in her bad time and she needs your emotional support are you giving it to her?</p>
              <p>See a strong relationship require both hands to clap in Good times and bad times.......</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>U and I are also facing the same problem. Sometimes i cant believe what he said due to some history too. But i chose to give him one last time and trust him. One day if he did anything again, i will go. If u cant find yrself to trust her anymore, maybe u shd move on.</div>

              <p>break up bah.  one moment want, next moment don't want. one moment love, next moment friend.  spend so much time and energy getting close.  when get close le, then doubt and drama again.  really sian.   forget it lah.  think no hope.</p>
              <p>reasons for failure - flickering thoughts, doubt, disbelief, playing hard to get, technical difficulties, wrestling with the past and present troubles, super sensitivity with words, super cautious and risk-averse (due to her suffering past hurts, i know), shopping mentality</p>
              <p>insanity is hoping to get a different result by doing the same thing 
                  over and over again. unless we take it to a totally different level and 
                  do this in a totally different way, i think difficult.  even if somewhere there is "true love", with this type of environment, how can the seed grow ?  give up lah.  if we really destined to be together, maybe our paths will cross in the future.  this is illusion from the beginning, and to think that we dreamt together through sweet dreams and nightmares for 2 years.  i will miss her.  but i really don't know what else i can do.  cheers and take care</p>

              TTFU, u r right on 'There is a limit to drama, things just cant keep happening'. 
              
              My bf recently gave me a lot of shitty stuff again.We've talked so much about it in the past and seem like things will never be improved. I've chosen to call for the final break. This will be a good time now since he's flying tmr and will be away for 10 days and I could use this period to recover and be able to face him once again when he's back.
