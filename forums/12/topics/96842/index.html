            <div class='col-md body'>Hey fluffy...<br><br>I get that feeling sometimes too... and its really really hard to describe... I feel like crying... but I dont know what to cry about? Yea, I do lie on bed and stare at the ceiling... Lasts for a few hours..<br><br>There's a quick remedy to this, I'm not sure if you would approve of it.. Normally, when that feeling sinks in, I get my running shoes, drag myself downstairs and run... Run for as long as I like... Come home all sweaty and so tired.. then I take a cold shower...<br><br>After that you'll feel much much better...<br><br>If you dont feel like running, you can always get a beer..not too much!.. U know, the old saying "chill out man, get a beer"<br><br>let me know what you think.</div>

Then the solution will be to find alternative solutions and get into the ideal body mass.<br>This is not a disease, in fact it occured to a majority of the population in a way or another, it is nothing uncommon about it. Like as stated above you will have to find the root of the problem. Well, if it gets worst.... then you will have to get help from professionals.</div>
