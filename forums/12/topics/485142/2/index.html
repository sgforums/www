              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I’m a 16 year old student and the O levels are coming up.<br> Everyone keeps telling me to study hard and stuff.</p>
              <p>Recently, my teacher has asked us to submit testimonials and
              stressed the importance of it for finding a good job. It suddenly
              dawned upon me that I’m going to be 18 in 2 years time and sort of
              become an adult. It is quite a scary revelation that I have to work
              and provide a living for my parents and be all on my own.</p>
              <p>I’m an only child which makes things even more frustrating. That
              means there’s no one to turn to when I have problems in the future,
              and when my parents die I’ll be reallly alone. I’m not really close
              with my cousins as they’re like adults while i’m in my teens.</p>
              <p>My ambition is to be a lawyer. Its hard to get in, and looking
              at my credentials, I doubt I can get in. My strength is in the
              humanities and not in the sciences. Looking at numbers just irks
              me, while you throw me a bunch of papers with small and wordy
              paragraphs and I’ll be more than happy to read it. I’m prepared to
              score through long law journals and all the tedious stuff, but not
              to become some engineer or doctor and study about newtonian physics
              and all that shit. I heard they take in excellent students who are
              good in everything including academics and cca and are full of
              talent.</p>
              <p>Yesterday, we just had our farewell party for the graduating sec
              4s in my cca. I’m a loner in my cca. I used to have a friend but
              she ditched me and joined a group of people, and there I was, alone
              since sec 2. I tried socializing, we can only talk for a short
              while and we are asked to do different activities for the cca. I
              tried to befriend the juniors since if my same age peers reject me
              I can always find other people, but its hard find chances to
              interact. My cca teachers must be gossiping about how much a loner
              I am to my form teachers and its reallly embarrassing enough to
              knwo that nobody wants me, its bad enough when they think I’m
              antisocial. But I tried to socialize just that they don’t see it!
              I’m really angry and feel really ‘yuan wang’ . How am i going to
              survive in the private sector workplace competitive private sector
              if i’m going to be a lawyer?</p>
              <p>Recently, my cousin got into <span>NUS</span> Medicine
              and is on his way to become a doctor. I feel happy for him, our
              family finally has a doctor. But I also feel stunned and pressured
              after that because that means all my relatives would be gossiping
              about how great he is. Everyone is saying that he is the ‘wai sun’
              and I’m the ‘nei sun’, so its not that amazing that he got into
              medicine because he is not really part of our family, and now my
              parents are pushing me to strike out something good myself too and
              give them sth to be proud of. My parents are quite jealous because
              they’re dream was for me to be doctor but its just not the job for
              me! Being a doctor is not an easy job, what if you contract your
              patient’s disease? Thus, there is only one way to go, to get into
              law, but the problem is, I can’t really get in. Urgh, life sucks.
              What am I going to do if i don’t get in? maybe be a magazine writer
              but my interest is in law! If i go all the way for my dream and I
              don’t get it, is it really worth it? Its hard being an only
              child.</p>

              Hi Floraet
              
              1. Always remember "Bird of the same feather flock together". So first thing is to be yourself. Accept yourself, accept what you are like and your value. Next is to improve yourself to the type of person you want to befriend. Example if you like your friend to be more positive, be more positive yourself.
              
              2. You need to know what you really want in life not what your parent want. Remember it is you who going to live your life not your parent. All parent like to compare their kids with others, trust me. However most of them forget that kids have learned to take responsible of their own life and parent can only provide guidance. My advice, study what you will enjoy doing in the future. We have too many unhappy employees in Singapore, we donâ€™t need another one.

              Why don't you consider pro-bono consulting services to build your skills in law. Fair enough you haven't got the grades but doesn't mean you couldn't put a good story across. Pro-bono consulting services may offer you the opportunity to build the experience in that.
              
              I do quite a bit of pro-bono work on the weekends and could share with you the places that specializes in these areas. Specifically you will work in teams to support start-ups or failing social welfare organizations or just attend to their general issues/problems.

              <p>Dont be stress.. Whats there to be stress at? </p>
              <p>You already mention that doctor isnt the path for you and you prefer the lawyer path. If your parents are really looking for a doctor to be their son/daughter, tell them to go adopt one. </p>
              <p>Life is too short to be living in people's shadow or parents directed path. You live your own life, and by that, it doesnt mean you go around smacking your parents silly physically. </p>
              <p>Sit them down and explain to them that life is too short to be pursusing something that is not of your interest. Explain to them that life can end anytime. Even now, you might just get blown away by a charging iphone or maybe an airplane will drop on you while you are walking to school. Shyt just happen anytime. If you cant convince them of your dreams and decision, then maybe you should rethink your future as a lawyer. Lawyers depend alot on if you cant convince you confuse tactic to make a living. </p>
              <p>What you need to do is maybe get a part time outdoor sales job that will put you in everyone's way. Talk to them, sell your stuff express yourself. Convince and confuse people into buying your stuff. If you cant do that, then maybe you can try taking up office administrator as your secondary job path. </p>
              <p>Dreams need action to be fulfill not just by sitting there and pulling your own hair. </p>
