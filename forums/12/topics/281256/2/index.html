My point is most people don't fear death or don't think about death until the end is at hand and at that point everyone would be scared.</div></blockquote>How can you be so sure that everyone will be scared when death is at their doorstep ?<br><br>Have you interview everyone that is facing death ??<br><br>You fear death, that is normal, most people do including myself. But why are u reacting so negetively towards those who don't ?</div>
