              <p>How should I start ...</p>
              <p>I'm a guy, roamed the earth for 2 decades just any other human being. Had been in sgforums for quite sometimes, but this is the first time I am sharing my personal agony, cause I seriously have no ideas on how to deal with it.... </p>
              <p>The last time I fell was during my secondary school days, when I  miserably took 3 three years to gather my courage to confess to her about my feeling. Furthermore, it's only during the period when we are close to graduate and walk a seperate path, that I manage to buck up myself and confess to her. Although, I succeed but this relationship does not last. I gave up, due to my foolishness of thinking about those contradiction that it will be hard to be together when we walked a seperate path. Back then , I hated that feeling and told myself that will be the first and the last time.</p>
              <p>Not long after I enter my poly route, luck was on me (I guess) , a girl actually fall for me and confessed her feeling for me . At first, I was totally against it , but somehow I gave in and gave it a try. I just couldn't get back the same feeling and this result in me giving up again....</p>
              <p>I was lost on the track of so called "love". What's love ? I dont need one...? Sometimes, when one said that they are finding for their other half due to the emptiness in their heart? Emptiness ...? I wonder how's the feeling like .... Perhaps, I am just not ready or either not old enough to understand such complex stuff.</p>
              <p>Time really flies, I can still rememeber the feeling of the days when I actually sent my "first" home at night after a day of hard work ,revising. I grew up understanding that everything was in the past, it's no longer happening. It's not fair how you were gone and how fast you are moving on, while I am still trap in the past. I grew , grew up of it...</p>
              <p>Recently, I found my heartbeat for this girl. She was older then me by three.She stay in Singapore but her homeland is in malaysia. Not possible to be together? Ha, I guess so. The more I get to know her, the deeper I fell... Knowing that she's single, I sent her flowers and a portrait of her to her workplace without leaving my name behind through delivery. I knew she liked them alot as she took a photo of it and set it on her msn display pic. Somehow, I really wonder if she knew it was sent by me....</p>
              <p>Can somebody tell how can I tell if she's really interested in me ? I tried to chat with her frequently on msn. She will replied but she never initiated a chat with me for even once. Does it means that she's not interested ? Or she actually felt for the guy that sent her the flowers. </p>
              <p> Perhaps, I should just give up ......</p>

              <p><br>Good gals usually are shy to initiate. So TS don't worry. Most important is how she chat with. Do u always have a fruitful chat with each other?</p>
              <p>For y case, is a bit strange. U have 2 r/s before but u still cannot muster enough courage. Don't give yrself so much pressure by confessing it. Instead give both of u time to cultivate love and it will be more easier for u to spell out the word that u love her easier.</p>
              <p>Try asking her out, if she accept. It means that is a good sign. Don't tell her so soon u are the one sending out flower.Even she ask u, tell her u send her the flower becos u see her quite moody and just trying to cheer her up.. Enjoy the courtship and don't kill it so fast first.</p>

              <p>Infatuatiion or love?</p>
              <p>The mind can't tell the difference.</p>
              <p>Both will have the same motivational force.</p>
              <p>The opposite of love is fear, and not hate as commonly perceived.</p>
              <p>Rule of the thumb, love move you to the positive, fear to the negative.</p>
              <p>Love make you yearn for the girl, fear stops you.</p>

              <p>The story of Mr Give up.</p>
              <p>"</p>
              <p>The last time I fell was during my secondary school days,
                                      when I  miserably took 3 three years to gather my
                                      courage to confess to her about my feeling. Furthermore, it's only
                                      during the period when we are close to graduate and walk a
                                      seperate path, that I manage to buck up myself and confess to her.
                                      Although, I succeed but this relationship does not last.<strong> I gave up</strong>,
                                      due to my foolishness of thinking
                                      about those contradiction that it will be hard to be
                                      together when we walked a seperate path. Back then , I hated that
                                      feeling and told myself that will be the first and the last
                                      time.</p>
              <p>Not long after I enter my poly route, luck was on me
                                      (I guess) , a girl actually fall for me and confessed her
                                      feeling for me . At first, I was totally against it , but
                                      somehow I gave in and gave it a try. I just couldn't get
                                      back the same feeling and this result in me <strong>giving up</strong> again....</p>
              <p>I was lost on the track of so called "love". What's love ? I
                                      dont need one...? Sometimes, when one said that they are finding
                                      for their other half due to the emptiness in their
                                      heart? Emptiness ...? I wonder how's the feeling like ....
                                      Perhaps, I am just not ready or either not old enough to
                                      understand such complex stuff.</p>
              <p>Time really flies, I can still rememeber the feeling
                                      of the days when I actually sent my
                                      "first" home at night after a day of hard work ,revising.
                                      I grew up understanding that everything was in the past, it's no
                                      longer happening. It's not fair how you were gone and
                                      how fast you are moving on, while I am still trap in
                                      the past. I grew , grew up of it...</p>
              <p>Recently, I found my heartbeat for this girl. She was older then
                                      me by three.She stay in Singapore but her homeland is in malaysia.
                                      Not possible to be together? Ha, I guess so. The more I get to know
                                      her, the deeper I fell... Knowing that she's single, I sent her
                                      flowers and a portrait of her to her workplace without leaving my
                                      name behind through delivery. I knew she liked them alot as she
                                      took a photo of it and set it on her msn display pic. Somehow,
                                      I really wonder if she knew it was sent by me....</p>
              <p>Can somebody tell how can I tell if she's really interested
                                      in me ? I tried to chat with her frequently on msn. She will
                                      replied but she never initiated a chat with me for even once. Does
                                      it means that she's not interested ? Or she actually felt for
                                      the guy that sent her the flowers. </p>
              <p> Perhaps, I should just <strong>give up</strong> ......"</p>

              <p>I aint the most polite guy here, nor the politically correct fella around, but i do know that when someone post here on AA, it is only borne out of a need, to sort out confusions. There really is no need to hurt anyone, TS or those who offer their views, right or wrong. This aint speakers corner. There is no need to drive the knife deeper, which sometimes, could be literal than figurative.</p>
              <p>We ourselves do not have the answers, no one really does, for none of us are lofty immortals, fully detached from the mortal emotion filled world, capable of clarity that would be inhuman.</p>
              <p>Some will try reverse psychology. Some will try other methods, But in the end, it is to help a stranger, sharing a perspective which either one has experienced or taught. I doubt if posters in AA meant any harm, save the odd trolls that are regularly recognised and ignored instantly, for they bear no serious food for thought.</p>
              <p>I too, may be deemed a troll, for my perspectives are often at odds at many, but i mean no one any harm, only sharing my perspective, and often up to the reader to judge or discard...</p>
              <p>As an answer to TS, i have no solutions, except that you must ask yourself how deep do you treasure and cherish her. If you truly feels she is the one for you, for the rest of your life, then you must somehow pluck up courage to confront her and share your feelings with her.</p>
              <p>Your fears are common, just like all of us humans, and that is rejection - the rush of blood into your head and face, the self perceived humiliation, the laughter you sense others and worse, her will utter in your face for being too revealing.</p>
              <p>But know what you really want. You are at the turning point of your life. Either you lose something good, which you claim and believe so, or you may end up building a lasting relationship with her.</p>
              <p>Once a person is at the end of the road, there is turning back. You really have nothing more to lose, for to walk away, you will lose her, but if she reject you, what would you have lost? Pride? How much is that worth? Reputation? What had she destroyed that you cannot rebuild again, if there is any need in the first place.</p>
              <p>SO, what have you to lose by sharing your true feelings, if you are sincere about her?</p>

              <p>Are you trying to overcome your fear of confession or just looking for support from forumers so that you can give up on her? Happiness is in your own hands, dude. Go after her like how a guy should! So what if she rejects you? That's just a learning experience for you. I'm sure you know this - You won't know the outcome unless you try. Let me know how it turns out. All the best!</p>

              <p>How should I start ...</p>
              <p>I'm a guy, roamed the earth for 2 decades just any other human
              being. Had been in sgforums for quite sometimes, but this is the
              first time I am sharing my personal agony, cause I seriously have
              no ideas on how to deal with it.... </p>
              <p>The last time I fell was during my secondary school days,
              when I  miserably took 3 three years to gather my
              courage to confess to her about my feeling. Furthermore, it's only
              during the period when we are close to graduate and walk a
              seperate path, that I manage to buck up myself and confess to her.
              Although, I succeed but this relationship does not last. I gave up,
              due to my foolishness of thinking
              about those contradiction that it will be hard to be
              together when we walked a seperate path. Back then , I hated that
              feeling and told myself that will be the first and the last
              time.</p>
              <p>Not long after I enter my poly route, luck was on me
              (I guess) , a girl actually fall for me and confessed her
              feeling for me . At first, I was totally against it , but
              somehow I gave in and gave it a try. I just couldn't get
              back the same feeling and this result in me giving up again....</p>
              <p>I was lost on the track of so called "love". What's love ? I
              dont need one...? Sometimes, when one said that they are finding
              for their other half due to the emptiness in their
              heart? Emptiness ...? I wonder how's the feeling like ....
              Perhaps, I am just not ready or either not old enough to
              understand such complex stuff.</p>
              <p>Time really flies, I can still rememeber the feeling
              of the days when I actually sent my
              "first" home at night after a day of hard work ,revising.
              I grew up understanding that everything was in the past, it's no
              longer happening. It's not fair how you were gone and
              how fast you are moving on, while I am still trap in
              the past. I grew , grew up of it...</p>
              <p>Recently, I found my heartbeat for this girl. She was older then
              me by three.She stay in Singapore but her homeland is in malaysia.
              Not possible to be together? Ha, I guess so. The more I get to know
              her, the deeper I fell... Knowing that she's single, I sent her
              flowers and a portrait of her to her workplace without leaving my
              name behind through delivery. I knew she liked them alot as she
              took a photo of it and set it on her msn display pic. Somehow,
              I really wonder if she knew it was sent by me....</p>
              <p>Can somebody tell how can I tell if she's really interested
              in me ? I tried to chat with her frequently on msn. She will
              replied but she never initiated a chat with me for even once. Does
              it means that she's not interested ? Or she actually felt for
              the guy that sent her the flowers. </p>
              <p> Perhaps, I should just give up ......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I should go, should I go close to you<br> <br> How would you think , I have no courage...<br> <br> The reason is that I, being a fool, is only watching you from a
              distance.<br> <br> Afraid of the wait, afraid of ur heart turning my feeling down, and
              so we feel the awkwardness.<br> <br> I am a fool who can't say I love you....</p>

              <p>Not being a wet blanket or whatever you would call it, but do be grateful.</p>
              <p>Less fortunate (literally) people than you have gotten themselves into such "limerence" or "infatuation" situations earlier in life, say about early into their adolescence period? Disrupting their studies, O' Levels, A' Levels etc.</p>
              <p>And some teenagers have had really obsessive infatuations at a very young age, that they even start to cut themselves and attempt suicide because they simply were too innocent for one-sided relationships to being with.</p>
              <p>But since you aren't just one self-harming teenage kid in secondary one, I guess you just have to go with the flow of life. You learn from you mistakes, and there is no guidebook like</p>
              <p>"Dummies guide to stupid infatuations and what silly things not to do even though you are going to do them anyway"</p>
              <p>Good luck bro.</p>
