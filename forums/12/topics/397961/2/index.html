              <p>i dont know why i keep meeting shallow guys and get hiamed.</p>
              <p>Online dating, knowing new friends through my circle of friends,
              social outings and events. It seems i keep meeting guys who go for
              looks only and like girls of a particular type. And they will not
              hesitate to hiam you openly if they find you not their type or
              typically attractive and pleasant looking. I do not why it keeps
              happening to me. Sometimes, i just joined these social events to
              know more friends, but end up they hiam or compare my looks with
              other girls. I dont know why my appearance is always singled out
              for comparison or criticism.</p>
              <p>Even when online guys see my pics, they stopped chatting online
              with me altogether.</p>
              <p>Why i keep knowing guys who write me off instantly and
              completely based on my looks or when they first see me? They just
              dont want to talk to me or treat me as non-existence after seeing
              me in person.</p>
              <p>Am i that bad?</p>
              <p>I know of fat girls who have better luck meeting guys on the
              net. They flash their fat pictures, and meet-up, yet the guy
              continue to keep in touch with them..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why I always kenna such things? I dont want to think abt it, but
              ppl always like to single me out and pick on my looks. I only want
              to expand my social circle and make friends.. why should looks be
              the primary factor?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am hurted</p>

              <p>I am still single but not ugly and desperate guy .</p>
              <p>The idea of finding a mate is to experience love, eventually have children and house. A person who cannot take care of herself, how could she be capable of taking care of the children and house eventually? Just like a men who is weak, how can he protect the family? </p>
              <p>It is bad to be overdressed, but it is just as bad to be under dressed. Making yourself presentable is also a way to respect yourself and respect others. </p>
              <p>I dont expect my partner to be a supermodel type, but she should have substances and able to present herself properly. </p>

              <p>perhaps it's how u present urself, perhaps it's how u never bothered to look ok.</p>
              <p>u can be not chio, but u cannot be looking all dirty and if i may be blunt, disgusting.</p>
              <p>while expecting everyone to be looking past ur appearance to see your very chio heart. </p>
              <p>the same goes for ur behaviour.</p>
              <p>mebbe the words u say, and even your body languages are sending the wrong signals to everyone u meet.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>First impression is very important. First impression as in the first sight of the person. You may be a marvellous person with super good characters, but if your appearance is a turn off, people will tend to shunt you.</p>
              <p>Which guy would not want to have a pretty gf whom they can proudly show off in front of their friends? Ya I know some fat girls have bf, and these girls know how to attract guys maybe by being cute, or being chubby or taking care of their appearance.</p>
              <p>We do not know what is ya problem. Is it really because of your face, with many pimples bursting like volcanoes, or your hair, which are dry and totally damages, or you dressing like a aunty in her 40s or you look like a balloon that is going to explode.</p>
              <p>May you should try to keep your appearance in check. Dress up nicely, there are clothes for fat people which are very nice. You should just try checking them out. Hairstyle is important to a person, a fat girl with long wavy, curly, rebonded, styled hair can be very appealing to guys as well. Facial protection is important to all girls, light make up can make a person very pretty, fake eyelashes can do the job as well, but it depends on what type of clothings and ya character as well. The power of make up can be found online by comparing pre and post makeup images of girls. If you think you are too fat, then you should exercise as well.</p>
              <p>Try putting on some perfumes as well. Girls that smell nice are very attractive. The smell of a girl is an important criteria in judging her.</p>
              <p>Fat girls can be appealing as well if they know how to make themselves attractive. I am sure, if you are determined you can do it as well. There are no ugly girls in the world, only lazy ones. You can try to put in just that little bit of effort and ya guy might just appear in front of you.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, if you believe in true love as in a guy will love you for who you are, then you can jolly well wait, who knows there might really be such a person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can go out with other people in a group instead of 1-1 with a guy. Because, by going out with a guy 1-1 and if that guy does not like your appearance, then they will feel very embarass especially in the public. At that moment they care only about themselves and not you, and they would want to dump you away ASAP.</p>
              <p>Jia you ba and Good Luck. I am sure you would find someone that appreciates you and more importantly, your other half.</p>

              <p>Great advice!</p>
              <p>But I hardly think TS would listen. (This is not her 1st thread about this)</p>
              <p>Anyway TS, people can only help and advice you so much. So instead of whining and complaining, why don't you do something about it?</p>
              <p>By the way, not everyone is born beautiful, most achieve beauty through hard work. So if you don't want people to be turned off by your looks then it's high time you start working on it.</p>
              <p>PS: You will probably never meet a completely un-shallow guy, unless you meet a saint, but then again, saints are usually celibate. Also you need a hell lot of work on your personality and character to be able to even attract one in the 1st place.</p>
