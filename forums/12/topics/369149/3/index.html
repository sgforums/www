              <p>U are 19 years old - u have been under the care of your present parents for so long - now u dredge up the past and justify all these emotional turmoil.</p>
              <p>U are a wasting your time n wonder if u know it lah - unless all these is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">giving u meaning</span> ( to your existential experience now) without u knowing or realizing it lah.

              <p>Hi Guys, thanks for the good advises.</p>
              <p>I told my parents of the situation, and they told me the whole
              thing. Still very emotional in the house. Found out that my birth
              mum 'sold' me &amp; sis to them at $17,000. She wanted to
              split my sis &amp; I so she could get more money. Two
              babies to two couples.</p>
              <p>Found out too that she came back with her mum &amp; uncle
              to threaten my parents to give them some more money so that
              they wont take us away. She had the right till we turned one year
              old. So the whole family moved. and to buy some time, my parents
              gave her additional $5,000.</p>
              <p>She's the type that goes in and out of prison for drug offences.
              I dont wanna meet someone like that, yet claim that she's my birth
              mother.</p>
              <p>Again, thanks guys for the good advises.</p>

              <p>Under the law, once the parents has adopted a child, they have the obligation to take care of you till 21 years old.</p>
              <p>Your birth parents has no right to claimed you back since you are legally sold "AS Goods" to the adoptive party.</p>
              <p>Once you are 21 years old, you are legally independent individual, so you can get to choose to be alone, stay with your adoptive parents or birth parents.</p>
              <p>Go for LOVE not heritage. Even though you might carry their genes but your soul is for your individually alone.</p>
              <p>Unless your adoptive parents are millionaires, which I would doubtless claimed their heritage.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Wow what is with the people here. I'm new so mind my words. If a person who has been raised for 19 years is told that he/she was an adopted child then it will certainly come as a great shock. I believe that when the Thread Starter started this thread all in his/her mind was a story of confusion. Some comments here make it seem so easy to accept, but such a news can be really shocking to certain individuals. Okay they raised him well, but which part of the thread was he actually complaining about it? He just wanted some information about the situation that is happening. And yes I only bothered to read the first page of this thread.</p></div>

              <p>This thread is yet another thread heading for the "out of control" tunnel again.</p>
              <p>TS has already known the truth, and she has already stated she is alright with it now, and she won't be going off to see her Biological mother. Thus, there is no need for anymore criticisms, arguments and/or debates.</p>
              <p>Yunhaier/Honeymouse, sorry to trouble either of you, but please lock this thread up.</p>
