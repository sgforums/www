              <p>the truth is..your adoptive parents brought you up and showered you with more love than their own children.and im sure you love them just as much..letting them know what you know is good..assure them that no1 can replace them as your parents..they will know and understand that you just needed the truth to balance your mind..show them care and corncern like you usually do..</p>
              <p>not related by blood doesnt mean anything less..you mentioned the name abdullah meaning children of Allah..does it not make every single human as children of Allah since he is the creator in your religion??does it not then make you related by blood in a diluted way?</p>

              <p>That will depend on the parents themselves, and it is on a case-to-case basis.</p>
              <p>But your perspective is quite negative, I will have to say so.</p>

              lol dun feel ashame that you are adopted. as time goes by, u'll slowly accept the fact. dun think too much about it, coz from what you say seems like your current family loves u a lot. 
              
              perhaps u will want to talk to ur current family about it. dun sound like you're angry, just sound like you're more curious to find out more. ultimately ur current family will be afraid that you will take it very hard, thus, perhaps hiding the papers from u. have a cool and clear headed talk. eveyrthing will work out fine.

              <p>The last I know of some muslim adoptions.</p>

              <p>It is not uncommon for even adopted children to look like their adoptive parents. Unless its a matter of different race.</p>
              <p>But there is always the connections, that even children will receive the legacy of their adoptive parents mannerism, morals, values, ethics and even responses.</p>
              <p>I would say, chill down, talk to the parents to tell them you know and assure them that you still value their love and devotion to yourself and your sister.  And urge them to sit down your sister with you, to tell you both the truth.</p>
              <p>And prepare yourself to comfort your sister if she becomes as shocked and confused as you are.</p>
              <p>Its always better to be asking for your parents medical history and prepare yourself for the future.</p>
              <p>Looking back into the past, should never impede your future.  If you let it becomes so, then its a matter of merely looking for excuses for bad behaviour.</p>

              <p>Quoted : <span style="font-size: x-small;">It should be noted that only relatives with a legitimate blood
                  relationship to the deceased are entitled to inherit from the deceased under Islamic law.
                  Thus, illegitimate children according to Islamic law and adopted children have no part in
                  inheritance. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Incidentally legal adoption as practised in the west is forbidden in Islam.</strong></span></span></p>

              <p>TS, odds are you are a malaysian, as you said you live in JB and your parents went over to SG for a while. Did you know that if the whole thing blows up you could get your parents into trouble with the religious court?</p>

              <p>dear huzane89,</p>
              <p>what you can do maybe is to:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>cool yourself down 1st</li>
              <li>since you're a muslim as what you've stated, ummm maybe praying will help as part of like stabilise your emotions. sometimes, it does help la.<br></li>
              <li>once ur emotionally stable, have a slow talk with your mum. i suggest u thank her and your adopted dad for bringing you in,giving you such love and dedication despite your discovery. pour out your love to them 1st and then ask the real question like-mak kalau ...your name... tanye 1 question,mak jangan ambil hati eh,...your name...masih sayang ayah and mak..(if you must, hug your mum as a saying of thank you-it doesn't hurt to do it.hehe.)</li>
              <li>Ask the real question...say that you just want honesty cuz you have the right to know the whole story. (be prepared and don't get too emotional if the story gets too hard for you.)</li>
              <li>About whether you wanna meet your real mum it's your own choice. even though your real mum may not raise you she's still your real mum who gave birth to u and despite that, love your adoptive parents as much because they have raised you from young til now.</li>
              <li>Lastly, all the best. and chillz ok? =) I really hope this helps. ~w'kumslm~</li>
              </ol>
              <p>*oh yeah, be gentle(lembut) when u ask sensitive issues to ur parents.</p>

              <p>TS, odds are you are a malaysian, as you said you live in JB and your parents went over to SG for a while. Did you know that if the whole thing blows up you could get your parents into trouble with the religious court?</p>

              <p><br>One thing that I am very grateful to my birth mother is that she gave me up for adoption. She could have abortion but she didnt. So, i am not really angry with anyone, I just want some answers such as medical history, the father, how my parents found her etc.</p>

              <p>Some people are way to harsh here. The TS just want to get to know her blood-related mom, nothing much. So suggest to your foster parents that you want to look for her, but promise you wouldn't love them less even if you manage to get in touch with your 'real' mother.</p>

              <p>Hi Guys, thanks for the good advises.</p>
              <p>I told my parents of the situation, and they told me the whole thing. Still very emotional in the house. Found out that my birth mum 'sold' me &amp; sis to them at $17,000. She wanted to split my sis &amp; I so she could get more money. Two babies to two couples.</p>
              <p>Found out too that she came back with her mum &amp; uncle to threaten my parents to give them some more money so that they wont take us away. She had the right till we turned one year old. So the whole family moved. and to buy some time, my parents gave her additional $5,000.</p>
              <p>She's the type that goes in and out of prison for drug offences. I dont wanna meet someone like that, yet claim that she's my birth mother.</p>
              <p>Again, thanks guys for the good advises.</p>

              <p>Regardless if you knew or not know the past, can you change or
              alter it in anyway?</p>
              <p>What had happened, has happened, and nothing can change such
              facts. We cannot change one bit of yesterday, but we can still
              control what will happen tomorrow.</p>
              <p>Your parents loved and took care of you yesterday, and will
              continue to love and take care of you tomorrow, as you too must
              love them and take care of them. The past is gone, severed like an
              umbilical cord between a mother and child at birth. It is the
              actions that a mother does that binds a child to her, and your
              present parents are the ties that bind and worthy of love and
              concern in return.</p>
              <p>Be glad you had experience love and care growing up, sacrificed
              largely by your parents for no lives are every rosy daily, and not
              abandoned on streets or lived in parentless orphanage.</p>
              <p>The past is gone, regardless of whom your biological parents
              ever were. Knowing or not knowing the truth will not alter your
              past one bit, but will only hinder your future with the sorrows,
              regrets and 'ifs' it brings.</p>
              <p>Your concern is with those who love and cared for you in the
              past and into the future, which you must return in equal or more in
              measure for the kindness given.</p>
              <p>I speak thru experience, for I too am an adopted child, and had
              never bothered to find out about my origins, for there is nothing I
              can do about it. But there is much I can do to those who love and
              took care of me over long periods, and gave me the best gift a
              human can ever hope for - unconditional pure love that only parents
              and child can share.</p>
