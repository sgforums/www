However, u need to ask urself how do u see this r/s in 5 yrs or 10yrs? Is the man u really wanns to settle down with?<br><br>Definitely, i not asking u to break up him immediately, but i believe u shld hav a heart to heart chat with him, telling him ur feeling &amp; the hurt &amp; pain u hav quietly suffered for the past 4 yrs. Hoping there's still some hope for him to change @ readaptation in ur r/s. I strongly believe u cant always give in to him, as he must know his limits &amp; to give &amp; take as well. How much more can u give in to him, how long can u give in to him, i seriously he shld take ur luv &amp; the r/s for granted.<br><br>He shld hav treasure this r/s with u, as i can give u r very commited to this r/s, which i think it's good, however it's not fair for just u only. That maybe one of the reason why u having been feeling so insecureto this r/s &amp; personally how u going to substain a long oversea r/s?<br><br>This conclusion based to ur own analysis, as u r the only one who know him well &amp; know about ur feeling to the r/s.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A man who beats up his woman is the worst scum on earth. The guy is not worth your love, leave him before you seriously get injured physically. Not only that, by choosing to stay with him, you are indirectly hurting those who care for you, like your parents, relatives and friends.<br><br>From the way you described, you seems to be still young, so, better get out of this relationship before you reach the state where you feel that all the men on earth are bad.<br><br>If he doesn't let you leave him, I suggests you talk to your parents and ask them for help.</div>
