              <p>Imho, the main problem is not Clara but Boyfriend. Perhaps you need to decide whether he is trustworthy to begin with. How he reacts to her tells his level of interest and commitment in you.</p>
              <p>If you have been asked to play second fiddle while he slow dance with Clara day and night, then the signal box is loud and clear. You're giving him permission to do as he deem fits because frankly, he is fine with you getting out of the relationship.</p>
              <p>I don't think he can fall in love with you again babe.</p>
              <p>There is no need to worry about letting him go because you're the one who got dumped. Nothing left to do kiddo. Buy a dozen Wild Turkeys, round up some good friends and cry. Let it sink.</p>
              <p>Take care.</p>

              <p>Why bother fighting over a guy? Seriously I feel that he's wasting your time. Asking you to wait, while he date a juvenile! For christ's sake, wake up! He can do it once, he can do it twice. I don't know about you, but if I were you, even if we get back together, I wun be able to trust him again.</p>
              <p>You are still young, you'll get loads of chances with different guys. So don't waste your time on such a guy. He can be telling Ms C the same thing he told you also.</p>
              <p>Love makes someone blind, but at certain times, we need the head to think, not the heart.</p>

              <p>Not all relationships end becoz of a third party. Ask yourself, if he is worth it?</p>

              <p>Look, if a 15 year old kid from some virtual world can just come in, bitch about you, then steal your boyfriend away, doesn't it show how weak is your relationship you have with him?</p>
              <p>Come on, I'm sure there are better guys out there. It's just that you have not crossed paths with one of them yet. Go give him a call later and tell him you're not one of those who like to share. If he still choose to stick with that gal, curse him and end the call. Delete his contacts (MSN, phone, friendster, game, e-mail, whatever) and cut off all communications with him and let yourself to cool down for a few days. If there is any hope for your relationship, you will see him, not you, trying desperately to salvage it. Otherwise, you can forget about it. Because even if you managed to save this relationship solely through your own efforts, such incidents would probably happen for the second time, the third time etc until you are really tired of it and decide to give it up for once and for all. So why not end it now?</p>
              <p> Anyway, you said W is "20f". He's...not a guy?</p>

              <p>Give yourself time and space to think clearly about the whole relationship. Apparently, you're still "madly" in love with him, which isn't a good thing for a long-lasting relationship, cos the chemistry may fizzle out one day.</p>
