              <p>Hi TS,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Im going to make a guess here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your boyfriend likes both of you..... unfortunately you are choice #2.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He won't mind having both of you.... but.... you will never be #1 in his eyes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Should you end it? You already know. Question is how do you end it with minimal pain <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But knowing you should end it is the first step.... the second step is to do something you like... go exercise and do abit of shopping ... get a part time job and doll yourself up abit <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/smile.png" alt="smile.png"> .... who knows the next hot thing might have his eyes set on you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Regards</p>

              <p>while you're only 19 years old</p>
              <p>still kind of young..</p>
              <p>but there are some things which you ought to put into serious consideration if you were to think about your future. (at your current thinking, i would say it's a bit too soon for you to think about, unless something happens.. which might chance you for the better)</p>
              <p>although i might be coming close to 21 in less than 1 month's time, but since i've come across somebody (my fren actually) who got similar problems, and i managed to talk to her and got to pinpoint the exact problem of her with her bf who happens to be my poly mate.. (not to mention he is clueless about what his gf is doing behind his back)..</p>
              <p>for your consecutively 6 years of none-stop relationship with various guys..and plently of negative experiences, i think it's about time that you start thinking about what you actually want in your life.</p>
              <p>give it some thoughts..perhaps that might help you to sort out your thinking and your directions..</p>
              <p>as for me, inside army for 2 years in the current vocation (since it's a "relaxing" life inside), all i can say is that i've come across and heard from my army frens during coversation of some even more dis-heartening cases..your's isn't the first..</p>
              <p>it's about time you give it some thoughts..just <strong>observe</strong> (pay a little bit more attention to)  the people around you, be it your frens, relatives or even colleagues (if you happen to be working part time); sometimes it pays to be KPO..only via this way, you get to <strong>learn stuffs like how to handle problems and getting over it..from EXPERIENCE..</strong></p>
              <p>going into the army, made me think of lots of things..from what i regretted doing in the passed to what i wanna do when i ORD..how i'm gonna live my life etc..since i'm exposed to different types of people..</p>
              <p>it's about time you learn to think for yourself..not necessary must try to solve your current problem..instead..find something which is more important to you at this point of time and work towards it..</p>
