              <p>Look, if a 15 year old kid from some virtual world can just come
              in, bitch about you, then steal your boyfriend away, doesn't it
              show how weak is your relationship you have with him?</p>
              <p>Come on, I'm sure there are better guys out there. It's just
              that you have not crossed paths with one of them yet. Go give him a
              call later and tell him you're not one of those who like to share.
              If he still choose to stick with that gal, curse him and end the
              call. Delete his contacts (MSN, phone, friendster, game, e-mail,
              whatever) and cut off all communications with him and let yourself
              to cool down for a few days. If there is any hope for your
              relationship, you will see him, not you, trying desperately to
              salvage it. Otherwise, you can forget about it. Because even if you
              managed to save this relationship solely through your own efforts,
              such incidents would probably happen for the second time, the third
              time etc until you are really tired of it and decide to give it up
              for once and for all. So why not end it now?</p>
              <p> Anyway, you said W is "20f". He's...not a guy?</p>

              <p>You can always gain confidence by doing what you do best. There are guys who played DotA just before an O-level paper and did well for it, in fact. (Anyone else reading this, please don't quote me.)</p>
              <p>If you are afraid of being lonely and forgetten, and need someone to talk to other than your family members, simply post your MSN username and HP number here like what you did for Miss C. I bet with you that you will be contacted by at least 5 strangers, probably inclusive of myself, within the next 24 hours. Or else just stick to this forum topic, will ya?</p>

              <p>I've been in your situation before.</p>
              <p>Let's put it this way.</p>
              <p>If you really love him, LET HIM GO~!</p>
              <p>If one loves others, one really wants others to be happy.</p>
              <p>Since he chose Clara over you, it meant that he is happier with Clara than you (im sorry to break this news to you).</p>
              <p>However, it is his lost to ask you for a breakup.</p>
              <p>You can choose to wait or start a new life.</p>
              <p>Being single is great (im not saying that getting attached is not)</p>
              <p>However, you are not lonely.</p>
              <p>You can start a new life. Start doing this that he dislikes.</p>
              <p>E.g.:</p>
              <p>He dislikes you wear long pants which you really love.</p>
              <p>Wear it. You feel good.</p>
              <p>Think positive. Positive outcome will come.</p>

              <p>I've been in your situation before.</p>
              <p>Let's put it this way.</p>
              <p>If you really love him, LET HIM GO~!</p>
              <p>If one loves others, one really wants others to be happy.</p>
              <p>Since he chose Clara over you, it meant that he is happier with
              Clara than you (im sorry to break this news to you).</p>
              <p>However, it is his lost to ask you for a breakup.</p>
              <p>You can choose to wait or start a new life.</p>
              <p>Being single is great (im not saying that getting attached is
              not)</p>
              <p>However, you are not lonely.</p>
              <p>You can start a new life. Start doing this that he dislikes.</p>
              <p>E.g.:</p>
              <p>He dislikes you wear long pants which you really love.</p>
              <p>Wear it. You feel good.</p>
              <p>Think positive. Positive outcome will come.</p>
              <p> </p>
