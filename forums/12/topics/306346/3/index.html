              <p>W8,</p>
              <p>Seriously girl, you don't need to break up face to face.</p>
              <p>The only reason you want to do so, is to see for yourself how he react. But seeing how he behaves will only confuse/hurt you more. So I suggest not to.</p>
              <p>Just send him as email or message or voicemail about your decision to breakoff with him if he is still reluctant to response to your call. After sending the message, don't bother waiting for his reply.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The first step to setting yourself free, is to let yourself go.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">Look W8, get a grip on
              yourself, don't let this angst overtake you and turn you into
              someone ugly. Clearly you putting her contact info there is if im
              not wrong, a way of taking revenge, wanting members of the public
              to flame this girl..</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What i feel now is that... there is no pt holding on to things.
              As you said "</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">can say coz im not
              close to my family..not close to friends...all except my
              bf...</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">" i can infer pretty much that
              you are the type who has become over reliant on yr boyfriend for
              that emotional support, that sense of self worth. Don't invest in
              him anymore, he is not worth it, break up with him and leave him,
              spend yr time and effort to grow yr friendships into something
              deeper and have more meaningful family time with yr family
              members.</span></p>
              <p>This guy is not worth it because</p>
              <p>1. Hes a coward</p>
              <p>Its clear he broke up with u over that clara girl but he stills
              covers up his ass with a whole lot of bullshit excuses eg. family,
              studies</p>
              <p>2. He is indecisve</p>
              <p>Cannot decide what he wants, regret after making major
              decisions.... shows immaturity and if he really treasures the rs he
              won't be like this</p>
              <p>3. Using you</p>
              <p>He still hugs you and kiss you despite being with clara...
              doesn't this show he is using u to satisfy his personal lust?</p>
              <p>DONT LET YRSELF BE HUMILIATED THIS WAY</p>
              <p>4. INFEDIL</p>
              <p>Though he is tgt with clara, he still does such intimate stuff
              with u... doesn't this show a lot abt his character</p>
              <p>5. HE DOESN't LOVE YOU AND YOU DESERVE BETTER</p>
              <p>if he loves you he would gladly give up clara (even as a friend)
              to salvage the relationship</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So yea, SMARTEN UP AND LEAVE HIM, when you place more self worth
              and value on yrself, you would meet better men. DON"T LET YRSELF BE
              TAKEN FOR GRANTED.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lastly, he is not yr property... don't interfere between he and
              clara anymore. With you being a such a stalker, he would want you
              less. RESPECT YOURSELF AND HIM. From her friendster, i can kind of
              infer shes a more mild form of a harlet...they won't last long.
              Your boyfriend is an adulterous faggot and he would eventually get
              his desserts.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And finally, as one of the wise person said above "</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Seriously girl, you
              don't need to break up face to face. The only reason you want to do
              so, is to see for yourself how he react. But seeing how he behaves
              will only confuse/hurt you more. So I suggest not to."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: x-small;">I will always be here for you!
              I can't stand seeing guys bully girls or girls disrespect
              themselves. There is more to life than having a bf. You are in a
              relationship because you choose to not because you need. Its like
              the "im driving this car, i'd get off as and when i feel that im
              being disrespected"</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lots of love and god bless!</p>
