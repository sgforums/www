              <p>how old are you btw? in puberty teens?</p>
              <p>just because ur class guys arent as tall or taller than you, u have this set of mentality. i suggest u go take a look outside ur class and u'll c many guys taller than 170cm.</p>
              <p>BE more confident and proud of ur height cux not many gers have ur kind of height and most desire to hit that range. so why feel inferior?</p>
              <p><br>u can wear clothes that suit ur height for a start.  i see often on streets gers with long legs wearing appropriately to flaunt their assets. they are eye candies to men la.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>i've got a tall stature at 169-170. and i actually feel inferior
              because of that. i know that many of my girlfriends will slap me
              for saying this but i don't want to be so tall. some will die to
              get some height from me, complaining that short is bad and they
              wanna grow tall. but not many actually will think from a tall
              person's view especially if you are a girl. the guys in my class
              are generally not tall at all, mostly the same as me or even
              shorter. i feel embarrassed walking with them. moreover i am not
              skinny. i feel like some giant with my girlfriends and the guys.
              there was once when we had to do dancing and i was paired with this
              guy close to half a head shorter than me. i almost died.</p>

              <p>I'm about 6' or about 1.84m and personally, I find it easier to talk to taller people. Don't have to bend so much while standing and talking. Had a friend in secondary school once who was about 1.75m. She was slouching cause I guess she was self conscious about the fact she towers over 90% of the class population.<br> Don't worry though, there's sure to be some guys who would love to date tall women, at least I do.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>all girls like tall guys(1.8 and above) and all tall guys prefer tall girls i think. Cause im 1.85 and i wouldnt really like it if my gf is 1.65 and below. all the girls i dated are 1.65 and above. my current one is 1.69, and she wears heels. so roughly 1.73 like that. Imagine me walking with a girl standing at 1.6m. It would be pretty weird right. Be confident of your height. Many girls i know would kill for it. Being tall is a privilege not many have.</div>

              <p>i've got a tall stature at 169-170. and i actually feel inferior because of that. i know that many of my girlfriends will slap me for saying this but i don't want to be so tall. some will die to get some height from me, complaining that short is bad and they wanna grow tall. but not many actually will think from a tall person's view especially if you are a girl. the guys in my class are generally not tall at all, mostly the same as me or even shorter. i feel embarrassed walking with them. moreover i am not skinny. i feel like some giant with my girlfriends and the guys. there was once when we had to do dancing and i was paired with this guy close to half a head shorter than me. i almost died.</p>
              <p>i don't even wear heels but i just feel so uneasy. what the fuck can i do man. tall girls, whereeee aree youuuuu?</p>

              <p>Girl of height 170cm.... seriously, what's the problem? Maybe it's a little tall for a girl, but I know of even taller girls.</p>
