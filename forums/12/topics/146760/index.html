If one day you can look at her as any ordinary person in your life, thats the day when you can say that you had totally forgotten your love for the person.   </div></blockquote>I agree with drx tat if she has no feeling for you, she will not care how much pain you hav gone through. Tats the answer I got from my ex when she emailed me asking me how hav i been lately etc etc.<br><br>If she has the mentality of giving up the relationship so easily, she is selfish in nature and will not giv a second thought abt how much pain will she inflict on you. All this have been planned ahead before you can even sense it.</div>
