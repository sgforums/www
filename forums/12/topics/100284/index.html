            <div class='col-md body'>mmm ur method of approach is abit abrupt and startling. how abt adopting my method below:<br><br>1. get to know her more and let her know u more too by going out with friends, talking, joking, etc<br>2. be nice and try to find out more abt her. ask her friends wat she like or not like, wat kind of guys she prefer?<br>3. don't get so worked up, relax. if u all fate, sure things will happen. as i always say wat is urs will be urs, wat is not urs will forever not be urs<br><br>good luck</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>agree with Magnus..you pop the question too early. nvm, learning experience for you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>get over her bah, it's easy to find another girl you like. and i think you like her because she's the prettiest girl in your class, right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>a girl will decide whether you are in her 'friends' group or 'lovers' group based on your behaviour and the conversations you had with her.<br><br>so learn how to talk confident and act confident in front of her. being too serious, acting cool, and keeping your mouth shut are some of the best things you can do to be friends with her <span style="font-style: italic;">forever</span>.<br><br>like i said, experience is the best teacher. you'll learn better and much more if you try it out yourself.<br><br>if you need practice, just find some of the less attractive girls in your class and start talking to them. just go up and say 'hi'. <strong>DON'T WORRY ABOUT HAVING NO TOPICS TO TALK ABOUT.</strong> just talk to her about anything! her sec sch life...your sec sch life...latest gossip...music...jokes...etc.<br><br>besides, if she's uninterested...what's the worst thing that could happen? eat  up your kkj? tear your balls out? turn you into a toad? NO! the worst thing that would happen is that she would walk off! hey, at least she wasn't the girl of your dreams! better practice more if you don't want the girl of your dreams to do the same thing!<br><br>a few more tips for you:<br><br>- don't EVER confess your feelings for her, unless you're certain that she likes you as well. just treat her as a normal friend.<br><br>- <span style="color: red;">DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT BE EXTRAORDINARILY NICE TO HER. IT WILL ONLY SCARE HER AWAY.</span><br><br>- if you like a girl, be her friend first! talk to her, and go out with her. let her get to know you better first.<br><br>- if you like her, act like you're not interested in her, just treat her as a normal friend. (i know it sounds stupid, but it really works.)<br><br>- don't always give in to her. i think that applies to not giving in to all girls.<br><br>btw, if you want to get your friendship back to its comfort zone, you have to convince her that you're not interested in her anymore. make her feel that she isn't your target anymore (there are plenty of ways to do this. one of them is to act gay with your buddy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ) when she realises that she isn't your target anymore, she'll start to open up again.<br><br>believe me...i've been through this.<br></div>

[b]DON'T WORRY ABOUT HAVING NO TOPICS TO TALK ABOUT.</strong> just talk to her about anything! her sec sch life...your sec sch life...latest gossip...music...jokes...etc.<br><br>besides, if she's uninterested...what's the worst thing that could happen? eat  up your kkj? tear your balls out? turn you into a toad? NO! the worst thing that would happen is that she would walk off! hey, at least she wasn't the girl of your dreams! better practice more if you don't want the girl of your dreams to do the same thing!<br><br>a few more tips for you:<br><br>- don't EVER confess your feelings for her, unless you're certain that she likes you as well. just treat her as a normal friend.<br><br>- <span style="color: red;">DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT BE EXTRAORDINARILY NICE TO HER. IT WILL ONLY SCARE HER AWAY.</span><br><br>- if you like a girl, be her friend first! talk to her, and go out with her. let her get to know you better first.<br><br>- if you like her, act like you're not interested in her, just treat her as a normal friend. (i know it sounds stupid, but it really works.)<br><br>- don't always give in to her. i think that applies to not giving in to all girls.<br><br>btw, if you want to get your friendship back to its comfort zone, you have to convince her that you're not interested in her anymore. make her feel that she isn't your target anymore (there are plenty of ways to do this. one of them is to act gay with your buddy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ) when she realises that she isn't your target anymore, she'll start to open up again.<br><br>believe me...i've been through this.<br>[/b]</blockquote>OMG i love this piece of advice OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG thank u so very much <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>haha but how do i noe if she likes me back?</div>

She means a definite NO.<br><br>Dun make her feel u are pestering her if u stil wana be frens with her. And frens is the only thing u can be with her from wat i see now. She said u stood no chance!

            <div class='col-md body'>girls express themselves through body language...so there are some ways to see if she's interested in you or not:<br><br>1) when you're talking to her, look at her straight in the eye. hold the eye contact for 2 seconds: if she continues to gaze at you after 2 seconds, it means that she's quite interested in you. if she looks away, that's bad news for you. this is one of the easiest ways to test if she's interested in you or not.<br><br>2) try to move in <strong>a little</strong> closer to her when you're talking to her. the point here is not to zoom into her like you're going to rape her. any girl, no matter how interested she is, will move back if you zoom in on her too suddenly. a small but significant shift in position will do the trick.<br><br>if she's interested in you, she'll stay put. if not, she'll move back.<br><br>3) when you're having a conversation, does she lean towards you? if she is, it's a clear sign that she's interested in you.<br><br>4) does she play with her hair/earrings/rub her wrists when she's talking to you? that sounds like good news.<br><br>5) if she's smiling and nodding alot when talking to you, that's a good sign as well.<br><br>you might want to look out for these things as well, because they're signs of no interest:<br><br>- eye contact never lasts for more than 2 seconds.<br><br>- constantly turning away from you while you're talking to her.<br><br>- always gives excuses to NOT go out with you.<br><br>btw, being interested in you doesn't mean that she is definitely in love with you! remember that your goal here is just to check whether the interest is there or not, not anything else.<br><br>when you know she's interested in talking to you, you can start making your moves <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
