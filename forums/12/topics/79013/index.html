            <div class='col-md body'>The appearance of things change according to the emotions, and thus we see magic and beauty in them, while the magic and beauty are really in ourselves. -- Kahlil Gibran<br><br>The mind is its own place, and in itself can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven. --John Milton (1608-1674), Paradise Lost<br><br>Don't ask yourself what the world needs, ask yourself what makes you come alive. And then go do that. Because what the world needs are people who have come alive. -- Harold Whitman<br><br>Be master of your petty annoyances and conserve your energies for the big, worthwhile things. It isn't the mountain ahead that wears you out - it's the grain  of sand in your shoe. -- Robert Service<br><br>I have come to the frightening conclusion that I am the decisive element.  It is my personal approach that creates the climate. It is my daily mood that makes the weather. I possess tremendous power to make life miserable or joyous. I can be a tool of torture or an instrument of inspiration, I can humiliate or humor, hurt or heal. In all situations, it is my response that decides whether a crisis is escalated or de-escalated, and a person is humanized or de-humanized. If we treat people as they are, we make them worse. If we treat people as they ought to be, we help them become what<br>they are capable of becoming. -- Haim Ginott</div>
