              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Two days ago is the 1<sup>st</sup> time I saw
                                  her after such a long time. It was slightly around 2 years. I had
                                  text message her a few day ago asking whether she is free or not. To
                                  my surprise she reply yes. So excited, was I in meeting her. I got
                                  there an hour earlier just to wait. In my mind I keep on going over
                                  and over what I am going to say later.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Just before our meeting she text to say
                                  she will be late, but thats what I had expected from her. From all
                                  those past dates with her, I realized that she is always late, ha ha.
                                  But that is fine with me.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">But I told her never mind just take her
                                  time and get here safety. When the appointed time came and went, I
                                  begin to worried, have anything bad happen to her. It was only when
                                  she text me saying where she will meet me , did my heart calm down,
                                  “she is alright!” I thought to myself. I rush to the new location
                                  and just as I turn around the corner, I lay my eyes on her. She still
                                  looks the same after so many years. She smiled, and I stammer, what
                                  happen to all my rehearse lines, nothing came out. She ask: “ How
                                  are you?” “Fine” was the only reply i could think of. We continued walking with no specific
                                  destination exchanging pleasantries all along the way. Along the way she
                                  ask whether I have had my lunch, I replied “No”. Cos I was
                                  waiting to have lunch with her, but I did not say that out. I was a
                                  bit disappointed when she told me she had hers. But in actual fact,
                                  so happy was I at seeing her, I didn't felt hungry at all.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">So we found a place to have some
                                  ice-cream. To my pleasant surprise her taste is still the same as
                                  mine after all this years. We, had both decided to have the frosted
                                  malt chocolate. And so we sat and talk about old and current things,
                                  for the better part of the day. I apologized for not contacting her,
                                  for so many years. And when I ask whether she has a bf yet, how
                                  afraid was I, that she would say yes. When she reply no, I was so reliefed. Thoughts tumble throught my head. I had so much I wanted to say but the
                                  words just won't come out. I wanted to tell her how much I missed her, how I thought of her every morning when I wake, how
                                  whenever I felt lonely at night I would think of her, but no words
                                  came. I wanted so much to know what she is thinking at that point in
                                  time, is she feeling the same way as I am or I am just another friend
                                  to her.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Time passes, soon it was time for her
                                  to go, she is meeting another friend for movie, I know its a guy and
                                  deep in my heart I felt so sad I did not want to let her go. But
                                  there is nothing I can do, so I accompany her back to her car. Still
                                  unable to say what I wanted to say.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">When we were at her car we began
                                  discussing about the route she has to take. My face was just beside
                                  her face as we look at the map. How I wanted at that moment to turn
                                  and hold her, but I held back. So we parted ways and all I can
                                  do is look at the rear of her car as she drives off..</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I wander around for a while not knowing
                                  what to do,  I contemplated going to where she is going just so I
                                  might have a chance of bumping into her again. But I did not do it, I just
                                  went back. Throughout the night I just sat there thinking of all
                                  the memories we have together. I text her again around 11 plus
                                  telling her how sorry I was for being so quiet. I just don't know
                                  when we will be able to meet again. I just miss her so much.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Sorry about my rantings here. Just wanted to tell someone else my thoughts and feeling. Just hope that she could by chance see this post. No, i do not think she frequent this forum. And I know its stupid that i am posting in a forum that she does not goes to, but thats the point i am doing it.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I am not looking for sympathy, just empathy...</p>

              My dear friend,
              
              2 long years went by and people change; even if you were to get back together again - it wouldn't be the same. Let your memories serve as a reminder and lesson; why didn't it work out back then, learn and better yourself.
              
              I empathize with you, but still you've got to move on.

              <p>First thing first. Sorry if i got all of you confuse. We were never together in the first place. Though i wanted us to be, but the times and situation back then...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">We  met about 5 years ago while
              clubbing. When I first laid my eyes on her I knew then that she is
              the ONE. But then at that point in time I was attached to someone
              else. However on and off since that day I have ask her out behind my
              then GF. I know I should not have done that but I don't wish to see
              anyone hurt. However in the end it seem to be a mistake cos I have
              end up hurting a lot more people.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I remember all the times we spent
              together the places we went to. Every single frame still remains in
              my mind till this day. I remember the first day I ask her out, she
              met with an accident which left a small scar on her forehead. I
              waited for her a long time then when I finally got through to her
              mobile that was when I knew she was admitted to a hospital. I rush
              down to the hospital looking for her. Looking back it was pretty dumb
              of me not to get any information of which ward she might be in. I just dash
              foolishly around asking around. Due to the fact that the reception there was not very good I could not call through to her. You could never
              imagine my relief when I saw her standing in front of me There are a
              lot more memorable events like when and where I first held her hand,
              there are too many of them for me to write it here.</p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;"> </p>
              <p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">I spent such a long time not contacting
              her, is because I hope that I would be able to forget her. Letting
              her have a happier life. I do not know how much of that is true, but
              I do know that through these two years. Never a day has gone by
              without me thinking of her.</p>

              <p>Karma88  I know it sounds like the movie. But the fact is i wish, this is really a movie, and i am just in the audience. Then at least i would know how things might turn out and i wouldn't be hurt.</p>
              <p>^c^ Yeah thats what i have been thinking to myself too. Funny isn't it. How time will let you see more clearly looking back.</p>
              <p>rish07 how i wish thing could be as simple as that, the problem is even if i wanted to she might not be willing.</p>

              <p>You write very well, gives the reader anticipation in what is going to happen next. You put feelings in your words dude. Grab some courage and call her out for more activities like movies, shopping, sports, or exhibitions. And when the feeling is right, make your feelings known.</p>
              <p>After 2 yrs of MIA and you suddenly confess to her would freak her out haha...unless she feels the same way too.</p>
