Usually it occurs when feelings of emptiness &amp; meaningless creep in...the only way to counter depression is to stay busy &amp; keep yourself occupied.<br>I was depressed a few months back...everything felt hopeless..but after I posted my depression in another forum...i had lots of people encouraging me &amp; they advised me to keep myself busy...<br>Another friend told me what I was suffering was just a temporary phase that would go away...he said his life was depressing &amp; he thought of suicide but what stopped him from that was he couldn't bear to leave his wife &amp; two young children without a father...<br><br>Now I don't feel depressed anymore...so stay positive in your outlook in life...there are people who are suffering in this world like hunger, poverty, sickness, etc... when you think of that, you will count your blessings &amp; not be depressed anymore.</div>

But then again, if starting up one's own business was simple and stress free, everybody would be a business person.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Like what a lot of business people will say, you will likely fail a few (or many) times before you succeed.<br><br>I know it sounds very cliched when I say this but whatever business you are doing, make sure that you at least have an interest in it or a passion to do it.  I know that ultimately the bottomline is that you need to make money from the business to survive.  Heck, everybody needs to eat.  But with passion, it will at least give you the determination and courage to push on and weather the storms that come your way while you learn the ropes and become familiar with the business until it becomes a viable source of income.<br><br>In my opinion, even if at the end of the day the business fails, you lose a lot of money and you have to give it up, you will still come out of it a better and more experienced person.  It is an experience nobody can take away from you.  YOU CHOSE TO FOLLOW YOUR HEART AND PASSION. Isn't that what life should be all about ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>What matters is that you are happy doing what you are doing.  That you are pursuing something that is, in your heart, worth pursuing.  Even if there are times when you are depressed from any problems that arise from the business itself, take consolation to know that even if you were working for somebody else in a firm, you will also experience stress, albeit of a different nature.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>You want to be stressed about your own problems or stressed about other people's problems ???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>So whatever it is, always know why you are doing what you are doing.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
