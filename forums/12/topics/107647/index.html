Beginning stages are always the most difficult.. Not only that, time is really hard for normal business to be running now... Even if it's not a new business...<br><br>But as you're aiming for something higher, naturally you'll expect a deeper fall and more hardship and such..?

            <div class='col-md body'>did you ask urself why venture into the killer business in the first place? Passion? Aim? Reassess them with what you are getting now. Is it worth it down the road? How long can you substain financially?<br><br>Take time to list down what are the likely outcomes you will be expecting and  not only just the outcomes you WANT. List what you going to do about them, contigency plan.<br><br>Results don't happen overnite. Though the only way to maintain a business is getting figures, the most precious and important things that you can hold on forever and come really useful are the experiences and lessons you learn from failures in your business. Most of the time, having those experiences prevent you from getting into larger pitfalls that the rest fall into.<br><br></div>
