            <div class='col-md body'><strong>  Leading pediatric neurologist Dr. Fred Baughman says hyperactivity is Â“an illusion, a contrivance [and] a deception.Â” Without a shred of scientific evidence, psychiatrists claim the symptoms of this Â“diseaseÂ” include:<br><br>often fidgets with hands or feet or squirms in seat;<br><br>often leaves seat in a classroom or in other situations in which remaining seated is expected;<br><br>often has difficulty playing or engaging in leisure activities quietly;<br><br>is often Â“on the goÂ” and often talks excessively.<br>And what of Ritalin? Ritalin is actually an amphetamine-like drug, but in children it acts as a tranquilizer. ItÂ’s a Schedule II drug in the same category as opium, cocaine and morphine. Highly addictive, withdrawal from it can cause suicide. Side effects can include: loss of appetite, weight loss, inability to stay asleep, heart palpitations, drowsiness, joint pain, nausea, chest pain and abdominal pain. It can also cause hallucinations and increase bizarre and abnormal behavior. </strong> quoted</div>

He would always be off playing sports, coaching teams, or refereeing some kind of activity. Kurt took the divorce very severely. It hurt so bad that he hated his parents afterwards. Mostly his father though. He was ashamed that his parents split up.

As a result Kurt was perscribed another drug which was to help him sleep at night. This introduction to drugs was the beginning of his frequent drug use and abuse. When Kurt was seven his parents separated and got a divorce. Kurt then moved around from one relative to the next and never really had a permanent home. As a result of this trauma Kurt became more and more reserved and antisocial.

A religion that's helped us evolve as a company and as riders over the last 20 years. To some, our obsession may seem a little sick in the head. But then, those people probably don't ride. They don't understand that, to be the best at something, you need to be a fanatic. And believe us, there's plenty of those wandering around our hallways. People like our product designers, who pursue innovations like they were well-hidden singletracks. Or the masochistic group down in R&amp;D, who probably have more scar tissue than the entire NHL combined. Even our founder, Mike Sinyard, has been known to cancel meetings just so he could spend more time on the trail. Weird? Not to us. We started Specialized for two major reasons.<br><br>Number one: We love the sport.<br>Number two: We want to build products that help people like you enjoy the sport as much as we do.<br><br>Period.<br><br>So enjoy the site. And be happy knowing all of the products were conceived, designed, tested and built by the same twisted fanatics that use them.</strong><br><br>this is for a bicycle<br><br>but passion in car mechanic or driving follows the same philosophy<br>too.<br><br>this is a passion but r we allow to have a small passion in singapore?<br></div>
