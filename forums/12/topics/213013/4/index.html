            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>The problem is that those ethical codes by themselves are constantly changing. 30 to 40 years ago in Singapore a couple holding hands in public was already considered as a shameless act of PDA. Now prostitutes openly soliciting customers in the streets is considered normal. At this rate, open sex by the roadside will soon be the norm.<br><br>You also can't underestimate to power of the mass media. As much parents and teachers keep telling us about the virtues of chastity and abstinence, it all counts for nuts if we have our youth watching sex scenes and blatant promiscuity on the telly set at 10pm. The message that gets driven into their brains is clear: 'sex is fun. Abstinence is for dorks.'<br><br>In the past, the best friends of our youth are their parents. But now with the close relationships of youths exhibiting a paradigm shift from parents to their peers, it's a whole lot harder to live by your parents' sayings and warnings with regards to sexual promiscuity. Especially if your best bud happens to be bragging about how all his sexual 'conquests'.<br><br>As for me, I'll stick to what my parents said about the birds and the bees. Call me old-fashioned, but to me they hold a lot of wisdom.<br><br>And after seeing what happened to one of my buddies when he came down with gonorrhoea after a ONS, I'm convinced once and for all that abstinence till marriage is the smartest thing to do.<br></strong></blockquote>I Love your words...  Its true.. about the part about holding hands in the past is considered shameless... But as human civilzation advances...As people get smarter... Things like these are bound to happen...  As for me same as well...I'll stick to the concept of not doing it b4 marriage... Maybe b4 being married at the point of engagement is alright...   But about ONS...I think thats outta of the question for me...<br></div>
