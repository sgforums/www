              <p>yes really. I have stop counting the number of times she stalked me. Just now when I opened the front door of the flat to sweep away a cockroach at about 1.30am. Just when I was about to lock up the door, my mom's door opened and then closed, without stepping out to the living room. Dun you think she ought to be sleeping at this hour and what on earth was that for?</p>
              <p>Yesterday morning when I walk to the kitchen to take a shower in the kitchen, I heard her bedroom door opened in the morning and I think she did not step out of her room. I have no idea what she is up to, and I hated it very much. some of the things she is doing is driving me crazy in the house. for example, instead of washing the dishes after eating, all she does was to put water in the bowl or pot and leave it there and wash it the next day.</p>
              <p> I dunno if she is getting senile,a few times she came home without even locking the front door of the flat. i really dunno how to communicate with her at all, as all she does is to nag and nag and go on and on.</p>

              <p>All that you suffer is not cos of what she does or is being lah, u suffer cos u expect ..., u compare and most of all u blame her for all that u feel.</p>
              <p>Man, you forget that one day u would also get old. If u resent her and feel only disdain, ask yourself how are u going about and dealing with ur feelings/emotions. It may appear like she is causing it. i doubt it lah - the truth of the matter is that all these feelings/emotions have always been there <span style="text-decoration: underline;">inside u</span>, unexpressed, accumulated, unreconciled and unaccpeted.  It is surfacing whenever she does or is being ...</p>
              <p>Assuming she is senile, the sensible thing is to look into it and find a way, if need be, seek medical opinion/advice and take ti from there.</p>

              everyone has different habits. I also soak my dishes before i wash
              them..  If you don't like that she leave the dishes in the basin for
              too long... don't you think you coulda wash the dishes yourself ?</p>

              <p>I think you should move out, since you are already past your mid 30s.</p>
              <p>This is a fundamental problem because you are getting older, you want to be more independent, and you cannot stand living with your mother.</p>
              <p>There is no remedy except that you do something which can better fit your new outlook and your desire for independence. You should move out.</p>
              <p>Stop whining and blaming your mother if you yourself are unwilling and unable to take action.</p>

              <p>My mother also like that, sibeh KPO one.  I do not dare tell her my secrets, as she is one who cannot keep secrets, even at her age. trust me, you will not want to tell her your inner secrets, unless you want it to be divulged. Why I  know? because she will go around telling my relatives. there are some people who just cannot keep secrets. there are some things that can tell, and some that cant tell.</p>
              <p>I do not know why women are programmed like that, seriously. young and old women alike, bitchy, gossip, backstab and likes to nag and nag.</p>
