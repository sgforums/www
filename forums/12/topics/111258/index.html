If we have the chemistry.."<br><br>Now what's the key word here? You got it. it's<strong> Chemistry</strong>.<br>To a women, chemistry is either there or it isn't.<br><br>Chemistry is about a woman perceiving that she and a guy are "naturally compatible" because her emotional and physical sparks fly when she meets or is around that guy.<br><br>Chemistry is NOT the result of a woman meeting a man and then thinking to herself "Let's see... he is six feet tall, has a good job making 20% more than the normal salary, is the correct age for child rearing... I think that we have a natural chemistry...".<br><br>Some tips to stirr up the attraction: -<br>1 Be humorous.<br>2 Be in control of urself.<br>3 Know how and when to tease.<br>4 Try creating tension, anticipation or mystic.. (whatever u call it, haha)<br><br>Well, I'll stop right here. Of course, there're many more ways to add in but the above are what I can do to help you bro..<br><br>All the best in ur future endeavors..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

You must learn to accept and then move on from it.. Not to dwell into it time over time.. This won't get you anywhere.. It might jus follow you around each time you tried something new..<br><br>People come and go.. you also know how to say.. the more you fall.. the stronger you should be... and not weaker.. In this world is not only having gfs can fulfilled your loneliness.. What about your friends?? your family?? If you aren't prepared to be in a relationship don't force yourself to.. Even if you got into one.. are you sure and confident that it will last long?? or it might be jus a short one.. in the case.. wouldn't you be telling us again.. that you are shattered from a broken relationship that you tot she might be the one..<br><br>If love really comes it will come... Don't push yourself too much.. Engage yourself into more activities.. get to know more friends.. and build back your self-esteem and pride first before you start doing anything like courtship.. Cos right now.. you ain't stable enough and prepared to have any r/s.. You've been hurt once and your think the world is going to collapse.. what about those that had been through more than you..<br><br>A good personality and character is what one is looking for.. Yes.. of cos looks does take into consideration.. but not that much.. if someone who is true to you.. no matter how ugly you look.. or how handsome you can be.. she will still love you the way you are.. is your heart and sincerity.. care and concern... If i'm the girl that you are goin to chase or be with.. and i know that you are someone who have no confident and low self-esteem.. how would the girl think.. will she feel secure when she's with you.. Or will you feel inferior anot??<br><br>Right now.. you got this close to this girl.. and she says she doesn't wan to start any r/s before the exams.. then wait.. wat the rush for it?? If you are 100% sure of yourself that she's really the one.. and she can be your gf.. No matter what obstacles come you must be able to fight it.. And not sitting down here.. wailing about you cannot get her.. she treats everyone the same.. i;m just like any other good friend of hers.. If you think like this.. You NEVER succed! Think about this.. even if you failed.. at least you tried your very best.. and after you know that you couldn't get her.. don't be too depressed.. Jus be yourself.. and you both still can be friends.. If you WANT TO!<br><br>If you keep telling yourself.. you are a loser you are a failure.. FOREVER you will be one! During this period of time.. is a good chance for you to build up your confidence level.. and meanwhile.. wait till exams is over then maybe you strike.. But still keep the closeness you have for each other..<br><br>BE GENUINE and be TRUE to yourself..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
