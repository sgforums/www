She don't bother about the gossips becos simply she knows that purely you both are rather good friends.. and none other than that..<br><br><strong>UNLESS</strong> you know that her bf is rather a jerk or what.. and you got confidence in yourself.. and garauntee that you can slowly let her be your girl.. then move slowly with your plan.. dun rush.. If not.. so be it..<br><br>Well, looking at this situation, i guess you and her should stick to friends.. sometimes when you like someone.. she might not be the suitable one for you.. hold your feelings.. unless you really jus wanna let her know how you feel.. and that's about it.. but be prepared if you tell her.. dunno how her reaction might be.. it can be good.. and you still remain aas friends.. but it can be bad.. that she tend to avoid you.. it's hard to say.. It depends on yourself whether to keep it mum.. or say..<br><br>Life is like a chess.. once you move wrong.. that's no turning back!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers..</div>
