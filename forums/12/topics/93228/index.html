Slow method but you leave everything to the "higher powers" to decide.  So whatever happens, not your fault.<br><br>2) Tell her your feelings.  See her reaction.<br>Good reaction - fantastic but now you are officially the third party.  Then come the problems. eg how to tell her boyfriend, maybe the boyfriend cannot take it etc etc - this can get very messy.<br>Bad reaction - be prepared to have her ignore / avoid you.  Good thing is you know what her stand is.  Bad thing, you may not even be friends with her anymore if she feels it is best to not see each other too often ... people will gossip etc etc<br><br>3) You just let it be and move on since you don't want to be the third party.<br>However, I guess love is not something you forget just like that.  Time supposedly heals all wounds. May take one  month, one year, ten years.<br>If you find yourself still thinking of her after so long, then you are just one of the millions of people in this world who are in the same shoes as you.<br><br>Sad but that's life ...<br><br>Listen to some sad songs (Winter Sonata's theme song by Jeff Chang is highly recommended), drink some beer and get on with your life ...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br></div>
