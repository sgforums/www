When she's ready, she'll probably spill her thoughts. That is, if she is willing to share. Not that she doesn't trust you or anything, at the least in my case, it's some sort of insecurity thing..<br><br>I think that firstly, it depends on the problem, whether it is related to you or not. If it isn't, then you can probably lend a shoulder for her to cry on. Don't ask about the problem; wait for her to open up. Give her tissues and soothing rubs on the back etc.<br><br>Edited:<br><br>Or maybe she's just insecure.<br></div>
