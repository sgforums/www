            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">sometimes, even when we love somebody too much, we shouldn't make him/her feel that we can't live without him/her.  Coz this will result in 3 consequences:<br><br>1.  He feels that u are too relient on him/sticky.  Hence wana get rid of you.<br>2.  He will feel pressurised.  Therefore, he will try to avoid you.<br>3.  He will think that you wun run away, and so take you for granted.<br><br>Just my opinion la, feel free to correct me if u think im wrong. </span></div>
