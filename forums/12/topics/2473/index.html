            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br>recently, I found myself getting jealous whenever this close female friend of my started getting really close with other guys. At first, i thought i would never fall in love with her cause she's a malay. But this malay gal is definitely different, she's not a typical minah. In fact, albeit she's malay and older than me by 4 yrs, I find her very interesting and veri ' clickable'.<br>We always call each other names for fun and when people think we're together, we wil always defend ourselves by claiming to be good siblings. but now, I'm going into NS soon, and i tell u...i will sure miss her. Never felt like this before, is this realli love or crush? I get jealous eerytime she dances with other guys and when she tries to joke with them. ME gets very very jealous. maybe i should control myself. And the sad thing is, i have been seeing other gals, as in social interaction. So the excuse of me being too close to onli one gal does not apply. i have been close to many other gals now and then but no body impresses me like this malay gal does. She's very english speaking and i like that. with her, i feel mature and think mature and talk mature. that's good development for me. i even have to thank her for that. of course, we have our childish times too like joking poking fun at each other and more. But i noe this is an impossible relationship because of race and age. So many have told me, if u noe it cant work, why start even in the first place. but hey, i'm still young, i'm not looking for a wife to settle down with. why think so far ahead? being with her realli makes my day. even if we cant last forever, having those happy moments once together are memories good enough to savour for a lifetime.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Buddy, look here, from what I know, or from the situation it is, it might be a kind of puppy love towards her for you. Come on, you are going to NS soon to be a real MAN, you will get over her, I bet you, and you will find that there are many good girls out there(hopefully)and who knows, your right one is coming along the way as soon as you ORD. So brace up and face the fact if it is indeed an impossible relationship.Tell yourself that. Be a MAN! I know you can do it! Remember what NIKE advertisement say? "JUST DO IT"!<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br>Don</div>

From my past experiences, Malays were even more filial than Chinese girls and sociable too.<br>Rohm, I been thru NS, but think it's not so gd an idea to get involved in a relationship b4 that, u neglect her A/F that, trust me...<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That was very rude of you, Toshiya! Your reply only goes to show your level of immaturity and how you have not made an effort to know people fr other races. Think before you decide to say something against other races or religion, or are you not capable of even that simple action? Be careful, your words can eat you up!<br><br>Rohm: No one can ever properly define our emotions. Neither are there correct terms to call them. What you feel now has probably been built up over time, thus your confusion as to whether it's love or crush. Don't worry about it - just go along with it. You have every right to.<br>Have you made your feelings known to her? Does she reciprocate them? If she does, then good for you! If not, ask her why. You should know her reasons, not to mould yourself to accomodate them, but to find it in yourself the ability to fulfill them as you are.<br>Keep it platonic for now though. You're going to be enlisted (or are you already in?), and I assume you'll be continuing your studies. Keep in touch as per normal, but do see other people, even though you know there's a high risk of either one of you falling for another. If that happens, then it happens. You can't control these things. But if after so long, you're both still unattached, have another go at it.<br>Age and race can be overcome, although it's a little difficult for Malays (in case you didn't know, they can't convert). But nothing's impossible. As you get older, age takes a backseat, more or less. As for religion, well, you'll grow into it - and it's not just out of your love for her.<br>I should know. I'm marrying my Malay fiancee soon, and we're starting a new life overseas. Agonizing as it may be, the long wait was worth the sacrifice.<br>All the best to you, Rohm!</div>
