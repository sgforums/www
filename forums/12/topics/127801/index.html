Thanks!<br><br>strudz</div></blockquote>Hi applestrudz,<br>For a start, I take it that you both are officially already in the relationship. Just wondering, how is the level of communication? Instead of "blaming" him for been insensitive, have you tried to communication it with him and express on how you both can improve on this issue in order to make this relationship work.<br><br>Some guys will take a gal's words like taking an order as they are not that sensitive. You told him to leave you alone just because you needed some space and time to calm down, but I guess from the guy's perspective, he was afraid to anger you any further, hence he will just leave you alone like as you told him to.<br><br>In another sense, some guys are good in suppressing their emotion. Like you said, he might he "hiding in a cave". Or maybe, he assume that you both are tied up with the projects hence this is not such a good time to talk. Try to free up and open up both your heart and mind and try to talk and understand each other better.<br><br>Gals sometime wanted guys to make the first move, some guys are afraid to make mistake in the first move, hence this has become a "waiting game". Why don't you both come out for a good heart to heart talk if you both like  each other. He had already made a small first move by saying to catch up after both your projects ended.<br><br>Wish you all the best. Good luck.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Sigh .. </div></blockquote>Hi applestrudz,<br>Just like to find out, do you both tried talking to properly understand what can make both of you tick, or maybe something that you or him don't feel comfortable about?<br><br>The dating stages don't just consist of going out or doing things together but it is more to understand the other party better and to see if he or she is suitable for you.<br><br>Talk about taking a gal's words seriously, it really depends on individual. Some guys will actually leave you alone if you ask them to as they don't know what is troubling you and they don't know what to do, and they fear things can get worse if they tried to probe further which could lead to more misunderstanding. Some guys will keep asking and probing to get the answer or the reason as to why the gal is angry, this could sometime lead to frustration on the gal who just wanted a little bit of their personal space and time to cool down.<br><br>It is not a mistake for telling a guy something that you don't mean it, that is just a gal's nature, you are entitled to it, but hope that you will not "abuse" it. This is why a gal will want a guy to be more sensitive on their part, to understand a gal's hidden meaning.<br><br>Ok, back to the topic. I cannot be very sure what he is thinking right now. But since he is still nice to you and the way he handle your material, it seems like a good sign. Like I said before, try to talk with him, have a good heart-to-heart talk to evaluate about this "cold war" and "guessing" period. I guess for your part, you are afraid to make the first move, maybe you are shy and will rather that he make the first move instead. He had already mentioned about doing some catching up after the projects, why not consider taking up that invitation and then have a talk.<br><br>No point assuming or play the "guessing game", just have a good chat with him and the stone on your heart will be lifted.<br><br>I wish you all the best. Good luck.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

So he did.<br><br>If you have a good feeling about him and your intuition tells you that the feeling may be mutual, why not find an opportunity to let him know during a casual conversation, that you didn't really mean what you said that time because work was so stressful? (You could also throw in a lunch/dinner invitation as a token of appreciation of his taking care of you and helping you with your work.)

Be it that you are still in the dating stage or officially in a relationship, communication is very important. Sometime, couples like to play "read-my-mind" game, they usually don't speak up their mind or simply say things that they don't mean and wanted the other party to guess and understand what is wrong.

You see, if it is because of pride that either parties will not take a step back or back down, this will cause a lot of unwanted misunderstanding and fight. What is the point of "winning" a "cold war"? You may have retain your "pride", but you may lost something truly more important and precious.<br><br>Since you feel that there is a mutual understanding and some chemistry between you two, why not pluck up your courage, stop guessing or waiting and start doing. Like I mentioned earlier, he made his first small move already, why not accept his invitation to do some catching up during a coffee session after treating him to a dinner because he had offer his help to you.<br><br>Like you say, in a relationship, or in the topics of feelings or emotion, there is no right or wrong, it is just if the party is suitable for you that's all. Try it handle this issue properly, try to talk with each other.<br><br>Whatever is your decision, I wish you all the best. Good luck.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Even between married couples, we also play the "waiting game".  Didn't someone said "Pride comes before a fall"?  So when we are in that "pride" mode or cold war zone, depending who is falling, the other party will lend a hand.  So cold war become warm war.  Nice?<br><br>Anyways, if you feel really strongly about him, make the first move.  If that's not working then perhaps, it's his subtle way of telling you he is not interested in a relationship but is in a friendship.<br><br>Good luck, applestrudz.</div>

Want some frank opinions here.. maybe you can tell me what is going on in his mind? Â“</span><br><br>To answer this question is actually quite simple<br><br>A guy likes a gal. He tried his best to hint the girl. The girl never says much then in the end, girl say need some time off to think it over. Guy gives girl time to think over ( not bad lar seen other guys keep forcing the girl to commit) If girl likes guy, she must accept the fact the guy, he will not always be there for her. The guy just try to see if they could still have a chance by msg the girl, but from what I see, if girl never put in effort then both of them better be friends thatÂ’s all. The guy is a gentleman, by using this method, if the girl rejects him they can still be friends.<br><br><span style="color: blue;"><br><br>Humm so you do have some feelings for him I see.<br><br>Actually my words will use to test you whether you still got any feelings for him at all.

If you tell me is the latter, I salute U</span><br><br>Btw hor I am a guy. I never deny it at all. I will choose the less pretty one. I am serious about this.  Cos I have seen the pretty ones betray their partners very often so no point in keeping them. Is just that it is a waste time, effort and money to maintain the relationship then when they are tired of seeing you they just run to another. I rather spent my time in finding a good one with good heart. Beauty does not last at all.<br><br><span style="color: orange;">Final thinking:</span>  If you love someone have the heart to let him know, or when the day comes when he or she moves on, then you will know the heart pain of losing someone this close.</span></div>

The only "fault" is that there was a mis-match in expectations. I have pinned too much hope on him. To my "shock" then, I never thought he would behaved so aloof, think it's sign of "withdrawal syndrome"<br><br>Hmmm.. the main reason why I ended up in this dilemma, is b'cause I lack the courage to find out the truth from him. Wondering how come he is not "interested" anymore. I also can tell that he's making a subtle 1st step, by suggesting to meet up during our off-peak period. The amusing part is he used to put me on his 1st priority (even before his work). Guess I no longer enjoy that "privilege" anymore  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Anyway, I will be going o'seas 2 weeks for a short assignment soon. Will try to "settle" my issue then. Don't think I will do anything for the moment, shall ascertain whether the "chemistry" is still there when I meet up with him once I'm back to Sg (provided he inititate the "catching-up" ). Lotsa "IF"s ...<br><br>Maybe I'm too "old" to act impulsively to solve this problem..think too much ..hehe .. by nature, I'm those passive kind. Like what drx has pointed out, I'm fully aware that I might live to regret if I don't action. To me, easier said than done. Frankly speaking, if he is with some1 else now, I won't be surprised but I just wish to clear things up and end everything nicely. I'm so confused by myself now; sometimes I can be so rational, other times, so emotional when thinking thru' this issue...arrggghh .... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Gtg ...thanks all!<br><br>strudz<br></div>
