              <p>Hello Yuki and all,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I just ended my relationship of 3 yrs.</p>
              <p>All i can say it`s all my fault,</p>
              <p>Yes, just the period before the break off, i was some sort of person like u had described about your boyfriend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps let me give you some background of my relationship,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I knew her since i took up tertiary education. Seriously, there was no intention of chasing her and all those stuff. but things turned out too well and too fast and i soon got together with her. At that point of time, she used to have a lot of troubles in her life, i was like her pilliar of support for sometime. I loved her and cared for her like each day was to be my last day alive. I will usually surprise her w sincere gifts and ocassionally buy her things that were beyond my capabilities.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Life was so perfect then, I loved her and she loved me. All the other problems in the world seems to be insignificant in the presence of our love. Being poor together, skipping lunches together cuz we had no money. sharing our money if either one had it. There was much trust in everything that we do. I`ll wait for her to end her lessons to send her home and she`ll wait for mine to end so that we can go home together. There was so much giving from each of us and none of us were complaining.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, things took a turn for the past few months.... Perhaps it`s that we gotten so used to eat other that now we do not show much appreciation for the good that we had done for each other. The surprises were meet with disapointments, the understanding that used to be there were gone. Good intentions were often met with undesiarable results. That where everything got worse, we become more hostile towards each other, in the need to seek the attention that was once so strong, but seemingly all gone. We do thing that would hurt each other emotionally and have the least of patience for each other. Qurrels were abundent and common. Soon we being the many cycles of breaking and patching. We`ll always be v nice to each other after every patch. But each time, after a while, we`ll qurrel again over some issues and break again. I know that we were both very sick of these.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The girl that i once knew was not there anymore. Ever so sweet and understanding. To her, the boy that she loved so much was not there anymore. The dedication and drive to do well was all lost in the echos of the past.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I had a wake up call sometime ago wrt to why we ended up in this stage. The reason is that we really took each other for granted, especially on my part. I did not reassure her my love anymore like what i do in the past. She did not show her appreiciation of my efforts like what she did in the past. I guess we were just too tired to carry on. No doubt there was love, but it wasnt like berfore. Somehow it took me to read this thread and previous thread to realise how bad a bf i was. I know it was time i had to make a change, but probably it was too late as the person that i wanted to grow old with was gone.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I wouldnt ask for another chance with her cuz i failed to show her care and concern while i had the chance to. until all becomes too late, i can only wept in silence and think of our good times everyday.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yuki,</p>
              <p>I`ll like to represent your boyfriend and give you my most sincere apologies.</p>
              <p>before you finally close out ur world with him,</p>
              <p>have u ever asked him why does he need to be like that?</p>
              <p>as in why he needs to be so violent w u and such?</p>
              <p>let him know how u feel and make a last effort to know how he feel.</p>
              <p>if he is really a scumbug like i am, pls leave him</p>
