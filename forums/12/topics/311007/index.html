              <p><strong>Continuing from my first AA thread here &gt;</strong> <a href="/forums/12/topics/300952">http://sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/300952</a></p>
              <p>I've heed the advice of my own friends &amp; all that replied to my thread. In January, I did something (on purpose) that made him mad @ me. I predicted that he would get so mad with me, he'll ask for a break up. &amp; He did. Everything went according to plan. (Boy, was he predictable <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">) So I took that chance &amp; I totally avoided him for a few days, telling everyone that he broke with me.</p>
              <p>But instead blowing up &amp; threatening me, he cried &amp; apologised to me for how badly he treated me. He really really regretted breaking up with me. He promised me that he will change &amp; he begged me for the chance to woo me back &amp; I couldn't help myself - I said ok because I still love him so much. We contacted each other through sms for the first few weeks. Then calls. Then we finally met up to go out together with a group of friends. Then we started meeting up more frequently.</p>
              <p>At first, there was no physical contact between us. Then I let him hold my hand. Then I let him hug me. Then I let him kiss me. Soon, it was like we never broke up @ all. I was very close to patching back with him.</p>
              <p>A day ago, someone close to me encouraged me to have a clean break with him. Because he hasn't shown any drastic changes since we broke up. He still has that temper problem. (Even though we weren't together anymore, we would still get into quarrels) My friend told me that I should start Poly afresh &amp; leave him behind. I had to stop contacting him once &amp; for all.</p>
              <p>I already msged him, telling him to stop contacting me. After the sms, I ignored his msgs &amp; calls. I'm not taking it very well. I broke down &amp; cry so many times yesterday. I really still love him very much. He told me that he is sincere, that he'll change &amp; stay changed if I go back to him. Should I believe him &amp; go back to him? Very emotionally unstable now <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="icon_cry.gif"></p>

              <p>If you want to move on, then you have to cut all ties.</p>
              <p>Are you certain that this person will change? Are you very sure that he is sincere?</p>
              <p>Based on what you have written, I doubt it. IF he really is sincere of having you back, how come he didn't watch his temper? Do you see him making an effort to show you that he is genuine and sincere about you?</p>
              <p>Bystanders can say alot to you. But only you know what to do, cause you are the one in the situation. "The truth of the matter is we always know what is the right thing to do. The hardest part is doing it."</p>
              <p>I feel that you should look at the bigger picture and in the long run. </p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents.</p>

              <p>This is just a short period of time that you are accessing him. What if you guys get back together, then he returns to his old self?</p>
              <p>Take a longer time to access, before you make the decision. It's only good for you to do that.</p>

              <p>Thats the way to go! By telling him to stop contacting you, you have burnt your bridges meaning that there is no turning back. Keep at it and you'll be fine later.</p>
              <p>You can pick up a sport, go shopping, call up your old friends, etc. Wipe those tears, sit up and make a resolution to keep yourself occupied. Try avoiding being alone; your mind may start wandering back to him. Be strong ya.</p>
