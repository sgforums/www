              <p>Ha I had a bf something like yours before and he was 2, 3 &amp; 5 of the pts you listed on your previous thread.</p>
              <p>My adv is a clean break from him. Like yours, he cried, begged and even stalked me after break-up that he would change. Gave him chance and chance and I tell you no changes at all.</p>
              <p>You feel sad because he used to be part of your life and you being used to him is really not to be used as an excuse.</p>
              <p>I suggest you take your friend's adv and break off all contacts and start afresh. There are better guys out there who will cherish and love you and not abuse you and take you for granted.</p>

              <p>This is going to be harsh, but here goes.</p>
              <p>Loving him, is like loving <strong>AIDS</strong>.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself, what good has he done for YOU? From what I saw in your relationship with him, your were giving, and he was taking. There was no balance. Imagine the type of life he could put you through.</p>
              <p>If you stick by him, its going to be unhealthy for you. You said you wanted to start afresh upon the start of poly, if you really mean it, leave him behind, whatever it takes. It won't be easy, but it's whats best for you.</p>
              <p>And heres something else, upon breaking up, he cried? He was taking you for granted all the while. How do you know it won't happen again?</p>

              <p><strong>Continuing from my first AA thread here &gt;</strong> <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/300952">http://sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/300952</a></p>
              <p>I've heed the advice of my own friends &amp; all that
                  replied to my thread. In January, I did something (on purpose) that
                  made him mad @ me. I predicted that he would get so mad
                  with me, he'll ask for a break up. &amp; He did. Everything went
                  according to plan. (Boy, was he predictable <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif">) So I took that chance &amp; I totally
                  avoided him for a few days, telling everyone that he broke
                  with me.</p>
              <p>But instead blowing up &amp; threatening me, he cried
                  &amp; apologised to me for how badly he treated me. He really
                  really regretted breaking up with me. He promised me that
                  he will change &amp; he begged me for the chance to woo me back
                  &amp; I couldn't help myself - I said ok because I still love him
                  so much. We contacted each other through sms for the first few
                  weeks. Then calls. Then we finally met up to go out together with a
                  group of friends. Then we started meeting up more frequently.</p>
              <p>At first, there was no physical contact between us. Then I
                  let him hold my hand. Then I let him hug me. Then I let him
                  kiss me. Soon, it was like we never broke up @ all. I was very
                  close to patching back with him.</p>
              <p>A day ago, someone close to me encouraged me to have a clean
                  break with him. Because he hasn't shown any drastic changes
                  since we broke up. He still has that temper problem. (Even though
                  we weren't together anymore, we would still get into quarrels) My
                  friend told me that I should start Poly afresh &amp; leave him
                  behind. I had to stop contacting him once &amp; for all.</p>
              <p>I already msged him, telling him to stop contacting me.
                  After the sms, I ignored his msgs &amp; calls. I'm not taking
                  it very well. I broke down &amp; cry so many times yesterday.
                  I really still love him very much. He told me that
                  he is sincere, that he'll change &amp; stay changed if I
                  go back to him. Should I believe him &amp; go back to him?

              <p>I think if you really love a person, you need to know that you cannot change a person. He is after all who and what he is. The change will need to be coming from his end and not you trying to change him.</p>
              <p>And having said this, now he is trying to change and as a friend we will need to see how sincere and resolve he is in this. I think you will need to support and encourage him - not simply just say break off . You see, at this moment you are his objective for this makeover and to remove this would only have repercussions than doing any good. I do agree that I am shocked to read how bad his temper and outlook can be but I think if you can be equally resolve on your part - things might just work out.</p>
              <p>Here's how I see it. I think there will need to be some ground rules set here and it must be strictly adhered to at both ends. He will need to fufill his end of the bargain as far as his academics, temper and finances is concerned. You will need good friends to be by your side to judge his progress along with you. Which means no more 1 to 1 dates and all outings will be strictly group basis for 1 full academic year. Grades and conduct all on the go. No interference to your studies and certainly no distractions to be coming from his end. There will be some demerits and having reached that it will be considered as he has failed and be kicked out of the game and your life. This was adopted by a friend of mine and was quite successful and the period was for 2 years when he finally achieved his O levels. Now he is a BA grad, thanks to her.</p>
              <p>So all is not so dampening at the other end. Love when administered with wisdom is really better than any essence and lessons on life.</p>

              <p><br>I DID NOT TEST HIM! I wanted break up with him but I knew if I was the one doing it, he will threaten me &amp; all that. So I pushed him to a point where I know that he will break up with me. I wanted to break up with him because I wanted him to wake up. He always told me that even if I broke up with him, he won't miss me, he won't give a damn. But I knew he was lying. So I wanted him to say the words "Break Up", regret &amp; change!</p>

              <p>This is going to be harsh, but here goes.</p>
              <p>Loving him, is like loving <strong>AIDS</strong>.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself, what good has he done for YOU? From what I saw in your relationship with him, your were giving, and he was taking. There was no balance. Imagine the type of life he could put you through.</p>
              <p>If you stick by him, its going to be unhealthy for you. You said you wanted to start afresh upon the start of poly, if you really mean it, leave him behind, whatever it takes. It won't be easy, but it's whats best for you.</p>
              <p>And heres something else, upon breaking up, he cried? He was taking you for granted all the while. How do you know it won't happen again?</p>
              <p>Think about it, Yuki.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>I know how difficult it is to put things aside after so long.. but sometimes it is necessary to bear with short term pain and put it aside.. move on.. it is for the better in the long run.</p>
              <p>I wouldnt try to persuade you whether or not to dump him coz I'm not in a position to.. and I duno wat's your problem with him. But, you should be able to make a sound decision by yourself.</p>

              <p>I talked to him on the phone just now. He demanded, yes, <strong>demanded</strong> to know why I didn't want to go back to him.
