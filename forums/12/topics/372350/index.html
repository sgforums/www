              <p>Please guys, im really hurt here more like confuse. Ok this girl I like in work, well not love actually. Just makes me happy when she's around. Im not sure but i got this feeling she hates me. When we chatted thru msn, she talks like im her good friend. There's always a topic and i know we enjoy our convo. When we met, she says hi to me or good morning in a really happy way and i did the same.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But sometimes, we ignore each other. Like really, we passby the hallway and we just smile and nod. And then moments later, she invite me to lunch. And after that, we went so happy together. We chat and stuff. Then it goes back to square one as in we just treat together like strangers sometimes in msn too. Then the next day, she invites me to lunch again and we went happy again and when we were working tgt she's really happy and i mean it, we talk like there's no tmrw. This really confuse me. At that time, she sms me and i reply back. And when i sms her she reply me back with just a few txt msg then she didnt reply me back. Then when we met again, she went all happy around me again. wtf.... its like we are really close friends then sometimes we are like strangers. Im really confuse. pls advice and pls take it easy on me. Well my question is that why she treats me like this? does she hates me?</p>

              <p><br>er i dont think thats what im trying to say. Some of us are quite playful and sneaky ^^. Usually guys make the moves first, so thats what we do. She "ignore" the guy to wait his response towards her. How is he going to react. Its a playful thing but we chat to the guy later on ^^.</p>

              <p>Please guys, im really hurt here more like confuse. Ok this girl
              I like in work, well not love actually. Just makes me happy when
              she's around. Im not sure but i got this feeling she hates me. When
              we chatted thru msn, she talks like im her good friend. There's
              always a topic and i know we enjoy our convo. When we met, she says
              hi to me or good morning in a really happy way and i did the
              same.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But sometimes, we ignore each other. Like really, we passby the
              hallway and we just smile and nod. And then moments later, she
              invite me to lunch. And after that, we went so happy together. We
              chat and stuff. Then it goes back to square one as in we just treat
              together like strangers sometimes in msn too. Then the next day,
              she invites me to lunch again and we went happy again and when we
              were working tgt she's really happy and i mean it, we talk like
              there's no tmrw. This really confuse me. At that time, she sms me
              and i reply back. And when i sms her she reply me back with just a
              few txt msg then she didnt reply me back. Then when we met again,
              she went all happy around me again. wtf.... its like we are really
              close friends then sometimes we are like strangers. Im really
              confuse. pls advice and pls take it easy on me. Well my question is
              that why she treats me like this? does she hates me?</p>

              <p>Obviously this TS doesn't want to be just colleagues. So just try lah. If rejected, at least no false hopes liao. If gal accepts date, then you have a chance and make good use of it.</p>
              <p>What's the problem with being colleagues? When I was pursuing gals in uni, and it din worked out, its also the same issue, since we meet regularly for classes. But everyone' mature enough to know that if things din work out, then, things din work out lor. What's the big deal?</p>

              <p>I have very good gal pals in my company. We talk and have fun during lunch, but during work, sometimes we meet at pantry or walk by, just smile and nod.</p>
              <p>I don't see what your problem is? Why are you so concerned? Its her life, her personality, her character. As a friend, it's none of your business how she behaves.</p>
