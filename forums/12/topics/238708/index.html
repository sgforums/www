Therefore, in another words, this is also your choice - not just your boyfriend's decision. I think it kinda made your matter worst when you could have inevitably suggested that the change of plans is largely due to your boyfriend's displeasure. Even if it wasn't so, your friend perceived it that way.<br><br>Eventually, it's all about mutual understanding.<br><br>You could do your best to appease all sides, but you must have that understanding from them to compromise.<br><br>Of course, it would be better if your boyfriend isn't a chauvinist and learn the beauty of freedom and trust. It would be easier on your relationship with your friends. I mean, if he wants to come along, you don't have to bother if there's any other guys coming because he's intention is merely there to keep a watch on you... and to me, that's silly because he will be so out of place.<br><br>I mean this is probably a girl's night out and in the end you have a guy tagging along?<br><br>Come on.<br><br>You would probably spent all other times with your boyfriend and that's still not enough to even spare one night with friends?<br><br>You do your Maths.<br><br>P.S: A healthy relationship also consists of a healthy life outside that of their relationship.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>True friends will try to understand and support you, not slander.  So I dunno what kind of girlfriend you got there.<br><br>You boyfriend may have his reasons but there will always be a struggle between you two on where to draw the line - the line between OK and not OK.  IMO don't give in too much (within reason) , once he gets too used to your obedience he may take it for granted .</div>
