            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm, don't you think she'll be in a much better position to know than us?<br><br>From the looks of it, she could be tired out. And besides, its always better to sms/call once every 2-3 days then everyday. It does get stale...<br><br>You should talk this out to her when you eventually get her out on a date.<br><br>But just remember... its better to take a forgiving and relaxed stance, then to be worked up at everything she does/or not.<br><br>Just relax, everything will work itself out somehow.~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well... perhaps ur gf need some space and time alone. That's wat my bf is doing... But she doesn't calls u or sms u doesn't mean she doesn't love u. If its feeling lousy the way she treats u.. mayb u shud let her know. Even she might not be giving u any explaination, dun hope for 1 in the first place. At least she will know she's treating u shallowly now. She will reflect on what she had done. Let her know it's hurting u. Wat u feel, say it out. Dun hide.<br><br>In the meantime, wait patiently. Well, if u really love her. Thats wat i have to say. It will pay off</div>

She's definitely tired or somehow exhausted due to her own schedules. Just be a little understanding in this area okay? Give her some time to settle herself down and let her clear her own mind. Relax dude. Don't pressurize her further. It may poison your relationship.<br><br>About the SMS, relax... it may be due to some lags or maybe she's too tired to SMS u. She may be SMSing u everyday previously, then starts to cut it down a little, perhaps, she's testing ur reaction??<br><br>U'll never know!<br><br>If u react in a way that u portray yourself as clingy towards her, then u r going to fail the test IMMEDIATELY!!!<br><br>What should u do then? Act cool man. Ai Zai. COOL. Get that?<br>Doesn't matter if she stops SMSing for a while. Always wait and see what happens. Don't imagine things. Be cool. Don't act like u'll die without getting her SMSes...<br><br>I hope u get it.<br><br>Happy Lunar New Year.<br><br>S.H.I.N.<br></div>
