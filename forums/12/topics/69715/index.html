            <div class='col-md body'>There was a scholar who was to marry his<br>fiancÃ©e, but on the day of<br>marriage, his fiancÃ©e changed her mind and<br>married someone else. The<br>scholar was devastated and fell ill. His family<br>seek all kinds of<br>medical treatment for him, but still he showed<br>no sign of recovery. They were<br>about to give up hope on him when a wandering<br>monk passed by.<br>After learning about the scholar's condition,<br>the monk walked to the<br>scholar's bed and took out a mirror for the<br>dying man to see.<br><br>In the mirror, the scholar saw a vast ocean, and<br>the naked body of a<br>murdered woman lay on the beach. A man passed<br>by, looked at the body, shook his head and left.<br>Another man who passed by saw the body,<br>took off his robes to cover the body and left.<br>Finally came a man passing by<br>who saw the body, dug a hole and laid the body<br>carefully to rest before burying it.<br><br>The scene in the mirror suddenly changed. The<br>scholar saw his fiancÃ©e<br>in a nuptial chamber and another man was lifting<br>her wedding veil...<br>The scholar blinked at the monk, confused.<br><br>Slowly the monk explained, "The woman whose body<br>you saw on the beach<br>was your fiancÃ©e in her previous life. In your<br>previous life, you<br>were the<br>second man who gave her his robes to cover her<br>body. To repay your<br>kindness in this lifetime, she loved you for a<br>period of time and<br>became your fiancÃ©e. However, ultimately the man<br>whose favor she has to return<br>for the rest of her life is the third man who<br>buried her. And that man<br>is now<br>her husband."<br><br>Enlightened, the scholar sat up and recovered<br>from his depression.<br><br>It is truly amazing -- this thing called "Fate".<br>There was a movie in which the theme song went<br>like this: "You can<br>say it is a big world, you can say it is a small<br>world. But for the<br>promise of<br>this lifetime, we shall spend our entire lives<br>to fulfil."<br><br>All of us are in this big grand masquerade,<br>among the throng of<br>people, we seek expectantly... in that<br>electrifying moment when our<br>fingers touch, the masks are removed to reveal<br>our true selves.<br><br>Before this moment, we were drifting aimlessly,<br>not knowing what we<br>really wanted. Till you meet this particular<br>person, you finally<br>realize what<br>you really want is not what you have wished for<br>in the first place.<br>It<br>amazes you that standing in front of this person<br>is a different you!<br>You<br>without any mask!<br><br>Fate is not something meant to be forced upon.<br>What is yours will eventually come to your arms;<br>what is not yours<br>will never come to be. In any case, we should<br>not lose heart and<br>give up on<br>our hopes for love that is true, good and<br>beautiful.<br><br>The value of life, in a certain sense, is<br>determined by the maturity<br>of how we love. Of how we give and accept love.<br><br>Treasure what you have...<br>Time is too slow for those who wait;<br>Too swift for those who fear;<br>Too long for those who grief;<br>Too short for those who rejoice;<br>But for those who love...<br>Time is Eternity<br></div>
