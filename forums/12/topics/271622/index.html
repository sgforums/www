            <div class='col-md body'>I really really like this girl from my school but i really dunno how to approach her, or at least start of as friends as her. We are in different courses but we are in the same lecture group. Whenever i see her, she will be surrounded by her friends so it makes it really hard.<br><br>She's not particularly pretty, normal looking but theres something really special about her and the way she makes me feel. I truely cannot describe this feeling. I love her smile, the way she laughs , her voice, and after observing her(yes i look at her a lot), there's something about the her demeanour and personality that i seriously like and feel comfortable with.<br><br>I've also catched her staring at me almost every lecture and looking around for me in the crowded lecture theatre even if she sits at the other side.  I know she obviously notices me too, and that makes me really happy. But i just can't seem to find a way to approach her. She is ALWAYS with friends and i only see her for only a few hours a week. And my timetable is really getting seriously busy and stressful.<br><br>I'm really afraid that maybe next term we will be split into different lecture groups then i will almost never be able to see her. I reallty don't wanna miss this chance..and i've tried talking to her several times but i simply couldn't. The most i ever did was smile at her and she smiled back(need i say,stomach did a backflip in utmost joy). There is progress but both of us are too shy to approach each other. Sometimes i also purposely isolate myself away from my group of friends so that it might seem easier to approach me.  I'm afraid that i might lose my chance as time runs out.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

And my timetable is really getting seriously busy and stressful.<br><br>I'm really afraid that maybe next term we will be split into different lecture groups then i will almost never be able to see her. I reallty don't wanna miss this chance..and i've tried talking to her several times but i simply couldn't. The most i ever did was smile at her and she smiled back(need i say,stomach did a backflip in utmost joy). There is progress but both of us are too shy to approach each other. Sometimes i also purposely isolate myself away from my group of friends so that it might seem easier to approach me.  I'm afraid that i might lose my chance as time runs out.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote>Yup, sit close to her, then try to get her name.<br><br>Once you get her name, it'll be easier.<br>You can always do stuff like:-<br>1) Hey Ann, the lecturer wanted me to tell you something, can you come over for a minute?<br>2) Hey Ann, James wanted me to pass you something...<br>3) Ann, come quick! I Got something for you!<br><br>or you can just get yr friend to be the 'wingman', and ask him to distract other girls while you get her attention and talk.<br><br>Many methods, but depends on which one you want to use~</div>
