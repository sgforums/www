            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by binarynwitz:</div><div class="quote_body">I remembered I posted a thread with this same exact title, about 6 odd months ago. Strangely, the situation is almost the same. I didn't want to post in AA because I can already guess what you folks' replies would be.<br><br>But I needed an outlet, and I needed some external advices, even if they're the same as the ones I gave myself.<br>-----<br><br>So me and my (ex-)girlfriend broke up. Her reason is simple - "No more feelings". This was about... one month ago.<br><br>I've been trying to forget her. I've almost gotten over her. But a string of emotions, a string of affection. It's still not severed.<br><br>I don't know if I'm disillusioning myself, but I've been trying to let it go. She has gotten herself a new boyfriend (which I think is the real reason for the break-up). At least that's who I think he is. She's moved on, but I'm still swimming in my well, seeing the light day and night, but not being able to get out of the well. I'm still circling the memories. Almost two years worth of memories. To some it's like a blink of an eye. To me it was the best time of my life.<br><br>I'm disheartened, and I feel like giving up, and let myself drown in the well of sorrows. My three friends tell me to fight on. To let it go.<br><br>I'm trying, but somehow, I'm failing... Like a vulture circling a corpse, the sorrow refuses to leave. I constantly remind myself, I will find someone better.<br><br>But my heart seemed to have lost the ability to love again. Photography is the only thing which makes me feel alive again, but even then, my camera cannot satisfy me. I feel like a zombie - detached from the crowd around me.<br><br>Even when I'm with my friends of four years, I cannot feel myself. I have problems blending in again. Then again, I never blended in. To them, I was the arrogant kid who knew everything, except humility. I didn't bother to try changing that opinion. I just choose to exhibit what I know. Though, I feel better, instead, with my new friends. The friends I've only known for.. six months (and three months). They're from SGF, and they know who they are.<br><br>I don't know. I feel disheartened. I don't have the flame to fight any more. I feel like just blending myself into the society - quiet, mindless zombies. </div></blockquote>Take photos.... Take different types of photos... Different types of themes...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Feelings change, people change. It is only too natural.<br><br>When a relationship ends, we are stricken grief, bcos we are being forced to deal  with space in an untimely fashion. We are reeling from our own misunderstanding. That person didn't exist the way we thought. All that remains is memories and emotions. Perhaps we mistook him or her for part of ourselves or our own identity. He/she is gone but he was never there the way we imagined. The reality is just blatant now. When later we say, "i'm over that; i've let go of the concept of that person and how things would be between us. "Wisdom teaches is to see the space between the lines. Things aren't as solid as they appear. It was the concept that cause us the headache.</div>
