            <div class='col-md body'>I don't totally give up on everyone before even knowing them. I only have a handful of friends who i really do spend time with. But we're all from different parts of the society, so they are all free at different periods and different days. I too have been frequenting the movies and other places alone. I like being alone too, but not all the times. Sometimes i would just like to have a friend who has the same aspects as my handful of friends, yet having the same free times as me. People who just enjoy an honest relationship not expecting out of you except friendship still exist but i just don't see it in alot of people. What i see is they rather choose friends through popularity, money, beauty, and other uses in their profession or what they're good at.</div>

              <p>Interesting topic. I've got 2 acquaintances. Highly sucessful people which gave me their candid opinion. One told me "there are no such things as true friends"</p>
              <p># 2 "It took me 30 years to realise there are no real friends. My best friend betrayed me for money."</p>
              <p># 3 "Eveyone needs someone for a reason." This came after I told him straight in the face, why do you call me only when you have a need or question only I can fulfill? Is that what you regard friend as, some utility item?</p>
              <p>I guess TS is right in some ways. It's ashame. Maybe it applies to people too influenced by money (many sgp people are). Maybe it's a city thing, maybe it's a Singapore thing? Fortunately for me I do have a few friends. Whom still contact regularly because we are of the same frequency and enjoy the company and have lots of fun. But all of them are in their late 40's.</p>
              <p>That brings us back to some earlier post in this thread. Maybe it's people from the Kampong days. The newer generation of people seem to think there are more things in life than friends. How I hate modernisation. you get more but actually less...</p>

              <p>When one is in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">need</span> of the other one is not <span style="text-decoration: underline;">able to be alone </span>and enjoy the immeasureable, immense riches aloneness(solitude) allows. One's centre is the place where only one can go, where one can feel fulfilment. One is so happy in being alone (solitude) that one would like to share and happiness witin one becomes a perfume, a fragrance of what one is.One's Being (Inner scape, inner "self") flowers and releases to all and sundry.</p>
              <p>The quality of life is the quality of our relationships (at work, in school ....) n it is associated to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the extent one is able to relate to oneself First. </span></p>
              <p>Solitude (aloneness) is benediction - one has a friend <span style="text-decoration: underline;">within</span>, one has love within ... add on. Loneliness is a anathema.</p>
              <p>Though I have used the universal experience of love as an eg. the above is expansive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Being = one has a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">porous</span> ego or is being porous</p>
