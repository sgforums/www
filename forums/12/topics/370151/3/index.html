              <p>What?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Another paradigm I want to establish is a difference between two kinds of<br>civilizations, which means a difference between two kinds of governments in them.<br>Asiatic Civilizations, which I call Class B Civilizations, generally do not attempt to<br>deal with individuals or with the problems of individuals; they leave interpersonal<br>relationships to the local or kinship community.</p>
              <p>Class A Civilizations including Classical Civilization, our own Western Civilization, or the first Chinese or Sinic Civilization, whose dates are 1800 B.C. to 400 A.D. In class A Civilizations, although the civilization begins as an area of common culture made up of communities, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>there is a long term trend to destroy and break down those communities.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>The way I would like to express this would be -- and I used to draw it on the<br>blackboard -- by saying that all civilizations start out as aggregations of<br>communities.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Those communities are generally of two types</strong></span></span>, either local, such as<br>parishes, neighborhoods, villages, or manors; or kinships, families, clans, and so<br>forth. When a civilization begins with such communities, as ours did in 550, there is<br>no state, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>and there are no atomized individuals.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>I will not go into the details of this, but in such communities, there are no written laws; all law is customary.</p>
              <p>Most controls on behavior are what I call internalized, that is, they are built<br>into your hormones and your neurological responses. You do what is necessary to<br>remain a member of the community, because if you were not a member of a<br>community, you would be nothing. You would not be a man.</p>
              <p>As you may know if you ever studied linguistics, the names which many primitive and not-so-primitive peoples have for themselves is the word for man. The communities from which Classical Civilization came were clans, kinship groups; the communities from which Western Civilization came were local villages and manors. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Lucky civilizations, such as Chinese Civilizations over the past 1500 years, generally have communities which are both kinship and local.</strong></span></span></p>
              <div id="post-body-9273355" class="body">What happens in the course of a class A civilization, over a thousand or more years, is that the fundamental communities are broken up and gradually disintegrate into smaller and smaller groups, and may end up simply as what we call nuclear families, a father and a mother, who eventually lose all discipline and control of their children. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The result of this process is a state which is not only sovereign but totalitarian, and it is filled with isolated individuals.</strong></span></span></div>
              <div class="body"><br></div>
              <p>Of the four civilizations which came out of Classical Antiquity's wreckage, two,<br>Islamic and Byzantine, clearly are Class B Civilizations, that is, they continued to<br>work for communities. Their governments were governments of limited powers, of<br>which the most important were raising money and recruiting soldiers.</p>
              <p>The finest example of such an Asiatic Despotism was the Mongolian Empire of Genghis Khan about A.D. 1250, but its origins go back to the Persian Empires of the Achaemenids and the Sassanids. Good examples of such a structure are the Chinese Civilizations of 220-1949, the Byzantine Empire after 640, and the Islamic sultanates which eventually culminated in the Ottoman Empire.</p>
              <p>The efforts of the Carolingian Franks to establish a similar empire in Western Civilization collapsed and led to the dark age of 860-970.</p>

              <p>Now I will put on the board something with which former students are
              familiar. I always call it the levels of culture, the aspects of a
              society: military, political, economic, social, emotional, religious,
              and intellectual. Those are your basic human needs.</p>
              <p>The interesting
              thing about them is that they are arranged in evolutionary sequence.
              Millions of years ago, even before men became human, they had a need
              for defence of the group, because it is perfectly obvious that men
              cannot live outside of groups.</p>
              <p>They can satisfy their needs only by
              cooperating within a group. But I'll go further than that, and return
              to it again in a moment: Men will not become men unless they grow up in
              communities. We will come back to that because it is the basis of my
              lecture tonight.</p>
              <p>If you have a group, it must be defended against outsiders; that's
              military. Before men came out of the trees they had that need. If your
              needs are to be satisfied within some kind of group, you must have ways
              of settling disputes and arguments, and reconciling individual problems
              within the group; that's political. You must have organizational
              patterns for satisfying material needs, food, clothing, shelter: that's
              economic.</p>
              <p>Then came two which have been largely been destroyed or frustrated
              in the last thousand years of Western Civilization. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Men have social
              needs.</strong></span></span> They have a need for other people; they have a need to love and
              be loved. They have a need to be noticed. Sirhan Sirhan killed Robert
              Kennedy because no one had ever noticed him and he was determined that,
              from now on, someone would know he existed. In fact, most of these
              "motiveless" assassinations are of this type.</p>
              <p>Someone went up to the
              top of the University of Texas tower and shot something like seventeen
              people before they caught him. That was because no one had ever noticed
              him. People need other people. That's the social need. The basis of
              social relationships is reciprocity: if you cooperate with others,
              others will cooperate with you.</p>
              <p>The next is emotional need. Men must have emotional experiences.
              This is obtained in two ways that I can see: moment to moment
              relationships with other people--moment to moment-- and moment to
              moment relationships with nature. Our society has so cluttered up our
              lives with artefacts-- TV sets or automobiles or whatever-- and
              organizational structures that moment to moment with nature are almost
              impossible.  Most people don't even know what the weather outside is
              like. Someone said recently that until September we had a great drought
              here in Washington, and four or five people standing there said,
              "That's ridiculous." We had a shortage of about eight inches of rain.
              Because they're in buildings, it doesn't matter to them whether it's
              raining or not.</p>
              <p>The next is the religious. It became fashionable in Western
              Civilization, particularly in the last hundred years, to be scornful of
              religion. But it is a fact that human beings have religious needs. They
              have a need for a feeling of certitude in their minds about things they
              cannot control and they do not fully understand, and with humility,
              they will admit they do not understand them. When you destroy people's
              religious expression, they will establish secularised religions like
              Marxism.</p>
              <p>Now, on the intellectual level: people have intellectual needs.  I
              used to tell students that Marilyn Monroe had profound intellectual
              needs. And when no one would treat her as an intellect or even as a
              potential intellect, for obvious reasons, she was starved for
              intellectual experience. That's why she married a man like Arthur
              Miller: she thought he was an intellectual.</p>
              <p>All right, those are human needs. Power is the ability to satisfy
              those needs. And someone who says that power is organised force, or
              that power is the outcome of an election, or that power is the ability
              to cut off our oil supply, has a completely  inadequate way of looking
              at it. My experience and study of the destruction of civilizations and
              the collapse of great empires has convinced me that empires and
              civilizations do not collapse because of deficiencies on the military
              or the political levels. The Roman army never met an army that was
              better than it was. But the Roman army could not be sustained when all
              these things had collapsed and no one cared. No one wanted to serve, no
              one wanted to pay taxes, no one cared.</p>
              <p>The other part of this will require you to put these things together
              to some extent. Persons, personalities if you wish, can be made only in
              communities. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A community is made up of intimate relationships among
              diverse types of individuals--a kinship group, a local group, a
              neighbourhood, a village, a large family. Without communities, no
              infant will be sufficiently socialized.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>He may grow up to be forty
              years old, he may have made an extremely good living, he may have
              engendered half a dozen children, but he is still an infant unless he
              has been properly socialized and that occurs in the first four or five
              years of life. In our society today, we have attempted to throw the
              whole burden of socializing out population upon the school system, to
              which the individual arrives only at the age of four or five. A few
              years ago they had big programs to take children to school for a few
              hours at age two and three and four, but that will not socialize them.</p>
              <p>The first two years are important. The way a child is treated in the
              first two days is of vital importance. He has to be loved, above all he
              has to be talked to. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>A state of individuals, such as we have now
              reached in Western Civilization, will not create persons, and the
              atomized individuals who make it up will be motivated by desires which
              do not necessarily reflect needs. Instead of needing other people they
              need a shot of heroin; instead of some kind of r</strong></span></span>eligious conviction,
              they have to be with the winning team...</p>
              <p>...In the final aspect of this process, controls on behaviour shift
              from the intermediate levels of human experience--social, emotional and
              religious--to the lower, military and political, or to the upper,
              ideological. They become the externalized controls of a mature society:
              weapons, bureaucracies, material rewards, or ideology. Customary
              conformity is replaced by conscious decision-making, and this usually
              implies a shift from your own conformity to someone else's decision.<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong> In
              its final stages, the civilization becomes a dualism of almost
              totalitarian imperial power and an amorphous mass culture of atomized
              individuals...</strong></span></span></p>

              <p>In my first lecture, I portrayed the sweep of a thousand years that we are concerned<br>with as beginning with a period in 976 when we had no state at all. All power was<br>private power. But we also had no individuals, that is, no isolated individuals. All we<br>had were individuals so deeply embedded in local self-sufficient<br>communities that the power relationships within which they functioned<br>were in their</p>
              <p>Day-to-day activities and the controls of their behavior were almost totally<br>internalized in their neurological and hormone systems. So they obeyed<br>what seemed to them to be their inner compulsions while they fulfilled their<br>functions in this interwoven community structure, which changed so slowly that<br>even in a long life of sixty or seventy years -- and, of course, most people in those<br>days did not live long lives -- almost no changes would be noticed by anyone in the<br>patterns embedded inside themselves.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>And at the end of the thousand year period, in the year 1976, we no<br>longer have communities, except shattered, broken, crippled, isolated<br>ones. Instead, we have states of monstrous power and frustrated, isolated<br>individuals; and the state and the individuals are working together from<br>opposite sides to destroy what we have left of communities -- local, family,<br>or whatever they might be.</strong></span></span></p>
              <p>Over this long period of a thousand years, the growth of the state, which is our<br>subject, began with the appearance of a state apparatus of a very primitive kind,<br>made up of a king and his assistants, who eventually became a monarch and a<br>bureaucracy. Around this core, there gradually accumulated sufficient activities to<br>make what we would regard as a public authority and, ultimately, a state. The mark<br>of what that process can be most clearly indicated, I think, by the development of<br>what we call sovereignty.</p>
              <p>Without sovereignty, I do not think we could say that a<br>state is much of a state, although we might call it one. There has been a great deal<br>of talk about sovereignty in books -- not very much, unfortunately, in history books<br>-- but no one has ever bothered to define it. From my study of the growth of the<br>state, I have been able, it seems to me, to put together what sovereignty consists<br>of, historically, in the tradition of our Western Civilization. To me, sovereignty<br>seems to have eight functions or aspects, and I will define them for you in<br>the approximate order in which they appeared.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>All human needs require that a person live and co-operate with other people for satisfaction. None of us can satisfy human needs by acting alone in a state of nature. The two fundamental needs men had from the beginning are, first, that a group within which a community is functioning and satisfying the needs of its members must be defended from outside attack. </strong></span></span></p>
              <p>So the first aspect of sovereignty is defense. Secondly, disputes and conflicts within the group must be settled, so that insiders cooperate rather than fight with one another and open themselves to enemy attack. Thus defense against outsiders is first; settling disputes among others is second...</p>
