            <div class='col-md body'>Domyoji, u 33 years old arrrrh???<br><br>In this materialistic world, a lot of things are judged by how much cash you have.  How good looking a person is.  To me, these are very superficial and shallow people.  I wouldn't want such people as friends.<br><br>You can work towards your goals but you've to balance it with your obligations to your parents.  You do not have to go to Africa to help people.  Start today, helping some old lady across the road, giving them a smile... it all adds up.  Or you could do part time at some charity organisation but continue working.  No one can say your unfilial nor can they say you do not fulfil your interest.<br><br>Right?
