Thus the continuous SMS.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>II) If behaving like last time would cause you some amount of hurt and tension, probably a little break/rest may be good. However, do take note that she wants to salvage this friendship thought a relationship may be impossible. By keeping distance, you are telling her indirectly that the friendship is permanently affected and things may not be the same anymore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>III) You can talk to her and come to some kind of conclusion - like remaining as very good friends like before and all that stuff. Probably this is the best solution to everything - provided if stress and tension is not very hurting to your soul.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Rejection is common part and parcel of life.
