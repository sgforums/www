            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, you still like Guy A. And it is very normal for you to feel that way. Simply because the fact that you felt jealous.<br><br>No, stay put in the situation for Guy B. Don't do anything as yet. I suspect he could be the nearest guy available for you to fall back on. Plus the fact that he is nice and all.<br><br>Chances are, you will regret your hasty choice. Just give Guy B and yourself a while more to see whether the "feeling" is there.

Usually trying will always be trying - guy B is someone that happened to be there. The girl accepted him because she wants to give a chance to him (of course he must have decent qualities that she could accept as well) Seriously speaking, is that liking - difficult to say. Usually, in this case, girl would have to spend more time within the relationship to see if he really like the guy.<br><br>She should have attempted a final attempt at Guy A before she settle for anyone else. <strong>At least she would know that she did what she could and still cannot be together - ok, fair enough. Move on</strong>. A half-hearted, ill planned switch will cause misery in the future because she will never know when will the hidden feelings for Guy A popped back again.<br><br>But since the girl has already went so far - drop the idea of Guy A. Feelings can remain, but choice has go on. Doesn't matter because you pursuit your own form of happiness and his as well. If you have love him, you should be feeling gald that he has found someone else - instead of being self absorbed.<br><br>Learn to lead your relationship well. Drop ideas that could shake your relationship. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
