            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Blueberry,<br><br>All I can say that, I understand how you feel and many others out there will understand how you feel...I am have almost an identical situation (with some extra complications) as you but with the roles reserved...Every day and very night the same agony...but I have learned to live with it...The feeling of wanting to be someone so much and yet you know that doing so would not result in the happiness he/she seeks...As someone once so aptly mentioned in this forum..."Loving someone it's not about possesing him/her but just to let him/her be happy in whichever way he/she sees fit". In other words, if you love him...just seeing him happy should be more than enough...I know it's not easy doing so..believe me..I have the same experience...you can look through the forum for my posts...Anyway, for my part...we are just the best of friends now...I am slowly trying to curb my feelings for her...it's slow and hard...but it will have to do for the time being...for you...I have no idea which is the 'right' way out...but do what you think it's best...you may yet still stand a chance...I don't know..nothing is certain...Just wanted you to know that you're not alone in such situations...anyway, best of luck girl...if you do wanna have a chat..look me up.. =)<br><br>Just my two cents...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Another sad story for all heart broken ones to dwell on. Another one that is played out and no luck with love. take care, the key is not to think too much. the more u dwell on it , the more it will "grow monsters" in your mind, infesting it till u come out with all sorts of possible bad and worse outcomes. Take heart my friend, the world is more than all this. Open your eyes, dun let this confide you into all those thoughts. Come see the world, there is definitely a better world out there for u.</div>

By the way, must pardon me, I cannot remember every single case by memory, especially when the forum cleared alot of the old posts, then when people update me - I am quite blur.<br><br>Still, it wouldn't hinder my thoughts of your post.<br><br>Ok the situation goes like this: As a friend, you would want to see him get back to his ex because he seemed so in love with her, but obviously this conflicts heavily with your liking for him. You didn't reach to that phrase where love doesn't have to possessive because most probably if you haven't declare your love for him or if you did, but in a subtle way or it didn't have the impact you thought it would be.<br><br>Then if you were to tell him to forget it - it seemed like you are 'scheming' because you liked him and influencing him to lose that difficult competitor. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br><strong>What you are doing is fueling him with false confidence</strong>. His feelings for her may remain and when he sees her photo, everything came back as if nothing had left in the beginning, but is it the same for her? Definitely not. One year change a thousand things - she has probably moved long ago, but not him. (If she has rejected his message, everything else, etc)<br><br>There are two options:<br><br>I) To wait for your turn. He haven't finished his business with her entirely. You may want to wait patiently for you turn, at your own risk. He may end up with his ex or worst - didn't have any feelings at all in the first place, making you waste the wait and feeling twice as pain as before. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>II) Say your piece and forget about it. He haven't finish his business but you don't have to bother. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You just want to let him know and when he is ready, he will let you know.</strong></span> When employing this option, totally cease asking who he is meeting, calling, etc (unless he told you himself), cease high expectation, cease past-future comparing, cease everything that you would do/feel/say/etc when you are with him with this liking undeclared. Be normal, be yourself.<br><br>Cheers</div>

The pain you're experiencing, is largely a partial creation by yourself.... By allowing yourself to experience that...?<br><br>Just a simple suggestion here... Whatever you feel for him is one thing. Whatever you're encouraging him to do (go after his ex.) is supposingly what a friend would advise another friend? But obviously you can't handle that position... So spare yourself that agony and stop contributing to things which you don't wish happening... If they're meant to be and he's interested enough, they would be.....<br><br>Ask yourself this question? Do you wanna be a friend or someone who's so interested in her? If you can't handle both positions at the same time, then DON'T....?</div>
