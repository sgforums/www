            <div class='col-md body'>Astrogal and V gal.. Would you rather that the phone calls are from his work place and they are discussing abt work.. Than when he is with you, he is talking to other girls.. Over minor stuff or what??<br><br>He is old enough to know where and when to set priorities right.. Of course.. Being over excessive on the phone is not a healthy sign.. Where you can actually talk to him abt it.. Like maybe asking him.. Is it possible to divert his calls to voicemail or maybe ask them to call back at a later time when he is not with u.. cause u find it uncomfortable.. etc..<br><br>Thats what i usually do when I am out with my gf.. I usually divert/reject calls which are unimportant or know that its from my clients.. I believe if the calls are so impt, they will always be able to call him or rather in this case, call me back..<br><br>Have a rather indirect, unoffensive talk with ur bf.. It will help in your r/s.. If you keep quiet abt it.. your the other half may think you are "perfectly fine" with whats going on..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Or gone mad of yourself for deleting the friendster?<br>Calm down. You're just harsh. Don't worry, people will do something unexpected when feeling lost. May re-register the friendster account.

It's all on yourself, as long you're happy with it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Don't give yourself stress.<br><br>Regards</div>
