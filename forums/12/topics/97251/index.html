Did he assure you that things are not as complicated as it seem to be? If he said that, why are you thinking and wanna be so paranoid?<br><br>You don seem to be able to trust yourself and your instincts with him.. Which is kinda difficult for both of you or rather for him to hold on to the r/s.. Why he feels sick to hearing your voice, I really dunno... But maybe is cause you keep calling or smsing him and ask him so many repeated questions till he gets so fed up... Give both of you some breathing space..
