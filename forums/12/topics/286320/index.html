            <div class='col-md body'>Hello, I am pretty frustrated &amp; sad to say, I kept 'taking' O levels for the past 3 years. What do I mean by 'taking'? It means that I was not motivated enough to study for my subs as I had cash flow problems trying to myself to school. Maybe I could study on my own..but I am just not motivated already since I left school 3 years ago. In short, I was only buying the O levels exams for some 'relief' (like at least there's something to look forward to) Reason being, I didn't have a goal at that time.<br><br>Ok so now, I have a goal. I want to work in a kitchen making pastries &amp; stuff. My F&amp;N has always been the best in my secondary school. (I am always the first or second in my class..exams or otherwise) The thing is that..Could I take two diploma on that subject itself in two different schools? That means the same cert but is in two different schools. Is there a degree in pastry making? Or is it unnecessary for to take two certs with the same skills? Would the employer just ignore the other cert cause it's the same or would he be impressed?<br><br>Also, is there a future in it? Will I have enough money to feed myself throughout? Or do you think I should just take my O's &amp; go through the normal education system? But even if I do, I'll just anyhow pass the subs. Besides I am already 20.  A waste of time?
