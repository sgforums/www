Because I already knew where to get those diploma. Besides shatec, there's also sunrice, bitc etc.<br><br>Hello, I think I'll skip ITE. Because my interest is baking &amp; stuff so shatec (already enquired them) is perhaps more suitable for me.<br><br>Btw, I have to explained that I skipped my O's even though I paid for them..=/ So yes, it's a waste of time &amp; money. [/b][/b]</blockquote>You don't need a degree to learn how to cook and bake. Most well known patisserie chefs don't even need a degree to do that. Does it matter whether you get a degree or not? Paper chase doesn't extend to the kitchen - you either know how to cook/bake better than anyone else,  or you don't. No amount of degrees will help you in that area. It is about doing an apprenticeship than taking some degree.  It is pretty much experience,skill and practical knowledge unlike a degree which imparts theorectical knowledge.<br><br>Frankly , no one is going to care if you are a good chef without a degree. As long as you can produce high quality dishes. No point having a degree if you can bake as normally as the people out there, because it won't save your career.<br><br>That is why some hawkers , who have the bare minimum education, can earn millions just cooking - why? Because they can produce very tasty food without a degree and their food cannot be rivalled by homecooking.<br><br>Unless you are talking about managing an F&amp;B organisation without so much as going into the kitchen.</div>

If there is potential to do well - go for it and do your best. Then when you earn enough - you can consider what is appropriate for you.</div>
