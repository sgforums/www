            <div class='col-md body'>bpghs got special stream meh?<br><br>Anyway the A Maths there is tough, I agree, because I was from there. Anyway, I would say you made quite a bad choice dropping there since you are already in sec 4. They just do not want people to affect their aggregate by so called "filtering" out. Anway, same thing happened to my friend then, the teacher V****** Lee (if you really from bpghs, should know who he is) forced her to drop because she got an F9 during sec 4 mid year, but she refused. End up A level A2 =/ .. ANyway just try your best ba.. ALl the best!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just hang in there, if the school standard is very high, chances are that you'll find the O level paper itself "no kick"<br><br>i was as bad as you in Amaths before, failed from start of sec3 to sec4 prelim, but somehow, the O level paper was very easy.<br><br>TYS really helps, you will eventually see how straightforward the questions are, since amaths problems aren't as flexible as emaths.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I used to score F9 for Add Maths. Worse part is my maths teacher rotates Add Maths/E Maths tests once every week. And he took other schools papers eg Raffles Institute, Cedar Girls (all those prestigious schools) for us to do. And i never score more than 33 before. So practically every week i'm failing... However, after some time my teacher know i am not the calibre, so he just ask me to just do 10-year series. I spent 1-month studying from 8pm-2am almost every night...After that I managed to score A2 for my Add Maths. And i didnt even bother about my tb (unless i'm searching for something).<br><br>so, if u think add maths really very difficult, just do 10-year series will do...</div>
