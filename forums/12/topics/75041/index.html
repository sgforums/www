            <div class='col-md body'>"settled oledi" is one way to describe it. coz most guys dunno how to add spice into the r/s after they got their "game". see, most guys're like hunters, once they got their "game", the fun and challenge end; they assume the game will probably not get away, so it's gonna be stable and they can take things easy (or easier). so some of them take things for granted that the "game" is theirs, safe in their hands, just need to do some follow-up every now and then, not painstaking meticulous care and concern anymore...<br><br>of coz this is the general case, and may not apply to ALL guys... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Relationship rise and fall periodically.<br><br>Your cycle has probably reached growth. The relationship is growing, but at a slower pace. It could be near the third stage, in maturity, but I don't think it is there NOW, but would be there very soon.<br><br><strong>You must understand a trade off between meeting often and talking on the phone</strong>. A couple must understand that conversation is like resources - the more you communicate for the day due to meeting, the less you will talk on the phone, for that day.<br><br>What you are trying to do is to prolong honeymoon period or stimulate richer growth - You may like to share this issue with your bf, express to him your desire to spend quality private, personal, 1v1 life with him on good regular occasions.<br><br>Don't be silly - he won't leave you LIKE THAT lar. Don't be paraniod. Govern your relationship well. This is nothing wrong - more communication is needed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Can be unhealthy for your relationship ya know? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Think it's probably the change in style of your relationship which you might not be getting used to?<br><br>Whether things would stabilise or not would depend ALOT on the mentality of the 2 individuals and also some external factors...<br><br>At the current stage of 'change', it'll be unwise to get too paranoid over things because as much as you might be adjusting to things, your bf might be doing the same... Give the 2 of you some time to adjust and the benefit of doubt?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
