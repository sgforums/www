              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is such a good moment of this feeling when u sign in your facebook and look at all your friends. Those good times u know, u guys hang out in primary school and now all grown up. And when u look at your friends pic in facebook, they have so much fun with their life with their new friends. I'm not saying my life is boring but i do feel like abit of envy when i look at most of my friends.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Especially the girls, when they have 1000 over friends in facebook and look how enjoyable they are. People like tammy tay the fashion designer, she's like the whole package. pretty, not arrogant and obviously she has lots of friends. I take a look at her blogspot, how lively she is. And She's in the same age as me. i dont know these type of feeling, feels like u did some wrong move in your past life that u dont meet these type of expectations. I'm now working but when i see my other friends, they having school and enjoy so much with their friends and life. It makes me feel quite a downer. I want to spice things up abit u know.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>While they having school, im here working. These type of trapped feeling makes me feel really useless. I know they say "suffer now, enjoy later" but looks like these kind of people (my friends) is having both at the same time. suffer and enjoy at the same time. Anyone care to share the same feeling im having too? how do u get out from this type of trapped feeling? I have friends but i dont know, it feels like i want something more out of this life of mine u know. Compare to my other friends, it makes mine really pathetic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Care to share how do u snap out of this? or care to share with me am i actually jealous or just plain envy? should i actually get more friends to spice up my life abit?</p>

              <p>I started a topic somehow similar as yours.</p>
              <p>I don't know about you ppl, but I feel it is quite hard to make friends when one has entered working world.</p>
              <p>You need consistent 'entertaining' to spice up the 'new-found friendship' if not, it is easily a 'hi-bye' 'friendship'.</p>
              <p>Off-Topic:</p>
              <p>I am not always on msn or 'chatting' in forums but I find ppl who are always online, be it on msn or in forum, they will have a higher chance of interacting with the same ppl.</p>
              <p>Then eventually start meeting up.</p>
              <p>But it doesn't stop there, you will still need to be 'available' online. This, somehow is very tiring to me who has other personal things to do.</p>
              <p>In the end, it is really up to you, to add in 'friends' and start interacting consistently.</p>
              <p>You don't need to regret anything. Jealously maybe, as at times, I also feel that tinge of jealousy but for me, I really won't want to waste time looking at how happy/busy the ppl are in their photos when I can spend valuable time going for hobbies/workouts and enjoy myself.</p>

              <p>You think FB is reflection of happiness leh? A lot of those people who post in FB r "showboaters". They like to post pictures and write rubbish on their FB so people can think how happy they are. Don't go for false advertising. These people are only masking the sadder part of their lives and selling only the good parts.</p>
              <p>You should not let your quality of life dictated by facebook. Besides FB got a lot of privacy issues. It seems that your personal data is being divulged and accessible to outsiders.</p>

              <p>Guess this kind of thing happen almost every time.  not just depending on yoruself, your friends too, and their priorities.  I do have FB, but with few friends and many people keep asking to be connected up with.    Chat room friends of yester-year invited me there just to connect up on FB and then disappeared even though still posting and updating about the family activities, but not really messaging to you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So when my classmate from UK found me there, after the initial meet up, and few months of continuous posting (some common topic of interest due to recession also disappeared into thin air due to work.  I hardly go FB nowadays even although I have few other friends there too.  Mostly just like making known their presence and then......</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Long time ago, there was the pen pal thing, same old thing do happen.  Many will ask to meet up and then except for a few most just disappeared.  More like looking for g/f b/f kind of thing... .some new and fresh seems to get the better of things and then move on to the next found person... repeating all over again... waste of time to me. </p>
