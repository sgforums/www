              <p>You want to avoid divorce, is it?</p>
              <p>To nullify the marriage you need to give proof.</p>
              <p>Like the other party is already married and still is.</p>
              <p>The other has no capacity to contract, ie retarded, under aged, forced..</p>
              <p>The woman is pregnant by someone else and the fool does not know it. (This not applicable to a two year marriage).</p>
              <p>The marriage was done under threat, duress.</p>
              <p>No sex is the famous reason. Premarital sex is not counted.</p>
              <p>There are two categories, void marriage and voidable marriages,</p>
              <p>Void marriage is that the marriage is not valid from the start. Mostly due to legal reasons. Polygamy, underaged.</p>
              <p>Voidable marriage is the marriage is ok, but due to arising factors should be quashed. Like the pregnant scenario, or no sex case.</p>
              <p>Just prove it.</p>

              <p>So you want divorce, not annulment.</p>
              <p>Annulment has its advantages in that  you don't have to contest, just prove on points of law that the marriage is not valid.</p>
              <p>Ok, for divorce you just have to say you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can't tolerate</span> your husband anymore for.... whatever reason, and the marriage has <span style="text-decoration: underline;">irretrievably broken down</span> as a result. The two catch word is can't tolerate and irretrievably broken down. Tell this convincingly to the judge, with the help of a lawyer.</p>
              <p>Then fight for the asset. How much you get depends how hard you fight. Back it up with receipts, bank statements, and emotions.</p>
              <p>Wait four years for him to be 35 years old, is laughable. I think he wan to pay you to keep the flat for himself. A 35 year old single is allowed to buy at most a three room flat on the resale market. And the transaction will take a while. So don't waste time.</p>
              <p>Remember if you can't tolerate any more and the there is no hope for reconcillation, then initiate the divorce straight away,don't wait.</p>
              <p>You'll  regret not doing, rather than going ahead.</p>
              <p>The lawyer is obliged to ask you to consider reconcillation. Think about it seriously. Of course it takes two to tango.</p>

              <p>Thanks for your encouragement, jojobeach........ I had agreed to his conditions cause he threatened that he will come up to my home to make a mess if I dun agree to him. We had already signed the separation papers and he wanted me to tell the lawyer that I dun wan any maintenancs fees or assets. I even agreed to that and had told the laywer........</p>
              <p>He even took back the dowry jewellery from me.........the angbao money that my relatives and parents gave us he tried to snatch from me too........He is so fierce and violent, I'm really very scared of him.......</p>

              <p>So you want divorce, not annulment.</p>
              <p>Annulment has its advantages in that  you don't have to contest, just prove on points of law that the marriage is not valid.</p>
              <p>Ok, for divorce you just have to say you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can't tolerate</span> your husband anymore for.... whatever reason, and the marriage has <span style="text-decoration: underline;">irretrievably broken down</span> as a result. The two catch word is can't tolerate and irretrievably broken down. Tell this convincingly to the judge, with the help of a lawyer.</p>
              <p>Then fight for the asset. How much you get depends how hard you fight. Back it up with receipts, bank statements, and emotions.</p>
              <p>Wait four years for him to be 35 years old, is laughable. I think he wan to pay you to keep the flat for himself. A 35 year old single is allowed to buy at most a three room flat on the resale market. And the transaction will take a while. So don't waste time.</p>
              <p>Remember if you can't tolerate any more and the there is no hope for reconcillation, then initiate the divorce straight away,don't wait.</p>
              <p>You'll  regret not doing, rather than going ahead.</p>
              <p>The lawyer is obliged to ask you to consider reconcillation. Think about it seriously. Of course it takes two to tango.</p>

              <p>Take pre-emptive measures before u embark on a divorce cos this spouse of yours operates on <strong>your fears</strong>!</p>
              <p>Eg, seek suggestions or advice from family service centre or make  police report before matters worsen.He does not have to know. As for the lawyer make him/her do the work.</p>

              <p>So he intimidates you by destroying objects. Did he hit you ?</p>
              <p>He's a bully, and a bully picks on a weaker party.. however, deep inside he's really a coward.</p>
              <p>If you show him you are not fearful of his ways.. he will have to stop.</p>
              <p>Bully feeds on fear. The more fear you show.. the more he will use it against you.</p>
              <p>He intimidates you with messing up your house, you intimidate him with telling his boss and co workers about his abusive behavior.</p>
              <p>Once he realise he has got something important to lose ( his career) , he'll leave you alone.</p>
              <p>3 years or 4 years to divorce is not an issue anymore as long as you leave him now. You drag any longer.. you'll only be the one suffering.</p>
              <p>Don't let him intimidate you on the conditions of the divorce settlement.... let the lawyer and family court decide.</p>
              <p>If he says anything.. tell him " Go talk to my lawyer". Minimise communication with him.</p>

              <p>This the perfect grounds for divorce.</p>
              <p>Get your lawyers to do the work, give instructions to petition for divorce immediately. You be the petitioner, your spouse the defendant. Yours is not going to be an amicable divorce, its going to be a fight. Don't bother about his consent.</p>
              <p>The lawyer should only advise you, you tell the lawyer what to do.</p>
