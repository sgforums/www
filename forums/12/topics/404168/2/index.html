              <p>LOL gal or aunty... ^^ file a case on him and ask for half of the flat and push hmi to madness!! if hes a jerk than make yourself become a bitch to him.. no offense !!</p>
              <p>haha.. maybe divorce with him is better if you have no kids ..dont flame me cause guys..think'' <span style="color: #333333;">In order to keep our flat for himself, he wants me to wait for 4 years till he turns 35 then only he can transfer the flat to himself.''</span> thats too over??</p>
              <p>i myself used to beat my gf if im angry but as time gets longer shes by my side and i learnt that shes there for me whenever i needed her although shes not pretty but i love her.. lols abit off topic :P </p>
              <p>Conclusion.. ask for half of the flat if you really cant stand it..and you have the reason to sell or rent the half of the flat.. and its YOURS not HES!!^^(1/2) ^^</p>

              <p>I will not ask for a half share of the flat as I did not pay a single cent for the flat. I am not able to work due to a heart problem so I couldn't help to pay for the flat.......So it's actually right that he should get back the flat for himself.....</p>

              <p>Girl, I can tell you have very low self esteem.</p>
              <p>Just because you are not as healthy or strong like other people, doesn't mean you should allow yourself to be short changed.</p>
              <p>The flat is a marital asset. It doesn't matter who pays for it.</p>
              <p>The fact is both of you lived in it as husband and wife.</p>
              <p>You have the right to part of it too.</p>
              <p>Think of it this way.. you need the money to survive after he throws you out onto the street. At least until you get back on your two feet again.</p>
              <p>Life may not always be fair to you..but you must be fair to yourself and learn to negotiate a fair deal.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you can try seeking Legal Aid Bureau's help.</p>

              <p>Wow, what you are asking me to do is very much different from
                  who I am. Assertive is the opposite of me, rejecting the cold
                  coffee might make me feel like demanding......wouldn't it?</p>

              <p>OK. So you don't want to be more assertive. And you don't want to stand up for yourself.</p>
              <p>I see. You just want to be rescued , yes ?</p>
              <p>You just want to rely on the "righteousness" of the people around you, to not take advantage of you.. yes ?</p>
              <p>Girl, let me ask you something... how are you going to teach your children to protect themselves and earn their place in this world when you are so... weak, naive and dependent on other people's handout ?</p>

              <p>TS is referring to 'annulment' - that means although married, there is no consumation (sexual relations) yet.</p>
              <p>Once a marriage has been consumated, annulment is no longer available under the law. Divorce will then be the only option after which both parties will not revert to 'singlehood' but be known as 'divorcees.</p>
              <p>However, annulment allows both parties to revert to single status as if the marriage had not taken place at all.</p>

              <p>If u r referring to rejectin that cold coffee, I feel that ppl are like us who come out to work for a living. Why make things difficult for them just for a cup of coffee?</p>
              <p>I prefer to think more for others than myself, that is why I am always compromising. Being assertive or not depends on the situation itself too....</p>
