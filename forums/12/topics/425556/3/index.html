              <p>As for solving the problem, the solution had been offered many times. Terminate UOB card, sign up another card, or change number or get your wife to do so with Starhub.</p>
              <p>If UOB can't help you, what do you expect from others? Impose our weight on UOB or MAS for such a rigid system? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>You can try to threaten Starhub to cancel the billing payment and take legal action against them. Eventually, your action determines your results.</p>
              <p>Of course, try and act like a big keyboard warrior online and curse SgForums for your woes will not gain you sympathy. It will only be another forgotten over time story which does not serve any purpose other than bring more hatred.</p>
              <p>Note: I already mentioned previously, Citibank does offer the assistance over a phone call to stop recurring charges previously for me, however, I cannot say the same for UOB.</p>

              <p>As for solving the problem, the solution had been offered many times. Terminate UOB card, sign up another card, or change number or get your wife to do so with Starhub.</p>
              <p>If UOB can't help you, what do you expect from others? Impose our weight on UOB or MAS for such a rigid system? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>You can try to threaten Starhub to cancel the billing payment and take legal action against them. Eventually, your action determines your results.</p>
              <p>Of course, try and act like a big keyboard warrior online and curse SgForums for your woes will not gain you sympathy. It will only be another forgotten over time story which does not serve any purpose other than bring more hatred.</p>
              <p>Note: I already mentioned previously, Citibank does offer the assistance over a phone call to stop recurring charges previously for me, however, I cannot say the same for UOB.</p>

              <p>i know, i saw the replies, and its one that i decide to take,</p>
              <p>i'm just debating more on rights but apparently, everybody seems to hate that idea...</p>
              <p>beside, rulings are processes that can be change, but for any change to occur, major dismay must first be achieve and noted. as such, people with similar problems can logde complaints on the involving companies, when enough queries are made, it triggers a change process in thier system and they will proceed to correct the problem. everything  has a start, and this is part of the process.</p>
              <p>but i guess i was wrong. its seem nearly everyone agrees with not having the right to contest charges on your own card...</p>

              <p>i've learnt that,</p>
              <p>1) I chose the wrong forum to debate about my problem</p>
              <p>2) because i'm divorced, i'm fk up and cannot solve my own problems. or vice versa,</p>
              <p>3) uob and starhub is always right, bcos they are big companies, they can do whatever they want, (at some point the in the future, someone is gonna get the same problem, maybe then people will take it seriously)</p>
              <p>4) because i cannot solve my own problem, people hates and criticise me. and openly do it.</p>
              <p>5) to keep my mouth shut / hands tight when i have a problem, bcos no body wants to properly study the problem and give proper advices.... (just read the forum from head to toe and see the advices that some of the people give) and then someone had the cheek to tell me about my half fk replies and stuff... -.-'</p>
              <p>6) to use less fks, because people are counting -.-'</p>
              <p>7) people will laugh at me because i'm stupid enough to take care of my ex wife's bill when we were married.... SO i am the bad husband all in all....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i've already taken the steps i needed to fix the problem, i guess debating this any furthur is pointless, because no body wants to see the real problem.... and instead i get all the replies that are openly attacking my personal life or how stupid or stubborn i am ?, great just what i need to start my new day...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>DO YOURSELF a favor and read your own post...... are you really helping or simply just attacking openly without remorse ?</p>

              <p>no i should thank you for your sarcasm, and enlighting me to the said points that i never knew about. and that you regarded me as a lowly human not worthy of any respect, nor rights due to the fact that i am divorced or vice versa, and for making me a laughing stock to everyone on the forum becuase of how you somehow refer everything that i do or did, as a repercussion of my divorce, as a form of stupidity, for whatever hidden reason that you might have.</p>
              <p>have you ever you looked at yourself in the mirror on the way you treat people around you? i can gather just as about about your impaired attitude, that you hated me since my first post, maybe because i'm a divorced guy, and you probably assume, my wife divorced me becuase i'm stupid,</p>
              <p>well i'm going to assume your a woman from that nick and i'm also going to assume your divorced too, bcos your husband dumped you,maybe from your post, perhaps you were at some point used for sex but not paid, so you take it out on me or others on the board ?</p>

              <p>well i called, uob 3 times, mainly all 3 times they say cannot cancel the only solution they offered like many of the replies here, is to cancel the card. i called starhub, twice, same thing, Uob did transfered 1 of my calls elsewhere but its still the same..</p>
              <p>the problem is i cannot cancel the payment because the starhub account does not belong to me..</p>
              <p>being pissed off, i email something similar to the first post on this thread, uob did not reply yet, starhub, said they would contact my ex and trash the problem out with her, i did however suggested in the reply email that, i am the main card holder and i should be given the proper rights, we'll see how starhub reply to that , bcos as most of the replies on this board suggested, the final resolution is for me to cancel the card and be done with it...</p>
              <p>i agree with some people that thats the best possible way to resolve the matter, but these people do not take into consideration that i'm in australia living off the same card, that cutting it off would limit my expenditure, lol a good thing, but i use to pay for food, trips and books, i can get it reinstated, but consider this</p>
              <p>my mom hasnt had the time to bank in money for me to spend via telegraphic transfer, and she is well not excatly illiterate, for somone her age and statue she doing pretty well, but she did not finish secondary school, going thru an supplmentary card application all over again, is gonna be troublesome, atleast for her, not impossible, but very tedious, so it probably take a month atleast.. if thats the case, what am i supposed to eat ?</p>
              <p>my mom was also under the impression that i have funds here, but since the divorce case, and the agreed payment i had to pay my ex, it took most of my funds away, i only have enough for 2 weeks of supply at the moment..</p>
              <p>i still have yet to find a job, if i had a job all this would be different, finding a job may not be too difficult but given im not a resident and my visa only allows 20 hours, not a heck lot of companies want to hire me...</p>
              <p>hence that is why i am so reluctant to cancel my card...</p>

              <p>well, TS....i assume you're new to sgforums. There are some people you learn to ignore....one of them is angel7030. She's one deluded troll. Of course, there are a lot of armchair commandos lurking too.</p>

              <p>well i called, uob 3 times, mainly all 3 times they say cannot
                  cancel the only solution they offered like many of the replies
                  here, is to cancel the card. i called starhub, twice, same thing,
                  Uob did transfered 1 of my calls elsewhere but its still the
                  same..</p>
              <p>the problem is i cannot cancel the payment because the starhub
                  account does not belong to me..</p>
              <p>being pissed off, i email something similar to the first post on
                  this thread, uob did not reply yet, starhub, said they would
                  contact my ex and trash the problem out with her, i did however
                  suggested in the reply email that, i am the main card holder and i
                  should be given the proper rights, we'll see how starhub reply to
                  that , bcos as most of the replies on this board suggested, the
                  final resolution is for me to cancel the card and be done with
                  it...</p>
              <p>i agree with some people that thats the best possible way to
                  resolve the matter, but these people do not take into consideration
                  that i'm in australia living off the same card, that cutting it off
                  would limit my expenditure, lol a good thing, but i use to pay
                  for food, trips and books, i can get it reinstated, but
                  consider this</p>

              <p>When you are in a funk, you feel the whole world closing in on you.</p>
              <p>No one else is gonna show sympathy if you keep it all within yourself. When exposed to light, the ego will destroy whatever dignity you sought to keep.</p>
              <p>We all live and learn.. your situation is indeed dire. But since your survival is so dependent on this sole credit card, it is best to let matter rest until you are back to settle in person.</p>
              <p>A monthly charge may be insignificant to others, but a person in your situation will find it a huge annoyance or a  ... distraction... hence this hissy fit you throw.</p>
              <p>Distance do make a small daily fix almost impossible... I know.. I've been there...</p>
              <p>Relax and finish what you set out to accomplish in a foreign land. This little mis-adventure should not detract you from your final goal.</p>
              <p>If you let this little set back your ex pits against you be the reason for your failure... then it is only to her delight.</p>
              <p>Let it go brother.. this is nothing.. compared to what you can accomplish much later....</p>
