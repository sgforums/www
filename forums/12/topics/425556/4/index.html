              <p>this one in red is exactly WHY i'm so pissed off with uob</p>
              <p>I called uob card centre...</p>
              <p>i recorded the phone conversation</p>
              <p>i own the Supp card, it has a starhub recurring charge on it</p>
              <p>i ask the support to cancel and block the charge,</p>
              <p>they say , they cannot do it. the only option is the cancel
              the entire card to block it (eg a change of card number)..</p>
              <p>they gave another option, to call starhub, to ask them to
              cancel...</p>
              <p>i called starhub, they cannot cancel it, because , i am not the
              owner of the mobile line that is using my card...</p>

              <p>They already gave you the option, which is to cancel the card and then replace a card with a new number, without any charges charged to you. So just bloody cancel the entire card. Problem solved. <br><br>If you still prefer using the existing card, then its your problem. You jolly well pay the bank and incoming recurring bills.</p>

              <p>no i should thank you for your sarcasm, and enlighting me to the said points that i never knew about. and that you regarded me as a lowly human not worthy of any respect, nor rights due to the fact that i am divorced or vice versa, and for making me a laughing stock to everyone on the forum becuase of how you somehow refer everything that i do or did, as a repercussion of my divorce, as a form of stupidity, for whatever hidden reason that you might have.</p>
              <p>have you ever you looked at yourself in the mirror on the way you treat people around you? i can gather just as about about your impaired attitude, that you hated me since my first post, maybe because i'm a divorced guy, and you probably assume, my wife divorced me becuase i'm stupid,</p>
              <p>well i'm going to assume your a woman from that nick and i'm also going to assume your divorced too, bcos your husband dumped you,maybe from your post, perhaps you were at some point used for sex but not paid, so you take it out on me or others on the board ?</p>

              <p><br>I hv to make you look low, and matter of fact, you are low, cannot even cancel a starhub plan, you think low or not. And by making u look low, I hope you can head up and look high to prove that I am wrong.</p>
              <p>My guts feeling tell me, you are just cruising on, making fun and seeking attendtion in tis forum, and you can be a clone for all i know, even a kid like most of us can call off a phone or starhub plan, and you, a guy which had gone thru marriage, went oversea to work and sound professional, yet cannot cancel off a credit card? My goodness, no offend, I am so glad your ex left you and make use of you.</p>

              <p>Actually if you look at it from the bank's POV</p>
              <p>How do they know WHY you want to cancel the charges?</p>
              <p>Is it simply cos you not happy with Starhub and instead of causing big problem in Starhub, you insist you stop the payment via the bank?</p>
              <p>Most of us deal with many vendors (even with recurring  payments) in one single credit card bill. If all of us not happy with vendor (or other reasons),.Buy something already, bring home AIYO spoil - ask bank CANCEL payment. GE coming, find out recurring power bills increasing - not happy - ask bank CANCEL payment.</p>
              <p>suka suka ask the bank to step in and cancel payment - the bank will be VERY busy over something which is essentially none of THEIR business.</p>
              <p>Having said tt, I've noticed a hotel charged a deposit (which should be cancelled) on my CC bill and immediately told my bank that the vendor should have cancelled it. They checked for me and later told me the hotel cancelled the deposit and therefore the amount will be refunded. If your card had been stolen, and there is a police report -   your bank can probably step in and stop the charges.</p>
              <p>So, warn your ex lor, if she continues to use your card - just tell her you will report the card stolen.</p>
              <p>and I also dunno why you MUST use bank UOB - cannot use other banks? If you use other banks - you can simply apply for another credit card while you cancel the UOB one ma... not tt difficult right?</p>
