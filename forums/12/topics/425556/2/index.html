              <p>UOB receive a legitimate charge from StarHub.</p>
              <p>They have to honour it.</p>
              <p>At the time of application by your then wife, you allowed her to use your account to pay, and did pay happily. Why you agree is a private affair, none of UOB or StarHub business.Therefore all the transactions are legal. Your divorce is also a private affair, not for UOB or StarHum to take consideration.</p>
              <p>Therefore for the charges to stop, StarHum must stop sending the bills to UOB. For StarHub to stop sending the bills they must receive instructions from the account holder, which is the ex-wife.</p>
              <p>You agreed to a request by your then wife, which shows you have control over your account, now wait for your ex-wife to send in a request to stop charging, and they will notify you and ask for your consent. It is your account after all, is it not?</p>

              <p>1. Call UOB tell the to issue a new card meaning new number. why the hassle to cancel and reapply? 2. you just cant anyhow cancel the giro/recurring payment. put in this way you use the card for recurring payment get a service or goods from a company. You happily used it and call UOB to cancel the payment so in return you scam the company?</p>
              <p>3. Same goes to the Starhub issue, what is the purpose of sign, put name put ic when whoever can call in to cancel? Account user and payment tend to be different things.</p>
              <p>so point 1 is the best solution. screw the CS if they say cant.</p>
              <p>just tell them you dont feel comfortable as you suspected your CC info was being comprised. so many reasons for them to issue a new card with different number.  </p>

              <p>Huh.. cancel your card lor... why you so dumb. A one time inconvenience is better than you dragging out this drama wat.</p>
              <p>UOB is not the only bank can issue you credit card. Get another card lah.. wah lau. I have at least 2 cards sitting in my wallet, just in case some places don't take one of em.</p>
              <p>UOB cannot cancel the charge if it's not a fraud charge. In your case, it is legit. Legit means an authorised charge request by your ex-wifey.</p>
              <p>Seriously dude, stop acting like a dumb bitch, OK ? Good.</p>

              <p>what i am PISS OFF is, the bank gives me no right over my own card to cancel or block a single charge, but rather the option to cancel the card and go thru all the painful process of re-instating the card...</p>
              <p>WHY DOESNT ANY ONE GET IT ???</p>
              <p>i dun care if i have to pay the stupid bill</p>
              <p>I AM JUST CONCERN,,, WHY DOESN:T THE FCKING BANK GIVE ME THE AUTHORFITY TO CANCEL A CHARGE...</p>
              <p>AND WHY STARHUB.... NEEDS THE APPROVAL OF THE MOBILE SUBSCRIPTION USER TO CANCEL THE PAYMENT , AND DOES NOT ALLOW THE OWNER OF THE CARD TO CANCEL THE PAYMENT....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>imagine this scenario, for some reason i used YOUR CARD, to subscribe to a phone line at starhub... YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO CANCEL THE PAYMENT ON YOUR CARD, bcos uob doesnt let you, and starhub needs my signature, THE ONLY WAY U CAN DO IT, is to completely cancel your card, and worse of all as someone mentioned earliar in the post, YOU CANNOT CANCEL the card if you have pending debts on it... WHICH MAKES THE MATTER WORSE, (but that is not my case)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>again i repeat,</p>
              <p>MY CONCERN IS,</p>

              <p>but considering, you are the giro applicant, and owner of the card, why do U need the USER of your money to grant any authority to stop a payment that you are paying ? doesn;t the payer has the final legal right ?</p>
              <p>any furthur debt should then be laid on the user of the phone line...</p>

              <p>yes it is legit charge, u can make a giro payment, and u cancel it, in this case, starhub is making a giro payment request on the card...</p>
              <p>doesn;t the owner of the card (with forms or whatever is necessariy) be able to cancel the payment? WHY must the owner of the subscrition be the one to cancel ?&gt;</p>
              <p> why can;t the owner of the payment order / card have the legal right ?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>i just realise i included the ex-wife in the topic,, which probably created the confusion</p>
              <p>its basically a simple debate of UOB and starhub, not giving the payment giver the proper rights in handling any incidents</p>

              <p>Few things to note.</p>
              <p>Interbank GIRO System (IBG) - Takes payment order from the originator of payment request.</p>
              <p>In your case, Starhub is the originator. Once the GIRO application is successful, to cease the GIRO payment, Starhub has to submit a "termination". Thus, the reason why UOB is requesting you to contact Starhub.</p>
              <p>Reference - <a href="http://www.abs.org.sg/cms/images/giro/IBGProcedures.pdf">http://www.abs.org.sg/cms/images/giro/IBGProcedures.pdf</a></p>
              <p>Stopping GIRO requires the BO (Starhub) to stop sending the payment instructions, thus, Starhub's authorisation is required for UOB to stop the effective payment.</p>
              <p>In your case, since Starhub account is your ex-wife's account.</p>
              <p>You can:</p>
              <p>1. Take legal advice from a solicitor to request your wife to terminate the GIRO instructions in letter, thereafter sueing her in court when your wife refuse to do so.</p>
              <p>2. Terminate the credit card or request for a new card number.</p>
              <p>Seriously, you can scream all you want in the forums, but this is how GIRO works. The GIRO instruction cannot come from your bank.</p>
              <p>Sidenote: I had a similar issue before, however, Citibank does "honour" stoppages of payment for GIRO instructions. However, you cannot assume all banks will honour stoppages of payment.</p>

              <p>Read the T &amp; C again.</p>
              <p>You agree to pay all charges to your account, whether from principle card or supplementary card.</p>
              <p>The Giro payment is a legitimate charge.</p>
              <p>You have to pay it. Please pay it happily.</p>
              <p>To cancle the Giro order, kindly get your ex-wife to do it. How on Singapore (earth)can your cancel someone else Giro instructions.?</p>
              <p>Like this your supplementary card holder buys something, take the thing, and then you call the bank says it is your card and you want them to cancle the charge. And ask them why cannot since it is your card.</p>
              <p>Giro is the same, your ex recived the service, StarHub charge, since it is every month, the Giro application make the charge automatic, but it is still the same principle as buy an item and charge.</p>
              <p>The matter can be solved very simply, just ask the supplementary card holder to stop using the card, for shopping or Giro payments. Or just pay happily. If all cannot, cancel the card lor.</p>
              <p>The problem now is you.</p>

              <p>acx1688,</p>
              <p>the supp card is in my name ... not hers...</p>
              <p>I use my card to pay her recurring bill...</p>
              <p>if i was the main card and she is the supp card... she can cancel her card, i also can cancel her card bcos i am the main applicant...</p>
              <p>this was not the actual scenario, but i held a supp card and my mom was able to cancel my supp card, because of fees and i no longer need it...</p>
              <p>so the main applicant of the card has rights... which is logical...</p>
              <p>----</p>
              <p>i think most of you guys probably answered my question. the problem is the ruling... which is considerably illogical...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>simply put, i have no rights over my card and whoever use it to make recurring payment... eg: the moment i let someone use my card to pay recurring payments...</p>
              <p>i, under law, gave up my rights to the cards intended use... have no control over who is taking money from the card..</p>
              <p>i however, retain the right to cancel my card</p>
              <p>---</p>
              <p>now heres the part where it may not make sense...</p>
              <p>i cannot cancel a charge, but i can cancel the card</p>
              <p>so by some of your examples, i can still deny payment to a large company... and perhaps "scam" the company?</p>
              <p>eg:</p>
              <p>making a payment with my card and then cancel my card ( allowed)</p>
              <p>as opposed to</p>
              <p>making a payment with my card and then cannceling the charge... (bcos of STUPID rules, not allowed)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> ----------------</p>
              <p>anyway this case is similar to giro BUT it is not giro</p>
              <p>as for giro payment , i might be mistaken, but i recalled cancelling giro payment via the bank, for my insurance...</p>
              <p>i called the bank and ask the bank to cancel the recurring giro on my bank account.</p>
              <p>i DID not have to go to the insurance company,</p>
              <p>the bank gave me MY RIGHTFUL rights to cancel a charge on my account...</p>
              <p>--------------</p>
              <p>uob however, does NOT allow me to cancel a charge, NOT on my account, but rather, on my card..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> ---</p>
              <p>i understand SOPs whatever red tapes they have... most are logical and is there to protect the client and the provider....</p>
              <p>this particular one protects the tertiary user, not the main user... and if its anyway useful to the main user, its one that creates a problem on top of another problem... </p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>as said in another post, i dun see a difference with regards to redtapes and such...</p>
              <p>you can cancel your card, but you cannot cancel a "recurring charge"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>uob probably sees it as a one time charge, hence you cannot cancel it.</p>
              <p>on the starhub side, its probably a starhub "automated payment facilities" that turn this into multiple monthly charges that appears as a single charge each month</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in this case then, starhub does not give the owner of the card the right, but rather gives the owner of the account the right to use someone else card indefinitely. and provides no support to terminate the payment...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in fact, when i called starhub, its really amusing that, they can pick up and see the name of the account holder, is different from the name of the card holder, but they provide no 3rd party card holder cancellation forms, etc...</p>
              <p>they howevere, provide forms for account holder to cancel the charge</p>
              <p>thus  to the topic of rights, basically, the  NON-Paying-Party has more rights that the Paying-Party</p>

                      redtapes and such...</p>
              <p>you can cancel your card, but you cannot cancel a "recurring
                      charge"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>uob probably sees it as a one time charge, hence you cannot
                      cancel it.</p>
              <p>on the starhub side, its probably a starhub "automated payment
                      facilities" that turn this into multiple monthly charges that
                      appears as a single charge each month</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in this case then, starhub does not give the owner of the card
                      the right, but rather gives the owner of the account the right
                      to use someone else card indefinitely. and provides no support to
                      terminate the payment...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in fact, when i called starhub, its really amusing that, they
                      can pick up and see the name of the account holder, is different
                      from the name of the card holder, but they provide no 3rd
                      party card holder cancellation forms, etc...</p>
              <p>they howevere, provide forms for account holder to cancel the
                      charge</p>
              <p>thus  to the topic of rights, basically, the 
                      NON-Paying-Party has more rights that the Paying-Party</p>
              <p>doesnt anyone find that illogical ?</p>

              <p>You are right, they ( Starburb) should NEVER had allowed you to pay for your "then wife" account with your credit card.</p>
              <p>I mean seriously, you guys were still sleeping together back then, they made life easy for you ... but now that you and her are no longer married.. the pain they (Starburb and UOB) had to go through to clean up the mess...</p>
              <p>Your "then" wife, shoulda used her own card with HER name on it to pay for the account.</p>
              <p>Frankly, why didn't you use your card to start an account in YOUR name before ? It's still a working account, doesn't matter who uses it right ? I mean c'mon, you decided to complicate matters in the first place. Then now you bitching about how complicated they made your life now ??</p>
              <p>I'd suggest you call up the credit card cancelation department and tell them if they value you as a customer, they'd bend over backwards for you. Some of the credit cards actually do, FYI.</p>
              <p>Competition is a good thing. That's why I never stick to only one card. When I tell my credit card company to F off.. they actually do some nice shitz for me.</p>
              <p>But then again.. I am a customer they love to keep. I'm not sure what kinda credit card holder you are.. maybe they don't do nutz for you because you are a bad client...</p>
              <p>Another  alternative is to haul your ex-wife to court and make her back pay you.  She'd be running to Starburb as fast as her little kitty heeled feet can carry her.....</p>
