              <p>These two have recently got on my nerves...</p>
              <p>I own a card at UOB.</p>
              <p>My ex-wife Owns a plan at starhub.</p>
              <p>She used my card for recurring charge before we divorced.</p>
              <p>We divorced.</p>
              <p>She refused to cancel the recurring charge.</p>
              <p>UOB cannot cancel the charge. (unless i cancel the card)</p>
              <p>Starhub cannot cancel the charge, it requires her signature.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>effecticly.. UOB and Starhub and ex-wife has frauded me...</p>
              <p>cos i have no control over the payment cycle without causing great trouble of cancelling my card...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the problem is elevated, as I'm currently in australia and wont be home till a year later...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BEWARE OF UOB AND STARHUB... and if anyone could advice me on how to bring this case up to a fruad officer for consumer protection?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>***********</p>
              <p>EDIT: cause alot of people misunderstood ,my problem....</p>
              <p>the case is NOT about my ex scamming or frauding me</p>
              <p>the case is about NOT GIVEN THE PROPER RIGHTS to payment handling.</p>
              <p>STARHUB AND UOB doesnt give the owner of the card, the proper authority to cancel a payment.</p>
              <p>in it, a possible case of fraud, if any one else, has a scanario in this similar fashion which does not allow the PAYER to make the authorative cancellation of payment...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>*** imagine I used your card to make payment, WITH your prior knowledge, and than later change it to a recurring charge WITHOUT your knowledge</p>
              <p>(or in any similar fashion, altho this DID NOT happen in my case, but, assume u make the one time payment, u sign the bill, i went home later and ticked the "recurring future payments" box) ,</p>
              <p> after which <span style="color: #ff0000;">YOU HAVE NO RIGHTS</span> to cancel, i mean go ahead sue me, put me in jail for frauding you, but other than canceling you card, which gives you more problems, you have to continue to pay my usage....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>this is assuming that, YOU ARE NOT TAKING the following options</p>
              <p>- reporting loss or stolen card,</p>
              <p>- terminating card due to fraud...</p>

              <p>i am complaining, but the point i'm trying to make is,</p>
              <p>as a rightgul holder of the card or provider of payment. WE SHOULD be given full rights to cancel a single payment   and not have to go thru so much trouble.  the finance provider for any service should have the final rights in authority in regards to any payment.. not the user or beneficiary of the payment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in this case, uob or ME should have the full rights to withhold a payment .. it is our account... my account...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>what uob is telling me is, they have no rights to cancel the recurring payment. they are not the authority, starhub is !?? What kind of nonsense is this ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and starhub... has no right to cancel a payment because i am the payment giver BUT not the accout holder ??/ this is another load of bullshyt...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>companies like this acts on feedbacks and complaints. they are what they are today. bcos its client base or users does not bother to seek recourse, if this sort of case happens to you in the future. you will feel my sorrow..</p>
              <p>and pls dun be all proud and say it wont.. it might not to you but some one else out of the 5 mil people in singapore.. a thousand or so will fall into this trap or deceit...</p>

              <p>I really think nobody understands what the TS is trying to let you all understand.</p>
              <p>In summary, the TS simply is asking to cancel the particular charges from UOB, so that when STARHUB does not receive payments anymore, and the internet will cut off by STARHUB.  When wife ask STARHUB why no more internet, STARHUB can just tell wife, sorry no $$ no internet. Then wife kaopehkaobu is her own business, she can pay her own from then on.</p>
              <p>As simple as that lah, I oso dun understand why it is not allowed to be done.</p>
