If she's still schooling in JC or Poly, probably she can take more time to know and understand the 4 guys first b4 deciding which guy is more suitable for her.<br><br>IMHO, since she is currently not too sure abt wat she wants in a bf.. maybe it would be better for her to remain as friends wif them first... But if the guys dun want to remain as friends.. then I guess there's nothing much she can do leh...<br><br>[This message has been edited by autumn (edited 21 October 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sounds like the show 'Survivor' on TV. Hehe. I dun think it's a good idea to have all four as partners then eliminating them one by one. It's really unfair to the poor gentlemen lor. They may be sincerely wanting to court you, yet that is how you treat them. And also if, you agree to go steady with them with the intention of 'trying the relationship or test test water'...then if you find out you really dun love them, it'll be a bigger blow to them if you reject them. Please lah...pity those poor gentlemen...dun play with their feelings. And guys...so MCP...how would they feel if they found out they are 'sharing their gf with 3 other guys'?! That will be double blow!<br>We can never have the best of both worlds...in your friend's case, best of 'four' worlds.<br>Beauty is really skin-deep..so looks should not play too important a part in the choice of bf. A guy may be humourous and fun to be with...but these are the ones we should beware of lor..these are the guys who are always trying to get the attention of most gals and they are often 'love cheats'...just know how to sweet talk gals. I personally feel that sincerity and how much he loves you is the most important things to look for when choosing a bf. Your friend need to know which is the serious one and which is just play play with her. Need to know if they like her for who she is or for her looks only. Pretty gals tend to face alot of problems in relationships becos it's not easy to find one person who likes them for who they are cos most of their admirers are attracted to them becos of their looks.<br>She can try to examine or observe closely the character of each of the guys, see how they treat their friends and family, how they view their future, whether they are the down-to-earth kind or the cunning kind...all these are good reflections on the guy's character. Hope this is of use to your friend or to those out there with the same problem.<br>Good luck to your friend and hope she makes a wise choice. Love is like a gamble. But if we review and observe carefully before 'jumping into the love grave', the chances of losing in this love game will be greatly lowered. Good luck to all those out there who are still searching for the one!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by XinYi:</div><div class="quote_body"> Hi Mike<br><br>Sorrie to say I am not as pretty as my fren nor having 4 guys falling for me.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear XinYi,<br><br>Its interesting to know that so many guys are wooing your friend at the same time. What you pointed out about her not knowing what you wants in a boyfriend and about her liking the 4 different guys because of different things like "humour" and such does bring her heart to light.<br><br>What you need to advise her is that so far, from what she's told you about the 4 guys, she has only highlighted their PERSONALITY. This is a major problem. Many teens today look out for PERSONALITY in their ideal partner. However for a lasting relationship, it is not PERSONALITY but CHARACTER that counts. Personality can change and if you fall in love with the personality of someone then you will fall out of love as soon as this personality trait decreases.<br><br>Let me give you an example:<br>Your friend likes Guy B because he is humourous. That's good. But she likes his personality. So the moment she finds he becomes too serious OR when she finds that his chracter is of someone who is insensitive then she will jump the ship and find another captain. Ships-a-hoy!<br><br>Advise your friend to plan out carefully the CHRACTER of the person she is looking for. Also, because she is a soft person, she needs to carefully asses if the guys like her for that about her. Some guys will chase ANY girl who seems soft because they perfer those TYPE (personality again) of girls.<br><br>In closing, the character of your friend's boyfriend will in turn shape her chracter as well. Iron sharpens iron.<br><br>Hope this helps. Stay cool n funky!<br>Daniel</div>
