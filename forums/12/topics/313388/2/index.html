              <p>you can detox to rid off the toxins present in your body. drink grapefruit juice, every morning which aids in losing weight. wholegrain bread, yogurt and whatnots are better substitutes to white bread.  try going for a walk around the park instead of sitting bofore your pc and talking to your online friends. climb the stairs no matter which storey you live on.</p>

              <p>To lose weight is easy.</p>
              <p>Exercise (long distance jogging, etc) and eat moderate. Must be consistent and patient. Don't expect to see result immediately. May take 3 - 4 mth or longer to see some result.</p>
              <p>There's no way you will be fat if the output is more than input, no matter how low your metabolism rate. These are just excuses!</p>

              <p>1) There are no miracle pills in the world, they just simply deprive your body of water. The pics you see are photoshopped</p>
              <p>2) Don't show self-sympathy</p>
              <p>3) Have strong determination and perservance, something you obviously did not have</p>
              <p>4) I have slow metabolism as well but I can lose weight and maintain. Because I know how to control. It's not useful if you eat only 1 1/2 meals today but probably eaten 10 packs of chocolate then have a buffet meal the next day</p>

              <p>hey im same age as u and i am severely overweight during my sec sch days. sec 1 when the P.E. teacher took my weight, he shook his head as i am 88 kilos at a 170 height. i still remember the look on his face till now. however, during the end of sec 1, i picked up basketball and became really active with a group of friends altho i did not join the sch team. we played like 3 times everyday and i would clock up half a day during the wkends.</p>
              <p>i cant seem to diet as i love food. i eat the usual stuff that my parents cook with one full plate of rice. if ive not picked up basketball i would have exceeded 100kilos by sec 2. i have low metabolic rate too as it is evident that i put on weight really easily, however, i felt my body getting more active and i dont feel tired easily after i began excercising.</p>
              <p>now when sec 2 start, my sch TAF club made me jog 1.5 km everymorning, and some part of the route goes uphill somemore. thats really hard for me to take and i feel my whole body aching up. however, after a few months, i can do that distance without even gasping for breath, and it makes me feel damn good whenever i broke out the sweat. im not tired during lessons too!</p>
              <p>i started slimming down significantly, not to the 'skinny' state but to the 'fit' state. at the end of sec 3, i weigh a mere 74 kg. and i did not even try to diet! im quite sure ur low metabolic rate is due to your dieting, id say eat a hearty mael but then excercise regularly.</p>
              <p>now when im in poly, it got harder for me as ive picked up smoking and then ive quit the 1.5 km every morning. -_- from the first year of poly till now that i started working, i only play basketball once every weekend for 3-4 hours, id usually go clubbing during the other weekend (dancing is great cardio too) well sadly, ive my weight now borders between 79-80 but ive built up my muscles and hv a nice body frame. (i wear 'm' size for clothes frm topman, have to wear 's' from timberland of fat face).</p>
              <p>so my point is, excersice really does wonders. dont think of excersizing as a way to lose weight, rather, pick up a cardio intensive sport that you like and then clock in serious hours every week working out. make it a habit! and i tell you that your metabolic rate is definately gona improve and you will become more active when you start excersicing regularly, matter fact, i havent even try the other methods of losing weight (wanted to, but never bothered to find out more) like acupuncture and pills.</p>
              <p>oh and one more thing, im also very anti-social when i was fat. but now id like to blive tht im a confident young man, i can chat with the opposite sex rather easily and im comfortable on the dance floor with the girls. so hopefully i can be a motivation to you. i realise tht the 'bigger' girls who've lost weight are definately more sexy then those skinny and scrawly girls <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/embarrassed.png" alt="embarrassed.png"> so get out of you house now and make use of the good weather today babe! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>Yoz TS,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can't say I totally understand how you feel coz I am not you but then again, I am also overweight. I mean erm, overweight for me is an understatement. I am seriously obese.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I agree with some of pur fellow netizens' comments on working harder. Many a time, we tend to blame our problems on this and that but then at the end of the day, did we ask ourselves on whether have we worked hard enough to achieve the desired results?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am currently over 230 lbs and I started slimming down after so many years as an obese kid. In the past, I was a angry kid with low self esteem now, I am a confident adult despite my size.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Having said that, confidence is not everything but then again, confidence is a very important factor of one person life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Having the confidence to face the issue at hand, having the confidence to work towards your goal, having the confidence to eradicate the obstacles that arises in the midst of your working plan.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the end of the day, what I want to say is start by taking pride in your strengths and then focus on strengthening your weaknesses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Start on your working plan to become fitter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am too on the path to become fitter, stronger.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let us work harder together. We will do our best to become the best that we can ever be.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cheers</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After i read thru all of the post, there is one point i feel is v impt.......... You should ask your sister or at least one pax to accompany to go exercise with you. Seek for her encouragement. No need for diet. U can eat whatever you like......... Just need to swear more.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My elder sis and I were like you when we were at your age....... She was 70kg (162cm) and I was 65kg (158cm).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My elder sis is the one who feel v sad when people called ber "bear"........ I am ok as I mix around often in school and have my group.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>We started slow jogging only as my sis can't swim, twice a week, 30mins. then do exercise like sit up (3x15), slowly thrice a week (mon wed fri - jog n sit up, tue thur - stroll 30mins) in the evening before dinner. Sat n Sun off,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You will see effect after 3mths, that you are more energetic, dun feel tired so often..... Healthy!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Try not to use lift, walk up the stairs.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Till now, although we seldom follow the above schedule due to workload, her weight is still at around +/-64kg and i am +/-61kg........No rebound. Dun trust those pills, only lose water from your body, not fats!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Also some guys like girls that are bao bao........ so dun worry la.... Good luck <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Good! you want to meet somebody's expectations of how you should look like. Please get people to write down what they would like you to be. This would make their expectations definite. Otherwise you would be besetted with a great amount of uncertainities.</p>
              <p>Ask them how slim you should be before they would like you.</p>
              <p>Or you can tell them to go to hell.</p>
              <p>Just be yourself. Just be what your nick says, a bubbbly girl. Your age, your lifestyle, your body metabolism, your image of yourself, all together plays a part in what you are. You want to change all that, it is not easy. You can starve and slim down, but you would be sickly, and grouchy (this cannot, that cannot) and still be without friends. A few good friends who accept you as you are is all that you need.</p>
              <p>Its better to <a href="http://health.yahoo.com/fitness-overview?pd=rockertraining&amp;ctype=blog">keep fit</a> than be thin.</p>

              <p>hey girl at least you are brave and confident. some fat girls cant get attention and they turn towards joining gangs, thinking that they can gain more attention, people in the school will be afraid of them bla bla.</p>
              <p>but you, you didnt.</p>
              <p>anyway i can see the problem you have, you need to have a more active lifestyle, involving more sports. telling yourself to go jog or swim every other day wont do, cos no one will be so motivated. besides, youre obssessed with your online games.</p>
              <p>how about joining a cca which invloves running  and some exercises, it will help, cos cca's regular. but no point joining those too tough one, cos you will end up giving up</p>
