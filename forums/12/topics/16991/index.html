If he choose not to, maybe its not a bad things after all....... just let whatever will come comes it's way.

I understd completely hw he felt and trust me, he will continue to probe and pester till u find him very irritatg.  the only thing to let him die heart is not to tell him u dun like him, but to avoid him for the time being. If he is as sensible as me, he will eventually figured it out himself, but if u keep rejectg him, he will b even more persistent.<br>Although I was once in this situation, I had matured frm that state cos I knw I will make my frd very frustrated and may even lose her as a frd, so dun look at me as if I was him, kekeke..<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>

I'll PERSONALLY ADVISE that you AVOID him.... (Not to mention the FACT that you're NOT interested in him in the 1st place...?)<br><br>------------------<br>In LIGHT I shall FEAR NOT.
