            <div class='col-md body'>okay im lazy to type so i copy-paste from my blog first.<br><br>speaking of my future plans. im accepted into ntu (acc) and nus (biz wif acc spec) but smu appln is still pending. i think most prob they have rejected me coz i wasnt very convincing during the interview when i was questioned on why i chose accountancy. frankly, im more inclined towards choosing smu becoz firstly i dont really wanna live away from family. it will be so for ntu/nus as i'll be living in hostels. secondly, i'd prefer a more spontaneous learning setting i.e. no more lectures please. but now, im thrown with yet another choice. my parents asked me to research on the cost of overseas education. as usual, i retorted and questioned if they have enough money. they told me that if they dont have enough money, i just have to study full time and work part time. they said i should venture abroad when im young and that so many youngsters have done it, there's no reason why i cant. for once, i thought my dreams of an overseas education was dashed once i received my lack lustre results from mr.chan. but now, it has re-surfaced as a viable option. as always, i'll really look forward to the exposure and experience of living and working alone, especially in another country (kinda contradicting ehs). moreover, i believe the three or four years of my life elsewhere will definitely be worth my time and effort there.<br><br>yeps, as above. im so stucked and mired, perplexed as where to go. anyone studying overseas currently care to shed some light. i'll most prob study something more general like business instead of specialising in accountancy if i get to overseas. which country should i go for? based on my preferences, should i avoid the usual stodgy british teaching methodology and go towards america instead?<br><br>advice needed badly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>depending on what you want, you can do undergrad in singapore and post grad overseas.<br>but if you wanna stop at undergrad, then try to go overseas for it. great experience and exposure. so long your parents can support you fully for at least your first year...because its not a good idea to start working on your first year as you have to adapt to uni life...<br><br></div>
