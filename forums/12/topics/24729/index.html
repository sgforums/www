            <div class='col-md body'>Hi!<br><br>I'm pretty hopeless when it comes to deciphering body language and signals so hope somebody (some phychologists perhaps?) can help figure out what a girl thinks.<br><br>A couple of years ago there was this girl I met and lost contact. But I managed to locate her on ICQ and chatted and eventually exchanged telephone numbers. We chatted over the phone on several occasions and she asked me if I'm interested in meeting up at a McDonald's near our house (she just lives about a 5 minutes walk from my house). I couldn't attend as I've to book in during NS and I have to turn her down. Also, once she asked me if I miss her and since I already know she just had a boyfren of 2 months, I just told her no. I guess she must have been pretty offended. Just dunno if she's really sending me signals that she's more or less interested in me or just playing along.<br><br>Once during poly working on a group project, there was this girl (this time another one) in the team (she was an excellent and hardworking student and was the team leader) and there was this discussion. I sat beside her. She keeps fidgeting her hair and pushing and draping them onto her ear when the hair isn't even dropping. So her right hand was busy holding a pen and explaining her project plan while her left hand was busy with her hair, throughout the discussion lasting 10 to 15 minutes. Her pace of speaking was somewhat faster than usual. I thought that was pretty weird I mean she seems to be quite fearful of any form of eye contact. What was she thinking and nervous about??? Imagine someone giving a presentation or demo of some sort, all the while her eyes are glued firmly to the plans/speech w/o looking up at all!<br><br>btw, for girls out there reading this post, would you express your interest in a guy? If so, how would you do it, subtlely thru some body language/signals or tell him explicitly "I like you" straight in the face?<br><br>Also, how to tell if a girl is already attached w/o maintaining a long-term casual friendship and observing her for weeks or months for any sign of boyfriend activity? The most paiseh thing is to make the first move (try to chat her up or even tell her that you're interested in her) and being told that she's already attached and getting rejected. Is there any techniques to detect if she's single and available? This is one area I've not been able to figure out and because of this, am unable to muster up enough guts to approach a female friend. If it gets screwed up, it's very "paiseh" for her to remain a casual fren in future and even a casual relationship may be off! So I dare not stake their casual relationship with me for a gamble.<br><br>Any advice greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually i think this post is rather common... i've seen it over like infinitum number of times over the years, ya?<br><br>okae, the best answer would be, i guess, body language. most girls have this physical space that they don't want to have intruded upon... it may or may not apply to every girl ya, it really depends<br><br>emotional space also applies.. watch how personal she is with u..<br><br>but hey, most importantly don zhi zuo duo qing... will be very painful n embarrasing... take things slowly, one step at a time<br><br>cheers!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Knowing someone likes you is not as easy as some of us think. Different people let others know theyÂ’re interested in different ways. You might notice someone spending a lot of time with the person they like, or perhaps they flirt with them without realising. Some people go the whole way and get their mates to tell their crush they like them, or if youÂ’re feeling very confident you might decide to ask someone out to their face.<br><br>The problem is, most people, girls and boys alike, can make it very difficult to tell when they are interested, so take a look at our hints and tips to tell if someone likes you and how to deal with it.<br><br>However macho it might seem at the time, lads just canÂ’t help showing off in front of girls, so look out for some considerably dopey antics.<br>If you hear you name mentioned among a group of lads at school, the chances are theyÂ’re teasing someone about liking you, so spot the red face in the crowd.<br>Any excuse is a good excuse to see the girl of his dreams for a lad in love, so next time he treks up three flights of stairs just to borrow a calculator youÂ’ll know why!<br>Whether youÂ’ve been mates for years or only just met, if he likes you the conversation will definitely not be smooth, so listen out for some major stuttering and spluttering.<br>ARGH! Green eyed monster alert! If he sees you with another bloke, heÂ’s gonna be jealous because as far as heÂ’s concerned youÂ’re his. HeÂ’ll either try to out do the other lad by flirting, or be moody for the rest of the day until he forgets and starts dreaming about you again!<br>However cool he manages to act, a lad with a major crush never seems to know what to do with his hands. He might stroke his chin, put his hands in his pockets, ruffle his hair or fiddle with his mobile, which are all signs that you make him seriously nervous because he likes you so much.<br>Ever caught him staring in your direction without seeming to realise the teacher is yelling at him to wake up?? ItÂ’s a sure sign that heÂ’s interested, why else would he stare at your gorgeous face?<br>As well as staring, if heÂ’s smooth enough to try and talk to you heÂ’ll probably make eye contact as much as possible in the hope you notice him paying you huge amounts of attention.<br><br>Girls just canÂ’t resist the temptation to touch a bloke they like as much as possible. She might mess your hair up if youÂ’re sitting down, touch your arm when talking to you, or even sway towards being really obvious and grab your hand or pinch your bum.<br><br>OK, so it probably makes us sound like right bimboÂ’s but at least you know weÂ’re definitely interested when we start giggling uncontrollably for no particular reason!<br>For shy girlies, blushing when a lad you like looks at you is a complete nightmare, but again itÂ’s one of the easiest ways to tell whether thereÂ’s something there or not.<br>When a girl smiles at you, what do you think? Is she just being friendly, or perhaps she wants you to really notice her? If a girl smiles back at you every time you grin in her direction, itÂ’s very easy to assume sheÂ’s just a friendly kinda lady, but look out for some action if she starts smiling dreamily every single time you see her.<br>When flirting, a girl can be subtle, or really in your face depending on her personality. If sheÂ’s being shy and doing a lot of the Â‘looking sidewaysÂ’ trick, the best way to find out what sheÂ’s thinking is to look her straight in the eye and make her blush. If the girl in question has taken the more outgoing approach play up to her by<br>teasing her and generally messing about, to see if she responds in the same touchy-feely kind of way.<br>If you donÂ’t understand when she says Â‘You would make such a great boyfriendÂ’ then you should give up right now! YouÂ’re gonna miss some really obvious hinting if you donÂ’t listen to her properly so tune in those ears!<br>Some girls tend to avoid direct eye contact if they can help it, because itÂ’s hard to hold the gaze of someone youÂ’re head over heels with if youÂ’re not sure they feel the same way. On the other hand, you might catch her staring at you from the other side of the room, but donÂ’t make a big thing out of it, just hope that sheÂ’s staring because she finds you amazing, rather than having a Â‘kick meÂ’ sign on your back.<br>As with lads, girls get fidgety if they like you, so look out if she starts playing with her hair or adjusting her clothes when youÂ’re talking to her.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>10 Signs He Fancies You<br><br>How can you tell if that lush lad wants you for his laydee? Well there's only one sure wayÂ… ask him, dummy! Not brave enough? OK, here are ten ways to tell.<br><br>He fancies you if he:<br><br>1. Gets really nervous.<br>Funny one this - of course he could be jittery all the time, but, unless you're a really scary chick, chances are he likes you and is worried about making an arse of himself. Ahh, bless.<br><br>2. Gives you the eye.<br>You catch him starring dewy-eyed at you when he thinks nobody's looking. He also looks right into your eyes when he's talking.<br><br>3. Gives you the third degree.<br>Questions, questions, always with the blippin' questions. "Where're yer going? Who with? When?" Try not to let this get on your proverbials too much, he just wants to get to know you better and probably to check out whether he's got any competition.<br><br>4. Gives your bessies the third degree.<br>Even better - if he asks your mates about you, you've practically got him in a bag!<br><br>5. Lends you his prized possessions.<br>Whoa, if a guy lends you his PS2, moby, fave CD, or secret teddy bear, then he's got it real bad.<br><br>6. Picks on you.<br>Another weird one - he's got quite low self-confidence, and doesn't think he's worthy of actually talking to you, so he tries to get your attention in other ways. Boys huh?<br><br>7. Shows off.<br>Desperate to impress, he makes a right pranny of himself with his ridiculous antics in the hope you'll come falling into his arms.<br><br>8. Calls you - like, all the time.<br>Oh come on girl, you didn't really think he was that stupid did you?<br><br>9. Calls you "by mistake".<br>Come on...he's not that daft!<br><br>10. Sticks up for you.<br>Get a grip, this is capital letters &amp; flashing lightsville. How much more obvious do you want him to make it? He fancies you!<br><br>10 Signs She Fancies You<br><br>Got your eye on a babe? Wondering if you're in there? Not quite got the bottle to find out? We can't guarantee you won't crash and burn. But before you go for it and ask her out - here are ten ways to tell she fancies you:<br><br>1. Orders you around.<br>Weirdly, this irritating and embarrassing behaviour shows she cares about you. How to handle it? Be flattered, say thanks for the advice, then go off and do whatever you were gonna anyway.<br><br>2. Asks your advice.<br>This means she trusts you, values your opinion and it is also a way of getting your attention.<br><br>3. Asks your star sign.<br>Chicks love astrology and she probably wants to check whether you're 'astrologically compatible.' It's a girl thing - just let her get on with it.<br><br>4. Eyes you up.<br>You notice her staring at you sometimes and she freaks you out by looking really deeply into your eyes when she's talking.<br><br>5. Gives your mates the third degree.<br>If she's quizzing your mates about you, you're well in.<br><br>6. Blushes.<br>She fancies you all right and is afraid it shows. It doesÂ…to everyone except you, you muppet!<br><br>7. Wears loadsa make-up.<br>Wearing more slap when you're around is the equivalent of putting an arrow above her head to attract your attention - come on man, these are getting really obvious.<br><br>8. Acts reeaally girly.<br>Strangely, girls often feel the need to act even more girl-like around guys they fancy - as if we hadn't noticed they were chicks or something!<br><br>9. Texts you, every five minutes.<br>You're on her mind all the time - if you haven't got the hint with this one you really need to get a grip.<br><br>10. Calls you "by mistake".<br>Jeez man, you didn't really think she was that stoopid did you?<br><br></div>

(Fact) I never notice her noticing me so much until There is one time i put on my cousin polo tee. Erhh quite fitting for my size wif pecs n nipples poping. Used to just goto the counter and get my arcade coins. Recently I notice she quite friendly to me. When i was toking to her friend she came up to me n cut in the conversation. When i saw her i look away at my IC r watch. Soft of shy when i see her. There was one time when my friend took my IC and i took someone's else, she jokingly told me not to run away must cum back. I'm nt sure hw to put it, but i notice we exchange glances alot more then usual even though i only see her on weekend when i'm free to play cs. M i being overly sensitive? Saw a tal ah beng tok to her for 1/2 hr standing there at the counter. Is she being jus friendly r does my physical appearance as anything to do with her attention?<br>Pls help.<br>BTW when i msg ppl does the person i msg noes i msg to her i this fourm? Seems like no one is responding?<blockquote><ul></ul></blockquote></div>

Just ask lar! No need suspense anymore. Skali wait a few months still dunno, then she get BF already lor. If u are shy type, just try ur best to ask 'casually'.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Just pop the question! There's nothing wrong asking.<br><br>All those signals are 'boh bao' one lar (not 100%)... So many girls out there are flirting wif guys to try to get attention. Maybe if u start chasing them, they will get their confidence boost. Very bo liao lar, but i can tell u there are lotsa gals like that now.<br><br>I kinda learnt it the hard way lor, they give lotsa signals, being so nice to u - all bullshit. Even if they tell u they miss u, like u or keep contacting u, or SMS oso bluff one lar. Talk talk only mah, no need to pay or doesnt hurt wat. Once u make the move, they will start retreating, then u hear all the BS reasons. Even now got one girl like to filrt so much wif me, talk dirty stuff, touch touch. She got BF already, but she tinks I dunno. I oso act blur lor, see how far she can go... hiek hiek.... I oso got some guy frds kana same type of girls, so I tink this has become the trend.<br><br>So there's no guarantee. U gotta 'feel' it urself, by looking at her response. Will she go all the way out to help u solve ur prob? But please NEVER zhi zhuo duo qing, think too much and mistaken friendshp for love. Maybe need some experience lar....</div>
