              <p>If you choose not to leave cos of the reasons cited above, the so-called relationship is headed for more trouble than you (n she included) might imagine.</p>
              <p>Frankly, she does not love you or has unwittingly misintrepreted needs/expectations/attachment to be ... and it is parading/ masquerading as love. It is understandable if you are ''fooling'' around or ''misbehaving'' which has her accusing or being suspicious. Of course, it is presumptious as only you and her are privy to what transpired or what is being communicated.</p>
              <p>However, it does not detract from what is true - intuitively, i would surmise that it is not love but needs and <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">insecurity</span></strong>. The commonality of  giving assurance and security to another is a myth and usually both in the ... eventually suffer.</p>
              <p>It is ok to leave cos it is stultifying you but being self-honest and most of all assuming responsibility for what you feel is essentially being wise and mature. She may be difficult, insecure but to apportion blame is unwise.</p>
              <p>I would suggest communication and stating your stance, your preferences and if they are sadly only words; words dont change and never changes anything. it is thru one's behaviour that changes or better still, transformation happens. We always teach another or others how to treat us thru our behaviour(s)!</p>

              Oh my, Possessive isn't a good word to begin with. I was once possessive.Which after I learn and grow from all my relationship. Boy Girl Relationship is some sort relevant like Parents - kids Relationship and it have the same theory with the " meat dumpling " 
              When Making a dumpling you have to make sure you put in the correct amount of rice and ingredients not too much not too little , else the outcome will be not nice.Or when you put the right amount of ingredient when the finishing part you got to use a string to tighten it. You cannot wrap too loose or too tight else the dumpling won't get cooked. Its the same when it comes to relationship.When mum controls kids too much the more he/she wanna be rebel.There goes the same for boy girl relationship.When the either party controls too much , the one that is suffering and wanted to get out of it because he/she feel breathless. This is not even called relationship anymore. For me , when it comes to relationship i make sure the person with me feels comfortable without any stress. That's what it should be and when it comes to social life must be mutual. He can go out with his friends , i can go out with my friends. Be it guy or girl , just let me know and I'm okay. So Manchesterdude1, either u continue to be with her to keep suffering or move on to find a better girl. If you don't feel comfortable with her just end it. Don't waste time anymore. She have totally no right to control you. I don't believe in controlling in relationship. She have to think in your shoes. If you control her , will she like it ? Its the same thing. So yup. All these are my 2 cents worth..

              <p>If there are constant wars and fights in a relationship, it is best to end it before you both are married. A relationship should be one that both parties find comfort and happiness in each other. Yours, I forsee will be one with loads of unrest .Do you both have a mutual friend who can maybe intervene and tell her to move on? She may cry and whine now but it is better that she accepts reality now and move on, than to whine and cry for the rest of her life with you.Never marry someone whom you cannot solve problems with right from the start. It will be hellish life journey for both of you by then.</p>
