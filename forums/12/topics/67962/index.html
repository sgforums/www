Just like when you grow up, you gradually grow out of playing with toys and it's ridiculous to expect you to do the things you used to do last time (or even LAN gaming for 13 hours in a day for example)<br><br>The issue here is that you AIN'T the problem and the key to what you want this friendship to turn out - its all about her. If she refuse to acknowledge that fact in her mind, even if you give her 10 years, she will still avoid. You can't expect her to confide everything, giggled when you both met, now because you have enter into another phrase of your friendship and now, the ball is in her court.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Do what you can.
