              <p>I need some advice on this issue, as i am not able to catch guy's mind.</p>
              <p>I knew this guy via online platform around August 2009 after my broke-up. Find it nice chatting with him, so gave him my msn add when he asked for it, we have been chatting on msn since then and later on exchanged hp number. Ever since then, we have been chatting on msn and sms, he's the one who initiates to sms or chat on msn most of the time.  We chat about anything from work to friends and him telling me when's his mother going for operation, what kind of operation etc. He even told me that he tried applying a new flat with his mom but did not manage to get it, if manage to get new flat then probably no need to apply for new flat when want to get married. (fyi he's the only child). <br><br>After communicating via sms n msn for about 1.5yrs, he smsed me asking if i am free on V.day. My reply was :" aint u working night shift?" He forgotten about that and asked again if I wud be his Valentine on 13 Feb. Before the actual meet-up, he asked if im interested to watch a comedy movie, i agreed since i've not watched that before and also asked about my preference for dinner. We stay quite far from each other, yet he drove and pick me up 
              from my house. I was kind of surprised that he made the advanced  reservations for dinner etc. We had an enjoyable time during that few hours, no problems in communication. He gave 
              me bear+a bouquet of lilies (my fav flower)+card before i alighted. That was kind of a surprise for me, as i couldn't remember that i ever told him that i liked lilies. He unfastened his seat belt wanting to send me up, but i told him i can go up myself as it's very late and no carpark lots so better not take e risk to leave the car like that. He told me to drop him a msg when im home and i did so. About 30-40mins later, he msged me that he has reached home too.</p>
              <p>We've been out several times and he always insisted
               on paying the bills when i wanted to go on dutch as i felt uneasy for him to pay all the time. I asked him out on his birthday for dinner and told him it's a birthday treat from me so do not fight with me over the bill.We went for movie after that, and he paid for that again. No matter if he's the one or i am the one who initiates the date, he always insists on fetching and sending me home and msg him once im home and he does the same. We sms everyday, and there's at least 1 sms from him asking
               "how's my day, etc" or a good night sms from him everyday without fail 
              even though he's busy at work. <br><br>Lately, we went IT fair and the place is really very crowded, he tends to place his hand on my back or waist guiding
               me to another place, whenever if he walks in front of me, he will stop and see if im behind him, or walk behind me with his hand placed on my waist gently. He remembers whatever i wanted to buy, whereby personally have forgotten 1 or 2 items. We went for dinner and decided to catch a movie since it's still early. I was already 
              wearing cardigan from morning and yet my palms are still cold in the cinema, i had no choice but to keep rubbing
               my hands or sit on both hands during the show. He asked if I'm still cold, then moved his hands over, found my hand and interlocked. He let go when my hands were not that 
              cold anymore and we never hold hands after that. Before i alight frm his car, he reminded me that i've to take tonics or see chinese physician as it's not healthy to have cold hands and feets everyday. <br><br>Is it normal that we do not chat on the phone at all? He's doing shift work, so it's kind of difficult to chat on the phone either.  Guess probably the only time we communicate over the phone was him calling me when he reached my plc. Sometimes he will ask for a good night kiss over sms, or ending smses with Muacks and calling me dear in his smses. These occurs more after we met up. Sometimes i wonder, does he do this to other girls as well.. Is he kind of interested in me or just flirting around? I am kind of a retard when it comes to relationship issues, that's why i've such qns.</p>

              <p>Very detailed post :)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am no love guru but reading through your post i think that guy is definitely interested in you due to the fact that he</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Initiates conversations mostly, no matter through what means.</p>
              <p>2) Shares his personal issues with you.</p>
              <p>2) Pays bills for you and fetch you home despite not requesting.</p>
              <p>3) Shows care and concern.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However it is still up to yourself to find out what exactly he is interested in. He might be interested in a long term relationship, but he may also be only interested in sex.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You need to find out what exactly he is interested in you for in other words.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for not communicating through phone calls, personally i think it is normal for your case since after all, he mostly initiates conversations with you and already going out together. </p>

              <p>useful?? Ok</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>First, in relationship, it is more or less a matter of gut feeling,  we are not in the picture to throughly see the body language that can tell a thousand stories, TS needs her personnal gut feeling over it. She need to ask herself, do I really got a feeling for this guy, or am I just stepping inot another love affair just because I want to forget about my recent sad and failed relationship.If she press no, then forget about it, just be friend, if yes, please proceed to second para...</p>
              <p>Secondly, this is a time of courtship,  and in courtship, verything is pink in color, so happy, so much promising, so much caring and love within  that most get carried away, I myself loves courtship, cos courtship is the best time to enjoy as a female, you feel so femine in you, that is why i got many bfs, break and join, break and join..so fun. oops rubbish again, sori..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thirdly,  the so called, check it out, many gals get so carried away by courtship that they forget to check out on the guy, check his pst, his place of work, his home, his usual friend, his colleagues, his education ,  he could be a married man  if you do not check it out. There are lots of wolves in the nets going after gal in saddness., did you watch little red riding hood?  watch it, you learn alot</p>
              <p>Finally, decison time, you hv all his info, his way and lifestyle, you make the decision,  </p>

              <p><br>i agree with this...</p>
              <p>let the guy make the next move whether he wish to go further with you... only when he initiate then you can choose whether to accept or not...</p>
              <p>if you start asking for more commitment from the guy, and if he is not ready... then that is basically the end of the relationship</p>

              <p>I think TS is giving guy too many opportunities. TS should bid for higher price, bargain more. MAKE HIM SWEAT. MAKE HIM WORK MORE HARDER TO GET TO YOU. TS should test the guy, see if he is genuine.</p>

              <p>Hi all, thanks for the advices here.</p>
              <p>@ Nelstar: Kinda not easy to start a phone conversation as our timings don't really <br>                   match. As in he does shift work, while Im bz with wrk n part time studies. In<br>                   my previous r/s  also seldom on e phone with my ex.</p>
              <p>@angel: i do feel something for the guy and is definitely not getting into another love <br>               affair to forget the previous r/s as i was e one who initiated e breakup. <br>               Probably i'm kinda heartless as i don't feel sad nor cried after e breakup. <br>               He had 1 ex-gf who broke off with him as e girl wanted to pursue her <br>               education and career abroad. He I've the name+add+number of e plc he's <br>               working at (he gave this to me just in case if i can't reach him on his mobile in<br>               case  of any emergency). He ever told me which block he's staying.</p>
              <p>@ color of money is honey: eh.. how to test him? Told him someone's trying to <br>                                                matchmake me with another guy? My cousin told me to <br>                                                invite him over to e upcoming chalet, whereby my <br>                                                relatives &amp; family will be there.</p>
              <p>Before we even met up, 2 of my relatives ever saw him before at NUH. He told me that his grandfather's bed was just beside my aunt-in-law's mom. He did tell me that his grandfather was admitted to hospital due to stroke. Surprisingly i received an sms from him few days later that he saw my aunt-in-law and uncle in e hospital. I was rather shocked as no one in my family nor relatives were admitted to hospital and at that time we did not know that my aunt-in-law's mom was admitted. He told me his grandfather's bed was just next to em. When i checked with my uncle, he told me that his mother-in-law was hospitalised. He told me that they took notice of the young lad beside em coz he kept turning and look at them. They commented he's a decent guy but at that time i can't comment much as i've not seen any of his pic nor met him up yet.</p>
              <p>Anyway, he just booked in for reservist now and still receiving his smses asking how's my day? What he has done for e day and what's up for tmr etc. But I did not reply his sms last night, then i received a call frm him but nvr answer. Another sms from him around 12+am asking if i am fine. I did not reply and he never send anymore till early this morning ard 5+ 6am. He smsed saying he's quite worried as no news from me all of the sudden. He asked if am i sick? (coz i was caught in e rain few days ago) or did anything happen at home...Are these concerns for real?</p>

              <p>ZZZzzzz...yawm...nAaa.., hangover again, ...damn...oh!. Its Jane!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let me see, you got some feeling for him, what kind of felling? how much is the feeling, that you hv to judge yourself, cos i no feeling one hor.</p>
              <p>Your infomation gathering is only superficial, if you really want to know and get along with the guy, you need to dig deeper,..oops, no dirty intended. Like me, when i want to know a guy, I do the PI work myself, talk to his grandma, his best friends, even his ex gf, get to know where he usually hangout on weekend nite, go to the place and stalk his movement, sometime, i find out some guy go out with another girl, I will apporach the gal to tell her about this guy behavior, advise her not to go with wolf, the rest is up to her. Most gals thanks me for warning them, and some become my good sisters.</p>
              <p>Do not ask old relatives or close one about your bf characters,old people tends to think differently, anything young to them is consider ok.</p>
              <p>As i said, it is all up to you now, you need more information gathering, more time and more guts to make your final decision whether to accept his love or not, ask yourself truly, what do yourreally like him, his characters? his persistent? his looks??, his way of lifesyle?? etc etc, then ask back yourself, do I go for this, do I have other alternative/suitors, what is my perfect man? Is he close to what i am looking for?? You have ot do some soul searching yourself ya. If you thinks single like me is perfect and free, so be it, just remain as it is . There are people in this world who prefer face to face talk then over phones, if you go taiwan, my homtown or other western countries, people do not use phone like what singaporean do,  ching chong ding dong so loud everyday, to us, face to face is more courtesy, phone is only for urgent and short call, not for chit chat. In my town, after 5pm, to call someone over handhpone is consider disturbing others off hours, we were taught in school , but in singapore, is like the more you chat, the more grand you are?? so funny, cross road, eat, shopping also call and send messages, big business meh?</p>
              <p>Lasstly, if you want, i can go and test him for you, if he falls for me, too bad, you know what to do, but then, I am in hot demand,  you need to book me and paid me per hour of service.  </p>
