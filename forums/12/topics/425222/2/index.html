              <p>Hi all, thanks for the advices here.</p>
              <p>@ Nelstar: Kinda not easy to start a phone conversation as our timings don't really<br>                   match. As in he does shift work, while Im bz with wrk n part time studies. In<br>                   my previous r/s  also seldom on e phone with my ex.</p>
              <p>@angel: i do feel something for the guy and is definitely not getting into another love<br>               affair to forget the previous r/s as i was e one who initiated e breakup.<br>               Probably i'm kinda heartless as i don't feel sad nor cried after e breakup.<br>               He had 1 ex-gf who broke off with him as e girl wanted to pursue her<br>               education and career abroad. He I've the name+add+number of e plc he's<br>               working at (he gave this to me just in case if i can't reach him on his mobile in<br>               case  of any emergency). He ever told me which block he's staying.</p>
              <p>@ color of money is honey: eh.. how to test him? Told him someone's trying to<br>                                                matchmake me with another guy? My cousin told me to<br>                                                invite him over to e upcoming chalet, whereby my<br>                                                relatives &amp; family will be there.</p>
              <p>Before we even met up, 2 of my relatives ever saw him before at NUH. He told me that his grandfather's bed was just beside my aunt-in-law's mom. He did tell me that his grandfather was admitted to hospital due to stroke. Surprisingly i received an sms from him few days later that he saw my aunt-in-law and uncle in e hospital. I was rather shocked as no one in my family nor relatives were admitted to hospital and at that time we did not know that my aunt-in-law's mom was admitted. He told me his grandfather's bed was just next to em. When i checked with my uncle, he told me that his mother-in-law was hospitalised. He told me that they took notice of the young lad beside em coz he kept turning and look at them. They commented he's a decent guy but at that time i can't comment much as i've not seen any of his pic nor met him up yet.</p>
              <p>Anyway, he just booked in for reservist now and still receiving his smses asking how's my day? What he has done for e day and what's up for tmr etc. But I did not reply his sms last night, then i received a call frm him but nvr answer. Another sms from him around 12+am asking if i am fine. I did not reply and he never send anymore till early this morning ard 5+ 6am. He smsed saying he's quite worried as no news from me all of the sudden. He asked if am i sick? (coz i was caught in e rain few days ago) or did anything happen at home...Are these concerns for real?</p>

              <p><br>So what is the issue here? You seem to like him. He seem to like you. Go forward wif the relationship. Nite shift is not a problem. Just call him at 10pm when he just started his shift to ask him how is he.</p>

              I seldom like to comment but let me provide u some insights as a guy (ok, I am a guy in his 30s) because I worried you over think and spoil what seems a good r/s with that guy.
              
              I find Singapore girls demanding and stupid - if I manage to chat with a girl for 1.5 years and she is cool and mature I would be very happy to date her but since she never express any feelings and I do not want to scare her off it would be the best not to rock the boat instead taking it one step at the time.
              
              First I ask her to be my valentine if she doesn't reject me - winner! but still that doesn't mean she wants to date me since we are both mature adults maybe she is treating me like her buddy?
              
              To show I am a serious, I am willing to be the man to pay for all the bills when we go out. I am not an idiot but I would like her to know everytime we go out it's a date and during dates I pay and I send her home.
              
              Finally, I show her I am a gentleman and wants to make sure she doesn't feel my touch is disgusting.
              
              All the signs seems to be there - do u still need to test him?
