              <p><strong>Facts</strong></p>
              <p>You will be arrested for being a member of an unlawful assembly because you were together with your gang members, had knowledge that a settlement talk was in progress and you were present at the scene. In fact, you will be arrested as long as you and your friends are together indulging in any unlawful activities. Such activities are:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <ul>
              <li>Staring incidents </li>
              <li>Confronting rival gang members </li>
              <li>Fights </li>
              <li>Going out to search for rival gang members to seek revenge </li>
              <li>Attending a funeral wake and procession of a gang member or his relative, etc.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The situation becomes more serious if you or yours friends are armed with weapons.</p>

              <p><strong>Punishments</strong></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Gang stalking will yield bad karmic seeds for themselves and their own family according to Buddhism. And is a sick mind according to science and medical, it's also not helpful in supporting democracy of mankind for peace and joys together. It damages the social well beings, welfare, and the health of people. Gang stalking are people having sick mindset themselves. The most detrimental effect is causing the mind of victim gradually suffering from mental problem like hallucination, causing harm to others, and worst case, entering insane or attempt to end their own life prematurely. I heard that if you always be mindful of the name of Namo Goddess of Mercy (Guan Yin Goddess), it will be very helpful. For more details, please seek help from the monastic for aid and understanding of your personal well beings. Confess with the stalkers those sins of your past life, such as raping, stalking others, murderings, committing suicides etc bad things that you may know of in the newspaper.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, look for psychology professional help, police and speak with your family members. Participate community activities and volunteer for social welfare activities.</p>
