I believe not...even if she did, i think most prob would just be a one-off only...<br><br>hmm...does she always chat up new friends? I do know some gals treat new friends much better than old ones...after she tires of u...then she will give u those attitude u talking about...trust me, it wont change...<br><br>this may be very tough for u...but really the only rational choice for u...anyway, do u realize that if ur mood depends on how she treats u, u are really putting urself at her mercy? please dun...what u can do for urself is to study as well as u could...keep urself busy...try not to look at her or her sms or anything to do with her...as time goes by, u will soon forget abt her...<br><br>its impt that u put all ur energies into ur o levels right now...u aiming for poly or jc? always keep ur goal in mind and tell urself u must persevere.
