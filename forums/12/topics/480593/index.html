We had a Resale 4 room HDB flat bought in 2010. Recently my wife caught me with teased messages with a lady, but I really didn't touch her before. I admit to my wife that we do really sent tease messages. I am very regret and apologies to her. But my wife don't want to settle with me and she insisted to file a divorce for my teasing messages with that lady. My wife had paid $6k as she claimed it's for lawyer, I don't know if this is true? She told me if I want to savage this marriage, I need to engage my lawyer and sign an agreement to prove that I truly love her and I won't cheat her anymore. The agreement is if I had cheat her or do anything wrong, I will give her my 100% assets of HDB 4 room flat, my car &amp; all my saving to her. I still love her very much and I want to save this marriage. I was advice by 100% of people I asked, there's no such condition as 100% assets &amp; saving for proving my love and loyalty to her. She is a changed person now. Very unreasonable and demanding. She said No negotiation. Does someone teach and guide her behind? Does she fall in love with another guy outside? I<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> need help from all brothers and sisters, please advice me what to do next? I admit my mistake of those text teasing &amp; I'm sorry what I had done, I had admitted and apologizes to her. I need help now. Thanks! </span></p></div>

              <p>Assuming you are not a troll....</p>
              <p>I get strong vibes that you haven't had much experience with the females. In summary your wife plans to take all your property and is setting you up. </p>
              <p>Did you already meet this female in person? Or was it only a flirting by phone?If so how did you meet? I strongly suspect that your wife set you up(look up 'honey trap'), seeing her efficiency on handling things. And looks like she is supported by a good lawyer.Knowing many lawyers I wouldn't be surprised if she has an affair with one or if one provided the idea with a promise of 'percent of win'. We can safely conclude she has another person.</p>
              <p>By signing this I am pretty sure you accept past infidelity and your wife being a big hearted woman, gave you a second chance. This would go well in the courts especially now feminists have their way.</p>
              <p>So next steps, get a very good lawyer,engage a PA to spy on your wife, get proof of infidelity. Get a list of her 'friends circle'. If any one is divorced in that group, she is usually the one giving these advices for quick money. And please don't waste your time on this woman anymore, well I can't say others are much better.</p>
              <p>All the best</p>

              <p>If you sign the agreement , you will be admitting infidelity. she can use it against you during divorce.</p>
              <p>Even if you sign the agreement.. she can still decide to leave. So there's no guarantee on her part.</p>
              <p>Money cannot fix a marriage. It can make many flaws more tolerable. But money can never heal a broken relationship.</p>
              <p>Once trust is broken, the dynamics changed.</p>
              <p>She is angry because you were sneaky, it's all about the deceit. Women don't care where you parked your dick, but if you had to be sneaky, that's where she draws the line.</p>
              <p>I'm not saying you need to give up on this marriage yet. Trust must be earned. And given your situation, you'll be spending several years trying to earn back her trust.( assuming you know how) and if she is even worth the effort at all.</p>
              <p>Tell her to give you 6 months. During which you will do your best to earn her trust back. Allow her to scrutinize all your correspondence, all your activities. Learn to pick your battles. Let her have her way as long as she is still married to you.</p>
              <p>If after the 6 months and your efforts are still not good enough for her.. then it's best to call it quits. Make sure she knows about the 6 months limit. It will give her enough time to think through if she really wants to end this or not.</p>
              <p>Takes two hands to clap.</p>
              <p> She's a woman with a brain. She don't need someone to teach her how to execute self-preservation.</p>
              <p>She is threatened by your extra marital flirting. You are interested in another woman, emotionally, there's a chance she may lose her position in your heart.</p>
              <p>Do what you need to do to make her feel secure again.</p>

              <p>Ya, say that to the guy after he has lost everything.</p>
              <p>Obviously you are the drama lover and you haven't presided over divorce meetings. What do you know of proofs created by lawyers to invalidate even a lawyer witnessed pre-nupital? I have seen much stupider things happening. It's not so difficult to play the system if you are capable and has people to support you.</p>
              <p>I can assure that this man if he signs this agreement can very easily part with all his belongings. Wifes lawyer will prove that he accepted infidelity, mental trauma, stress all leading to inability to work. A leniant court may allow him to stay in his place till he finds a new one. Now that he has a job even that might be difficult.</p>

              divorce her, but do not sign any agreements. Obviously she is trying to leech you dry. Do you love her ? Love do not come with a price tag. And she is tagging you with an ultimate price to pay. 
                      
              Flirty messages? That's pretty common . No much harm as long as you dun commit adultery. That's a whole different thing. 
                      
              And further more, some Malaysian girls likes to think they are above the sky. Engage a PI , I think she is also not honest.
                      
                      Good Luck!

              <p>Filthy messages are ok ? Lol. Not when your spouse is sending those to another man.</p>
              <p>Just because you think that kind of behavior is harmless does not mean it is also ok for your partner.</p>
              <p>If that behavior is offensive to your partner..no matter how you try to justify it in your head.. it is still offensive to your partner. </p>
              <p>Inconsiderate behavior can never build nor sustain any relationship. </p>
