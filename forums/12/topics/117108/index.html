Because she will cook all your favourite food for you everyday and ofcoz you got to eat together with her too.. if you donwana gain weight or you wana maintain your weight, you have to watch what you eat and at the sametime you exercise, for ladies when they reach 30++ their hormones slow down and they tend to gain weight easily so ladies, I suggest that you keep up with your daily exercises..<br><br></div>
