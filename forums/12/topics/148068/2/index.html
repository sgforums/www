She acknowledge your liking for you, but retain silence regarding her feelings.<br><br>IMHO, you are treading on very dangerous terrain. Dangerous, not as in life-threatening kind; more like every slight movement would create a chain of reaction. She probably holds some kind of feelings for you, but it isn't strong enough to justify a relationship. There could be some unseen body language or situation that took place and she deemed it as either anti-seductive (minus marks) or unsuitable.<br><br>It's great when you have the fighter spirit to try and win the affection of your Love, but knowing your circumstances is critically essential.

Take the time you have away from her to improve yourself. Maybe she'll see it, maybe she won't, but others will appreciate you for who you are and what you do. Don't let your whole life crash for one person, because the only one who'll really suffer is you.<br></div>
