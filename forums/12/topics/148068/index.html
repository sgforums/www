            <div class='col-md body'>To anyone whose reading this long problem of mine, whether u got an answer to my problem or not, i really appreciate ur effort. Thank you very very very much...<br><br>I'm a poly student and i got to know this girl around end of january. we started off well and got close to each other pretty soon. i could tell that she was intrested in me becoz i asked certain qus and her reply was obvious. there was once she was sick but insisted on going somewhere far for dinner with me... but i did not tell her abt my feelings becoz i wanted to get closer to her and then reveal my feelings. i thought this would ensure i could get her.<br><br>However as time passes, she got colder towards me. despite sacrificing alot of time for her and showering her with gifts. her time is spent on her other friends, guys and girls. instead of me. i couldnt take it anymore and i revealed my feelings for her. she then said she knew this was coming and she didnt wanted to be in a relationship. her actions before were very much showing she was intrested in me...<br><br>but god knows when she started changing and before i could realise it, she was treating me like a normal friend. she treats her friends very well, so i often got mistaken. but there is the difference in ur actions if u're intrested in someone or u're treating ur friend well. and i could tell that difference.<br><br>we arent as good as before but i've always been very dedicated to her and i never asked for her to sacrifice anything back. i just hope she could accept me... but she never did. i used to have academic and sports excellence but its now deterioating... i'm considered an achiever, and my performance now is really a big disaster. i just cannot focus on anything i do... still, my mind is sticking onto her...<br><br>i often miss her very much. every moment. the last thing before i sleep i think of her... so is the first thing i thought of when i wake up... i go to sch, listening to class, walking, eating, playing... virtually everything i do, she's in my mind... i've let her know abt how i missed her, but she doesnt have any response to it... she never reveals her feelings for me whether she likes me or not even though i asked her. if she doesnt, why not just tell me and let me give up. if she does, why not let me know and be with me... i used to msg her everyday and when sometimes she msgs me first... but she doesnt now. and i tried not msging her for a week and she doesnt even bother to msg me! she's now with another guy friend and she seems to be in good terms with him...<br><br>i'm feeling really bad and i dont know what to do. i've been telling myself to give up on her but i just couldnt do it. i've told myself to go for her one last time, if it doenst work out well, then lets forget it... but everytime it worked out somewhere in the middle. not bad and not good. i just dont know wat to do now... the worst feeling is when u're not very good with her, and not too bad, hanging somewhere in the middle... we used to be very good... but now we're not... someone please tell me what should i do...<br></div>

I mean from what you are saying it seems like you have been keeping a lot of your inner thoughts to yourself... Does she even know how you are feeling now? The fact is that you said she treats friends very well, could that be a possibility that she is also treating this guy as a good friend too? Could it be that she has been getting close to him recently that has resulted in the loss of trust in your current relationship?<br><br>Well... I can't say I know how you feel totally now for I'm not you, but it seems that you might be thinking a bit too much, it might just be good for you to have a talk with your gf...</div>

You got to understand that love is something that you cannot always fight for dude... I am pretty sure everyone else wants to fight for his/her perfect life too... but hey, are you going to make life miserable for both parties? I'm not trying to disourage you... I can tell that you have put in effort to make your 'perfect' life, and yes no doubt I'm sure you have her in your heart and mind all the time... but problem is... does she feels the same? have you spare a thought for her?<br><br>Perhaps this is more than fate, rather its more of her feeling towards you. Yes you can try all means to have a relationship with her, but no, you can't force her to say  that she wants to be with you if that's not what she really wants...<br>I have many friends with same situations before... and they really try all they could for ages, which means years... and in the end? It seems that a guy will appear out of no where and poof~ you hear friends telling you that she's with this guy whom she met recently...<br><br>However, I would still like to wish you all the best~ =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by TidusX:</div><div class="quote_body">To anyone whose reading this long problem of mine, whether u got an answer to my problem or not, i really appreciate ur effort. Thank you very very very much...<br><br>I'm a poly student and i got to know this girl around end of january. we started off well and got close to each other pretty soon. i could tell that she was intrested in me becoz i asked certain qus and her reply was obvious. there was once she was sick but insisted on going somewhere far for dinner with me... but i did not tell her abt my feelings becoz i wanted to get closer to her and then reveal my feelings. i thought this would ensure i could get her.<br><br>However as time passes, she got colder towards me. despite sacrificing alot of time for her and showering her with gifts. her time is spent on her other friends, guys and girls. instead of me. i couldnt take it anymore and i revealed my feelings for her. she then said she knew this was coming and she didnt wanted to be in a relationship. her actions before were very much showing she was intrested in me...<br><br>but god knows when she started changing and before i could realise it, she was treating me like a normal friend. she treats her friends very well, so i often got mistaken. but there is the difference in ur actions if u're intrested in someone or u're treating ur friend well. and i could tell that difference.<br><br>we arent as good as before but i've always been very dedicated to her and i never asked for her to sacrifice anything back. i just hope she could accept me... but she never did. i used to have academic and sports excellence but its now deterioating... i'm considered an achiever, and my performance now is really a big disaster. i just cannot focus on anything i do... still, my mind is sticking onto her...<br><br>i often miss her very much. every moment. the last thing before i sleep i think of her... so is the first thing i thought of when i wake up... i go to sch, listening to class, walking, eating, playing... virtually everything i do, she's in my mind... i've let her know abt how i missed her, but she doesnt have any response to it... she never reveals her feelings for me whether she likes me or not even though i asked her. if she doesnt, why not just tell me and let me give up. if she does, why not let me know and be with me... i used to msg her everyday and when sometimes she msgs me first... but she doesnt now. and i tried not msging her for a week and she doesnt even bother to msg me! she's now with another guy friend and she seems to be in good terms with him...<br><br>i'm feeling really bad and i dont know what to do. i've been telling myself to give up on her but i just couldnt do it. i've told myself to go for her one last time, if it doenst work out well, then lets forget it... but everytime it worked out somewhere in the middle. not bad and not good. i just dont know wat to do now... the worst feeling is when u're not very good with her, and not too bad, hanging somewhere in the middle... we used to be very good... but now we're not... someone please tell me what should i do...<br></div></blockquote>Dear TidusX:<br><br>This may not sound pleasing but keep in mind what i'm going to say.<br><br>The problem doesn't lies with you, you did your best.<br>I'm afraid that i have to label her 'a problem child' - Problematic.<br>From your post, she is really just checking you out and interest level dip below par, before you know it. She's checking out another guy.<br><br>Note: i could be wrong because there are variables to each r/s and courtship. But this is my prediction, for now.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey dude... yeah I'm sure she's your dream girl... but your dream girl as of now... have you seen more than half the world and can you safely say that it will be her even til the last of your breath? I dunno what are you thinking of  now... Yes she is your dream girl but you can't gurantee that it will stay forever that way... until it has been tried out...<br><br>And one thing you got to correct on your philosophy...unlike marathon, in the end you don't win a prize after your hardwork of trying to win her heart. The idea of a relationship is more on enjoying the process, like being together thru the thick and thin times, it's not about just winning her heart and yes! you got what you want. She's not a prize to be won, remember about that.<br><br>When a prize is involved, it is a linear way of motivation, meaning to say so long as you work ver very hard, with your effort, you will deserve your prize. But this is a love that both has to cherish and treasure dude... which means she has to respond to it too... and if she doesn't, what more can you do?<br><br>I know its hard for you to take it... but life is such</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>does that mean that she aint serious abt me from the start? do i really have to forget abt her? i cant get her off my mind, its really bothering everything i do... what can i do to forget abt her... i use to run whenever i have problems, i wont be thinking abt the problem during running and i'd face it better after the run... but she's in my mind even everytime when i'm running... it just makes me stop and think abt her... what do i have to do to stop thinking abt her...</div>
