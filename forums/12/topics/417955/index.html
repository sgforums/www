              <p>If her bf finds out that you asked her to be your gf before, it is going to get worse for you.</p>
              <p>There is always the day when friendship ends with everyone going their way with their families, especially for those of opposite gender.</p>

              <p>She has already made her stand very clear and she is also attached. Why don't you mix with other girls and who knows, when the right one comes along, your lust for your best friend will just fade away.Maybe cut down on being with her too much.You know you are only feeding the lustful desires in you when you are with her often. Also, occupy your mind with other better activities, people &amp; things so that your focus will not be on her solely. Some people are meant to be just friends, you have to learn to accept this truth or be hurt in the end.</p>

              <p>I ask you this question: Do you really really like her or you only want to lust for her? If you are interested for sex then forget it. You will surely ruin your friendship.</p>
              <p>On the other hand if you really like her - then this may be unfortunate because she is not ready to give up her bf for you. Perhaps you can wait for the right timing. She may decide to break up then you be there for her. Or if you are the risk taker type, you go after her but beware, the perils are there.</p>
              <p>You have got to do some reflection. Make a list of what you like about her. Do you both have anything in common? If the whole list consist of lust, then this means you can again forget it.</p>

              <p>Ts,</p>
              <p>It is cos all that you see is not a human being, and sadly repressed sex is what it is all about.</p>
              <p>Till that is resolved, running away is not the solution but rather understanding the lack of ...  another gal or even a prospective gal friend, it is bound to be like that.</p>
              <p>I dont know how old u are and it is understandable and yet woefully insulting to see another human being as a means to one's end. Sex is healthy, sexuality is sickness!</p>

Tomorrow wake up early and head down to the nearest polyclinic.. very cheap one, consultation fee only a few dollar, tell them your situation and ask them for advice, they will likely book an appointment for you at a local hospital, after which they will print a slip for you to know where to go for the follow up and what time it will be.. go for the follow up, which is likely to be a counselling session.. it may be in a group or a one to one counselling... tell them all your feelings even if you don't tell them you will still need to pay so no need shy just bomb everything... after that they will nod their head and give you some pill then you can go home as a normal man again.... counselling ftw.. no need scare this kind of thing nothing to shy about one...</p></div>

              <p>Maybe if you start treating the other girls as well as when you're with her, you'll find that there are many more girls out there who would appreciate or even begin a meaningful relationship with you. Time to let go of that wilted rose and search for a new one, dude.</p>

              <p>Your problem is not the sexual urges but the target.</p>
              <p>Your buddy is the trigger, but you also have her in you sights.</p>
              <p>Don't supress your urges, it will only exert an equally opposite force.</p>
              <p>But rather shift you target else where. Masturbate if you must.</p>
