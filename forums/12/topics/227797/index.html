            <div class='col-md body'>When I read you post, I knew you are one of those who have lost their bearing. The most unfortunate thing can happen is when you've finally realized that the course which you are pursuing now is the the dream course you wanted.<br><br>Yes, I agreed the one must bear with the harsh reality of the corporate world in business. Everyone want to climb up the ladder in order to gain fame, respect and social status. Reading your post, I could tell that you are one who dislike practises of backstabbing and fake-friendship.<br><br>Since you are majoring your business course at this moment, I guess you should continue with your studies instead of "not studying for the sake of temporary joy - money made from tuitions". You have already reached the stage where "give up and lose everything" or "continue and gain something".<br><br>A businessman will not do anything without profit let alone a business student. I strongly encourage you that you should continue with your course and at least obtain your rightful paper qualification. It's not wise to give up at this juncture because you'll loss the money, time and resources you've invested.<br><br>You said in your post that you earn money by giving tuitions. First answer yourself, do you like teaching as a career? From my knowledge, people who give tuition are usually categorize into three groups. The passionates ones, the money-minded ones, and those forced by circumstances. Which caterogory are you in? If your passion is in teaching, why not apply with the MOE?<br><br>It's still not too late to ask yourself, "What in my interest, what is my dream"? Everyone has a dream! What is yours? If you say architecture if your dream, then spend some time doing research on this area of field. Ask your friends who are doing this course. Never worry about job opportunities because you'll definitely find them, time is the only factor.<br><br>Have faith in yourself, and chose your path wisely. As life went on, you'll have different social circle and be meeting with different types of people. Maybe for now you're in the "social circle vieing for corporate climb", in future your cirle will be expending at the rate of light speed where you'll have more friends than you know now.<br><br>Cheers.</div>
