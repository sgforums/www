              <p>Thx for all your comments, i have been trying hard to make time
                  for communication. it seems difficult but i'm trying...</p>
              <p>I did not sack my maid of course, and i think she is doing a
                  good job so there's no reason for me to sack her. btw my kids are
                  4,6 and 7 respectively and i am happy that they are coping well in
                  their kindergarten/pri school. I'll try to make time
                  sending/fetching them to school and talk to them on the way</p>

              <p>It's good to see that you have finally wised up and started taking responsibility..... both as a parent to your children, and as an employer to your maid. It was very immature of you to have been jealous of your maid and to have tried to pin the blame on her.</p>
              <p>Like everyone else here has said, if you don't have the time, then <em>make</em> the time. It doesn't have to be a lot. Some of the best memories of my childhood involved my mom taking me and my siblings out to the neighbourhood library on Saturdays. We would then go and visit the nearby NTUC after that for shopping.</p>
              <p>In hindsight, my mom was smart: in one fell swoop she combined children's education + parent-children bonding time + weekly grocery shopping.... and all at low cost. Go figure. Â </p>

              <p>I'm a parent of 3 and both my husband and i are working hard to
                      pay off our housing debt. To take care of my children during my
                      working hours, i hired a maid about 3 years ago.</p>
              <p>However, it has become increasingly evident that my kids are
                      more attached to the maid than me! They always talk with the maid
                      and when i try to talk to them, they either give me short answers
                      or just stare blankly at me. I feel frustrated and so does my
                      husband.</p>
              <p>Sometimes I feel like sacking the maid and hiring another one,
                      so that at least i become the more 'familiar' person to them in the
                      house. However, i don't think my kids are willing to part with my
                      maid so easily... Can anyone tell me how to deal with this??? thx
                      alot in advance</p>

              <p>Sack the maid for doing a good job ? Well done !</p>
              <p>You are such an asshole and a selfish person.</p>
              <p>You are the one who is unwilling to commit the time. The fault lies in you. Can't you see that?</p>
