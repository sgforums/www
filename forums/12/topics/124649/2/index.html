            <div class='col-md body'>Oh Phanta5y, I am so glad that you will be going to the doctor (thank you Lord, Amen).  Even if the examination turn out nothing serious or just a temporary condition, at least you will have a peace of mind.  Hearing it from the expert beats guessing it, right? Can you get another adult, like a relative to accompany you, just to give you emotional and spiritual support?  Or you may be wrong.  Your mum may go with you.  Explain to her that accidents happened, even in sports.<br><br>Even if it was mischief on your part, but the incident has happened.  No point in pointing finger so just make sure your well being is being looked after.  And I am sure you will learn something from this.  I have always told my son that it is okay to make mistake.  The most important thing is to learn from it.  Some mistakes can be expensive though so we have to remember that we are the beneficiaries of our own actions.  Even as adults.  You know, whatever parents teach their children, it apply to them as well because responsibilities and attitudes are responsbilities and attiudes.  Age has nothing to do with it, i.e. no matter what age group we are, we have to shoulder these.<br><br>I hope I am a good mum.  Actually, my son and all my friends think so.  But I am no angel, I have my off days too but I practice self control or what the new age say "anger management".  But I believe there are always two sides to the coin.  For you, you may grow up to be very independent and street smart with your parents too busy to fuss around you.  Because I am always there for my son, he may be less independent.  But I believe eventually, everything will fall into place.  We humans are resilient and adaptable.  Agree?<br><br>Okay, I think I have written too much.  You may really feel this is Aunt Agony alright!!!  You stay well okay?  It is good to have fun but it is important to keep well too......the body and the mind.<br><br>Cheers and have a great weekend!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just cross my mind that I know of the Raffles Medical Clinic.  Good choice as I think they are reputable.<br><br>Good luck at the doctor's!  Be sure to explain the accident, the conditions thereafter.........in all its entirety to the doctor, okay?  Don't worry, alright?  You are still young and will still grow physically.  Let's just hear it from the doctor then.<br><br>Cheers.</div>
