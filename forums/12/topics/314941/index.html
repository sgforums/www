              <p><br>To be frank, I seriously don't see the reason why you are holding back your feelings and not telling her your true feelings.</p>
              <p>It may be the norm to observe and worry this and then what will happen to you if she rejects you...but it doesn't really apply to your case isn't it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you feel strongly when you should hold back your confession towards her, it means your heart is telling you "she's not ready for it yet / this is not the right time to confess", but.......you and I know that you should come clean with your feelings with her now...in fact long ago since now. So what are you waiting for? Lack of experience in this area perhaps?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you felt that your relationship with her isn't moving anywhere, that means one of you need to hold onto your balls and bring this relationship to the next level. So........go and sort of confess your feelings to her romantically please......do it like you would do if you were to "propose" to her ok?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Romance is sweetest when both parties are anticipating for it, but please don't drag this for overly long cos even the sweetest candy might taste bad if left un-eaten for too long.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is no 100% success but you know it's definitely 80-90% success. So don't come here and tell us your agony when there is nothing to agonise about.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just don't drag until somebody else stole her away then you come here and post your regretful agony, by that time....nobody can help you....not even me.</p>

              <p><strong>Hemispherectomy</strong> is a <a class="mw-redirect" title="Surgical procedure" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgical_procedure">surgical procedure</a> where one <a title="Cerebral hemisphere" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemisphere">cerebral hemisphere</a> (half of the <a title="Brain" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain">brain</a>)
              is removed or disabled. This procedure is used to treat a variety of
              seizure disorders where the source of the epilepsy is localized to a
              broad area of a single hemisphere of the brain. It is solely reserved
              for extreme cases in which the seizures have not responded to
              medications and other less invasive surgeries.</p>
