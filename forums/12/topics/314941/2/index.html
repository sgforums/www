              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>She was the sister of a friend's friend.<br> Nearly a year ago, We chanced upon each other by accident and we
                  started keeping in contact via email.<br> <br> Then there was a slight misunderstanding (she thought i was keen on
                  someone else) and we didn't really talk for six months.<br> <br> Recently she asked me out for coffee and in the midst of our
                  conversation(s), we cleared up that misunderstanding<br> <br> Since then we've been in contact almost daily, and we've been going
                  out more frequently (not as frequent as i'd like thou!)<br> <br> she informs me when she's heading out, lets me know when she's home
                  from a late night out, etc. I'm pleasantly pleased with this;<br> When i was contemplating a job offer that would require me to
                  travel frequently, for a number of years, one of her first
                  reactions was "does that mean i'll only get to see you in a few
                  years' time?<br> <br> its been two months since we caught up with each other again, and
                  i'm this time, i'm pretty sure she's the one i want in my
                  life;<br> <br> A few days back, I tried to sound her out, but I had a feeling that
                  she knew what was coming (either that or i was over sensitive) for
                  that meetup was pretty tense.<br> <br> Things were still the same after that, so i'm pretty glad for
                  that.<br> <br> Now I've came to know that there's possibly another guy in the
                  picture.<br> but she wouldn't say much, other than that's a friend (she does
                  have quite a few male friends)<br> <br> I know i should come clean with how i feel, but is this a good
                  time, or should i observe more?<br> <br> One thing i noticed, we tend to think too much for the other party,
                  and sometimes, this leads to a lack of action by both parties. this
                  is bad, i know, and i'm working on it.<br> <br> Can any kind souls please advise?<br> <br> Cheers,</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> This is probably similar to a salesman who
                  does his pitching but doesn't know how to close the deal. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Yeah... the price is clear. So is the
                  function, the unique selling point, the need, the desire, the service, the
                  aftersales service, the warranty, the setup, the additional accessory, the
                  colour, the size, the model, the discount, the free premium, the contract
                  period, the number of users.. blar blar blar blar blar. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Sheesh, so how do I get her to close the deal? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Just pass her a pen and sign the acknowledgement. Done.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Albeit you like her customized attention to
                  you, but you still must recall that ultimately, you two are not yet a couple,
                  yet acting, in certain aspects, like one. I reckoned that there is too much of
                  that grey line in which your friendship with her have inevitably transformed
                  into. Informing you when she is going out and coming back is a little too much
                  for just mere friends - but because there is this distinct passiveness in your
                  attitude towards the chase, it's probably just hanging there.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You are probably just maintaining status quo. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I don't understand how competition can change
                  your stand in loving someone. You mean just because someone is <em>probably </em>in the
                  picture and that per se could deter you from advancing?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Observers are only meant for football games -
                  if you have no intend to play the game, then I suggest you could make better
                  use of your time by doing other constructive things - like focusing on your
                  career. Though nobody wants to play a soccer game only to lose, but if you
                  don't start the match, you will never know the outcome. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Be a player, not a punter. </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Cheers </span></p>
