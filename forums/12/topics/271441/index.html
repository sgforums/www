            <div class='col-md body'>you have guy friends. Its ok mah. Why do you expect the girls to say hi and bye to you. Then would you feel they hi-bye you alot and make use of you for homework.<br><br>To have friends is nice but to have a many false friends is a waste of time. Its important to have a couple of true friends. But seriously, if you feel the need to hi-bye, why don't you hi-bye these people. Perhaps they are just more shy... so you need to take the first step</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i understand how u feel.<br>its not jus the girls treating u like u are invisible that's making u feel left out. its the school environment right. people dun approach u. people dun include u in anything. people dun even talk abt u.<br><br>well seriously , looks dun play a big part at all. unless u look like an alien. i have seen big sized guys who are popular, i have seen guys with pimples all over and they have friends to go with.<br><br>dun demean yourself. this is afterall a new environment for u.<br>get noticed first by looking approachable. so give a smile to anyone whenever eyes met. no matter whether u know them or not. soon u will.<br><br>and join more activities esp if there are leardership roles available. train yourself to be a leader, u never know if u have such potential. and most student leaders are popular.<br><br>u can also find someone who takes the same bus as u, or walk the same way back. journeys are a great way to know a person. and u may forge a friendship in that process.<br><br>take the cue from someone who makes friends easily. see how that person talks and figure out what it takes that makes them likeable. and u too can be like that.<br><br>i wish u all the best!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For all u know, people also wait for u 2 say Hi to them 1st? Its the way it is, people expect others 2 talk first then they talk. People are always passive, that's why in this world, we need 2 take initative. Next time u see ur classmates, say Hi first to them . U will be suprised that they are actually friendly people.<br><br>Anyway, its only August. U still have 1 year+ before A-level. Sooner or later, u people will bond. My class didn't really bond until the second year last time, because we all going through the same thing, and we gave each other support and help. So, take things as it is!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i am also a jc1 student. i wouldnt call myself very sociable either.im a rather reserved person. im also not one of those sports jocks. i do play sports occasionally. i would call myself slightly above average looking. my j1 class has 5 girls. 20 guys. naturally they girls would band together. what we do as a class is eat together and play card games(eg bridge and bluff) together.<br><br>i hope you're not:<br><br>1.) a chao mugger<br>2.) a weirdo in actions<br>3.) a motormouth<br>4.) act cool<br><br>the above 4 are a big turn off for girls i believe. this is because my class have 4 guys like that and people tend to stay away from them. from your original post i would tend to think you are inclined to 1.) . my relationship with girls is that i can talk with them and can have conversations(though im rather shy to the girl i like  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> ). however, what you need to do is to <strong>put a smile on your face!</strong> and be cheerful! and dont talk the same way to them as you do to guys. e.g. oi, hokkien expletive etc etc<br></div>
