              <p>themoment,</p>
              <p>Let's face it girl.</p>
              <p>You havn't broken up with him, but he had with you.</p>
              <p>The money is only a sad excuse for you to hang on to that old and broken past with him.</p>
              <p>Let the money go, take it as a payment for his past companionship services. And the price you pay to learn a lesson in relationship.</p>
              <p>There are so many people around you, he is not the only one who can be a good friend. So let him go too.</p>
              <p>Why bother getting yourself all frazzled ? He is not going to care, because you're the only one suffering right now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You may claim to be his good friend.. but in fact, you are not, because you cannot wish him happiness from the bottom of your heart. Think about it.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              <p>u have not moved on lo.. dun deceive urself.</p>
              <p>y would u be jealous if u have moved on?</p>
              <p>it's not abt the $50.. it's the fact that he's gg on a trip with his gf that's making u really nervous.</p>
              <p>dependent?  i think it's more likely to be 'possessive'.</p>
