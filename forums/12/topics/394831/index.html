              <p>Hi</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was wondering if a girl is very clever in her studies.. what kind of standards will she set in their potential boyfriends?</p>
              <p>When i mean clever, i dont mean just university. I mean top the university cohort in her course of study.</p>
              <p>Will the standard criteria for most girls apply to this kind of girl as well? </p>
              <p>If no, what kind of standards? i was thinking probably someone academically even smarter than her, but that would make majority of the guys not up on par liao. </p>
              <p>And would you as a guy go over them?</p>
              <p>In case there are any academically outstanding girls in this forum who happen to be in sgforum, appreciate your perspective on this. Would appreciate if you can kindly state so, otherwise wun know which opinions are coming from the normal and which from the perspectives of smart girls</p>

              <p>She may be academically smart, but that doesn't mean you do not stand a chance at all if you are to go after her. I certainly hope this has nothing to do with your own pride or whatsoever.</p>
              <p>The most important thing is for you to be able to ''communicate'' with her. As far as I know, top students usually do not set the same criteria for another half, except the common criteria among most people of being able to get along well with them and communicate with them.</p>
              <p>If you are really interested in what she wants from a guy, get your female friends to try to go close to her and ask her.</p>
              <p>Personally, I will go after a girl base on her personality, not her academic results. </p>

              <p>It is clear now that you do not have confidence because she seems so perfect. </p>
              <p>It is likely that most guys around her also have the same idea - she is too good and out of their reach, and that is probably why she is still single.</p>
              <p>If you really want to make yourself match up to her, then work hard and top your cohort as well.</p>
              <p>Well, that is not realistic right? So just go ahead and give it a try and ask her out. You will never know if you never try.</p>

              <p>one of my most favourite question - </p>
              <p>a smart gal will know the larger perspective and adjust accordingly to support her man as the leader...</p>
              <p>put it in another way.....advisers are usually smarter than the President or Prime Minister...and all credit still goes to the leader in charge....smart advisers know when to hide behind and live longer....</p>
              <p>put it back again....no matter how smart the gal is...eventually she must decide whether its the larger family perspective or herself is more important</p>

              <p>Not sure why you focus on her academic achievements.......</p>
              <p>Usually, a woman's power and bargaining position is not from the academics.....but from the looks....</p>
              <p>For you, as a male, your bargaining position is your looks and earning power. (money).</p>
              <p>If you have achieved top 1% grades, but you earn a little money, compared to another guy who is just average but earn twice or thrice than you, he will have a better chance in wooing her and defeat you.</p>

              <p>Hi</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was wondering if a girl is very clever in her studies.. what kind of standards will she set in their potential boyfriends?</p>
              <p>When i mean clever, i dont mean just university. I mean top the university cohort in her course of study.</p>
              <p>Will the standard criteria for most girls apply to this kind of girl as well? </p>
              <p>If no, what kind of standards? i was thinking probably someone academically even smarter than her, but that would make majority of the guys not up on par liao. </p>
              <p>And would you as a guy go over them?</p>
              <p>In case there are any academically outstanding girls in this forum who happen to be in sgforum, appreciate your perspective on this. Would appreciate if you can kindly state so, otherwise wun know which opinions are coming from the normal and which from the perspectives of smart girls</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thanks for any advice in advance</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Academically smart doesn't means that the girl will have a different set of criteria than other girls.</p>
              <p>Which girl doesn't need someone who can provide for them in their future? Be it love, money, shelter and food.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Find a girl who is MOST COMPATIBLE with you, that's my gift to you.</p>
