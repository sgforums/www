            <div class='col-md body'>Man maybe ur mum has some bad exp with PRCs? i dun realli have a good impression of them either cus of some personal exp with em but i have ta admit i have also met a few good ones. However you shuld not blame ya mum as she has ya interests at heart and also she is older and has probably seen much more than you have esp in the area of judging people's character. Also you mentioned that you have been together only for 6mnths which is not realli a long time thus i suggest you do not trust her completely, i am not saying dun trust ya gf at all but do exercise some caution for the world is not really that kind and wonderful so just continue to find out more about each other and see how things turn out lo as for ya mum tell her u will get to know her better and decide for urself. also that you will consult her if you need her help. Remmeber never trust anyone completely unless the person has proven he/she is worth your utmost trust</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know when you are in love, it is like the two of you gainst the world. I hate to say this but I believe mother's know best. It is a woman's instinct. Or maybe you are a Mommy's boy and she can't accept that you have a woman that you love more than her, so base human nature is to strike down your competitor with whatever means possible.<br>remember your mother carried you in her womb for 9 months and gave birth to you. She will always be your mother even after she die. But this girl could leave you for another man if she has a change of heart. Human emotions no matter what colour, race or creed is the same. You have only been together for 6 months so you are currently in the infatuation stage. Than you will reach the period where she wants to control your movements or vice versa, there are certain charecter flaws that you can't stand about each other, money issues etc which will lead to quarrels this is known as the reality stage where everything is not just peaches and honey. If you can through this stage than it will be the going for the long haul phase in which it could eventually lead to marriage or not.<br>But your mother will still be your mother from the time you open your eyes till the time you close it to go to sleep. Offending your mother is like offending God himself. Think about it.</div>
