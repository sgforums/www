            <div class='col-md body'>I dont think it is good to take PRC gal as gf or wife. It is true that they are nice in buying people heart. But do you find the things they bought for you are usually cheap stuff from china. Nothing to be appreciate of. No doubt they are quite pretty and well make up, but dont think can be long term. They are just using you as a bridge for their PR here. Dont be so tian zhen</div>

If ur girlfriend is really good as u say, ur mum will sooner or later find out for herself too. That's the only way for her to drop her bias.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my personal experience with the 8-10 prc gals I'd met are:=<br>a) They are very very cunning<br>b) Very good in buying people's heart<br>c) Very tan xiao pian ye<br>d) Will smile smile smile even in front of people they hate to the core<br>e) Think very fast, know how to always change the situation to their advantage<br>f) Know how to act pityfull to get (esp) guys help (and the guys are stupid enough to help them. My boss kana backstab by one but still never learn his lesson, kana another time by another prc. haha)<br><br>Me also kana backstab once by them.<br><br>The above are from the 8-10 prc gals i know and am personally in contact with. They are some various backgrounds (local poly grads, uni grads).<br><br>TS, I can't blame your mum for being cautious. However, I think 6mths is too short a time frame to really see someone's true character.</div>

I have a gf, as stated in the topic, she is a PRC... she is just like any other normal gal... i find her less materialistic than most singaporean gals.. ( sorry for tat.. ) she is very caring towards me... and she bought things back for us( me and family), whenever she goes back to china for holiday or visit her parents... but problem is... my mum have a very strong biasedness against them... she insists that all PRC gals are bad... they are open minded, and they are cheap and sIutty... can u imagine tat? I dont dare to tell my gf all these... I afraid will break her heart... She treat my mum not bad... buying things for her whenever she come across soemthing nice or wad... but this is wad my mum did to her.. sigh... And my mum insists i break off with her now and find a singaporean gf... But I love my gf very much... and she does too.. den i told her tat some  singaporeans gals are materialistic too..she dont believe... she thought singaporean are 100 % good... unlike PRC girls... and when i try to talk to my mum tat she got buy things for us whenever she went back to china, she will say tat the PRC are good in buying people's heart... and she will not fall for tat... Sometimes I really very fed up with my mum... for wad she had said... i know she do this for my own good, as she is afraid me will be cheated... but... isn't she abit too far too? oh ya... btw me and my gf is together for 6 mths... i know it is short... I will let the time be the judge... hopefully my mum's opinion will change... can anyone here give me some opinion? </div></blockquote>With the availability of so many negative reports from the media on PRC, it is no doubts that your mum had such bad impression on themÂ…<br><br>WellÂ… to be frankÂ… being good to a person is not just about buying things for you and your familyÂ…<br><br>It is still very early to determine whether she is the one for you or not as it is still very early to say anythingÂ…<br><br>Nobody knows what will happen tomorrow but just keep in mindÂ… all parents loves their kidsÂ… no doubts some will be quite extreme when they are doing so but no matter what.. she is still your mum who simply wants the best for you thusÂ… think for her alsoÂ…<br><br>AnywayÂ… Good LuckÂ…</div>
