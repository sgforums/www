              </p><p>I'm a sec 4 girl this year (O levels...)...My grades are terrible last 3 years but my parents want me to get into RJC, and it is rly pressurizing considering they only accept 400 students from other schools :( What makes matters worse is that I am so totally infatuated with this person (I had liked him since sec 1, so it had been 3 years and it still hasn't wore off) whom I cannot ever have that I cannot focus on studying at all. I did everything in my power to get over him...Getting boyfriends, webcaming with random people, cyberdating, gaming. the only things I didn't try is what is illegal. Many times a day I feel that life is not worth living without him in my life. But I will probably never see him again after this year which makes me extremely depressed. On top of that my best friend keep on bullying me into doing things for her, without considering whether i am busy at all. </p>
              <p>Recently I've taken to badmintoning for 1 hour and gyming for 1 hour everyday to slim down so that I can look better, so maybe he can remember me as a prettier person. But nothing can happen btwn us so I don't even know what I want...</p>
              <p>Worse thing is, I want to complain about everything online, but I do not dare, because if people find out my name I will really be shamed and might have a landslide of problems pouring down at me.</p>
              <p>I really do not know what to do, who to trust, and what I should do for life. Many a times I feel like just jumping down from the 25th storey, but I do not dare because of the pain...I am terrified of pain :'( and clearly none in this forum ever answered how to die without pain...</p>

              <p>You remind me of my stupid daughter. Same case infatuated by some stupid boy. No amount of talking from me about how premature her relationship with the boy will last. When I told her that I only got a girlfriend in University, she thinks I'm some stone age gay fuck.</p>
              <p>In short, you will live. Its just that you are too damn fucking disobedient and you got to suffer because of yourself.</p>
              <p>Don't dream about RJC lah. Once you got that fucking boyfriend problem be glad that you don't commit suicide.</p>
