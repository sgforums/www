            <div class='col-md body'>I won't lie.... I'll be perturbed if she tells me that she's had an abortion before. I still believe in that supposedly old-fashioned stuff about how you should save sex for your wedding night. I also believe that abortion is cruel and should never be carried out unless if extraordinary circumstances demand it.<br><br>That said, if all that happened in the past, and she is willing to put the past behind her, then so am I.<br><br>If I truly love her, she'll always be the one for me, no matter what her past was like. After all, no one's perfect..... I also have my own personal demons continually haunting me. If she can accept me in spite of my own past, then I can accept her past as well.</div>
