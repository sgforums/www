I was raised by my grandparents.<br><br>Not so good to switch too often. Although it all depends on the personalities of each child.<br>You need the children to get used to the helpers too.<br>I take about 3-4 months to get to know my nephews and nieces.<br>Each of them are unique , so it will take a while to really know their perks and querks.<br>When I had to leave them for a few months, some of them don't do very well.<br><br>Anyway, your baby will come home to you after work right ?<br>Your parent only take care during the office hours, right ?<br><br>So just tell your PIL that it is  hard work taking care of baby whole day,<br>your parent will take care of the baby during the day, at evening/night, your PIL handle. During weekend the baby will be at home where your PIL lives what.<br>This way, it will sound fair to your PIL. Also, your child will be under supervised care, you won't have to worry about their bad habits lor.<br><br></div>
