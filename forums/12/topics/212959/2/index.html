Go for a CLEAR HINT that you could be executing a break up if you're left with no choice (and that you love her and do not wish to do so - only if you feel this way)....<br><br>But that would be a 'prelude'. With no effect, break up should be executed shortly after.</div>

Sometimes I find my actions doing more than enough but I hope to play my very best part in my relationship.<br><br>she failed me badly, fail her part badly I think. I got only little love from her . I am not being stereo-typed her. That's her impression to me. We been going on steady for a year and 3 months. As days come nearer to today, I feel that our relationship is on the declining stage. I tried very very hard to save, endure ,withstand . Its catching on my limit soon .I am going to suffer a breakdown soon .<br><br>NO ! I didnt start this , there is no third parties, no related incidents. This is between 2 of us. It gets a hell lot complicated.  She started to <span style="color: red;">insult my parents in our quarrel using the F*ck word. She says there is nothing I can do to when she use this words !</span><br><br>Every little single wrongly white stuff I did, <span style="color: red;">She will yelled at me , in front of her family member and EVEN my friends.</span> I had enuff . She is challenging my ego and pride. Just simple little things, for e.g a detail which I did not asked to the Telephone operator , <span style="color: red;">she would yelled at me in front of her family</span>. I feel like an idiot . our quarrel will always end up in threatening to "BREAKUP".<br><br>Today , I am became rebellious. I began to show coldness to her, not carrying her stuff , talked the way she did to me in front of her friends . I got tired of it, I told her I am going off and went home alone without her and her friends.<br><br>I want to save the relationship, a lot of times, I gave in although its clearly not my wrong, not my mistake. I hope breaking up is not the ultimate option. But if it is, if it could benefit both of us, I will execute it.</div></blockquote>My friend, the areas highlighted in RED are serious. From the many replies you have gathered here, I will just add another telling you to move on.......yes, no need to explain any further or even salvage such a relationship, simply because it's NOT HEALTHY.<br><br>You have been nice to accomodate such behaviour &amp; being able to accomodate till such a level, i trust you can find a better one out there whom you'll have a more pleasant time with.<br><br>Best of luck <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>

Before faulting the gal, perhaps the guy himself have some glaring problems?<br><br>I am not offering any excuse for such behaviors, but I tend to like to reflect upon myself to see if I have the right to fault another person. Perhaps I am doing something that is very wrong too.<br><br>More often than not, I find my basic human instinct is wanting to point my finger at someone else.
