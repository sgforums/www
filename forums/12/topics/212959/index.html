I am not being stereo-typed her. That's her impression to me. We been going on steady for a year and 3 months. As days come nearer to today, I feel that our relationship is on the declining stage. I tried very very hard to save, endure ,withstand . Its catching on my limit soon .I am going to suffer a breakdown soon .<br><br>NO ! I didnt start this , there is no third parties, no related incidents. This is between 2 of us. It gets a hell lot complicated.  She started to insult my parents in our quarrel using the F*ck word.

I had enuff . She is challenging my ego and pride. Just simple little things, for e.g a detail which I did not asked to the Telephone operator , she would yelled at me in front of her family. I feel like an idiot . our quarrel will always end up in threatening to "BREAKUP".<br><br>Today , I am became rebellious. I began to show coldness to her, not carrying her stuff , talked the way she did to me in front of her friends . I got tired of it, I told her I am going off and went home alone without her and her friends.<br><br>I want to save the relationship, a lot of times, I gave in although its clearly not my wrong, not my mistake.

            <div class='col-md body'>The issues are quite straightforward. Do you see a future between the 2 of you?  Is keeping her as your gf more iportant than your self- respect?<br><br>If there's no future between you 2 as apparent from your description there isn't, then why bother to maintain the r/s? The girl obviously thinks that you are a weakling that she can walk all over you. (Your tolerating her behavior probably makes you a weakling in her eyes!) The more you tolerate, the weaker you are and it may not be surprising if she treats you the way she does because she "despises" you.<br><br>Come on, be a man! Regain your pride and self-respect by walking away from her. Don't even say anything and just exclude her from your life altogether, living your life without her to the best you can. She may start wondering why your 'weak' behavior has changed and change her attitude towards you if you earn her respect. If not, there IS no future between you 2 and terminating it may be the best way to redeem your lost pride and self-esteem which are invaluable.

I will back out and start finding new girls. Better girls. Life is too short to just focus on one girl. You just need a good one. When she asks for a breakup, you just say "Goodbye. See you around then." And don't contact her anymore. It's over. Can you imagine her to be your wife?<br><br>I think I say no more. Most of the forumers have given you the advice that I wanted to raise.<br><br>Let's do not talk about love anymore. She does not even have the basic respect for you and your pride. Where is your manhood? She is not even sensitive to others' feelings.<br><br>You are with a girl who has no respect, takes you for granted, no manners and worse of all <strong>does not love you</strong> Girls who love you will not find fault with you, period. She already wanted to dump you. It explains all the trouble you have been receiving from her, not to mention the insanity.</div>

That means you are begging. Women hate guys who beg. You have to show her you have a backbone. This woman spells of trouble. I believe you have the 6th sense to feel it.<br><br>Just back off and things clear up. What you are doing is creating intense pressure.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bro, what is think you should do is to have a talk with yr gf and tell her how u feel, things u dislike. If the talk failes, break lah. If u remind torlentant to her temper, u will suffer even more when u got maried. Just image u got married with yr gf, everyday nag at u asking u why come home so late? Why never call me? why this why that? Worst is she control all yr monthly salary. That what's happen to me friend. Every cent he earn was given to his wife and only given I think $400 to $500 to him monthly. So conclusion, have a talk, if fail, let her go.<br><br>P/S: Do both of u opened a joined bank account?</div>
