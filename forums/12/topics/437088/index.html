              <p>heres my stories,go to poly got gpa high enough to get COM,went to army got diagnosed with depressions.after army come out got local u and study.</p>
              <p>now currently not doing well in school,local u,especially when they required you to do a lot of independent learning,it doesn't even help that I do not have a single friend in school.I am a introvert with poor social skills and i am self aware of that.</p>
              <p>I am serious.I didn't attend freshman orientation.I know someone,but evaded him after his social circles got larger.first year do grp project already......went to a group people in a clique,group work not segregated properly,because i feel that they don't draw the line between friendship in a clique and project mate,could have seeked help,but regreted.What in the future I have to do grp project.What irks me the MOST IS that unlike poly your classmate aren't going to stick to you for the rest of your 3 years life,so you don't have the time to build up relationship with them.Do you want to experience class changing with different classmate every sems feels like.</p>
              <p>I went to the exam hall blindly,unaware of whats going to come.no one there during my semester,pointed out any issues or problem with my coursework or studies.because i had not a single friends.I cried when I flunked my first paper,I still tried not to get overwhelmed by my emotions to carry on to the second in the afternoon,i still struggled there and hang there till the ends.</p>
              <p>Trust me you know,the only reason people quit school is because they cannot find the right match of partners and friends in school.that the reason most people quit.If you got a chance to study,go work them out with you mentor or school counsellor.</p>
              <p>I continue tmr.</p>

              <p>University is like that one. Independent thinking, independent learning, individual notes, individual textbook. individual FYP, individual report. Your classmate is probably three months only for a module only.</p>
              <p>That's why poly student and army boys cannot survive in Uni. Because Uni stresses on indepedent, individual thinking. It is only me and me.</p>

              <p>Hi pal, </p>
              <p>I believe it must be very difficult for you.  I am also an introvert. But when I am in the crowd, I switched.  So, I can slightly understand the feeling of loneliness, but not fully, for I still have friends most of the time. </p>
              <p>I was from NP, but now doing my post-grad now, and most of the time, I am alone.  Most of my classmate are much younger, and I cannot mix well with them due to age, so yes, I do suffered like you, when I missed something, no one tells me.  I have my fair share of A's, and 1 failure (due to missing of infor).  </p>
              <p>But I will continue to move on, to achieve the goal I set off to do.</p>
              <p>I am not sure what to tell you, but logically, it will be good for you to clear your first degree.  In the mean while, try not to stay too long in front of the computer, but go out and play.  When I was young, I played games just to get to know friends, especially those sports that does not required a lot of individual skills, but just strength and guts, with a lot of people.  So in time to come, during training break, you will have one or two friends.</p>
              <p>Never stick to them, but try widen your scope.  Believe me, it helps. </p>
              <p>As for study, in any area that you are strong, volunteer to teach others.  people will appreciate it.  Share with them your knowledge selfishly, people will notice it, and in no time, friendship will be established. </p>
              <p>You need to learn social skills, painful as it is.  Life ahead is more cruel, but life can be fun and enjoyable too.  Cheers. </p>
              <p>I wish you well. </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>The only think you can do is to be yourself. You cannot change overnight. Try to make friends, start a conversation or get involve in group study. Listen to people's conversation and see if you can strike a common conversation. Sometimes, you feel a bit rejection when people look at you wierd or not being as friendly as you would like. But that is life. You need to take socialising step by step. If you want to be an extrovert, you have to take risks and be more thick skin.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Having said this, most important is to focus on your studies. You still young and have a lot of time. Use your time well. Don't let loneliness or depression get to you. Start to be more open, speak openly. That is a first start.</p>

              <p>Dude, deal with it, Uni is like that. Believe me, it trains you to be a better person because when you step into the working world, so you will not be so needy of people around you. Imagine your boss ask you to do something, and you start asking people around you how to do and help you do it, that is not the way.</p>
              <p>And dude, if you have problems with your coursework, you want your friends? Huh? If you got problems with your coursework, you find the professors. If you don't dare face to face just email them, if you don't dare to email them using your true email, just create a anyomous email, I have know people who did that because that just fear talking to the professors.</p>
              <p>I am also an introvert, I also did not attend orientation stuff and most of my time was alone and you know how I got through? I always focus on what I had to work with and stop thinking of how I wish things were. So what if my project mates keep changing every module, every sem, every year. That is not my goal, my goal is to get the grade and I will do everything necessary to get it even getting my skin thick to talk to people who don't me.</p>
              <p>Your mindset needs to change, if you keep thinking of how Uni life should be like your poly life, you are going to be forever depress.</p>

              <p>Join an active bonding CCA (e.g. dance, team sports). It is practically impossible not to makle friends there. You should also realise there will be individuals who organise outings, and you should take these chances to know more people - odds are you won't be able to know enough about others just by your daily studies.</p>
              <p>For your studies, pester your professors and tutors for help, ESPECIALLY if they already say that they offer help openly. Another thing is to keep an ear open for those who are near/at the top of your cohort, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">and who are willing to give a helping hand</span>. They need not be the first class, but you should at least be able to find a few second uppers who are willing to take out time to help out others. </p>

              <p>But he hides in the toliet and evade people he knows.Because he is too ashamed to let people know his results sucks and he has little social circle in school.He eats his lunch alone.He was stressed out during the lull period in between first classes of the day from preparation till the faciliator comes in to hear him do presentation.</p>
              <p>In classes,imagine you have to stay with them for the next 4 hours even though you cannot work with them.And feeling isolated all the time when the classes has no one to monitor.And pretend to keep busy and put on earphone since people around you are not cooperative.Seriously I find people in RP more stress out than people in uni because of social issues.</p>
