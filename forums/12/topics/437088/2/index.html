              <p>I tell u what happen to one of my friend in RP.</p>
              <p>Initially he went to RP first semester still ok.</p>
              <p>But he hides in the toliet and evade people he knows.Because he
              is too ashamed to let people know his results sucks and he has
              little social circle in school.He eats his lunch alone.He was
              stressed out during the lull period in between first classes of the
              day from preparation till the faciliator comes in to hear him do
              presentation.</p>
              <p>In classes,imagine you have to stay with them for the next 4
              hours even though you cannot work with them.And feeling isolated
              all the time when the classes has no one to monitor.And pretend to
              keep busy and put on earphone since people around you are not
              cooperative.Seriously I find people in RP more stress out than
              people in uni because of social issues.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Wah, your friend really sound like my classmate. Very quiet, always put earphone on, stay one corner. But he first sem already results like gone case, keeping in mind that we haven't even started on our core modules. Dunno how he will survive for the next 2.5 years.<br><br>I also introvert since sec sch, but I learnt that in RP, I have no choice but to start talking &amp; build up a working relationship. RP simulate working world liao, if got problem you can't run away from it, must face-&amp;-solve it. If you don't help yourself, how you expect your classmate to help you? I also noticed more participation in class (talk more) = upz one grade. I feel really drained in RP for forcing myself to talk more during class time. But in the end, I get my fair share of A daily grades :D<br><br>First step is hard, but the following steps get easier...</p>
