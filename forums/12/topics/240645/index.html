            <div class='col-md body'>"Whats wrong with you dude?! Why are you so negative?!" said my online frend.<br><br>I know of this online friend a few years ago, he was older than me, so I respected him alot. Due to our own personal thingys, we actually went in our own ways and only talked a little. Maybe this is the cause of the deteriorating relationship.<br><br>As I am a more pessimistic person, I usually think of the negative sides than the positive sides. So there was this issue that he scolded me for being negative, as I still respected him, I did not argue back and just keep silent and learn from the 'mistake'.<br><br>Just a few minutes ago, he told me he was getting Sony Ericsson Z610i for 200++(under contract or smth) as he bought mio. So I told him he got 'conned' because Z610i was sold only for $99 for student plan!<br><br>So he argued back to me saying that, he is not student, defintely cannot buy it what, so why tell me its $99?!<br><br>So I told him, you go buy out side 2nd hand brand new is even more worth it. (Sure have people go sign up as student plan, but sell it out for $$)<br><br>Worst of all I am co-operating with him on 1 website, and he just seemed very pissed of with me because I said he kana 'conned'?!?!<br><br>Now I don't know what to do.... haiz...i feel very pissed now oso...i think the website that we have is going to end its life soon too.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm not everyone would easily take such a straightforward reaction from you.<br><br>In fact, I remember one person who told me straight that I kena fooled by a offer, and that I was so stupid. Worse, this was coming from a person I least expected to call me stupid too. I was quite hurt with that person's comments even though I chose to brush it off.<br><br>Think, if you were in his shoes, how would you feel?<br><br>If you can't get it, here goes my explanation. I'll be frank here, you may come across as being very "yaya" (proud and egoistic) and sound as though you're deliberately insulting the person when you told him that, that's why he cannot stand you.<br><br>Next time, just say that he could have gotten a better deal, if you want to make it feel better for him, say that his was not too bad, and never say he kena conned or that he is stupid. Everyone makes mistakes after all. It'll definitely do you good to apologise to him.</div>
