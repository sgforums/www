            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by millienium_bear:</div><div class="quote_body">ya, had a sexual relationship with him when i was with my ex. ignorant and tempting that time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>agreed with your points.<br>no, i did not want that kind of marriage since he is still growing that time. a day before chinese wedding, i thought thoroughly to back out but no courage to do so. i might bring everyone in confusion and anger. i go ahead with it. frankly, my friends and relatives asked me why i look so unhappy when walking up to the stage during dinner. some of them knew about my problem.<br><br>once it is over la, i began to learn to love him. if not, things go out of control in future.<br><br>for the marriage, totally agreed with you. the pro counselling can help. i had bring up an idea but he just don't want. he don't feel good if he had one. i don't understand why he just dun want. what can i do? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote>Man don't feel good it is because counselling seemed like having to recongise being weak or unable to work things out - ego problem for a man.<br><br>I have to say one thing: You made a mistake, but you continued to move blindly towards it - you have no turning back. Mistake started when he had an affair with him.<br><br>Both of you needs serious heart to heart talk with one another. Problems lies within suspicious and mistrust - something that you cannot work out without communication. HE has to WANT to work out this marriage together with YOU. If not, it is like catching fly in the air - nothing works. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>What must be communicated?<br><br>He already stated that his only feeling for you is responsiblity - which is not love. Ask him whether he wants his marriage anot if he do not have this responsiblity. It is totally useless trying to preserve relation that the flame has already snuff out. If he doesn't want to work for this relation, but instead choose to run away and find other woman company. There is little you can do, perhaps other professional hotline may suggest some ways or method.<br><br>After that initial phrase, the next thing is that the both of you have to get matured. Stop all these suiciding, email mistrust all that crap. Both of you are already MARRIED, therefore act like one. If he wants to make this relation work - he has to stop flirting outside, gradually change his negative ways of doing. You have to make it gradually change, not immediately: things don't change overnight. and you have to HELP him change too. Guide him along and move along with him. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>For you, do keep a distance with your ex. I know you still have feelings for him but this is the route you chose to go. You have no turning back - regret isn't part of you and you must move on. If you should dwell on past - this marriage will fall because now you recongise this crisis and wants to solve it. If you don't want to: who else will? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>And for the BOTH of you: Learned to speak like a married couple of understanding and respect. Never raise your voice to get your message across: speak and communicate properly. Don't suka suka say want to separate want to divorce - Damn childish. The both of you are alright with it, yes no doubt. What about your children? (Noticed i used the word 'both of you' and 'your') Can they voice their view? NO!<br><br>My advice is still the same: Settle those issues I mention above and seek professional help. Cyber advice are only words you see and how you interpret: solid face-to-face are still the best way to counsel.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br></div>
