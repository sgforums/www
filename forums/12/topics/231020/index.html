            <div class='col-md body'>learned that one of the friend was a big liar. let's call this friend 'B' that was one year ago, act like nothing happen but couldn't get out of this recently. one year ago, this fren was chasing a girl, 'A'. as I close kinda 'close' to A and he found out, guess what he did. 'A' came to me and said this friend said I liked her from behind, and had tried to stop her and my friend together out of jealousy. I was shocked. None of it was true. I dunno why did he create a lie involving me.<br>Not only that, 'B' has big mouth also. Whatever I said to him that suppose to be the secret that I trust to him, I will heard back to with my own ear just within 1 day!. As got one time i told her i like 'C', ask him to keep it as a secret. 'C' then few days later gave a very cold shoulder to me, with the rumours flying around that I like 'C'. Judging from the incident about 'A', he might have added something. I don't think a girl will give a cold shoulder just because she knows that u like her?<br>There's one time I have jokingly tell him that I liked 'D'. must testing. true enough, just half day only I can hear another fren asking me back "U liked 'D' ha?"<br>This friend even had create a lie to me about a girl who likes to watch porn, just to create a bad image about her, where i first believe him, and later i found out it was just a lie. It seems that he likes to create a lie just to make a friend had a bad impression about a friend, some kind of his hobby. Kinda big mouth too.<br>Now, there's a few girl that he is close with will give a cold shoulder. I wonder if he is behind all this. there's are countless of event with I suspect.<br>While all this happen, he continued to be my very good friend like nothing happened. He said he had really keep the secret that I like 'C', where I had a friend, 'E', who already told me that 'C' was the one who told him, and 'C' told 'E' that I had told everyone that I like 'C' (just to make him feel freely to talk about it to everyone because 'i had told everyone myself, so it's not a secret).<br>Now, what should I do with this friend? Ignore him? Felt he is very dangerous, the more I am with him, the more not true rumours about me that was created by himself will reach another friend's ear, giving them a bad impression about me. His tactic was so advanced that I had believed what he said to me about others before, so it's most likely they will believe him. He's good at it.<br>If the majority think I should ignore him and break the friendship, i will follow. In fact, I feel like 'kenakan' him 'balik'.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ^mR.yellow^86:</div><div class="quote_body">    learned that one of the friend was a big liar. let's call this friend 'B' that was one year ago, act like nothing happen but couldn't get out of this recently. one year ago, this fren was chasing a girl, 'A'. as I close kinda 'close' to A and he found out, guess what he did. 'A' came to me and said this friend said I liked her from behind, and had tried to stop her and my friend together out of jealousy. I was shocked. None of it was true. I dunno why did he create a lie involving me.<br>Not only that, 'B' has big mouth also. Whatever I said to him that suppose to be the secret that I trust to him, I will heard back to with my own ear just within 1 day!. As got one time i told her i like 'C', ask him to keep it as a secret. 'C' then few days later gave a very cold shoulder to me, with the rumours flying around that I like 'C'. Judging from the incident about 'A', he might have added something. I don't think a girl will give a cold shoulder just because she knows that u like her?<br>There's one time I have jokingly tell him that I liked 'D'. must testing. true enough, just half day only I can hear another fren asking me back "U liked 'D' ha?"<br>This friend even had create a lie to me about a girl who likes to watch porn, just to create a bad image about her, where i first believe him, and later i found out it was just a lie. It seems that he likes to create a lie just to make a friend had a bad impression about a friend, some kind of his hobby. Kinda big mouth too.<br>Now, there's a few girl that he is close with will give a cold shoulder. I wonder if he is behind all this. there's are countless of event with I suspect.<br>While all this happen, he continued to be my very good friend like nothing happened. He said he had really keep the secret that I like 'C', where I had a friend, 'E', who already told me that 'C' was the one who told him, and 'C' told 'E' that I had told everyone that I like 'C' (just to make him feel freely to talk about it to everyone because 'i had told everyone myself, so it's not a secret).<br>Now, what should I do with this friend? Ignore him? Felt he is very dangerous, the more I am with him, the more not true rumours about me that was created by himself will reach another friend's ear, giving them a bad impression about me. His tactic was so advanced that I had believed what he said to me about others before, so it's most likely they will believe him. He's good at it.<br>If the majority think I should ignore him and break the friendship, i will follow. In fact, I feel like 'kenakan' him 'balik'.</div></blockquote>Majority think so? What you think?<br><br>Like you've said, your friend is dangerous and not trustworthy.. What would you wanna keep such a 'friend' for?</div>
