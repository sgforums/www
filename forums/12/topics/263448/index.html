Or what?<br><br>If you are talking about rebounding relationship...<br><br>You can see the guy or the gal tends to be very close to you at the start. They will do lovey dovey things to you that you might not know, you ask them - they most likely reply you "used to do it with ex". Also there WILL be comparisons from them regarding you and their exs.<br><br>The best part of the rebounded relationship is: after some time they start to get tired of you (not all cases but many to most) and you can tell they actually took you for a spare tire to fill their void.</div>

Over here?<br><br>I would say stay away from a relationship right after you break up with someone. Get together only when you are sure you have healed. Otherwise this person will always be, in your eyes, a replacement for your ex, or someone you are with just because you are hurting and lonely.</div>

(Though depending on who he is, this action might lead to consequences of its own...)<br><br>My personal take is that you just treasure whatever you've got now, return the love in kind just like in a normal relationship... Rebound, no rebound, the future.... Like I've said, how far can you really tell.....?</div>
