            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.<br><br>This is a really typical situation.<br><br>You need to make her feel good when you talk to her. And definately not feel/look needy infront of her, else you'll turn her off. Crack some jokes, make her laugh. <strong>Be CONFIDENT</strong>. You sound to me like you'll run into a wall if she asks you too.<br><br><strong>STAND up for yourself</strong>. Don't do everything she tells you. Remember to let her know you have your own will.<br><br>Yeap, that's it basically.<br><br>And yes, start calling her up instead of messaging. No matter how shy you are (i was really shy, and i realized that smsing just doesn't do the same magic as calling them up), just call. It helps if you can practice a bit with others girls, but you just have to make that call.<br><br>Take care, and hope to hear good news from you soon.<br>[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>slowly and take your time,let her finish her exams first then later ask her out again...if she agrees then that means there is still abit of chance for you...if she don't want to comes out with you after her exams ...then i think mostly chances are very low and slim...</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I suggest you lie low now and let her finish her exams. After her exams, try to sms her. If there's a reply, be relieved because she still treats you as a friend.<br><br>If there isn't..... well, I'll usually skip this sort of girl and find another. She probably had her own reasons for ignoring you.<br><br>My advice is still the same...let her know you better as a friend first, before you start making any plans on BGR. Only 2 out of 100 guys are lucky enough to get a girlfriend by declaring his feelings for her straightaway. Unless you happen to be 1 of that lucky 2, it's better to not to risk it.<br><br>If you are interested in her, you must treat her like an ORDINARY friend. Don't give her special treatment just because a) she's a girl, and b) she's also the girl you like. Believe me, girls don't like male acquaintances/friends to be too nice to them. They find it creepy.<br><br>What special treatment? Oh, it's all those things that you do when you're with a girl...namely the <strong>gentleman acts</strong>. Stuff like, offering to order her food for her, helping her to do things, being polite in front of her, opening the door for her, etc. I'm not saying that these gentleman acts are wrong, and that they don't appreciate it at all. It's just that it's not the <strong>right time </strong> to do such things.<br><br>You may think that you're being a gentleman here, but they might think that you're just a two-faced liar. Who would really believe that you're such a gentleman in reality?!<br><br>Also, you MUST NOT become her listening ear OR her best friend. Once you become her best friend, you will always be her best friend. Period. That's because girls have no sexual attraction towards their (male) best friends.<br><br>The first step you'll have to do is to make sure that the atmosphere b/w both of you is always light and comfortable. Why is this important? Girls, when they're uncomfortable with other people, will tend to clam up and become jittery. And they will certainly not choose a boyfriend who makes them feel uncomfortable.<br><br>By letting her feel comfortable around you, your chances of interacting with her will greatly increase. Like what _Aaron_ said, you can make some jokes or talk about non-serious topics with her.<br><br>Hope that helps.</div>
