              <p>ive been reading the forum quite recently and no doubt, everyone has problems, and i have too that i feel like, asking your opinions about it. im gonna make it as short and simple as possible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>im a muslim. i believe in what they teach. however, im not being a 'good' muslim. (btw im not gonna start preaching or discuss about anyones faith here. i respect in whatever your faith is).</p>
              <p>ive been drinking, i work in a place wherby i handle alcohol, not always tho but at times its unavoidable, thus, made me drink, even when im working.</p>
              <p>other than that, there is this particular thing, which i feel that, ive commited a really big sin. well, of course ive tried to change or prevent it from occuring again but, its hard. its tough. </p>
              <p>last few weeks, ive started praying. but my drinking "addiction' just wont go away, especially when im with my friends - chinese friends - colleagues. so a part of me says, f*ck it man. you'll eventually go to hell.</p>
              <p>well the point is here, i dont wanna live a sinful life. to cut it short, its pointless right if i were to pray and seek forgiveness from god, but i still end up doing things which are prohibited by my religion. i want to do good.</p>
              <p>so, i was thinking of giving back to the soceity. i was thinking maybe i could, set aside some of my salary, and donate it to those who need it more than i do. OR, i actually am really really interested in doing volunteering work. you know, like those cancer society or make a wish foundation and they make events for the needy or the less fortunate and they need volunteers and stuff - it is part of giving back to the society too, right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sometimes, i keep thinking whether i would even wake up the next day. so even if i were to die, i would have at least made my part by doing something good, whenever i can, even if i go to hell. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so, what do you guys think? and if you think volunteering suits best, where do i start? thanks guys. (and please dont talk about religion here. im bad enough at it so lets just think at it as an antheist, except you believe in good and bad, yin and yang, karma etc.)</p>

              <p>Bro,</p>
              <p>we are humans, whenever you do wrong come back to the right path. I am a muslim too i also have sins. Everyone have sins and we are living on earth, temptations is always there. Start slow, listen to your head, deep inside there is a better you. I am glad you prayed as it is the pillar of islam. If ever you need someone to talk I am around. Eight five 00 six nine seven three. Dont ever think that you will go to hell. Only Allah knows better.</p>

              <p>Bro, if you stop working in handling alcohol, you will stop your alcohol addiction. Fight your ''nafsu''. Example like during fasting month, you remind yourself not to eat/drink.</p>

              <p><br>Bro, i used to work in a place which i handle alcohol ... blah blah ... but yes there is colleague peers pressure.  It is how you handle it.  Yes some of them will say things to tease you or try to get you to drink, but as long as you stand strong, they will respect your stand.  <br><br>It is your own addiction - that you help, you are just using your colleagues as excuse only. No people know who is going to hell or not , even if all is going to hell - are you going to go there as a acholol addict ? Roads you have to choose yourself - not follow your friends.</p>
              <p>It is good to give back to soceity, and do good. But if you thinking that you do one bad, then doing a good will make it right ? - don't think it work that way .</p>

              <p>Dear I came with a sword,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If setting a side portion of your salary to give to charitable organisation and to help the less fortunate makes you feel better, by all means, do go ahead.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There is nothing wrong in trying to do some good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If possible, you can also do volunteering, whichever makes you feel better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You mentioned that </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>
              </p><p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">"other than that, there is this particular thing, which i feel that, ive commited a really big sin. well, of course ive tried to change or prevent it from occuring again but, its hard. its tough. </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">last few weeks, ive started praying. but my drinking "addiction' just wont go away, especially when im with my friends - chinese friends - colleagues. so a part of me says, f*ck it man. you'll eventually go to hell."</p>
              <p></p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">To be frank, it is so similar to my drinking problem, i find it very frightening,</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">I also have this problem, wherby I keep being forced to submit to peer pressure over and over again till I am miserable and unhappy.</p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;"> </p>
              <p style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">But I suppose life goes on.</p>

              </p><p>oops. cant delete that top post.</p>
              <p>anws,,</p>
              <p>to all the fellow sgforummers,</p>
              <p>thanks for all the opinions and i appreciate every comments given, even tho, it gets kinda humorous. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>well anws, first and foremost i would like to make things clear on the situation im at now.</p>
              <p>there was totally no such thing as peer presure on my friends part. i willingly accepted their offer to drink and there wasnt any, "hey, come la drink" or "you got p"ssy is it ah?". - im obviously not following my friends cause i do drink alone. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i know that doing "one good" wont really make that one "bad" any better. well, at least its better than nothing right? </p>
              <p>ive downloaded some application forms to be part with an organisation. was wondering whether anyone here in too or actually are already in one, any recommendations on which one to go to? im aiming to spend some of time to the needy childrens or those that needs help cause i think i can relate to them better.</p>
              <p>wait. something just struck my thought. (looking at it at a relgious and social pov)if, i, were to help those children, be it giving them moral support, or helping them in any way that the organisation wants me to do, but if i, myself, a muslim, not just a drinker but also a bloody sinner whom doesnt even obey the rules and commandments of such simple and most straight forward religions in the world, wouldnt i be a hypocrite? cause, those kids would look at me as a role model. but i myself aint doing the right thing. damn. </p>
              <p>am i just confused here or, doing good is, really not easy. </p>

              <p>like that who will go to hell?</p>
              <p>i do evil, so that i go to hell. becasue heaven's highway is always so damn crowded. a lot fo them their tickets is the coach to hell but they purposesly crowded heaven's traffic. so not automatic.</p>
              <p>anyway dont fake good dees lah, heaven's watching, hell's waiting. but before that year 2013 is coming, and it will be going again.</p>
