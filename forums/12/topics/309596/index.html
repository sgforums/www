              <p>I am depressed for being so single, and can foresee myself being left on the shelf for the rest of my life. Really envious of people who are good and healthy relationships. I am already in my late twenties and didn't engage in the relationship for years. I feel I have already missed the boat in finding a partner as most of my colleagues are married or engaged. I feel there is a stigma attached to singlehood. But I do not want to walk into a dating agency and grab anyone who fancies me. To me, relationship must be mutual.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So many people around me already talking about babies, mother-in-laws etc.I feel so outdated. And often get questions about when are you getting a boyfriend? getting married? you already not young, do not be choosy, etc etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sometimes, I do wonder if every woman on earth must get married. I somehow feel an unmarried woman has some inbalance in her life. Looking at some of the unmarried old woman I know, they seem to experience certain things like bad temper, insecurity, loneliness, defensiveness, extremely sensitive, etc. I just afraid I would end up being like that soon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many a time, I wonder what is wrong with me. I always feel awkward when I attend gatherings/ lunches whereby people talk about their other half. Usually people will find me pleasant , in other words, they think I am simple -minded, easy-to-please person. However, to the contrary,I am more opinonated and independent. Perhaps thats put people off. And after the first date, I didnt hear from the other party anymore. Then, again I wonder if i should act dumb, pretend to be agreeable to look more attractive to others, in other words act according to my looks. By the way, I am not even materialistic in the first place.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I just find it frustrating. Sometimes I think maybe when I hit the big 30, I do not want to socialise anymore. Everyone will be talking about partner/family issues which I can no longer understand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think I can make up part of growing singles, who are not welcomed.I already started to feel the stigma.</p>

              <p>There are lots of guys out there. Most of them unsuitable for you. Do not bother about the one that find you unsuitable for them. Its their perogative, just as you have your perogative.</p>
              <p>Its true, as you get  on in years, most of the guys are taken, and whats left are either gays or nerds.</p>
              <p>But there is still one gem out there, undiscovered. All you need is one, isn't it?</p>
              <p>Continue to socialise. Fret not. Be discerning. Do not be a "any dude will do" lady.</p>

              <p>Some people are destined to get married late. Good things are worth the wait....</p>
              <p>Singlehood is fun. You really get to do alot of things that married/attached people might not be able to do, becoz of their commitment. When you are single, you are only accountable to yourself for your actions.</p>

              <p>Dun be too pessimistic ya... I understand how u feel when someone dun response to you.</p>
              <p>It is not good to rush into a marriage. Just look at Lee NanXing and Yang LiBin, u know liao. Married so many years also ended up divorced and no kids.</p>
              <p>Being single is not the end of the world, just live it to the fullest. Just imagine all the monks and nuns have your thinking, will u think they are still alive today?</p>
              <p>Have a rational mind though i know it is painful to see couple holding hands and so on. Sometimes is better to wait then to rush into one. U never know when u will meet ur Mr. Right.</p>

              <p>Hmm actually i think the problem is often lack of 'exposure' and not giving yourself opportunities to socialise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A lot of people tend to settle into a routine once they start work, and more often than not, spend most nights in front of TV or computer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They feel that joining activities by SDU/SDS is like 'demeaning' but.. actually for a lot of their activities, if you keep in mind its just getting to know new people - not say desperately want to 'commit', i don't think it's a bad thing to do ba.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, most important, seeing many unhappy marriages and relationships - i always feel that if you can't meet the right one that you can be happy with, then better be single and happy, than married and tormented.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Be happy :)</p>

              <p>Don't think so negative about 'being left on the shelf'. There're many ladies in their 30s who are leading fruitful lives, even without a boyfriend.</p>

              <p>But if you chose to shut yourself up, no one can truly appreciate the character you are inside.</p>
              <p>Of course, you can always join the Singles Club, or any dating agency. They're a dime a dozen these days.</p>

              <p><br>I think you might have described your own problem there.... While independence is a character strength, being opinionated is not. You are of course entitled to your own views and opinion, but sometimes you must give and take. Doing so does not require you to "act dumb" and is certainly not a compromise of your own independence. It is just simple courtesy. State your views by all means, but do not be too pushy and expect others' conformance. Also, if you are too obstinate and conceited with your own opinions, you will come across as a petty, argumantative, uncompromising, and cantankerous person.</p>
              <p>I suggest that you talk to a good friend. Ask his/ her honest opinion on what he/ she thinks about you. They may be in a better position to help you reflect on your own character weaknessess.</p>

              <p>I am depressed for being so single, and can foresee myself being left on the shelf for the rest of my life. Really envious of people who are good and healthy relationships. I am already in my late twenties and didn't engage in the relationship for years. I feel I have already missed the boat in finding a partner as most of my colleagues are married or engaged. I feel there is a stigma attached to singlehood. But I do not want to walk into a dating agency and grab anyone who fancies me. To me, relationship must be mutual.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So many people around me already talking about babies, mother-in-laws etc.I feel so outdated. And often get questions about when are you getting a boyfriend? getting married? you already not young, do not be choosy, etc etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sometimes, I do wonder if every woman on earth must get married. I somehow feel an unmarried woman has some inbalance in her life. Looking at some of the unmarried old woman I know, they seem to experience certain things like bad temper, insecurity, loneliness, defensiveness, extremely sensitive, etc. I just afraid I would end up being like that soon.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many a time, I wonder what is wrong with me.

              <p>I just find it frustrating. Sometimes I think maybe when I hit the big 30, I do not want to socialise anymore. Everyone will be talking about partner/family issues which I can no longer understand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think I can make up part of growing singles, who are not welcomed.I already started to feel the stigma.</p>
