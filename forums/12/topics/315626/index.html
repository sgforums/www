              <p>"lostlostlost" was my colleagues when he lost his girlfriend.  While we tried to help him, I advised him to join Sgforums as I know there are many kind souls here will help him.  He was much better then.  I left the company 6 months ago and now I just heard he is in hospital in a coma.  His blood vessel burst at his back of his head and it had been two weeks.</p>
              <p>I am very sad and know not what to do.  I just hope those who had chatted with him and even met him will join me to pray for his recovery .. </p>
              <p>I just wanted to post here to let those who " knew " to at least know what is happening to him ...  sigh ...</p>

              <p><br>I don't know whether he spent time at bar forum but I knew he was really desperate.  You should see him when his girlfriend broke off with him...  he was so lifeless..  he is only 23 years old and I don't think he deserve all these..  he was very positive and that why I spent a lot of time trying to council him . .  he would had be fired from his job and I thought that would had been worst.   I refuse to let him go and that had caused a lot of problem at work place.   Anyway, I heard that the doctor need to cut a hole in the throat to help him breath ..  I haven't gone to see him ..   I don't know if I can take it ...   </p>

              <p>ur fren in icu unit? then  all the best to him.........................</p>
              <p>my mother was in the same simillar as ur fren........her cancer cells spread to the brain and then she fell in a coma....after tat we need to place her on life support...................................................</p>
              <p>never to wake out again<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/cry.png" alt="cry.png">...........................................she passed away last month<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>
              <p>i spend 2 weeks in the ica and witness 3 deaths..............................all of them very tragic and sad...i remeber a little girl tat have heart problem...............her mother was with her until the end..................................</p>
              <p>u should go and see him...............maybe his time is out already.........sorry but i dun wanna sound negative but..............u know those tat experience such serious condition some times they cannot make it ...</p>
              <p>so my advise is best that u go and see him</p>
              <p>check whether his condition stable anot???</p>
              <p>ask docter hows his chance of survival...................and lastly maybe u could offer his family some sort of support???</p>
              <p>because..........during my spend in the icu unit.....can see tat when people see their love ones suffering tat time....is the time tat they needed support....</p>
              <p>sometimes medical bills can be expensive.............my mother spend abt 60k in icu..............so maybe u could help his family finanically?????????</p>
              <p>i think tats all....but in my opinion its best tat you go and see him.....as there are very limited ways in which u can help him..................because he is all on his own now...................good luck and all the best to him</p>
