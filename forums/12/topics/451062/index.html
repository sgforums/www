              <p>All my life I have felt lonely &amp; tired. Not when I'm alone, but when im amongst the crowd, in groups or amongst friends. In spite of my preference for solitude, i long deeply in my heart for some1 who understands. I thought that there might be something wrong with me. Even 1 <strong>girl</strong> that i liked commented that i might be crazy from some of my actions.</p>
              <p>I tried identifying myself with various groups of mental disabilities, but couldn't find the similiarities. Today,  i went through a cluster of vids on youtube of people with <strong>Asperger's syndrome</strong>(something less well known on the end of the utism spectrum)<strong>. </strong>A spark lighted up in me. So please anyone with Aspergers, i wish to meet you. I am not a diagnosed Asperger, i just need some1 who understands, i just need to find out. thank you.</p>

              <p>Dear topic starter, ignore the ignorant replies above, for you are a special individual. There are many online communities for Aspies, which you can find via Google. One of my JC friends is an Aspie and although he was weird, he had an amazing personality. I wish Singaporeans would learn to be more accepting of people with physical disabilities and special needs.</p>

              Poor thing. You have no problem just that too lonely. Loneliness can lead to depression, which in turn lead to disillusion that you are sick in the head. 
              
              Go out and make more gal friends and see which ones are suitable. Only with a companion, your life will be filled with smiles again.

              <p>Hi watergate,</p>
              <p>You most likely <strong>don't have</strong> asperger syndrome from the way you wrote.</p>
              <p>Asperger syndrome is an in-born disorder. Asperger syndrome have difficulty relating to people. They don't mind loneliness but you don't want to be lonely. Aspergers have trouble knowing what is love in the first place, but found interest in a girl. Aspergers mind their object of interests more, but you longed to be understood by humanity. These traits gather enough evidences that you <strong>don't have</strong> asperger syndrome.</p>
              <p>You might want to browse through <span style="text-decoration: underline;">OCD</span> symptoms to see if there's any similarity with your actions. You should try browse through <span style="text-decoration: underline;">anxiety disorder</span> too. There're <span style="text-decoration: underline;">several types</span> of OCD and anxiety disorder so be sure through browse them. There's not much info on your post, so I can't tell. You <span style="color: #800000;">may have</span> an undiagnosed mental disorder. Or you <span style="color: #0000ff;">may not</span> be having any of these in the first place. You should see a psychiatrist for a proper diagnosis. Seeking info from internets will not make you discover your condition.</p>
              <p>Do not listen to some people above because they chose to be ignorant on mental disorders. If you like to know, over 20% local population have a mental disorder ranging from mild to severe visited mental care help. People do not chose to be mentally ill. Seeking help through proper channels is the right thing, than doing nothing and get advices that doesn't help you. Mental disorder doesn't mean they're 100% disfunctional either. 100% disfunctional only applies to extreme cases. Mild to severe cases are common. They can only be functional in certain environments which normal people take granted for. From some of the posts above, you can see how people take granted on their normal lives. They have that mentality of everyone is the same like them without consideration of other difficulties.</p>

              <p>Hi watergate,</p>
              <p>I am sorry you do not feel quite fit in on this planet. It is tough to feel loneliness deep from the heart. I hear you. Your topic is a good one. It shows how many people are ignorant about the sorrow of others. Generally, most people are uneducated when it comes to mental illness. I do not know if you have Aspergers but even if you do, you are still a special person, authentic and glowing at your core. Mental illness is just like other physical illness. Do not fear, there are people out there who struggle and walk through hell and still survive. I had been there.</p>
              <p>OranDe made a very thoughtful reply to your thread. Do more research and talk to people (online, if that makes you comfortable) about Asperger's and other illnesses that you suspect you might have. Just research, do not dwell on it. I would like to recommend you a support site where I am a regular, www.experienceproject.com. It is a global side where people from all walks of life and continents share their stories anonymously, on every single topic.</p>
              <p>I understand your desire to be diagnosed and find out the facts. I wish you well in your journey of discovering yourself. Please be well.</p>
