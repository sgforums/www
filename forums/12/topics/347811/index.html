I wanna be a hot babe, n i desire to dress up skimpily like them...in those short minishorts, spaghetti tank tops, n pretty slipper shoes or high heels. N put on makeup n have nice soft silky hair. N i wish i was pretty like them, had a slim hour glass figure, nice sexy long legs.</p>
              <p>I always think how nice it would be if i was a girl...i could dress up in all sorts of nice n sexy clothes...put on makeup n beautify myself. How i wish i was born a girl instead.</p>

              <p>how old are you? might be puberty</p>
              <p>unlike wat bryanw says, i don't think you are a woman trapped in a man's body. the fact that you still envy gals' hot figure shows that u are just like a normal guy who lusts after gals, which is perfectly normal. woman trapped in man's body only lust after men.</p>
              <p>i think u are 1 of those guys when yr sexdrive start becoming super super active, and u are probably driven 'crazy' by curiosity over what sex is and how the female private parts look like. </p>
              <p>at the end of the day, you are so driven by this urge and curiosity that you want to be a sexy woman because you want to see and feel what is exactly underneath those mini skirts, bras and panties. (and not because you really want to be a woman)</p>
              <p>my solution for you is to mix around with more girls, or even get a gf if possible, helps u kill those unhealthy urges</p>

              <p>I am a straight guy, 100% straight, i am attracted only to
              women.</p>
              <p>Whenever i see hot babes in the shopping mall, town, school
              campus, public places...i am attracted to her beauty n sexiness, n
              of course i check them out, just like most hot blooded guys my age.
              I check out their slim n long legs since many hot babes in
              Singapore like to wear short minishorts or miniskirt. N their
              nice arms n shoulders in their sleeveless tank top.</p>
              <p>But then at the same time, i envy them. I envy their sexiness,
              beauty, figure... N i often wish that i could be like them....that
              i was one of them.</p>
              <p>But wait a minute! I'm a guy.... that doesn't sound right i
              suppose? But somehow i just can't help it... I wanna be a hot babe,
              n i desire to dress up skimpily like them...in those short
              minishorts, spaghetti tank tops, n pretty slipper shoes or high
              heels. N put on makeup n have nice soft silky hair. N i wish i was
              pretty like them, had a slim hour glass figure, nice sexy long
              legs.</p>
              <p>I always think how nice it would be if i was a girl...i could
              dress up in all sorts of nice n sexy clothes...put on makeup n
              beautify myself. How i wish i was born a girl instead.</p>
              <p>N now i have strong urges to go n purchase some female clothings
              to wear. But then i tell myself i am a guy, it doesn't sound
              right</p>
              <p>I can't stop these urges though...Am i weird? Any of u guys have
              similar thoughts like me? Am i even normal?</p>
              <p>please help me out....sort out my feelings n identity. I am
              really confused now...i think i need help.</p>
