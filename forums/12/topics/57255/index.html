Let me tell you your scenario happens to virtually almost all relationship (90%). All relationship will walk out of honeymood period eventually, regardless of how much attempt is to hold it. Under Love Life Cycle, good relationship generally stay within the growth stage.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Its NORMAL for people to 'slack' gradually as their relationship advance - because motivation isn't as strong as previously when he has to chase you.<br><br>Try to find life outside your boyfriend. One of the top few rules to maintain a good overall relationship is to have life outside your partner, for who wants a mate to be dull and so dependant on him/her? With decent social circle outside him, he has to constantly prove and motivate himself to work towards this relationship, which is doing good for you love.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In theory explanation, the Law of Diminishing Effort state that partner will do minimal to upkeep a relationship, while maintaining security. If upkeeping a relationship and still feeling secured in your relationship means sms thrice a day against once in three days, if both still bring about similiar effect - he will do the latter. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Being in a BGR doesn't signify anything. More effort must be work through to see it blossom. Have a good talk with him and let him realise this point of you. Communicating your thoughts effectively is one of the first step you have to do, at least allow him time to get to know the real you, instead of exploding one fine day without him knowing what's wrong. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: sillyme's advice is exactly what I wanted to say as well. Check it out - its a good way to spend your time.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yixun,<br><br>Just as it takes both hands to clap, both parties are equally responsible in a relationship. Most of the time, problems arise due to some miscommunication. I'm also saying that although u may hav contributed to the constant quarrelling, your bf is just as responsible to this contribution. Recognise the factors that lead to the quarrels, if not, having a good talk with your partner over the problems is definitely not a bad idea.<br><br>As a reminder: Running from problems only relieves suffering for a while, but they would come back only to cause more. Solving problems while they are small is best, and it helps to develop relationships.<br><br>All the best.</div>
