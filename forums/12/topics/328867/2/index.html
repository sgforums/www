              <p>okay so here's my story..</p>
              <p>i dated this senior of mine for half a year before he asked me
              to be his gf and i of course, agreed..our journey of love together
              lasted for about two and a half years before we went separate ways
              due to a stupid and childish misunderstanding...it wasnt actually
              this misunderstanding that caused the whole break up but probably
              accumulated anger and resentment towards each other. he deleted me
              off his msn list and we never actually stayed in contact ever since
              then.</p>
              <p>after the break up, he still reads my blog everyday but i dont
              know if this was because my blog was 'nice to read' or that he
              wanted to be updated on my life..for me, i thought of him everyday
              and ways on salvaging this relationship....till now, after 9
              months, i havent fully gotten over him...all i wish is that one
              day, he would be back by my side again...</p>
              <p>then a miracle happened, recently..he contacted me again, saying
              that he misses me and realised that he still loves me after so many
              things happened..</p>
              <p>we eventually patched and went out together, on the same
              day.</p>
              <p>we held hands, we hugged, we kissed, we displayed our affection
              for one another almost like nothing happened and that we have never
              left each other for 9 months. we were just like any other loving
              couple on the streets of orchard road. but after we went home that
              day, he told me that his feelings for me arent as strong as
              before..</p>
              <p>the next day, he said that its better for us to stay as friends
              as it would be very unfair to me....i appreciate his understanding
              towards my feelings but i really hoped that we would be together
              once more, i believe that this is just a temporary feeling and if
              we were given more time, we would definitely be like in the
              past..afterall, for an ex-couple to be together again after 8
              months without contact and still claiming that they love each other
              is quite miraculous..</p>
              <p>personally, i feel that a love like ours should have never
              ended..</p>
              <p>so whats your take on this? is it just wishful thinking on my
              part? any suggestions what i should do? thanks a lot.</p>

              <p>Does he really love you? Or is he just bored and want a partner?</p>
              <p>I am sure you can feel it whether it is love or not...</p>
              <p>If it's love, go on...<br>If it's not, let it go...</p>
              <p>Another advice, some guys can make a girl fell in love with them and making the girl feel that the guy love her but in fact the guy just want a partner...<br>So ask your heart carefully... Is it love? Or are you manipulated instead?</p>
              <p>Time tells, leave things to fate.<br>If you both ain't for each other, you'll never be together...<br>If you both are for each other, you both will be together naturally...</p>

              <p><br>Do let him know that you wish to be together with him again and let him make the decision.</p>
              <p>If he gave you certain terms and conditions in order to be together with him again, it is up to you if you want to agree to it or not. For me, I would imagined love is never about placing restrictions, terms and conditions or even promises. So I won't accept even if I still love him, if I were you.</p>
              <p>Love was free before both of you were together and it should still be free when both of you were together and it should still be free if both of you are to be together again.</p>
              <p>Do not wait for miracle to happen to you, instead take many initiatives to allow many miracles to work for you.</p>

              <p>LOL!! JOKE!!</p>
              <p>from a guys point of view (me), the problem is not with him but you. the answer is simple, but you choose to cling to this "relationship". BGR is between 2 person not one.</p>
              <p>the guy wont care if u really love him or what when he has no interest in you anymore. you can cry you can scream or hang urself but i believe he wont care for the 1st 2, but if u try hanging he might. juz kidding~~ =x</p>

              <p>but isnt it kind of logical too if he says that he loves me, but when he went out with me, he feels that the feeling is different from the past and thus in order not to continue any further sufferings, he chooses to stay as friends first..</p>

              <p>Actually it all comes down to what kind of a guy he is, his sincerity, and how much you trust him. Anyone here could be giving the wrong advice so its always more important to trust your own instincts.</p>
              <p>If he was one of the 8/10 Singaporean guys (just a rough estimate based on my group of friends aged 20-25) I would say he's just feeling empty/lonely and decided to look you up again. Do you know if in the past 9 months he had another girlfriend? Or if he went after another girl or got rejected? Maybe he's comparing his previous relationship with a new girl he likes and he asked you out to confirm his feelings?</p>
              <p>But of course he could also be the other 2/10 guys who genuinely meant it when he said he couldn't get over you and he really loved you and he really did care for your feelings when he said its not fair to you.</p>
              <p>Just my 2 cents. Good luck</p>

              <p>i <strong>think</strong> he was asking himself whether he he still loves you anot before he ask u out again, and i believe he hasn't found it yet until he tell u "no we cant be together". he might wanna feel the good old times again you see. aiyoh~~</p>

              <p>there is one slim small tiny little chance that he's really really genuinely feeling that it's unfair to u..</p>
              <p>and when u do an approximation, equates to zero..</p>
              <p>if he thinks he still loves u.. especially after that outing, do u think he will be so caring and thoughtful and think "wah i want her back, but like that unfair to her leh.." meh?</p>
              <p>of course not.. just put urself in his shoes! now that YOU are wanting him back, did u for a moment think that it's unfair to him? unfair to him that after nine months, u want to be with him?  i doubt so.. so why on earth do u think he will be feeling guilty and understanding?</p>
              <p>there are two reasons why he is saying it's unfair to u..</p>
              <p>1) he's not certain how he's going to treat u in the future, good or bad..</p>
              <p>2) he's just lying thru his teeth and just wants u to accompany him when he needs it..</p>
