            <div class='col-md body'>to add to wat lex had said ....<br><br>One of my fren's mother once said this,"Learn to take care of yourself first before you try to take care of others"<br><br>Well, i believe that relationship is dynamic. It can't be static. It will either move forward or move backwards but it will never stay where it is. So if you feel that your r/s is not progressing, it is probably getting worse.<br><br>How to maintain a relationship ? Truthfulness is the most important criteria. Effective communication is next.<br><br>There are some simple things that u can do to spice up the r/s :<br><br>a.  send him/her cards. Even on April Fool's day. Best is to make your own card and please try to be creative. If you know that she/he is down, you can send him a card too. There are many reasons to why you can send him/her a card !<br><br>b.  buy him/her presents. Simple presents, not expensive ones.<br><br>c.  talk about your dreams and plans for the future.<br><br>d.  go holiday together, a new environment can rejuvenate a r/s<br><br>e.  dun always go out alone with him/her. Ask frens to join in, sometimes you'll have a lot more fun this way. For example, do sports together.<br><br>Hope these help.</div>

This is really subjective. It depends on a few factors :<br><br>a.  how busy both are with their personal life (ie study/work/family)<br><br>b.  personaililty of the person (some are more possessive than others. We are all possessive, just at different extend)<br><br>But one thing for sure, once you find that the both of you have been meeting up too often and it is getting a bit boring/nothing to say ... good to see each other less (like from every 2 days to every 4 days). Dun mian qiang stick together just becos you are a couple. It is just going to harm the r/s.<br><br>Secrets ....<br><br>It all depends on wat type of secrets. Sometimes we do not possess the secret alone. For example, your close fren tell you something very personal about him/her and now the both of you share the same secret. Such secret should not be shared with your bf/gf otherwise you'll be breaching the trust your fren has on you. Unless you got permissoin from your fren.<br><br>But if it is your personal secret, then i think it is ok to share. But dun share secrets for the sake of sharing secrets, really stupid.<br><br>I believe in truthfulness. 2 persons must be truthful to each other to make a r/s works. So if there is a *need* to share secrets, i will not hesitate to do it.<br><br>One more thing, the extent to sharing secrets also depends a lot on the level of r/s you both are in. Dun tell me the both of you are attached only for 1 week and you spill all your secrets to him. It is plain foolish.</div>
