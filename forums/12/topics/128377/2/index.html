I thought I can get along well with her in the first place  but things doesnt workout well, she's so so conservative and very unappreciative and very selfish and very uncooperative and not understanding you see, so no matter how hard I try to please her it's not easy and she always talk about money money money whenever we or I myself visits her or talk to her on the phone.<br><br>And the probs. with my husband, he really don't like to visit my parents and so I'm the only one who is visiting them and of course my parents will nag and ask about him all the time and I was like duhh.. don't know what to say already.  And he thinks he can afford to pay all his mother's bill but in the end we all suffer, he's not rich and he cant even give me the financial support properly..<br><br>I thought if he's married to me he supposed to settle our problems, our problem comes first.. but now since his mom always call him up and ask for this and that it's like she's trying to snatch him away from me... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br></div>

Not only will you feel much better after talking, you might get some insight on how to solve your problems.<br><br>After you have a clearer view on the situation you're in, you might not be so frustrated at the people around you. And also, you would be able to pinpoint the areas they might have done wrong. In doing so, you can do something to rectify it.<br><br>I think that by then you will have the confidence to talk to your husband or family members or inlaws without getting discouraged easily. You will also be able to speak better because you know what to say and what you want to do.
