Apply leave and dump everything and disappear do not tell anyone. Switch off  hp. Take a trip alone to find yourself again. Works for super stress people.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>2) method 2<br><br>start helping others, like going to old folks home doing something useful.<br>At least it gives some purpose in life.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>3) method 3<br><br>Super hack care, live for yourself why do you always worry about others when they never care about you?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>4) method 4<br><br>The D word. Do not really want to use it as it is the last card to use.

I understand you are just here to complain and to destress and you know in your heart there is nothing you can change.
