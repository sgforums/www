You should put the past behind you can continue with your life with your BF. No guys like thier GF to keep bringing up tis past, esp if his past is not a present one.I am sure you will be piss off if he did the same to you. I think as long as he is faithful to you and love you now and the future, then it should be alright. You must remember that it is your relationship btwn him and you now and not his ex and him.A good relationship should only consist of the 2 involved parties and no one else.<br><br>May Happiness be with you 2.<br><br>BrenBren</div>
