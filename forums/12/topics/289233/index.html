His fur was all in patches too.<br><br>Then I brought him back, smelly and all... housed him in my doggie's cage. He became best friends with my dog and was so kind to her - even though she always liked to hump him, all he did was just to walk away. He only scratches things and never people or animals.<br><br>From a bag of bones he grew to become an obese lardball who loved to stroll into the living room and collapse into a pile of fats rolling around on his back.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> I am sorry. The answer from what I know is yes. When animals are in pain or dying, their instinct is to hide so that predators won't sense their weaknesses and hurt them. It is a self protective instinct that concides with their death.<br></blockquote>^^ from other forums.<br><br>it's quite weird as<br><blockquote>In all liklihood, the owner of indoor-outdoor cats will eventually face the sorrow of having a cat turn up missing. However, the chances are (for good or bad) that your cat did not run away. Cats are very territorial (even the neutered ones) and will defend their territory at all costs, and if driven out by another alpha cat who is bigger and meaner, will seek safety indoors (if allowed that option) before running off. The truth is that the chances are more likely that a cat has been unwillingly removed from the area, injured, or killed. </blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I thought it was part of their nature to disappear? (And I have the impression that they are born-ingrates.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> ) My family used to keep stray cats in the house but each time, after a few months or so, they would ran out of the house and vanish from our sight. The last one we kept tried to "escape" and even managed to get to the first floor (We're on the twelevth) somehow for a few times, but we always managed to find it hiding at some corner of the void deck until its last attempt.<br></div>
