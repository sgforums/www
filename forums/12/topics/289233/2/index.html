(thankfully, they have always returned, even if they come back a bit bruised, dirty or ill) animals tend to make us smile in a way other humans can't, because we to pretend they really understand us.(since they can't speak), and those that are not so emotionally attached to others cannot understand why a pet means so much.<br><br>i'm sorry for your loss, but you should make space in your heart for another pet or something(and don't feel guilty about "replacing" him, because you're not)-you'll be benefiting another homeless cat! i have heard torture stories, and these cats really, <strong>really</strong> do need homes. :/<br><br>anyway, have a few good nights of crying (preferably while listening to sad music), eat some bens&amp;jerry/haagen daz (no cheap ones, they don't have the same effect) ice cream right out of the carton... all those girl stuff. lol. i don't know what guys do, but the girl traditions have been passed down for so long and are really damned effective.<br><br>take care.</div>

But I can't get over it. I always believe he's still alive somewhere, but I just can't find him.<br><br>I loved him sooo much. He was the best pet I ever had. Cuddly cuddly, silly but brave. So many stray cats have come and gone in my backyard, but I just completely stopped being able to feel any sense of attachment to any of them.<br><br>It's already been a year plus, but I still end up in tears every time I think of him. And I feel extremely guilty about it, because if I didn't 'fall sick' last year, if I didn't neglect him for a few days, he would probably be still around. What if he's alive but has become a skinny, starving cat (he used to weigh 5kg)?<br><br>If he would come back home, I wouldn't mind giving up 50 years of my life.<br><br>I miss my cat so much and my heart aches so much.

I don't think it's because you fell sick and things happened - it appeared more like your bonds with this cat has ended naturally.<br><br>/me pat pat Mookie. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
