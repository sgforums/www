              <p>your logic of it sounds strange and misleading but i  had come across this type of psychotic woman before. They are usually high flyers in their careers but failures in their personal lives. They cannot get a man because no normal man wants to marry such a high status woman ( which is different from a wealthy woman) due to fear. it is i think more about their dominating character, temper and outlook in life. At least wealthy woman are still normal woman who can be demure and sweet <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">( like my wife)</span></strong> and i guess most man want them too. Added benefit.</p>
              <p>After some point of time, this sort of woman usually after 35 years of age tends to get frustrated and vent their anger on all men and some younger women become their worst victims.</p>
              <p>One of my close friends had such a lady boss before and he says she is nastier than any male superior he had encountered in NS. A complete psycho and she absolutely hates the younger female subordinates who are pretty and sexy.</p>
              <p>This kind of abnormal woman is preferred by abnormal man who have a fetish for things like BDSM</p>

They can also be found doing nothing at home or just touring around in places like Orchard and Sentosa. U happen to meet them by chance. They were pretty common in the Orchard area in the 90s, either single or married.</strong></p>
