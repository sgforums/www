              <p>Its reputation as a stable, affluent society and the close affinity in culture, skin colour and food has made Singapore a special choice of Vietnamese women.<br><br>MOVE over, China ladies; hello, Vietnam! In their dependency on foreign brides to correct a marriage imbalance, more Singaporean men are turning to Vietnamese women in recent years.<br><br><strong>But this growing marriage bond has become mired in controversy and charges of exploitation that are earning Singapore’s image a black eye.</strong><br><br>For years, the city-state has gone on a global binge on almost everything in life, including the institution of marriage.<br><br><strong>With educated women rising, a marriage gap has been building in Singapore between a small army of middle-aged, less-educated men and independent-minded women who shun them as spouses.</strong><br><br><strong>Some 40% of marriages in Singapore today are with foreigners.</strong><br><br>Last year, 6,520 male Singaporeans and permanent residents married foreign brides, the highest number in 10 years, according to the Department of Statistics.<br><br>Yet, one out of three citizens does not have a spouse and some 30% of the men are wife-less.<br><br>These social statistics are quite sobering for Singapore and are building up into a huge dependency on foreign spouses to keep life in b alance.<br><br>The biggest numbers still come from Malaysia and China.<br><br>But in recent years, the Vietnamese women are making up for lost ground. Many of them are flocking here – and to other Asian cities – seeking a better life.<br><br>“Many of them take a tremendous risk marrying foreign men – some having met for only an hour – so they can send money home to their families,” said a marriage agent.<br><br>Vietnam is famous for beautiful girls and obedient, hard-working wives, a contrast to their more Westernised, educated Singapore sisters.<br><br>The exact number who arrived is unknown. One unconfirmed report said that between 2000 and 2006, the arrivals had risen by 42 times.<br><br>Singapore is very small compared with bigger markets like South Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia, and China in the transnational matrimonial business.<br><br>But the republic’s reputation as a stable, affluent society has made it a special choice of the Vietnamese women, despite the language obstacle.<br><br>A major reason is the close affinity in culture, skin colour and food.<br><br>For every Singaporean who goes to Ho Chi Minh City to find a wife, there are thousands of women who want to come here.<br><br>Aired over TV, an 18-year-old Vietnamese girl was asked whether she would marry any Singaporean and she nodded her head. “Will you marry someone even if he’s 60?” Her reply without hesitation: “Yes.”<br><br>The practice of paying for a bride has raised anger in the West and among Asian liberals who say Singapore – with clean, transparent advocacy – is condoning trafficking in women.<br><br><strong>A letter signed by more than 1,000 Vietnamese appealed to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to stop some of the 30 Singaporean agencies offering “certified Vietnamese virgin brides” for sale.</strong><br><br><strong>A human rights office in Ho Chi Minh also protested to Lee about this “shameful form of modern-day slavery”.<br><br></strong>Those in support argue that arranged weddings or dowry payments have always been part of Asia’s traditions.<br><br>Even modern weddings still involve some exchanges in cash, red packets or in gifts (either jewellery or ceremonial lavishness) demanded by the bride’s parents.<br><br>“So why is the idea of a brokered marriage through an agency so wrong?” one representative asked.<br><br><strong>The answer lies in the undignified, inhuman way many businesses are advertising or parading Vietnamese girls (86% do it to get out of poverty) in their premises like they are selling branded shoes.<br><br></strong>The economic crisis has delivered a sharp blow to the practice, resulting in further insults.<br><br>One outlet advertised a half-price discount – from S$8,000 to S$4,000 – for the prospective husband.<br><br>The supply of cheap, virgin brides from hard-hit countries seems inexhaustible. Cambodia has banned marriage brokers.<br><br>Vietnam, however, can’t stop its poor, rural families from “selling their daughters” as long as poverty exists.<br><br>However, to stop the exploitation, the Hanoi government is considering setting up a government centre to handle the marriage of Vietnamese women abroad.<br><br>An estimated 15,000-20,000 Vietnamese do so every year. On the positive side, the families often get a better life, or have debts repaid or may receive a steady allowance from their sons-in-law.<br><br>In one Vietnamese island nearly every peasant – or his neighbour – has a daughter who is married abroad in an Asian country.<br><br>There is also another downside for the Vietnamese. The average Singaporean man who is seeking a bride in China or elsewhere has a high-educated profile today.<br><br><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">One agency said that five years ago, its clients rarely had more than a secondary 2 education. Now, seven out of 10 have at least a bachelor’s degree.</span></strong><br><br>This doesn’t appear to apply to Vietnam, where the “husbands from Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore are often older, unskilled workers who are unable to attract a woman back home”, said a Hanoi official.<br><br>That would imply that because the price is so affordable that more of the elderly bachelors in the state are making a beeline for the women there.<br><br>As Vietnam gets richer, the number of its women willing to be sold into marriage will drop.<br><br>But, as a British Telegraph columnist wondered, what would happen if the UK were to slide into prolonged recession, and economic power continues to shift to Asia?<br><br>“I wonder if 10 or 20 years down the line, (whether) it will be British women coming to Singapore, Beijing or even Hanoi to find a rich Asian husband,” he quipped.</p>

              <p>If those men want to widen their choices to include the Vietnamese, is that wrong?</p>
              <p>They are using their relative wealth and status, but is that wrong when they do this in choosing a bride?</p>
              <p>It happens in all setting, a man is supposed to use his status.</p>
              <p>There are a lot of dating sites or dating agencies. Those in Singapore, for locals, are also using the same principles basically, the men have to be educated and earn some money.</p>
              <p>When you date someone, if you are a guy, you are supposed to use your status to attract women for potential marriage.</p>
              <p>I dont think we should be so crude to say they "buy" the brides, because it is almost the same like in any other dating setting.</p>
              <p>The only problem I can see is that since there are big money involved and an agency involved, there might be some cheating or other problems.</p>

              <p>what is the diff? Sg girl also say " i love u" because of your money. No money , then divorce u. In 2004 the no. of divorce went up because of money related issues. I think local men who choose overseas bride are clever becuse even if money is involved, it is the same thing and foreign bride is more likely to stay than return to their country as conditions there will be worst than SG. They rather choose the lesser of the 2 evils. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Indeed, this type of woman will be more willing to work hard to keep the marriage than ruin it. This puts off stress off the man as he can go about his life without worry</span></span> I tell from expereince because men do the same too and also many men tend to compare their wives to those of other men. ... <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I have a very pretty gorgeous wife from wealthy family and i try hard to keep her , making me more hardworking in trying to keep up the marriage.</span></strong></p>
              <p>SG woman do not have any qualms about divorcing u because they aint going anywhere. They are just spoiled brats who got everything handed to them on a the silver plate, cover their nose when NSF sitting beside them on the bus and give a F5cked up persona like Xiaxue and plastic surgery Dawn Yeo. And btw they are not anywhere as beautiful as foreign brides, so why waste time on them?</p>
              <p>The chinese community in Sg is screwed when it comes to marriage but somehow strangely the indian and malay communities are still doing fine.</p>

              <p>At most times, my analyses are correct. But Sg woman are good at pretending but when their real intentions are uncovered, they are poor at masking it. Most of them want a glamourous lifestyle especially graduate women. (not all but some), cant do housework or even cook.</p>
              <p>They dont have a F5cking clue that men are at a disadvantage in singapore because we are lagging behind females in education and work expereince due to the nagging NS duty. They refuse to accept this situation and i think social education is necessary for them.They should be more accomodating ad humble than expect us to shoot right up there straightaway after ORD.</p>
              <p>Men now are more educated and more clever than before due to affordable degree education now . They also dont need arrogant graduate women. They only need beautiful face, figure and boobs.</p>
              <p>Arrogant graduate women are the result of false elitism and improper upbringing by their parents who have no time for these kids to spend with</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I can safely say in 50 years time: There will be more single old women than men out there .</span></strong></p>
              <p>But most sociologists say that the high rate of cross-marrying, which is reminiscent of pre-independent Singapore in the 50s, brings glad tidings for Singapore's stock. <br><br>Social Darwinians would say it adds depth and diversity to the nation's small pond and widens its genetic pool. THE question is: is no babies a worse consequence than arguably genetically less-endowed babies?</p>
              <p>i dont see any wrong in this foreign bride thing as it arks back to the old days where my parents and their parents were forced arranged in marriage. They still gave birth to us and have not separated. This time it is just a bit different as both parties are willing, the matchmaking agencies earning profits and the govt intention to boost fertility rates</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Who are the losers here- IT IS THE SG WOMAN.</span></strong></p>

              <p>What you said about the Chinese community here is quiet true. But you ask any one of them, they will deny it. Self deny is a bad thing to begin with. But the funny thing is when u look at the Chinese community across the causeway, they are relatively more traditional, more close knitted than us. </p>
