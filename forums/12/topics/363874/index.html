              <p>Accountancy is a very dry job and if you like to interact with people, accountancy is definitely not for you since all you face are numbers and figures and many accountants don't work for long due to the stress of the job.</p>

              <p>seriously... do what you like to do. Look into yourself. What can you do on hours at a stretch without feeling sick and tired? Can you do that for at least a year?</p>
              <p>I'm an accountancy grad, stayed 2 years with a big 4 co and now working as an accountant and will be getting my CPA soon. I picked this route cos of the money and it's kinda fast track given the high pay increments in big 4 (not anymore in this economy though).</p>
              <p>I work day in day out, tried to rationalize why i picked this path but i would still suffer from bouts of depression time to time. In the end... I was never really a happy person. Yes, I am making more money than most of my peers but I always feel suffocated in this industry. I don't feel any passion towards my job and it sickens me to realise that I am wasting my precious time on nothing. I am now making plans to get out of the rut that I've landed myself in.</p>

              <p>Hi Meowme</p>
              <p>I thought i was passionate about my chosen path but in the end... it was something carved out of figments of society after years of conditioning. It is only when you are actually in it and doing it, that you begin to realise otherwise. Hope you dont fall into the same trap as me.</p>
              <p>Practically speaking, having a degree in accountancy or ACCA allows you to work as an accountant and progress along that line. i.e. finance manager, FC, CFO.  CPA is an additonal qualification required for you to sign off accounts as a public accountant. It does give you an advantage over non-CPA holders in the finance sector but it really isnt required. However, if you are intending to work overseas, holding a CPA gives you higher recognition and advantage in the foreign firm. CPA is an internationally recognised qualification in accounting, and you learn boring accounting standards and taxation. </p>
              <p>CFA is not really relevant to accountants as it is deals mainly with investment related subjects. This route is for those wanting to be stock finance analysts.</p>
