            <div class='col-md body'>Now that i understand why the term 'Lame Pigs'. I really appreciate that you bothered to reply my post and explain the situation you're in. Even though you don't owe me one. Thanks.<br><br>Maybe you come across a person that have good working attitude, but poor interpersonal skills.<br>I agree that it's sick to see people doing their fair share only and 'watching' the busy one drown in his/her work.<br><br>I still believe that if you're in position which is useful to them, they'll definitely see you in different light. Respect and help comes along.<br>Let's face it? In worklife, we value another by our own means.<br><br>You have my respect on that, you don't want to bootlick your boss/supervisor/superior.<br>I've seen many of these people personally, they didn't climb the Corporate ladder. But have gained much respect thru the years.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>
