I am going to the party because for my friend took the effort to invite me...I'm going there for my friend's sake...nobody else. If I chat up with someone, it's a good to have...If I din chat with with anyone, at least me being there is a form of me showing  my friend that i appreciated his/her gesture of inviting me.<br><br>Shift your focus from yourself towards your friend...it's difficult but it's not impossible.

When you tell yourself that you donÂ’t deserve something then you donÂ’t. It really is as simple as that. What you tell yourself is true.<br>Stop all those sick thoughts and tell youself to be positive.<br>If need be, you should go to the mirror and speak to yourself.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Please be responsible of your own life and take charge of it.

But it seems that you're having a very <strong>Individualist</strong> thought here, may i just gently remind you that you may not be right?<br><br>Lame pig is a extreme and self opinated comment esp onto another of your fellow colleague as well as human.<br><br>All the best to you when you're hired to do big things. I still have to say...if in small things, you don't have the social skill. When big projects/resposibility comes. Don't expect skills to start popping out in your brain overnight.<br>Unless you're confident that you're the man who has it all.<br><br>P.S - 'Hate' is a term mostly used by negetive/inferior thinking people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>know why i used the word 'lame pig'.<br><br>my colleagues always grumble about how hard a time they are having wif massive work load and shortage of manpower. but when i came up to their area everyday i see them chit chatting and talking away. not once, twice ( i call it coincidence), but everytime.<br><br>when i ask them for some help in doin some simple things for me in private - they say they busy. but when they are unsure of stuffs and wanted me to step in to shoulder or back them up - i did no matter how busy i was at that moment. the funnier thing is in front of our immediate superior when i purposely asked them for the same help again ( and i expected so), they agreed like talking to their loupaei (father).<br><br>now i know why they always complain about no manpower distributed to our department and against our top management - giv them too many help so they can hav more time talking away?<br><br>i am not being individualistic. things can be done. the only obstruction is getting people to perform they share of the work as a whole.<br><br>i am not being individualistic again but i hate making people happy so that they can work for me.<br><br>i do not see the reason for so. i get pad, i perform y fair share of the work. my bosses do not have to sweet talk me, go to bed wif me, invite me for lunch or dinner to make me work.<br><br>no offence coz this is my 'individual' point of view.</div>
