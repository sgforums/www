            <div class='col-md body'>Hey.. I'm also from NUS and I also don't have any close friends in NUS but that's ok for me. 'cause I think it's also a way of life in NUS. Due to our module system, every semester we meet new people so it's very hard to get to know someone. For me, I don't care. I just move on alone and I'm ok. I don't even join any club or society.<br>Always keep in mind that " You may feel lonely sometimes but you are not alone". There is always someone who cares about u. For me,I don't have my family here 'cause I am a foreign student but I have one close friend who is not from NUS, so whenever I feel stressed out, we meet up and talk. So, u see, don't be sad about not getting friends in uni. u can always find someone outside to talk to about ur feelings and problems. Uni counsellor can also help u. U can go and talk to them and seek their advice.<br>Cheers<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Remember that u have someone who is in the same boat like you, it's me! It's also a way of life, just accept it and move on... u'll be fine... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
