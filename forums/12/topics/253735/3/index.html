Is it simply a matter of not having a common interest? Or is there more to what you want in a friend?<br><br>In the abovementioned, you mentioned something about not ever having been close to guys. You've effectively ruled out half the population (and I'm assuming the gender divide of those you come into contact with is 50-50) if you do not seek to proactively befriend a person just because he happens to be a guy. Subconsciously, could there be other issues that actually hold you back from befriending someone whose interests or beliefs actually counter yours?<br><br>In all honesty, if you aren't going to change the mindset like the one above, I don't see how much your life's going to change - joining activities and <strong>passively</strong> expecting others to ask you along isn't going to work in the long run IMO. It's time you became more proactive if you're bothered about the lack of company.<br><br></div>

Easier to make friends that are like-minded<br>And don't worry about turning into another Cho. He's got some psychological problem from what I've read... That guy doesn't respond to anybody, even his family members...<br><br>Maybe instead of waiting for your gang to ask you out, for lunch etc, you can take the initiative? Like after lects and tutorials, ask them if they wanna have lunch together. After class go catch a movie or something?<br><br>And try to take some cross fac modules? Like CS1105 from SoC. The tutorial class is quite interactive and there's a couple of group assignment that I'm sure you can make some friends with. And don't worry about not having someone to take with you. You can try to ask your group of friends to take the module with you and even if you don't have, like me, you can always just show up at the tutorial and get absorbed into whatever group that's there.<br><br>What about friends outside of NUS? Your circle of friends need not be restricted to just in school<br><br>Don't worry too hard about not making any friends. In due course, I'm sure you can make some, it's just that NUS is not conducive for introverts to make friends</div>

I am not in NUS, but i have friends who do, and it seems to me that they too have few friends they can speak of in NUS. They were the kinds that were extremely popular and friendly during JC days, so it couldn't have been them.<br><br>Joining Hall activities is a way of making friends, but the TS seems not to want to make friends at all in the first place.  Like I said in 1 other thread, sometimes, all it takes is for u to take the initative, rather than trying to wait for people to call you. For instance, a simple "Hi, wanna meet up for coffee or something?" will do wonders, trust me. Its possible too to join in a group of people who already have cliques. All u have to do is make the first move. Don't be afraid that they may find u irritating or a pest who wanna be part of them. Be urself, and I'm sure people will like u enough to wanna include u in their grp, and activities.<br><br>TS, as for ur family, I think you should try to spend more time with them. Its lack of communication that is hindering u from knowing and bonding with them. Try to talk to them, ask them how's their day, how's work, and talk about TV shows, movies etc. Don't think that u can't click with them, and hence keep ur distance from them. One fine day, you will regret not knowing ur family better when they are no longer around.<br><br>University life, or life in any school for that matter, should be filled with fun and happy memories. If at the end of ur course, all u can think of is how glad that you have finally gotten out of Hell, and how u do not have much friends from there, then its pretty sad. Life is how u make out of it, and I of course cannot stop u from leading the current life u have, but won't u wanna know if there's a chance of leading another type of life, the type where friends, family and happiness fill ur life? Its all up to u.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey TS,<br><br>Open up man! =)<br><br>You definitely need more friends. I was more or less like you back in secondary school days. But eventually as I came to JC I became more extrovert from a total introvert. Then just when I thought all was well, I came to Uni....<br><br>Let me tell u a bit about myself. I am not a Singaporean. I am an Indian (from India doh..) But been here for like 9 years now. So its really hard to tell me apart from a Singaporean now. I speak like one, I eat like one and I shop like one. Hehe.. Yeah anyways, since I'm not a Singaporean, no NS for me. And hence I go immediately to Uni unlike all my guy friends from JC who went to NS. So there I was in Uni (NTU) in a faculty which is majorly guys (computer engn) and I had no known face AT ALL among the 450+ people!! By the way, I'm a guy.<br><br>But now I have just finished my NTU life and I am sad to say I am gonna miss it terribly. I found my clique on the first day during the first lecture itself. And by the end of my NTU term, I know most of the cohort! Many because of the group projects and stuff.. Also many because you see them so many times in lt/tut that u will someday end up smiling and saying hi to them <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>First year itself I joined NTU Astronomical society and was in it's main committee for 3 years of my uni life. Its one of the best things to happen to me =)<br><br>You just have to make yourself more approachable. How? Well to start off you can try chatting with your lecture/tutorial mates (doesn't matter if they aren't your good friends) about anything under the sun OTHER then studies.. Like others said, you have to find a common interest matching with others first before you can "take off" with them. I am sure you watch tv, or listen to music or follow the news or anything like that. Just try starting off conversations regarding them..<br><br>Don't worry babe! U will slowly make friends. Anyways, you can add me in your msn if you have one. I am more then willing to chat with you regarding anything under the sky any time.. =) I'll pm u my msn bah.. =)<br><br>Take care!</div>

(and pls dun worry, i'd never even think of pulling off a stunt like that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> ) but apparently he stayed on campus and even shared a room with pple, yet he was so isolated... i think in the end it's really me that needs to change my behaviours, otherwise no matter how many halls, clubs or societies i join, pple will still be leaving me out... and speaking of Cho, when i heard about the sort of person that he was and how isolated from others he was, it dawned on me that i'm also lonesome like him... just not twisted and psycho, but definitely isolated, especially in nus... ok lah, i'm not as bad as that, as in when ppl talk to me i do try to smile and be friendly, but they're all the "hi and bye" type like some of you said... and yeah,in uni, it's normal to have lots of "hi and bye" friends like some have said, but at the moment all of the pple that are talk to are that type, and there aren't any close friends...zero <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  I can't remember the last time i ate lunch with other pple, but i remember thinking that lunch is so much nicer with company, and that i really took for granted all those regular lunch buddies from sec sch and jc...<br>and yep, being lonely is possibly a good thing, i'd have more time to concentrate on my studies, but now we're having vacation, and it's really been plaguing my thoughts... and the Cho thing also scares me; i dun wanna be like that <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br>maybe i'm just thinking too much since it's the holidays, maybe it's part of being an adult like somebody said... being lonely..sorry if i sounded immature/ low self-esteem that day; was crying and not thinking properly... i'm not sure what to do now; on the one hand i could try to keep occupied with sch/work and just forget about this; on the other hand if i ignore this problem then possibly nothing will change, and i'll grow old all alone and i'll die with noone at my funeral...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </div></blockquote>I think........ you think too much....<br><br>what will happen in the future, we don't know. Why spend your mental energy on it and scared/worry yourself with there possibilities that might not even happen? It makes no logical sense.<br><br>It is good that you are awared that you need to change your attitude for the better. It is good that you are learning from this lesson and learn not to take things for granted.<br><br>I feel you should learn to appreciate and love yourself for who you are unconditionally too. There are all sorts of people with unique personality traits in the world. Apprecitate your uniqueness and others too. There is nothing wrong with you not laughing at your friend's jokes. On the other hand, there is also nothing wrong with their lame jokes that you can't bring yourself to laugh.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was somewhat like u back in my NUS days (damn, i miss those days)...<br><br>2 things I would like to comment on.<br><br>Firstly, don't close yourself off to restaurants and travel, especially travel. I guess you have not really experienced DIY / backpacking travel to far away countries before have u? Personally I live for such trips, immersing yourself briefly in a totally alien place... seeing and learning stuff u never knew you never knew about yourself and what u see on TV... its an undescribable feeling. I was hooked when I first saw my vista towards the Arc De Triomphe in Paris, the first time i felt the embrace of sea breeze to the sound of waves crashing on sea cliffs at the 'end of the world' in northern scotland, Running my fingers on the 2000+ yr old stone walls of the Coloseum in Rome etc.... Its a visceral feeling, like connecting with a part of human history and nature... the essence of being alive in this world. If after such an experience you are still unmoved, then I can;t say anything....<br><br>Secondly, it sounds like you maybe should have joined another CCA. My best memories in NUS were almost exclusively from my CCA. I was in a performance group, i joined purely out of interested, but i left with lifelong friends (with whom i still get together and jam with), and most importantly.. a wife!!! I know how it feels having difficulty opening up.. but if you find your real interests and partake in them, it is a very effective catalyst for making friends.</div>
