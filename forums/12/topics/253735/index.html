            <div class='col-md body'>Don't feel so sad. You still have 3 years in NUS so you should have no problem finding friends that share the same interests as you. Don't mind me asking what CCA did you join? Maybe you can be more proactive and ask people out or just kindly remind them to include you in their activities. Have a happy mind and always think positive then you wouldn't feel so lonely. I'm also from NUS so if you have any problem maybe can just find me haha.

Likewise, you should source for the same kind of friendship in that sense.<br><br>It's a vicious cycle - the more you reckon that people don't involve you in their activities or cliques, the more withdrawn you become. In that sense, you are the one that push people away, subtly, from you and not vice versa because everybody would be thinking that you prefer isolation but in actual fact, you don't.<br><br>And of course, the mind would take its defensive stance to protect itself, by believing that you do not 'need' them to survive in order to justify your rationale.<br><br>To evolve, you must take bold steps in implementing those changes.<br><br>i) Seek for self understanding. Do this exercise: jot down all your strength and weakness, likes and dislikes and include the things you are interested to pursue/learn/do.<br><br>ii) Seek for interest. By understanding what you like, you further yourself by pursing things that would generally make you happy and passionate about. The easiest way to make friends is when people have similar interest. And conversation is made easier in that sense, the initial scope of topics can revolve around the interest.<br><br>iii) Seek for acceptance. Understand that there are things you may not fancy, however, seek to understand that people are different. But being different doesn't mean you must project an extreme aversion to them. Walk in their skin and learn to see from their perceptive. In general, be more accepting to the people around you and at the same time, keep an open mind.<br><br>I hate cigg smoke, but that doesn't mean I avoid making friends with smokers. Seek to understand the importance of freewill and people's choice - accept the way things worked.<br><br>P.S: Welcome to the community of SGF - many have made lots of friends here.
