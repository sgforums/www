And now i keep discovering that people that i see in classes and cca,pple i used to know in sec sch, are organising outings and they don't even bother to ask me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> but anyway it's not like i really enjoy their company... and i keep getting the feeling that everyone in nus looks down on me, cos i'm not very outspoken/glam/popular.<br>i'm so screwed. why do i not like doing the things that other people like to do? it seems that people in nus like to eat at fancy places,  plan trips to hongkong,europe, etc. somehow i find that these things very extravagant, take up a lot of money, but not meaningful, or fulfilling... and i don't feel excited about going to europe,etc, yet all around me people seem so cheery about it. i don't get it! are they just being fake, and pretending to be excited, just to seem interesting? Or maybe travelling the world and eating at fancy restaurants is a joy that only rich pple(more than half of nus) can understand? Even with the money i earn from my vacation jobs, even though it's enough to do those things, i don't feel any excitement about those activities. i'msosad <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> And speaking of vacation, this must be the worst vacation ever, cos i've got no friends to go out with... just work,work,work. and my family, although they are bearable, there's just no common ground for me to be close with them, we're all so different...<br>maybe there's soething wrong with me, maybe i should go see a shrink...<br>nowadays i just feel that life is so meaningless. is it possible to die from loneliness? as in loneliness of not having friends... see i'm so sad and lonely, i don't even care abt getting a boyfriend, i'd be happy just to have a few nice pple as close friends... what do you think i should do? how do i find nice pple to be friends with, when everyone i know doesn't seem like my kind? maybe i am too gloomy a person... if i had the money i'd leave the country and start afresh, cos' there's nobody here worth staying for. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br>P.S. sorry for the extremely long post.    </div></blockquote>Hi,<br><br>Why not try to bridge the gaps in your family first ?<br>Get to know your parents more before it is too late.<br>Understand, communicate and care for your sibilings or cousins?<br><br>In a way, i was like you once.

            <div class='col-md body'>hi, thanks for all the advice, was really eye-opening... i think i should follow some of them, like being more proactive and asking pple to go for lunch, outings, etc, and talking to pple sitting next to me... and i should probably stop going around with a sad face, cos it makes pple think that i don't wanna talk to anybody <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  also i hould call up old friends, esp those who are in the same course. (sorry, i'm not in computing, i'm in engin... maybe that's why i'm so lonely, cos it's mostly guys... when i was in sec sch it was an all girls sch, and in jc my (few) buddies were all girls... i've never really been close friends with guys... hmm, maybe that's what i meant when i said that i feel like an alien)<br>but i dunno about some of the other suggestions, like joining hall and more clubs and societies... cos when i joined my current cca, it wasn't just out of interest, but also to meet pple, but now it feels like pple are leaving me out... and about hall, it's possible to join hall and still be lonely, just look at that Cho fellow.. (and pls dun worry, i'd never even think of pulling off a stunt like that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> ) but apparently he stayed on campus and even shared a room with pple, yet he was so isolated... i think in the end it's really me that needs to change my behaviours, otherwise no matter how many halls, clubs or societies i join, pple will still be leaving me out... and speaking of Cho, when i heard about the sort of person that he was and how isolated from others he was, it dawned on me that i'm also lonesome like him... just not twisted and psycho, but definitely isolated, especially in nus... ok lah, i'm not as bad as that, as in when ppl talk to me i do try to smile and be friendly, but they're all the "hi and bye" type like some of you said... and yeah,in uni, it's normal to have lots of "hi and bye" friends like some have said, but at the moment all of the pple that are talk to are that type, and there aren't any close friends...zero <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  I can't remember the last time i ate lunch with other pple, but i remember thinking that lunch is so much nicer with company, and that i really took for granted all those regular lunch buddies from sec sch and jc...<br>and yep, being lonely is possibly a good thing, i'd have more time to concentrate on my studies, but now we're having vacation, and it's really been plaguing my thoughts... and the Cho thing also scares me; i dun wanna be like that <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br>maybe i'm just thinking too much since it's the holidays, maybe it's part of being an adult like somebody said... being lonely..sorry if i sounded immature/ low self-esteem that day; was crying and not thinking properly... i'm not sure what to do now; on the one hand i could try to keep occupied with sch/work and just forget about this; on the other hand if i ignore this problem then possibly nothing will change, and i'll grow old all alone and i'll die with noone at my funeral...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Many people come into our lives at different stages of our lives. We meet different people almost everyday. Life is like a bus ride, different people will board onto your bus almost everyday. But, who will be the one to stay in the bus eventually? In addition, who will be the ones that will still be with you till the end of your life?<br><br>I do have new friends when I am in a new environment. Friends have newer friends; might even grow closer to them and further away from me in a new environment. And I accept that. And grateful for that because there's someone there to keep them company, to keep their smiles and laughter the same as before and I do hope they are grateful for my new friends too. But at the same time, I treasure every moment with friends I don't often see anymore yet still adore and cherish. And if at any time, they'd stopped making attempts to keep that friendship from becoming stale, I accept that too.</div>
