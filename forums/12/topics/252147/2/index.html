This is not on the topic of intelligence whatsoever. You justifying his intelligence is already out of point. As i said in my previous post, this is the issue of him(the principal) ISOLATING a RACIAL group.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why cant student stand in a principal perspective and see what went wrong?<br>Students nowadays are abusing their so-called 'rights'. Working with ppl who got more 'rights' than him puts him in disadvantage. May I know what rights does a principal have now?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a JJC student too. I do not like the frequency at which he mentions "I will expel you; I will sack you; I will deport you; I will fire you". He may mean them as threats or perhaps not, but I certainly do take them as threats. Plus, we are debating this as a person, a citizen of Singapore. Not student against principal.<br><br>And regarding the "voluntarily causing harm" thing, if I interpreted it correctly, what the person who posted it is trying to say that it is voluntary when the principal hit the chinese student, therefore it is not a crime. Penal code 92 mentions that it is an offense to voluntarily cause hurt for any other purpose other than to prevent death or hurt. Therefore, it is a crime for the principal to hit a student unless it can bring the student back from the brink of death. Then again, you may mean something else.<br><br>My personal opinion is that he should change the way he does things. Then again, this is just my 10 cents, my 2 cents is free.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>And regarding the intellectual thing, if he had been that intellectual, he would have intelligently avoided such a controversial comment that many students of all races felt was racist.<br><br>The impression that his speech left on me was that: I do not like the Indians, I do not want to see them together again. These are far from the exact words, but it is the impression that it left on me.<br><br>I do question many of the things the principal does. I even have doubts on how JJC attained the good pupil development award (something like that). The way i see things, the 'leaders' are forced to impression guests. Behind that curtain are multitudes of threats.<br><br>Then again, these are just one person's views. It should not be taken as information agreeable to everyone.</div>
