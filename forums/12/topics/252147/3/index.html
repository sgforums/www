Please try to appreciate his role as the head of a school, shouldering the responsibility of the education of nearly 2000 students.<br><br>N i wana rebutt those who make comments bout jj leaders! U dont know all the effort and hard work all the leaders put in to make our camps and activities a success! we dont stay in jj just coz we want to be wif our friends, we r not tt superficial. but coz we like the sch.<br><br>I m open to any thoughts, feelings, rebuttals, comments etc. I not defending my P, i find him kinda peculiar, just want to defend my sch.

            <div class='col-md body'>hi, i'm oso a J2 student in JJ too. Well ,sometimes he may make some comments that r quite offensive, but let's face it , he did make some improvements in the sch. however , he 's not doing himself a favour by scolding the teachers and the students together in the morning assembly. sure , the teachers in the sch may be young , but to scold the teachers in front of the students is quite disrespectful towards the teachers, plus there is a time and place to scold the teachers- contact time. he ought to be mroe tactful with his comments.<br><br>for example, this morning when he called that blogger up, what did he wanted to show? did he wanted to show that wat the blogger did was wrong? or did he just want to assert his power?<br><br>in all, i feel he shud improve on how he present the situation to the sch population, or else i'm not surprised if one day the teacher's start complaining to the teacher's union...<br><br>this is my honest opinion , if he does pick me up for this , i don't mind but it will show that we as students does not even have the freedom to debate on such issues</div>

Whenever the school has money, he would spend it on the student body. He never raised his voice against his students irregardless of the extend of the student's wrong-doings. He talks to them, discuss issues with them and none of them were repeat offenders. As such, he is very, very respected, revered even. He now has a team of at least 150 strong ex-students (around a quarter of the graduated cohort) who graduated last year doing things voluntarily for the school.<br><br>It is how the principal portray himself to the student body. Appear to be a tyrant and people hate you. Be nice and people will cooperate and you won't have to spend so much time with disciplinary issues. It worked for my principal, I can only assume it could have worked for jj.

However, put yourself in our shoes and maybe you'll know why there are so many complaints against the principal. Even though I know whatever he said is for the good of the college, I am in the opinion that he should be tactful when it comes to rules and conduct. (He tends to get a bit carried away when berating students.) By tact I meant when he touched on sensitive issues like races and world affairs like terrorism. We are afterall, young, impressionable teenagers. His comments would have hurt some people and gave the wrong impression to others.<br><br>Students maybe or ARE in the wrong, but respect is a mutual thing. Having done wrong, teenagers (going to be young adults), we are able to differentiate what is wrong and right most of the times. Thus, given the chance, I'm sure we are able to amend whatever wrongdoings that we may haven done. We are humans afterall. We make mistakes.<br><br>Therefore, I conclude that: 1) The blogger here is right on some points, but should not go behind the principal to complain about him. 2) Respect is mutual and it should be earned. Therefore, both the student body and the principal needs to practice this; in students respecting the principal's decisions and questioning them only when it seems too unreasonable and against laws; Tact should be practiced in the latter's case. 3) We all make mistakes. Giving each other chances to change for the better isn't a sin.</div>

If you should say that his negative outweighs the positive, then seriously we've overlooked his contributions and took alot of things we hav in our college now for granted...<br><br>if you dislike the way he does things, then remember and not repeat the things he had done which you think is wrong... not all people showcase their glamorous sides to the student population, and if he doesn't want to show the student population the friendly side of him, that's his choice...<br><br>if the forumers doesn't know, the P practically pioneered the idea and raise the funds to build a new block called the people development centre...<br><br>if you think life under him is bad, i think u can ask former jjc-ians before 03 batch... my bro is from 02 batch, and he really agree that what P did is good, and it shows in the progress of jjc as a jc...<br><br>that's my 2 cents worth...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>just move on. why bother to look back at the past?<br><br>if you guys want to challenge that blogger, i dont think you all should. and i guess it might be a lesson learnt not only for the blogger, but also the school body.<br><br>just a reminder for all J2s, 194 days is what we have to endure. get back to studies, dont gossip so much. A levels is just 173 days away, remember? and let's just go study, especially the leaders. dont screw your academics up. i know the talk this morning is hard to swallow, but let's move on. don't blame the j1s or ourselves for what they or us have done that has troubled the whole school. period.<br><br>and i wish everyone all the best. let this matter rest. F| or jason please close this thread. thanks.</div>
