I agree, looking through from your point of view, it kinda sucks, but you gotta look at it in another way. The thought counts and 400 bucks for just a wallet is a lot. Just the same as spending thousands just to get a tv. At least they remember your birthday. My parents don't even know mine haha but it's ok cos I also don't know theirs haha..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think there is a gap between you and them due to the distant and time of seperation. Try to communicate more with them and see how they handle things. The value of gift is not a measure of love, is the thought that count. Maybe a word of 'I love you', 'How are you' or 'I miss you' are more meaningful than expensive gift. You can stop buying expensive gift for them.<br><br>Just to share with you, I am more happy when I received gift that I like than expensive gift. This indicate that the giver has been paying attention to me and knows what I need or want.</div>
