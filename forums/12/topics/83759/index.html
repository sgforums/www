            <div class='col-md body'>Technology was their match-maker. In college days, she already noticed him because he once said that his hamster died and he teared to mourn it. She felt he was so full of luv, so caring, even towards a small little animal. She was touched, she consoled him. 2 years later, she was studyin overseas, he was in ns. Again they communicated thru technology every single night.<br><br>Perhaps it was the inital loneliness in a foreign country that made her come online every night. But he was online too, to company her, play games with her, chat with her, and to make her  happy. Soon, their companionship and teasing grew into thinkin more and more about each other, missing each other. They got together, a long distance rlnship and spending a month physically together every 6 mths.<br><br>After ns, he was busy with his studies but he still kept his promise of companying and chatting with her every night. When she went back to sg during her hols, they went out together almost evry day.<br><br>He was not rich, his mum is puttin all her hopes on him for a better future, so he has to do well in his studies. She just want to be with him. She pays for him most of the time when they are out but she doesnt mind. $$$ is secondary to her. He just wants her to be happy.<br><br>Like every household has its own rules, every relationship has its own problems. She wanted him to come visit her overseas because she is graduating and going home. HE said he will try to work to raise the $ for airtix. She thought he wasnt interested in coming because he was not enthusiastic in finding a job. He wanted to work only if his friend was working with him, and said that he couldnt find a job at all in a period of 5-6 weeks. She was mad at him for quite awhile.<br><br>On seperate occasion, HE said that his circle  of friends are strinking because he spents most of his awaken time with her.<br><br>She used to throw her  tantrum on him.<br>She said his driving skills sucks, draggin the gear, lousy clutch control. He just kept quiet, did not want to argue with her.<br>She said he was always late on dates. He said the bus was crowded and the mrt she took was always punctual.<br>She said all other bfs go to gfs house to pick them up before goin out and bfs always call their gfs at home. He said the other bfs are too free, and still doesnt call her unless necessary.<br><br>Yet he despite being cool, calm, logical, practical he showed her what was love about. He saved up to bring her to a posh restaurant for their 1st V-day. He surprised her with a parcel on her b-day when she's overseas. He bought toys from a blind man and gave them to her. He cancelled some of his soccer games and rejected his buddies to be with her. She was the 1st gal he bought home to let his mum see. Whenever she threw tantrums, he let her let off, wait for her too cool down and explained logically to her.  He just wanted her to be happy.<br><br>Now, they are offically not together. He said that he would not have enough time for her everyday. She said it was better because there was no commitment and he should not feel guilty of not spending time with her.<br><br>She somehow is still waitin for him to be online to chat with him almost every nite. She tries her best to be happy, because she knows that what he always wanted her to be.<br><br>She thought about being his wife but he said he wasnt sure if he could live with her tantrums.<br><br>She said, 'the longest distance in the world is not when u'r beside me but dun know that i luv u. Its when both still luv each other but cant be 2gether..somehow...'<br>He said 'Sometimes u have to give up what u want the most.'<br><br>What do you think about this situation? Is there a possiblity that down the road they will be together again? Should she wait for him?What wil the future be?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There is a possibility of them being together again, although the chances are slim. Waiting is just an excuse to make both of them feel better and have some hope in their heart everyday to keep them going. But once one of them has already got over this depression period, that person will want to abandon the hope that they shared to keep them going everyday. One of them is bound/doomed to be hurt in the end of the line....and it is going to be very hurt. Usually it is the person who suggested this waiting idea, be the one who will get over with the depression first and end up hurting the other clueless person.<br><br>Love is like an evil seed planted firmly inside our heart...it can never be completely erased from our heart, we just merely choose to ignore that love that has planted itself in our heart.<br><br>I feel that as long as both persons have accepted the love for each other, no matter how far they are apart from each other...they are only far physically in distance but closer to each other in their heart than the person beside them. Love can hold their faith together in their heart, but you need fate to really bring them together.<br><br>So the possibility of them being together again really have to depend on fate itself. I'm sure none of them will ever forget about each other....that feeling is what we commonly know as missing each other.<br><br>Good Luck and I hope fate will bring both of them together again...but remember, things will be different...because people will always move on with their lives and situations will definitely change.</div>

Your foundation is already there... Your love is already there... Though it previously existed in a LDR form, you can modify it to exist on another form... Though it might not be easy to start with, but the same question should linger on both your minds....<br><br>"If given a chance for me to let him take my hand again, would I take it up or would I just let go?"<br><br>"If given a chance for me  to take her hand again, would I take it up or would I just let go?"<br><br>Personally, I would find it such a pity to just give things up like that at this point... Given the fact that you've already survived a LDR... What you have to face now is something more realistic today... Can do it at a slower pace... Slowly 'practise'.... Spend less time with each other (but do let him know your 'plannings')... Slowly increase the amount of time IF you WANT TO.... Understand how much you really want each other... Only from there would you truly understand and appreciates the time you've got for each other and be blissed....<br><br>You know how a love story happens...? Alot of people thought that it just happens overnight like MAGIC.... Now let me tell you the true story... Sometimes it happens that way... Alot of other times it's WRITTEN... Word by word through EFFORTS.... That's when the MAGIC REALLY HAPPENS...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>All the best my dear?<br></div>
