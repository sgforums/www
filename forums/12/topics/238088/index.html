            <div class='col-md body'>i don't quite understand the first part. but anyway, you say you want to be her friend, but is it worth it? from the way you descibe her it seems she's pretty unreasonable. my stand is clear - any friend who doesn't allow you to have any other friends besides him/her is no goddam friend...<br><br>maybe you are just too used to having her around and now that she isn't, you have a sense of unfamilarity and uneasiness. but sometimes you gota move on. just try it out for a change, there's no harm in mixing around with other people, god knows you may like it better on the other side.<br><br>and please don feel say because you couldn't be there for her when she most required it. i mean, no way you can be beside her all the time yeh? your life doesnt revolve around her...<br><br>i wish you good luck!</div>
