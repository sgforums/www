              <p>Tqx83,</p>
              <p>I totally understand how u feel, becos I am also facing the same problem. My neighbour upstairs have been bullying us for the past 20 over yrs and we have been suffering in silence. Her usual acts are dripping her wet laundry on our laundry, swearing at us when she sees us and making gestures. Recently, things gotta out of hand, so we had no choice but to report the case to the police and currently trying to seek for mediation. After reading the threads, I m quite worried that mediation might make matters worse. Actually, we are only trying to seek for help and protect our family and not to create any trouble. Really lost as in how can we go about resolving the case if mediation fails. I really don't understand why such people exist and they really enjoy disturbing others.</p>

              <p>We have tried to seek for litigation. But advice given by lawyer is that we won't gain much even if we win the case and such litigation case might take yrs.

Haiz, feel so helpless... Tit for tat doesn't work on my neighbour because she is a full-time hsewife and she is damn free in thinking of ways to disturb us. Nw we can only pray hard that they don't come and disturb our elderly parents. :(</p>

              <p>YOur woman neighbour really downright bitchy.    If she cares about face, you can go tell the neighbours about her and words spread and when she gets to know it she malu then may stop.    My case though no end but improved a little.  The son stays in the same block.  This son very bitchy, goes all the way to get at me.  One day I told him off that he is a bitchy woman in a man's body.  From then on he dare not offend me.  </p>

              <p><br>that is the son staying at the other side of the block.   The old evil, maid and visitors still cause trouble.  I meant to say that it is not as loud as ever but it is still bad enough to disturb peace and sleep.    Sounds like you really need police to help to deal with this public nuisance.   I actually had sergeant visited the old evil but old evil very cunning to say that only 2 at home so no making noise.   This is bullshit.  They bang, jump and drop heavy objects intentionally to cause trouble.    The relative visiting still told me that they stay the top floor so can afford to make noise to disturb.   The old heck for no good reason used vulgarity on me.  </p>
              <p>Somtimes I got so angry, up to my neck I shouted "old woman stay unit #XXXXX is nasty to make noise to disturb.     Many will be able to hear and know she is the nasty neighbour disturbing.  My neighbours downstairs can even hear the noise.</p>
