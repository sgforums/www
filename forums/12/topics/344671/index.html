              <p>Hi, kinda new here. I am living in Yishun and having this crazy, inconsiderate and rude neighbour. This incident has been going on for like years... and i cant take it anymore, its affecting my daily life.</p>
              <p>It all started when my this neighbour moved in. As I live at the corner, those (4 rm hdb), in front of us is the drain. Now my neighbour owns lots of plants, and plants drop leaves as you know, all she does is sweep the plants to the front of the house, making my poor old 50+ year old mother sweep it up for her. My mother one day was pissed off and she wanted to talk to the neighbour, but she refused to talk and all she does is do more rude and inconsiderate stuffs like slamming the door when we pass by their door, deliberately placing her incense burning pot, i dont know how people call it, those for burning the incense for buddihists, very near to the side of my door. Last but not least, she deliberately sweeps the plants more to the corner and slams the broom in front of my flat. I have seen this with my eyes through the door hole or whatever you call that.</p>
              <p>There was once i talked to her but all she says is rubbish. She claims that my mother scolds vulgarities at her, but for my whole life i have never even heard her swear. After i told her i have seen her slam the broom in front of my flat, she says why me and my family always want to look at her? Ridiculous... And i tried saying , ok maybe you are angry that time... but she claims she is not angry... i was like... WTF... I have tried reporting to the neighbourhood mediation center but they are simply... useless. They sent us a letter saying they cant help if the other party is unwilling to come and mediate. Furthermore, she is a committee in the hdb organization or something. I was like so shocked when i saw her name in a poster besides the lift.</p>
              <p>Seriously, no one seems to be able to help. Last choice seems to be the police. Otherwise i will have to take things into my own hands...</p>
              <p>Regards the suffering...</p>

              <p>My condolences....</p>
              <p>My analysis and recommendation is for you to try to improve the level of cordiality between the two of you.</p>
              <p>This is the fundamental reason why such an occurance (falling leaves) can cause a big problem.</p>
              <p>So to solve this question, one needs to improve the relations first.</p>
              <p>First, I suggest that everytime you walk past her or meet her, try to smile and nod to her.</p>
              <p>Next, when the situation is ripe, try to say a few short greetings and exchange some words.</p>
              <p>Do this for some time to thaw the relations.</p>
              <p>Now after the relations is relatively civil, next time when you can find an appropriate opportunity, casually mention to her about the leaves. If you can, do this delicately. First talk in general, and then talk about the plants, say you are also plant lover, then after that talk about the leaves, and mention that u somehow want to ask her a favour to sweep the leaves to a bin, and not towards your flat.</p>
              <p>I hope you understand what I say.</p>
              <p>I believe this is the only action you should take.</p>
              <p>Dont try to escalate the matter. Dont escalate hostility. Doing such thing will only bring a lose-lose outcome and is counter productive. It is not in your interest.</p>
              <p>If you find my suggestions to be difficult for you personally to implement, try third parties, such as someone else in your family. Think of someone who is suitable. Perhaps men talking to men will be better. Approach your father to talk to the husband.</p>
              <p>OK, good luck</p>
