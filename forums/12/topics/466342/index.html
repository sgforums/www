              Today at around 4 pm, I went to fetch my 2 year old boy from his childcare at near Serangoon Stadium when a parent of a boy from the same class as my son knocked on my car window as I was on the phone and about to leave. Without hesitation, I wound down my window and he started asking me if I know anything about my boy biting/hitting his son. He explained that his son has a bloody bruise on the lips. At first I was a little startled, but maintained my composure. I told him that I have no idea as the teacher did not indicate to me of any incident today. He also said that he did not ask the teacher but it was his son that mentioned my son is the culprit.
              
              (It is my habit and practice to ask my son's teachers about son's performance in school everyday; whether he has drank enough water, did he create any problems for the teachers or did he enjoy the extra music lessons we registered him for.)
              
              He proceeded to ask if my son can respond to questions. I turned around, looked at my boy and asked if he has done what he is being accused of. He said no... Not able to get a yes from my son, he walked away not very much pleased. 
              
              I drove off, rushing to pick my wife up from work yet thinking of the whole incident. When I reached my wife's office, I immediately called the school up and queried about the boy's bruised lips. Now, what the school told me was in total contradiction of what the father had accused my son of doing. 
              
              Yesterday, I emphasis yesterday; morning - the class was having some music and dance lesson. So, all the children are dancing, jumping, laughing and I guess having some crazy fun time when my son, apparently from what the teacher had witness, accidentally knocked into this boy and he bit his own lips. there was little blood but a bruise nonetheless. The teacher who witnessed the incident also informed the parents of the boy yesterday about what happened that it was purely accidental. 
              
              She said she has explained the whole situation in detail to the mother and she has acknowledged that the incident was an accident. So now comes my anger/frustration/pissed off/wtf mood.
              
              The teacher has already said it was an accident involving two 2 years old boys. The school explained to you in detail. So why are you accusing my son of deliberating injuring your son? You know the facts, you know the truth so what's with the finger pointing? Do you wish for me to pay for the medical fees incurred? I mean, grow up...

              <p>And why are you getting all agitated and defensive for ?</p>
              <p>If your kid is the one with the bruised lips , will you be as non-chalant as how you expect other parents to behave ?</p>
              <p>It is understandable for parents to feel bad when their child get hurt. And worst if they are left feeling helpless about the whole ordeal.</p>
              <p>That parent may be over-reacting, but YOU are the one who need to GROW UP.</p>
              <p>Even if it's just an accident, you should have the decency to show some concern to the child condition.</p>
              <p>If you accidentally step on someone's foot, you should apologize for the mistake. It's really common courtesy.</p>
              <p>Perhaps your parents never teach you common courtesy because they are some low class farmers, at least you should teach your child now that you are an educated parent.</p>

              my son came home once with a bite mark on his arm. the teacher told me one girl bit my son while they were playing as my son refuse to give her the toys he was holding.
              
              do i wait for the parents of the girl and knock on their car window and asked if they knew anything about their girl biting my son? they are in a childcare, they are 2 years old... accidents do happen, grow up and face the world. over protecting a boy in singapore is not ideal, NS is a requirement. should i assume that the mother will be the same auntie that visits the MP and ask for special exemption?

              all i am saying is the parents know the facts and truth about the incident. the school has explained to them twice that it was an accident when they were dancing during music class. my son while turning lost his balance and knocked onto their boy who bit his own lips and have a bruise on the upper lips. nothing serious that require medical attention... 
              
              the idea of you knocking on my car window, signalling me to wind down and accuse my son of aggressive behaviour when YOU KNOW IT WAS AN ACCIDENT is childish and fraudulent. isn't it basically lying? you know A stole your wallet but you accuse B of stealing it. you know the truth but decide to twist it. isn't that immature?

              <p>That girl intentionally bite your son, and you choose not to protect your child. What kind of father are you ? Most parents will be holding the teachers accountable for letting it happen.</p>
              <p>And yet, you get upset when other parents question you over an obvious ACCIDENT.</p>
              <p>Do you know the difference between an intentional offense vs an accident ?</p>
              <p>May I suggest that you do what you are suppose to do as a parent.</p>
              <p>You are supposed to protect your children when they are unable to protect themselves.</p>
              <p>Your child is only 2 years old and you expect him to face the world like a NS man ?</p>
              <p>You are one heck of a messed up father.</p>

              who "accidentally" bruised that kid ? Isn't your child also LYING ?

              that kid's mouth. But he said no. Why are you ignoring this fact

              <p>I assume you must be a first time parent.</p>
              <p>If your child gets hurt due to INTENTIONAL actions, like pushing, biting, bullying, hitting etc... you go to the teachers and hold the school accountable.</p>
              <p>They are suppose to take care of your child , that's what they are paid to do.</p>
              <p>And no, intentional hurting is not allowed in any schools, period. be they toddlers or teenagers.</p>
              <p>If you simply brush off the incident because you are too aloof or non-chalant, then you are not doing your part as a parent. You are failing as a parent.</p>
              <p>In the case of accidents, parents should not ignore it, because what caused a minor injury could possibly also cause a major injury if left unchecked. Again. Watch out for NEGLIGENCE.</p>
              <p>Always keep an eye on the care providing institution you put your child into. Just because you have no other options does not means you show no concern about the safety aspect of the school you left your defenseless child in.</p>
              <p>Child care abuse is more rampant than you think.</p>
              <p>You are leaving your child in the care of strangers, you as a parent should CARE.</p>

              <p>I brush off the incident not because i'm non-chalent or too aloof. people who knows me knows my son is my everything. I brush it off because they were playing. my son refuses to share the toy and the girl got agitated and bit him. so what did i tell my boy? it is important to share and he should have share the toy. maybe i wasn't too hard with the school but the school has been responsible and i must say impressed me with their style of management and teaching. (they are accredited and well received) </p>
              <p>yes, i do agree that we should not ignore minor accidents as it may potentially lead to serious accidents but my son is known to run into shelves and walls and have bruises all over. I shower my son personally and i check for any injury marks everyday. it is the usual "knocked into" bruises. </p>
              <p>I would believe the childcare is well managed as cameras are installed in all rooms and corridors. plus the boss is a fellow catholic, i would believe he takes pride and care in the childcare. </p>

              <p>First of all, why is it that your school did not call you up and
              inform you of the incident ?</p>
              <p>If my child accidentally caused injury to another classmate and
              the school had to intervene, they will call up BOTH side of the
              parents and explain the situation.</p>
              <p>When you go pick up your 2 year old, did the teacher  not
              say anything at ALL ?</p>
              <p>Now that you know what has happened , yet you still want to piss
              all over them. Your posting is after the fact that you already
              found out what happened.</p>
              <p>Frankly, you are no better than that parent knocking on your
              window.</p>

              <p>i post here to vent my frustration but again as keyboard warriors, we just vent it out here. do i put names to shame them? no, i deliberately left them out. did i name the school? no, i deliberately left it out. why? because i was just looking for a avenue to vent it out instead of confronting them. is it wrong then? </p>
              <p>yes, i agree that the school may have failed in that aspect of informing both parens of that incident. honestly, the teacher did not say anything. as i've mentioned in the earlier post, i will always ask the teachers about my son's day. did he eat well, did he pooed and did he create trouble. they did not mention anything about the incident. i cannot deny the fact but the only reason i could partially defend them is, "when we pick our children up, usually its the same time as the other parents and there is a crowd at the door. could it be they deliberately left it out or they really forgot about mentioning it to me, only God knows. </p>
              <p>precisely why i'm pissed with them after i know the truth. as i've said, they have seen the video footage, they know it was an accident. they know the TRUTH. must they come up to me and accuse my son in front of me that my boy has aggressively injured his son? isn't that lying?</p>

              <p>No it is not wrong to vent.</p>
              <p>As a parent myself, I suggest you start building bridges instead of letting your anger burn it down.</p>
              <p>Unless you have no intention of keeping your child in that school for very long, it is likely you will be having a social circle centered around the parents in the same school.</p>
              <p>As your child grows, they will go to parties and gatherings and events , places where you will meet other parents for many years to come.</p>
              <p>If you are socially inept, you will find yourself in quite many awkward situation when you have to attend children gathering with that parent you pissed on today.</p>
              <p>You will be surprised how important it is for you to establish a good relationship with other parents in your child's social group.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I had a mom pull her child out from the school because she couldn't get along with other parents.</p>
              <p>It could mean the difference for your child getting invited to birthday parties or outcasted because of you.</p>
