And not everyone is as lucky as you because most of us have flaws. Flaws that your partner has to tolerate and live with it. The good match would have two person who do not mind each others flaw and can in fact help to polish each other up. The bad match will have one party constantly being annoyed by the other party's flaw. I have not experience or seen many relationship where there is no quarrels. Most just don't tell you unless you are very close to them.</div>

Think buy lotsa gifts den can get girls den got better ones simply dump them and go for the chio-er gal. Den everyday action, always say sweet words just to make gal happy but dun really mean them. Guys always want someone weaker den them, inferior so they can feel superior. WTF is this!? When gal become more successful, den the guy feel inferior den will go for another gal le. Always look things on the surface de, never really know the person den go stead le. One end they say equal rights, on the other end, practicing something else.<br><br>PS: Not my opinions hor. LOL. I'm a guy.</div>
