              <p> </p>
              <p><strong><em>If now that you have stop giving her the $ monthly allowance, it is simply because since she has no more free money from you, so of course she cried...</em></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Honestly speaking, she is just not that into you and is using
                                      you.</p>
              <p>She is just treating you as a 'small money tree' good friend,
                                      but you are not her ideal boyfriend criteria. To her, you are just
                                      a good guy, but not up to her boyfriend standard.</p>
              <p>In a girl's point of view, if an ordinary male friend gives a
                                      platonic female friend money allowance every month to spend without
                                      expecting anything in return, who will not make good and full use
                                      of this male friend?</p>
              <p>Just to think that when every month have money take from a male,
                                      then no need to account for what she spend on or even can splurge
                                      on her wants instead of her basic needs, to maintain the girl's
                                      'high maintenance' lifestyle instead of a simple, no-frills 'low
                                      maintenance' lifestyle, why not? </p>
              <p>Also, this male also don't expect anything in return, not even
                                      the least minimum basic of having sex in exchange. To her, this is
                                      even better than to get 'bao' by a sugar daddy who wants the girl
                                      as a mistress for sex.</p>
              <p>Save the money for yourself, for your own future or even use
                                      this money to pay the bills.</p>

              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">In your post, there is a part that mentioned the boy saying "he has to distant himself from
                      her". I think this means that he is serious about love relationships, yet </span><strong style="line-height: 1.231;">he feels that he is not suitable for the girl</strong><span style="line-height: 1.231;">.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Whereas for the other part where you mentioned the</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> boy saying "he had to deal with of not able to have

              <li>both the boy and the girl love one another.</li>
              <li>however, boy saw girl being with another boy.</li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">the other boy was actually just working on something (eg. project) with the girl, as they may be in the same group.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">however, boy does not know, so he misunderstood it.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">boy mis-interpreted it as the girl has another boyfriend.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">boy feels sad and inferior to the other boy.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">boy feels that the other boy deserves the girl more than him.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">boy wants to distance himself from her.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">girl thinks that boy only regards her as friend.</span></li>
              <li><span style="line-height: 1.231;">girl feels sad and cry.</span></li>

              <p>If so, the girl should tell the boy what is really happening, to clear the mis-understanding.</p>

Lately ive been helping a best gal friend of mine with money. Ive started giving her some small sum every month as an allowance for her as she is financially drained. <br><br>She knows i love her but she rejected cuz she told me she didnt wanna risk losing the friendship. That was 5 years ago. And recently, she did told me she likes me more than a friend but not to the level of bf. she even call me her special guy friend as im her only guy friend she trust with all her heart. <br><br>Im helping without asking anything in return. I did so because i love her is one thing. Secondly, she needs help and she is a best friend so i cant bear to leave her behind with problem. And she is single again so she cant ask her ex bf for help. <br><br>Ive never hated her or hold grudges against her for rejecting me. She knows that ive always respected her decision even if it hurt my feelings. I know im not gaining anything by doing this for her. But i love her and im ready to sacrifice things for her.</p>

              <p>all eac is saying that it has to be 2-sided to happen and is looking at it from a emotionally detached perspective whereby feeding her $ is pointless because she needs to learn how to survive on her own.</p>
              <p>you are looking at it from an emotionally attached perspective whereby there is a friendship/relationship between you and the person.</p>
              <p>there is no right and wrong for this....but know that you are not helping her be independent which she inevitably needs to be. i suppose short term is ok.</p>

              friend loves his best girl friend whom only considered him as a
              best friend wrote her a note saying he has to distant himself from
              her cuz of the pain he had to deal with of not able to have
              her. <br> <br> After reading his note, she replied to him. She says he can take
              all the time off he wants but pleaded never to leave her for good
              or end the friendship. Cuz his absence breaks her heart and him
              being gone for good is like a missing puzzle piece in her life. She
              even said she is angry at herself for not able to return his love
              for her. She will wait for him to come back to her when he is ready
              to resume the friendship. This guy is her only guy friend she
              treasured. She felt bad for the whole situation and she cried a lot
              after reading the note. They had been friends for 10
              years.<br> <br> Is it a good or bad thing? Why cry over a guy whom u dont even love
              as more than friend? Would appreciate if someone can give a more
              neutral feedback rather giving negative comments like
              "friendzone".</span></p>

              <p><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> That is assuming that her tears represented love for you, in which I reckoned that it may not necessarily be so. </p>
              <p>You may be doing this out of affection, but symbolically, what you might crave is the desired affection you are been unable to obtain successfully thus far. Unconsciously, you might be secretly hoping that something triggers inside her, mystically blossoming into a relationship somehow. Naturally if possible, but more critically, the affection must be mutual.   </p>
              <p>Though you may claim that you have no motive behind your action, but I will quote what you mentioned in your earlier post:</p>
              <p><strong><em>[quote] Cuz i rather she take my money than she ask from others who would most probably try to advantage of her [/quote]</em></strong></p>
              <p>That appears to be a warped form of elaborated bribery to keep your woman at bay from other men. I am not attacking the genuineness of your friendship with her - neither am I concluding your action to an aspect of moral behaviour (between 'rightness' or 'wrongness'). <span style="line-height: 1.231;">It is your thinking process... the rationale of your action that doesn't quite go in sync with your action per se. </span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">My greatest curiosity is not about the act of helping a friend in need, but why the need for 'overly indebtedness' on your part to help a friend in need? When you combine this with unrequited affection from the past, you basically created loads of self confusion via having self justifying principles to effectively disguise the true nature of your motivation. </span></p>
              <p>You may have a coveted need - your need to feel <em><strong>needed </strong></em>by her. So whatever responsive cue she exudes could be masqueraded in your mind as a form of love affection easily.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">And this is the point I am driving at; her responses are not necessarily driven by love </span></p>
              <p>You may disagree, but given the fact that the fate on the outcome of your 'relationship' has already been decided by her - which somehow still doesn't give birth to any structural formation of a BGR regardless of the amount of positive feelings, regards or responses she has for you - t<span style="line-height: 1.231;">he unfortunately reality is that she may not be into you romantically. </span></p>
              <p>Indebtedness is not love; you just cannot convert an apple into orange because these are two separate things.<span style="line-height: 1.231;"> What you see as love for her could be a pursuit of blind obsession to get her affection, which may turn out to be a mirage of a karmic relationship. </span><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Cheers </span></p>

              <p>Best scenario  is that love is very strong.. That it can make ppl cry. I mean 10 years... It's a Long time so it's possible for this to happen.. Even if the guy distanced himself.. To conclude, they love each other, but not at the same time.</p>
              <p>l would say that your friend should use his iudgement, he knows her for 10 years so he should know her character... Personality etc... So let him judge for himself.. If he should continue to be her friend</p>

              <p>Greetings from The Modern Gentleman, </p>
              <p>Perhaps if i may be so bold as to share my opinion. </p>
              <p>It seems that <a style="font-size: 15px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 17px; background-color: #dddddd;" href="http://sgforums.com/users/274291">Undiscoveredsoul98</a>'s friend is thinking too much. Sometimes, we may not notice it but the very enemy is our very own thoughts. The fact that she read the note and cried a lot is irrelevant to your friend's situation.</p>
              <p>It could mean she actually love him or it could just simply be that she is someone who cries alot. It could mean anything. The infinite questions you can ask yourself, the endless "why would she cry?" is enough to consume a person's mind. </p>
              <p>Instead, i would suggest asking your friend to work on himself. Unreciprocated love is only painful because we have the expectation of our love being reciprocated. He should dig deeper and sort out his feelings for his female friend.</p>
              <p>Is it really true love? Because if there is one thing i know, true love is never painful. To love without any expectation is one of the most beautiful feeling one can have.</p>
              <p>If he is feeling some form of emotional pain, then what he can do for himself is to be brutally honest and investigate into that pain, to see if there is any form of expectations or attachment behind that pain. Chances are, there will be.</p>
              <p>Do note that he should take it slow. It is not easy and often very painful to see the truth, especially after a ten year relationship. But as the popular adage goes, the truth will set you free.</p>
              <p>Sincerely,<br>The Modern Gentleman.</p>
              <p> </p>
