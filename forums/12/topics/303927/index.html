While he on his side just thinking of you as his friend now.<br><br>You are being very unfair to yourself. Is time you get back to your own life. and end this misery.<br><br>At a certain age sometimes is hard to gather friends out because they are so busy with their work and other programs. you can try joining some courses, e.g something of your interest, yoga also can. join in some activities that usually you wont. you will find that it can take ur mind away for a while.
