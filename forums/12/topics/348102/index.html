              <p>TS, your problem is that you've become too needy for her... which is kind of like a turn off to girls, even to guys... to people in general.</p>
              <p>You are being "nice", but not being MAN enough to kiss her at the doorstep. That's what you should have done, I feel. From what you say, I guess you pretty much lost her interest in you. Don't be sad because there are so many girls around. A man should be more focused on career than just girls unless you're talking about your bed skills.</p>
