              <p>How in the world could someone earn $900 with no licence - still dumb enough to buy a honda stream which need to pay $1k per month.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She is totally screwed !!! - the car is auction off, as 2nd car the value already have a huge drop !!! which is not enough to cover the car cost and interest. Thus she is royal screwed !!! No + still have to pay a huge sum of money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only help you do for her is to find a damn good brain doctor for her !!! She need major surgery + possible a new brain - that can thing - maybe you donate yours to her.</p>

              <p>As stupid as you think she is, you're just as stupid to get involved. People will have the same reaction to listening to your reasons as you had when you listened to her excuses for why she did what she did with her ex-boyfriend. They will think you are stupid and blind.</p>
              <p>Getting involved in blind, stupid people's live will ruin your own. Get her parents involved and responsible, that's the smart thing to do. Then stay out of it. Don't make the same mistake she made of getting involved in a blind and stupid person's life (her boyfriend).</p>
