              <p>Now seriously... Consider this, my friend.</p>
              <p>If you were the 'right guy' that attracted her enough, she would be into you enough to forgo her past. I'm not saying she's just making an excuse by saying she's still trapped in the past, I'm saying she might not be attracted to you enough for her to WANT TO MOVE FROM THE PAST!</p>
              <p>So what now? Learn a lesson, let go and move on with your own happiness. If there's something from this incident you'd like to bring along with you, it shouldn't be sadness... but a valuable lesson and experience :P</p>

              haha, sorry but im in a relationship before.yes i do have many
              friend.im not afraid to losing whoever i onces loved because after
              a relationship, we broke up and we were still friends again.im
              not afraid too if things change, i face the fact okay..?i stil have
              to move what, this is what we call life.theres always up
              and downs... the whole point is, now someone rejected you. you
              move on.. you will defininetely able to find someone who is willing
              to like you for who you are. you are not some shadow
              what-so-ever... plus, let nature takes is course.....</p>
              <p>and btw, if i dont commit myself to a relationship, why should i
              in the very first place get into one? -.-</p>

              <p><br>There are many better girls around, but I have to tell you there are alot more even worse girls around.</p>
              <p>It's your blessings that you are not associated with any worse Singaporean girls, and you should wake up feeling so thankful that you won't get yourself into any divorce, separation situation in the future.</p>
              <p>I believed you are one of those rare Singaporean guys who strongly believed in marriage and holding onto your wedding vows and honouring them until you expires.</p>
              <p>Don't take this as a setback as I don't think it is. I believed this is a warning signs that you should look and be with a better girl next time around.</p>
              <p>We always get tons and tons of warning signs around our lives before the inevitable happens.</p>
              <p>And you're one of the lucky ones who did not overcome and ignore those warning signs.</p>
              <p>I hope you can realised that things can always turn out to be alot worse than what you are going through right now...but it won't anymore cos you have realised how lucky you are to avoid it from happening in your future. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
