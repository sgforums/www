I used to treat relationships lightly when i was younger. I know I was not responsible then but I could only blame it on my youth. But why now? Why when I am ready to settle down, I could not seems to find someone to share my life with? No matter how I try, I could not get into a relationship though I am very serious about it. Is it really fate playing a fool on me or what? I ask for nothing except a simple life with a family of my own.<br><br>Because of this I am very frustrated with life. Even more so when I see so many people enjoying life with their loved ones. Places to go during the weekends. Holidays and countries to visit. Why or what have I done that I cannot be like them? Why can't I simply meet someone?<br><br>Why are girls just entertaining me just because I am friendly to them? Everyone says I'm a great guy but I'm still alone? I'm responsible, trustworthy. I don't smoke nor visit pubs nor club. Why did the one I finally choose to love only treat me as a good friend? What's wrong with girls these days? Or are they simply too young to be serious?<br><br>God!Why is it so hard? Feeling fucking frustrated yet there's nothing I can do. Please don't give advices like concentrate on career, or know more friends because all that is taken care of. I want to know why fate is so hard up on me? What the hell have I done to deserve this? I'm losing myself if this goes on.<br><br>I sent her a long email yet not even a reply. Always giving me hurting comments. ARGH!!!!!!!!! How I wish I can become a robot. Really no motivation to move on anymore.</div></blockquote>God will reply you like this.
