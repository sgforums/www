How can we coerce Love to embrace us willingly when the fit is mismatched?<br><br>What do you think is the root of your frustration? Being rejected? Or simply because the 'tables are now turned' against you?<br><br>Why must you dismiss the option of enlarging your social circle simply because you are rejected by someone? Why must you deny yourself of learning and possibly of a 'better-fit' by knowing more people?<br><br>Perhaps if you learn patience and humility, it might be easier on your soul, simultaneously, evolved yourself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

So it could be something that you have done/behaved/spoken/thought that alerted her to fail you as her potential life partner. Girls have long range radar.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>But if a girl likes you, no matter how thick your skull is...she will be able to drop large/heavy hints that will sure punch through or at least dent your thick skull. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>IF you are as good deal as what you and your friends have claimed you to be, then I would advise you not to worry about it cos there will definitely be someone out there who will see the true gem in you for who you are.<br><br>Good Luck and take care. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

Maybe the only thing that has changed is that you are willing to settle down, but your fundamental attitude towards relationship is still the same. You must ask yourself , are you overbearing, know-it-all, blow hot and cold type, insensitive, jealous, controlling, condescending, self-centered, selfish?</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Maybe because they sense that you are insincere, and are just checking them out to see if they are gf material. Or maybe you are subconsciously judging them too much, but you can't see that you are doing it. Girls usually like sincere guys. Girls are also very sensitive and would know if you fake it or not. </span><br><br><span style="color: brown;">I don't quite get you. She didn't reply, but give u hurting comments. In any case, have u ever hurt her before? If so, she's feeling as much hurt, if not more than you. If not, then maybe she's just not the right girl for you.</span><br><br>One good question is : are you too self-centered? It sounds like you want badly to achieve what you want, that is to get a relationship. Hmm... but you need to ask yourself what you have to offer to a prospective gf. Can you offer love, security, a listening ear, non-judgement, support?<br><br>Hope that helps.<br><br></div>
