So she knows the stalker?  Is there any common fren that she can seek help from?  Probably report him to the police and not juz worry about the private number.  </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there, im a newbie here. Upon hearing wat happen to your frd, i would like to share my experience here as well. The similar incident happened to me abt 4yrs ago... And i have irritating calls from diff guy every min of the day and ask for free sex as my hp nos was been advertised over the net by one of my frd(play a stupid joke on me!!!)  At one point, i got pissed off and went directly to my guy for help as he was a police officer. He detained my hp for abt 02days and take the calls personally and tape all the conversation down. Finally, he got all the nos of the caller and actually issued warning to the callers. Less den a wk after wat my guy did, everything was solved! And for the rest of my 02yrs using that line, everything is peaceful. Hence, i urge you to get ur frd to go lodge a polce report asap as to stop the matter from getting bad to worst! Good luck.</div>

They can burn the body in the palm tree plantation and throw the ash into the sea within 3 hrs. If you find the method to be too cruel, then deal with him in a more humane way.
