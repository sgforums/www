If not, just a treat at some restaurant will do. What kind of restaurant will depend on the $ you willing to spend. Maybe a good place to eat with good atmosphere is at suntec? I mean those higher class restaurants.</div>

Closing in?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>What are consider overly quiet? There're some restaurants with relatively nice atmosphere and reasonable price... Look for those with normal pricing of main course around $20 per pax. Personally, when you talk about NICE ATMOSPHERE for a restaurant I would think of those with GREAT indoor decors and those which leave you in the moonlight outdoors... It's relatively EASIER to find the latter with a good price. Look for one with NICE FOOD... It's really a PLUS... Smaller restaurants as you'll have a chance that they're not charging too high but YET, gives you the personal FRIENDLY TOUCH.... You can even make special request like music to be played or bringing of birthday gift to that girl on a serving tray with the food or something... Use your imagination and creativity...<br><br>Be EXTRA SWEET and CARING... If my 'prediction' is right, that should be quite an IMPORTANT BONUS...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>~Good Luck and ALL the BEST....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
