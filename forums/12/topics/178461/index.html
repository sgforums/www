Im not asking him to treat his ex really like an enemy. As soon as the relationship is over, it's time to move on.<br>im just telling him not to take the breakup too personally.

But it's better to face reality. Many guys i know seem to take rejections very personally-and that includes breakups.<br><br>The point is this: if u take rejection to heart, you are never going to move on and find the right gal for u. That's what successful guys do right? Pls note that im not against gals or anything. In fact in the game of love rejections should be taken with grace.<br><br>My two cents.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
