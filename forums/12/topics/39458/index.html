Spare no arrows,<br>for she has sinned against the LORD .<br>15 Shout against her on every side!<br>She surrenders, her towers fall,<br>her walls are torn down.<br>Since this is the vengeance of the LORD ,<br>take vengeance on her;<br>do to her as she has done to others.<br>16 Cut off from Babylon the sower,<br>and the reaper with his sickle at harvest.<br>Because of the sword of the oppressor<br>let everyone return to his own people,<br>let everyone flee to his own land.<br><br>17 "Israel is a scattered flock<br>that lions have chased away.<br>The first to devour him<br>was the king of Assyria;<br>the last to crush his bones<br>was Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon."<br><br>18 Therefore this is what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says:<br><br>"I will punish the king of Babylon and his land<br>as I punished the king of Assyria.<br>19 But I will bring Israel back to his own pasture<br>and he will graze on Carmel and Bashan;<br>his appetite will be satisfied<br>on the hills of Ephraim and Gilead.<br>20 In those days, at that time,"<br>declares the LORD ,<br>"search will be made for Israel's guilt,<br>but there will be none,<br>and for the sins of Judah,<br>but none will be found,<br>for I will forgive the remnant I spare.<br><br>21 "Attack the land of Merathaim<br>and those who live in Pekod.<br>Pursue, kill and completely destroy [3] them,"<br>declares the LORD .<br>"Do everything I have commanded you.<br>22 The noise of battle is in the land,<br>the noise of great destruction!<br>23 How broken and shattered<br>is the hammer of the whole earth!<br>How desolate is Babylon<br>among the nations!<br>24 I set a trap for you, O Babylon,<br>and you were caught before you knew it;<br>you were found and captured<br>because you opposed the LORD .<br>25 The LORD has opened his arsenal<br>and brought out the weapons of his wrath,<br>for the Sovereign LORD Almighty has work to do<br>in the land of the Babylonians.<br>26 Come against her from afar.<br>Break open her granaries;<br>pile her up like heaps of grain.<br>Completely destroy her<br>and leave her no remnant.<br>27 Kill all her young bulls;<br>let them go down to the slaughter!<br>Woe to them! For their day has come,<br>the time for them to be punished.<br>28 Listen to the fugitives and refugees from Babylon<br>declaring in Zion<br>how the LORD our God has taken vengeance,<br>vengeance for his temple.<br><br>29 "Summon archers against Babylon,<br>all those who draw the bow.<br>Encamp all around her;<br>let no one escape.<br>Repay her for her deeds;<br>do to her as she has done.<br>For she has defied the LORD ,<br>the Holy One of Israel.<br>30 Therefore, her young men will fall in the streets;<br>all her soldiers will be silenced in that day,"<br>declares the LORD .<br>31 "See, I am against you, O arrogant one,"<br>declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty,<br>"for your day has come,<br>the time for you to be punished.<br>32 The arrogant one will stumble and fall<br>and no one will help her up;<br>I will kindle a fire in her towns<br>that will consume all who are around her."<br><br>33 This is what the LORD Almighty says:<br><br>"The people of Israel are oppressed,<br>and the people of Judah as well.<br>All their captors hold them fast,<br>refusing to let them go.<br>34 Yet their Redeemer is strong;<br>the LORD Almighty is his name.<br>He will vigorously defend their cause<br>so that he may bring rest to their land,<br>but unrest to those who live in Babylon.<br><br>35 "A sword against the Babylonians!"<br>declares the LORD -<br>"against those who live in Babylon<br>and against her officials and wise men!<br>36 A sword against her false prophets!<br>They will become fools.<br>A sword against her warriors!<br>They will be filled with terror.<br>37 A sword against her horses and chariots<br>and all the foreigners in her ranks!<br>They will become women.<br>A sword against her treasures!<br>They will be plundered.<br>38 A drought on [4] her waters!<br>They will dry up.<br>For it is a land of idols,<br>idols that will go mad with terror.<br><br>39 "So desert creatures and hyenas will live there,<br>and there the owl will dwell.<br>It will never again be inhabited<br>or lived in from generation to generation.<br>40 As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah<br>along with their neighboring towns,"<br>declares the LORD ,<br>"so no one will live there;<br>no man will dwell in it.<br><br>41 "Look! An army is coming from the north;<br>a great nation and many kings<br>are being stirred up from the ends of the earth.<br>42 They are armed with bows and spears;<br>they are cruel and without mercy.<br>They sound like the roaring sea<br>as they ride on their horses;<br>they come like men in battle formation<br>to attack you, O Daughter of Babylon.<br>43 The king of Babylon has heard reports about them,<br>and his hands hang limp.<br>Anguish has gripped him,<br>pain like that of a woman in labor.<br>44 Like a lion coming up from Jordan's thickets<br>to a rich pastureland,<br>I will chase Babylon from its land in an instant.<br>Who is the chosen one I will appoint for this?<br>Who is like me and who can challenge me?<br>And what shepherd can stand against me?"<br>45 Therefore, hear what the LORD has planned against Babylon,<br>what he has purposed against the land of the Babylonians:<br>The young of the flock will be dragged away;<br>he will completely destroy their pasture because of them.<br>46 At the sound of Babylon's capture the earth will tremble;<br>its cry will resound among the nations.<br><br></div>
