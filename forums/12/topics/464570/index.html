              <p>I have this friend at uni who's a year older than me and she's 
              really hot. She's tall, slim, has nice curves, and has nice eyes and features. Whenever I go out with
               her she always makes people's heads turn when she walks by them. Both 
              guys and girls always check her out.<br> <br> She's really popular with the guys partially because she's pretty, and also because she shares quite a 
              bit of similar interests such as soccer and video games and she  
              doesn't seem to get offended by their crude perverted jokes and 
              excessive vulgarities. Not only that she even talks to the guys about pretty girls as well!<br> <br> Apart from the guys, she's really popular with all the other girls too and quite often she will hug around with some of the girls. Strangely, there are some b*tches 
              that none of us girls can stand, but somehow she seems to get along with
               them and they seem to really like her too.<br> <br> <br>But that's not all. Shortly after we first met, she actually 
              confessed to me that she's transsexual!!! I really thought she was 
              joking around, but then she pulled out her IC and it showed a
               young sec school boy with short hair with a guy name. The gender stated 
              was male too! She then showed me her driving license which had her picture on it, but the IC number was the same as the one she showed me! I was completely stunned because there was nothing about
               her that looked male to me at all! She looks like a girl, she sounds 
              like one, she's not big sized, she has curves, her hands are small, she 
              has no adams apple!!!<br> <br> And she makes me feel really ashamed of myself! I'm born a girl while 
              she's born a guy yet she seems to be so much more successful at being a 
              girl than me.<br> <br> I admit at times I do have some particularly nasty thoughts to spread 
              the word that she's really a transsexual and not really a girl and see 
              if the guys will still find her attractive any more, but I know it's 
              wrong to do so.<br> <br> I just don't really understand why life is so unfair that a guy can be so much more successful at being a girl than an actual girl...</p>

              You dun have to feel so jealous.
              Part of Her/His success is due to the physical traits, for a lack of words.
              
              For instance, a man has a smaller pelvic bone, giving rise to a tight buttock and signaling fertility. That's why she/him is popular with the guys. In fact, this is recognised unconsciously by the guys and the girls.
              
              Of course, i am not implying that you go and make your buttocks as tight as possible. Just accept the way you are.
              
              In fact, when a guy wears a skirt or dress, they are viewed as being more sexy. I know cos i saw a guy wore a skirt to play the role of a fairy.
              
              Lastly, she trusts you very much, she treats you like her confidant. Do not break this trust. If you break it, it will tell others what kind of person you are.
              
              You have to feel confident that you are a girl and you can learn from her on being more successful at being a girl.

              <p>Put in some effort to make yourself look better.</p>
              <p>When you look better, you;d feel better about yourself.</p>
              <p>Pull yourself up, instead of pulling others down.</p>
              <p>Then perhaps after building some self-esteem, you won't have the need to be despicable towards your transgender friend anymore.</p>
              <p>When a person wants to destroy another.. that's because they needed to make themselves feel better... but in reality... a person is still shitty even after taking down another "better" person.....</p>
              <p>When you had to act in a despicable manner and you know it... you'll feel even more lousier about yourself... and your self-esteem will spiral downwards.</p>

              <p><br>Ok, so now you're suggesting that the ugly lazy girl photo that I found for you, has a deformed face. No, she don't have a deformed face, she's just ugly or as your logic suggests, she's just lazy. To be that ugly, she has to be damn extremely lazy.</p>

              <p><br>Then it's possibly started by those cosmetics companies to change the mindset of women in order to sell more cosmetics. Companies like De Beers have managed to change human mindsets towards buying diamonds by doing the same thing, and they have been quite successful because diamonds are actually very common, if you give diamonds to Americans, there is enough to give 1 cup full of diamonds to EACH American.</p>

              <p>In reality ....Women dress up to make themselves feel good- to build self-esteem , then validation from men is a side bonus.</p>
              <p>That's why you see a lot of women after a breakup, after they hit rock bottom and wants to lift themselves up.. they go and get new hair cut, go shop for new clothes, put on nicer make-up.</p>
              <p>Doing so will in-turn attract men.</p>
              <p>In a long relationship, when she feels too secure, too comfy in her comfort zone, she don't focus on her looks anymore.

              <p>In the absence of men, women will still want to look nice, for themselves.. only difference is their fashion sense will no longer be skewed towards men's preference.</p>
