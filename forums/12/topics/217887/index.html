But I tell you, it might be too late.<br><br>You know how I know? Her feelings towards you are very low when she said she can't feel the same and worse, she rather be single facing the wall than look at your handsome face. It means she is very turned off by whatever actions you did to her. It 's not she prefers singlehood, rather she doesn't want to be attached to you. That's what counts.<br><br>You can't make her return to you. It's very low. When a woman has loses her feelings for you, she will never love you like before again.<br><br>Suggest you back off and see if she will still contact you. If not, it's sayonara. One more thing, don't be fooled by her saying she might still come back to the r/s. That's a contradiction to what she is saying. She prefers singlehood and still wants you as husband?

I can say that 2.8 is the period that she feel the burn out in this relationship. She must be excited with the new life now. I am not sure what is yours and her age, but I am able to guess she should be less than 25 years old. Truth can be brutal at times, we just have to face it.
