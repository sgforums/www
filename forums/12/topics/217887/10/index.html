Your ego cannot take the rejection. Your ego is so high you think you are better than that guy. Your ego don't allow you to accept defeat. Your ego cannot take the fact that just because she called you for directions while making out with the guy, you still think she likes you.<br><br>She doesn't like you anymore and you should not either. If she don't love you, why should you should you love her? I know it's very difficult to understand.

            <div class='col-md body'>mitgalant, last night i saw a movie on HBO, in it there was a guy who was hopelessly and freakishly in love with a gal even though she loves another...<br><br>and as the gal and her love goes out for a date, he pursue/stalk them, again and again he tried to beatup/kill the other guy... finally someway or another he got the gal to promise to marry him. at the wedding, the bride stood in front of every one and told them a brief version of what happened, and asked "when the two ppl are not in love, do you think they should marry?" but before anyone can reply, the groom jumps in to say "even when one of them loves the other very very very much? worships the ground she walks on?...etc"<br><br>you are really beginning to resemble that man. pls take a step back and listen to us.<br></div>
