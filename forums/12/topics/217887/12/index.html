The least you can do is not to go do things which would rub on your wound while you're already in pain. i.e. Go meet her, go and indulge in places / songs / things you used to share together.<br><br>Understand at this point that no one's directly making your life miserable except yourself.</div>

You know yourself best. You know how long you need. But the one thing is for sure: she is not coming back. Get involved in some activity, play some games. Go buy PS3. It's $1399 cheap..plus GST 7%, maybe more. You might forget girls after you get involved in PS3.<br><br>doko</div>

If your heart tells you that your girl is treating you coldly, remember to really not pour in more of your heart. Learn to withdraw and accept it. Accept that it is over.<br><br>You have to really control yourself. A lot of people are like this like guy Tankh80 in another thread. Next time, don't put in too much effort into the relationship whn you realise the girl keeps pulling away and keeps giving you the cold shoulder. Really, stand up for yourself and don't be a slave to women. You need to live for yourself to be happy and not be happy for girls. Now, there are more important issues at hand here like George Bush's arrival and the GST hike. If you think about it, yours is only but a small problem. Girl gone, no problem, can always find another one again.<br><br>doko</div>
