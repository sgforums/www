No hope, no chance. She doesn't care for you when she dumps you or whatever you try to do to make her happy. She doesn't even want to see your face.<br><br>Yet you keep pressing her for an answer like a love-mad puppy. Im not trying to be hard on you but you must be hard on yourself to get past her. You are making a lot of mistakes. You are begging. "Please don't go...". You think this will work like it does in the movies? I tell you, 99% of the time it does not!<br><br>0-10% of feelings and you still want to force a dead fish to be with you. It's dead. Wake up..dead already. No use trying to save a dead r/s. Why marry<br>a dead fish?<br><br>Nothing to do with the guy but everything to do with you.<br><br>Spend some time with yourself and read our 4 pages worth of posts. Reflect on your mistakes. A woman cannot make you happy. You have been poisoned by your love for her. Start healing your heart.<br><br>If there is one single thing you must learn from our posts, women with self-esteem hate guys who are damn fvcking needy. Being needy means you are weak. You need to work on that.<br><br>Girls,those who are reading this post, if you don't love a guy anymore, don't give him false or "real" hopes, for the sake of a backup/standby/accompany.<br><br>doko</div>

There is a 3rd party in your r/s now. Infact, ur gf has the answer in her heart already but she is reluctant to tell u oni... when a woman changes her heart, there is no turning back.<br><br>My advise to u is, let go the rope..... i noe it is difficult but hei man u hv a long way to go, when u looses something, u will gain something. Maybe u will meet somebody better in the future.... Love or relationship is always a gamble, sometime u win, sometime u lose. Be a man and like a chinese saying "na de qi, fang de xia" dats a true man.<br><br>Move on n live well, trust me, time will heal ur heart..... go out n hv more social life, u will find hw wonderful life is bside boy girl relationship.<br><br>I dun want to give u false hope by telling u maybe she will come back to u but anyhw, this is only wat i feel towards wat u hv written. U hv a choice to listen or reject......<br><br>But anyway, u hv my blessing...... GOOD LUCK! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

Thus, he got the advantage.<br><br>How often do u two quarrel?  Always have cooling period after the quarrel?  Too much of this makes 2 parties tired and start to think whether it's time to let go.<br><br>She told u that she's enjoying her singlehood.  Somehow it also means that she can do without you.  You have to do something about it, cherish her more, with or without that guy's existence.  Girls need security and tender loving care.<br><br>Personally, if my bf nv contact me or tells me that we need to cool down and stop contacting for some time, it will make me feel insecure and hurt.  Can't help if the feeling is shaken, or the confidence level is not there.  </span></div>

She is being honest with you and not giving you false hopes. That's good. Take the hint and leave her.<br><br>You still want to go back and take more crap. What MAYBE? There is no maybe with girls. Either yes or no.<br><br>Can you bring a dead fish back to life? If you can, I think you must be a good magician. Bringing her feelings back? Instead of letting her miss you, you want to force the issue by trying to buy her things and taking her to restaurant. You have to stoop so low and become more BORING. Last minute work does not work with girls. It's your ego and high feelings at work here. That's why you cannot grasp the idea of leaving her.<br><br>doko</div>

Which is already explained by her to be standing at 0-10%... Do a bit of Maths and go figure...<br><br>I bet the reason why she's still giving you a bit of 'hope' is either because you're still pestering her or she's just too soft-hearted to hurt you bad...<br><br>If you don't wanna wake up on your own but rather choose to cling on to something which won't work out, then basically nobody can help you...<br><br>No matter what both of you have done in the past and how beautiful things were, the relationship's already dead by now... Cry if you must, but no use clinging on to a dead body....</div>
