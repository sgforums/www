Then we stopped contactin one another for like 1 to 2 months. During this standoff, she starts to get independent and starts goin out with her frens.<br><br>Meanwhile over at my side, i am tryin my best to see if i really want this relationship. She assured me that she still want this relationship<br><br>After much consideration for a month or so, i finally got back to her. We started doin things like goin out, to the beach etc but suddenly, when i ask her, y is she so cold towards me, she replied me that she no longer feel the same in this relationship<br><br>She prefers her singlehood now. She is enjoyin herself now. Every friday night clubbin all these.<br><br>She does not seems interested in this relationship now.<br><br>What can i do to make her come back to me like the past ? I really really love her alot.<br><br>Can give me some advises. Thanks </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> That is the reason why I always do not recommend a time off period, over proper communication to either resolve an issue or dissolve the relationship. Yunhaier remember meeting up with this fellow from SGF few years ago, who did the same thing as you and suffer the same fate.<br><br>When you give a time off to somebody - you are effectively giving wings to her. Now that she enjoys her flight, you wouldn't be able to stop her from revelling in her new life.<br><br>When you deny communication, you gave approval to degenerate the relationship.<br><br>Drop her that ultimatum - if she desire that freedom so much... if she sees herself like a caged bird, then I don't see why you want to keep someone so unhappy by your side. If Love was understanding, love would have told you to release that bird for greater happiness.<br><br>If you cannot give what she needs - then I don't see why should you even covet her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Do you want to wait for her decision or move on with life?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Waiting for her:</span><br>Honestly, I don't recommend this.

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly things are complicated if there is another person involved...<br><br>I have a fren who was married and he liked this colleague of ours. When he is drunk he will whole day tell you that he don know what to do he liked both persons.. at the end of the day.. he still stopped the r/s and went back to his wife...<br><br>But.. the reason y that happened was that his r/s with his wife after so long has got little excitement.. then he alws work very long hours with this colleague so they got close and u know new r/s is ALWAYS very exciting.. but at the end of it he realised he cant hv 2 persons at same time, he has to decide. both of them also kept askin him to decide..<br><br>maybe the other guy dun know about u. if he does, i am sure he will also be asking yr gf to decide.<br><br>anyway if u want her back u have to tell her and maybe be patient for a while see what her decision is. go clubbing with her and when you do dress up nicely so she will be happy to be seen with you.. then at least u get to spend time together to rebuild your r/s.</div>
