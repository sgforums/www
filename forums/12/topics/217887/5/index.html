If you are so unhappy already when attached, I think you will be happier without a girl/love. Perhaps the path for you is singlehood, if you can't drop this girl and go find someone else.<br><br>Everybody likes your ex-gf. The more important question is, whom does your ex-gf like? You or the other guy? You cannot hope for his feelings to go down. You can't control feelings.<br><br>During the time when you mature, she is in the arms of some guy making out.<br>The reason she gave you this BS is because you are not MAN enough for her! You are boring, predictable and a lovesick pooch. No offense to you, she still like you as a friend but she cannot fall in love with you.<br><br>You made a correct decision by breaking up. In fact, you did not break up. You two already broke up during the cooling period!<br><br>Do as much as you like because at the end of the day, you will still find all of us saying the right things again. Don't come back crying when you asked us to give you a lot of practical advice. The amount of time you spent waiting for her  is the amount of time you have wasted that could have been used to hustle other chicks.<br><br>doko</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i am tryin. but its really too stupid of me to put in so much love into my first ever relationship. she is my first serious gf, and i simply love her too much that sometimes i wonder if i really know what i am doin?<br><br>i knw, the standard things will be like, goin for a jog, keep myself occupied.<br><br>but whenever i woke up frm my bed, the first thing in my mind is HER. Whenever i slp, i always dreamt we are back together. The memories that i had with her. its everywhere. its always comin back.<br><br>even when i am typin this, my head and is her.<br><br>i dun know y i am harbourin hopes of her returnin to me. Maybe is becoz of somethings she said that gave me a little hope.<br><br>She told me, maybe after NS, when i am more mature, we might still be together. all she wan now is to have fun and be alone. BUT WHERE on earth, will someone that is tryin to be ALONE still go to clubs? still go out with tat guy every nw and then ? Is tat what she really mean by being alone ?<br><br>i dun know, but somehow i still think i need serious help now. I had lost so much weight. Frm 64kg to a mere 56kg in like a week.</div>

BUT HOW ?</div></blockquote>The fastest way is not necessarily the best way... In this case, it's so very true...<br><br>Why would you want the 'fastest way'? How about the more effective way...?<br><br>1st of all, <strong>STOP</strong> giving yourself ANY hope. Do you realise that you're like buying a lottery now...? If you buy a certain number combination, yes... You might have a CHANCE to WIN... A so called 'hope'... Nobody can truly deny you of that FACT.... But SERIOUSLY... LOOK at those people who QUEUE for LOTTERY.... Out of the HUNDREDS, how many of them actually win...?<br><br>GO FIGURE. Why cling onto that LOUSY 'HOPE'? It just APPEARS so much BIGGER simply because ya DESIRES IT... It's a paradox error. When you see a small hole on the wall which appears much larger than it actually is because the girl you so much desire is on the other side... And ya try to squeeze your way through with all your efforts... REALISE how MEANINGLESS and POINTLESS IT IS.<br><br>2nd thing. <strong>NO LONGER YOUR GF</strong> means no longer YOUR BUSINESS. You've got YOUR OWN LIFE, she has got hers. The MAIN DIFFERENCE now is that she's already living her life (the way she wish it to be), but you're not... You're SORE. To get on with life and away from her DOESN'T mean you DO ALOT OF THINGS just to DISTRACT YOURSELF. It means you DO THINGS because you ENJOY doing them and LIVING YOUR LIFE as it is. LOVE YOUR LIFE as it DESERVES to be LOVED by you. LOVE YOURSELF. If you can't even claim 'LOVE' from yourself, imagine how much more difficult it would be for another to pass it on to you? BE FAIR to YOURSELF.<br><br>3rd thing. If one <strong>TRULY LOVES </strong>you, there's NO WAY you're gonna be kicking her out of your life.. The REVERSE is TRUE that if she DOESN'T, then there's NO WAY you can cling onto her heart... If you TRULY have DOUBTS for her love... Leaving her behind is one of the better choices.. That if she TRULY LOVES you, she'll COME ALL THE WAY BACK with ACTIONS to PROVE IT... Else you'll just be as 'invisible' if you continue to hang around her...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>after reading so much.. this is what i have to say<br><br>1) since u decided to break off with her, no point clinging on to anything. gers are like that, they can say all the funny things, like they wont want any relationship for now and blah blah. it will never be true. what they tell u is just so that they won't feel so guilty, or maybe so that you would feel more hurt.<br><br>2) time will heal you, yes, provided if she don't come call u and "disturb" your life. change your hp number if u are serious on coming clean from her. don't worry of such things like "if next time she want find me how?". now friendster link link link can find each other one.... but i doubt she will find you, unless u prove useful to her. girls like to make use of guys.<br><br>3) please don't be a spare tyre. i know its easy to say but hard to do, can you accept the fact that the ger you love being touched by some freaking bstard? then what she think? love is not a game to you, she happy will go try other guys, don't feel like sian liao come back find you?? i don't think you want such a relationship.<br><br>4) hope all guys/girls who snatch other people's partner kena bang by car</div>
