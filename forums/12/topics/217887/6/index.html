There is something wrong with you. She just doesn't feel for you anymore. She is displaying signs of low feelings towards you. Can you understand the situation now?<br><br>Let me tell you something. You can go and beg her. She MIGHT want to come back. After that you will come back to this forum and complain again. It will prove us right again. Everytime you go against our advice you will find you are wrong again. Can't you understand? Women seldom tell the guys they have no interest in them anymore. Sometimes they will give a bit of hope. They know guys cannot take the pain. Be strong.<br><br>Did you know that when you say if she comes back after bedding the new guy you will forgive her, you sound like a wimp, a pussy-whipped guy? Which self-respecting guy will take a woman back? DuMp her! It's over. Let me tell you something again. If you ever forgive her, she will treat you like a dirt. You know why? Because she did not respect you! You can't give her the chance to respect you! You remind me of a similar predicament most guys are in when they are so madly in love. They keep giving excuses to their women whom. They are not tough enough. They cannot even respect themselves! Self-respect is what most men needs. More so than the so-called love. Most importantly, ask yourself: will she sacrifice as much as you do huh?<br><br>She is not your ideal partner. Again, making up excuses for her again just because you are 10000% madly in love with her. You are boring and she has had enuff fun with you in this r/s.<br><br>5% chance is not enough. You need 100% chance, I tell you. It's like trying to operate a tumour with 0-5% chance survival.<br><br>See the light. There is no ideal/special ONE. But, there are a lot of good chicks out there with good personality. Also, there are evil bitches too. The path to dating is tough, in fact it is a war. A long term r/s is never easy with obstacles along the way. You need a good girl. The girl, apparently has lost it with you and so, is not for you.<br><br>In this war of love, you have been gunned down. Go heal yourself. You need a lot of medipacks to heal yuor heart before you set foot in this battlefield again,  with increased experience.<br><br>doko<br><br></div>
