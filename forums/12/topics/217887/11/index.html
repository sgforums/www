            <div class='col-md body'>Grief is a somewhat commplicated and misunderstood emotion. Yet, grief is something that, unfortunately, we must all experience at some time or other. We will all inevitably experience loss. Whether it is a loss through death, divorce or some other loss, the stages of grieving are the same.<br><br>There are five stages of grief. If we get stuck in one stage or the other, the process of grieving is not complete, and cannot be complete. Thus there will be no healing. A person MUST go through the five stages to be well again, to heal. Not everyone goes through the stages at the same time. It is different for each person. You cannot force a person through the stages, they have to go at their own pace, and you may go one step forward then take two steps backward, but this is all part of the process, and individual to each person. But, as stressed, ALL five stages must be completed for healing to occur.<br><br>The five stages of grief are:<br><br>1-Denial-"this can't be happening to me", looking for the former spouse in familia places, or if it is death, setting the table for the person or acting as if they are still in living there. No crying. Not accepting or even acknowledging the loss.<br><br>2-Anger-"why me?", feelings of wanting to fight back or get even with spouse of divorce, for death, anger at the deceased, blaming them for leaving.<br><br>3-Bargaining-bargaining often takes place before the loss. Attempting to make deals with the spouse who is leaving, or attempting to make deals with God to stop or change the loss. Begging, wishing, praying for them to come back.<br><br>4-Depression-overwhelming feelings of hopelessness, frustration, bitterness, self pity, mourning loss of person as well as the hopes, dreams and plans for the future. Feeling lack of control, feeling numb. Perhaps feeling suicidal.<br><br>5-Acceptance-there is a difference between resignation and acceptance. You have to accept the loss, not just try to bear it quietly. Realization that it takes two to make or break a marriage. Realization that the person is gone (in death) that it is not their fault, they didn't leave you on purpose. (even in cases of suicide, often the deceased person, was not in their right frame of mind) Finding the good that can come out of the pain of loss, finding comfort and healing. Our goals turn toward personal growth. Stay with fond memories of person.<br><br>Get help. You will survive. You will heal, even if you cannot believe that now, just know that it is true. To feel pain after loss is normal. It proves that we are alive, human. But we can't stop living. We have to become stronger, while not shutting off our feelings for the hope of one day being healed and finding love and/or happiness again. Helping others through something we have experienced is a wonderful way to fascilitate our healing and bring good out of something tragic.<br></div>

There are many parts to a lasting relationship, looks included though initially. After all, 40 years down the road, your looks don't matter anymore when you have white hair/balding/wrinkles.

But this is against reality. Patience, my friend, is the way to many things.<br><br>Don't tell yourself negative things. When you look at how many people are suffering more than you, you will realise how lucky you are. I know this sounds very Buddhist but all your troubles come from your desires. As long as you eliminate this desire (though not completely), you won't be putting so much stress on yourself.<br><br>Don't worry you have lots of company. Every problematic guy here who puts in a lot of effort into their relationship and see their gf keep pulling away always plunge into deep emotional mess. The main root of cause is that they are not willing to move on. They keep thinking their gf will come back. The fact is, they will not. Their heart has changed.<br><br>For a start, rebuild your life. Stay away from relationships. You need to cure yourself first and make yourself a stronger person mentally and physically. You need to tell yourself you can survive without girls or your ex. Remember Japan? After the war, they did not give up. They rebuilt themselves again and what are they now? A world power to be reckoned with! Every person has the power. It's whether you want it or not. It's whether you choose to remain to be in this deep hole or choose to have resolve.<br><br>Try getting a hobby first. Anything will do. Keep your mind occupied constantly.<br>Every time you think of her, remind yourself it's just wishful thinking. Your life is your focus. You are the star in your life's movie. You are James Bond. James Bond doesn't get wavered easily.<br><br>To sum it up: it's really very simple. It's whether you want it or not. It's whether you want to let yourself to constantly maintain a defeatist mindset.<br><br>doko<br><br></div>

The more you try to deceive yourself, the deeper you'll fall. Seen plenty of cases of yours. Start walking the correct direction while you still can, otherwise picture could be really bad when things really start to degrade..<br><br>Remember. When you can't handle, stay AWAY from her.
