            <div class='col-md body'>Earlier, you mentioned you're not the type who goes out much.. she seems to enjoy a certain lifestyle that isn't "you".  You can't really help it if she's just not that into you.<br><br>Also, don't get desperate.  If you allow the emotions to overwhelm u, u might act on that desperation, which will probably be just ugly and embarrassing .. especially for you.<br><br>If u're very determined to win her back though, try to recall what it was about you that she found so attractive in the 1st place.

She is no longer yours, and I'll even go as far as to say that no one truly possesses another person.<br><br>She is already telling you gently that she doesn't want you around anymore when she says that she doesn't want to meet you as often because of the above reason.<br><br>Even if you succeed in stopping her from contacting this guy, she can always find other guys to pursuit. By stopping her, she'll hate you even more for obstructing her freedom.<br><br>Let it go. Months later, you will wonder why the heck did you even agonise so much over her.</div>

Because you love her much more than she loves you. Oh wait a minute, does she love you in the first place? The more you pressure her, the more she pulls away. Get it? Any form of contact with her is deemed as pressure on her.<br><br>Like the above posters said, it does not make sense when she gave you that bullcrap. She just want to reject you softly. When girls like you, they want to see you, period. Either that, they just want to control you like a slave if they really say that. You don't want girls who don't like you or want to control you.<br><br>You see how nice girls are? They will never tell you to get lost. You see how they want to keep confusing you? It will be very rare for a girl to be honest with you. It's like you are in a thick haze and can never get out. What the heck is this girl thinking? You think and think...what the hell do girls want? Simple..They may say what they want but they will never know what they emotionally respond to. In this case, she has emotionally responded to the new guy. Apparently, the guy is 'nice' to her.<br><br>So why is it that she don't want to avoid the guy and hope the guy will miss her huh? Oh, I forgot she don't like him. Don't care about the guy. Whether he succeeds or not, it is another story. Your story is more important.<br><br>Leave her alone. You don't want such girls. Not worth it.<br><br>doko</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey threadstarter,<br><br>I was once in your shoes, except ex-gf that time was in her early 30s. Whoever heard of females in their 30s still 'wanna have fun'. But that's life. Reading your posting does bring back really bitter memories. Should the other side choose to break-off a relationship, any dumb stupid reason is just as valid as the other.<br><br>Do you want to be treated as a spare tire? Are you willing to be the recipient of used goods? Is your precious time to be used waiting for this girl, while she is out there having her fun? Do you have your sense of dignity?<br><br>Sure there's a call to be disappointed and sad, considering the time and effort you have put into the relationship. Cry (even if u're a guy) if you must like others say, but hey! life's doesn't wait for noone. But when the last tear has dropped, time to move on. Learn from this experience.<br><br>The part about you being the perfect husband... is just stringing you along. If she is able to think of that, then she ought to have the responsibility to foresake others to take on her role as your wife too. But has she shown that?<br><br>Over-analysis sometimes does clouds the mind in matters of this nature. Each of us have our own opinion, but we hope you have wisdom to choose the right action.<br><br>good luck!<br><br></div>

Now I realise loving her is not really the best thing I can do. It's like you are hooked to her like a drug, constantly needing to be around her to feel good. Makes you feel like a zombie. What if you can break free from this matrix? I don't really NEED her at all. I just need ONE good girl. Along the way, I will just meet girls who are not for me. TS, that means you have to find your a girl who has also woken up from this BGR matrix where the word 'love' is so often overused that it has no meaning anymore nowadays.

            <div class='col-md body'>to cut a long story short<br>let me summarise it for you<br><br>1. she dont want you anymore, she want the exciting bad guy who is most probably handsomer and richer than you . and taller and slimmer.<br><br>2. she is not worth it, if she can do it now , she can do it again. we human are repeat offenders , born to be like this, we never learn , thats how great dramas come about<br><br>3. Even though you get drunk and plastered everynight, or WHATEVER happen to you , accident or whatever, she is not coming back<br><br>4. do you really want to be a bad boy?because of her, go to a nice church find a nice girl like rainee or something or whoever.<br><br>get it through your thick skull, she dont want you anymore, whatever you are , the most you willbe is the backup plan for her.<br><br>cmom man , dont be a dog, be a man!<br><br></div>
