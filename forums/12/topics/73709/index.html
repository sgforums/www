Taking away part of your emotion... Taking away pat of your human... <span style="font-style: italic;">Feel</span>... Be grateful that you can <span style="font-style: italic;">feel</span>...?<br><br>Not much of your situation is revealed here... Hereby, I can only give you general guidelines..<br><br>If you feel that something is wrong with your relationship... And you think that it could be salvaged... Work out the difference... And try to come to an agreement with your bf to amend it... Remember... It have to be genuine and sincere from both parties.... Otherwise it probably won't work...<br><br>If you feel that all hope is gone... Then don't hesitate to take charge of life? Don't be afraid to change... Sad? Painful? Live it the way it should be....<br><br>From what i can tell you... No point suppressing thoughts and feelings unless they're groundless ones.. Even then you'll have to learn to deal with them... Almost everyone has a limit... Building up can't be a solution forever....<br><br>Regards.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Cutie,<br><br>The 1st flushes of happiness u feel when u 1st fall in love r always wonderful -- tt giddy, heady feeling u see whenever u see him, the heart palpitations whenever he holds ur hand.<br><br>The truth is, after time, the 1st flushes of being in love will fade.  That's where both u &amp; ur partner hafta make the effort to keep urselves in love, &amp; Not juz settle into routine.  1st of all, it means Not to take each other for granted, &amp; this is ezier sez'd than done.  Are little presents to u greeted wif the same enthusiasm as when u were 1st courting?  Do ur eyes light up whenever u see him, &amp; vice versa?<br><br>Women/girls usu wonder where the love has gone after being taken for granted.  U hafta let ur guy noe.  Men, if u dun tell them, dun notice (yesh, they can be tt dumb <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">), so it always helps to get thgs out in the open.  Sure, they may be defensive @ 1st, but when they realise tt wat u sez is true, they WILL make the effort to spoil u again.  If u dun take the chance to tell them, then u'll always be stuck in this situation.  U haf Nothg to lose.<br><br>RP<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by CuTiE~~:</div><div class="quote_body">it used to be such a wonderful feeling...the simple feeling of falling in love...<br>but as years go by, you start to know the person inside-out...<br>certain incident takes place, u start to have the doubt that the other person does not seem to place you in much importance.<br><br>tears were shed...pain in the heart was felt.......<br>one moment, u feel ok...but the next moment, when u start to think of those unhappy events, you start to feel angry.........<br><br>wish the person could be ur last...........but just dunno how to feel, dunno where this relationship is heading towards......<br>realli wish heaven could take away all my hurt &amp; only allow me to keep the happy ones...dunno how i can suppress this tot &amp; feeling...<br>can someone teach me how?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br></div></blockquote></div>
