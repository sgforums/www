              <p>Well you didn't mentioned that, so i take back what i have said. then i just move on with your studies. register for o level then. since you can excel in your ITE days, then perhaps you should gearing up slowly for 'o' level.</p>
              <p>just to share smth. Recently, a junior of mine whom was once in normal tech, is currently sitting for 'o' level. she done it with her own effort - self study. i find this rather 'pei fu'. cause from NT to O levels within 2 years by her effort, it is rather amazing. so hopefully u can emulate her. ;) </p>
              <p>lol. so young phobia of marriage. no wonder decreasing birth rate these years. jokes. aiya jus don't get involve with that kind of guy can alr wad. no need to be phobia of one. lols.</p>

              <p>I think you should concentrate on one problem at a time.</p>
              <p>If I were you, I've solve your sis's problems first. Her problems are the most serious and should be addressed immediately. Don't wait anymore, report that bastard to the police, get him arrested and get a protection order. Your sis would be better off emotionally, mentally, physically and financially without him.</p>
              <p>Besides, from what you've described, she seems to be suffering from some form of OCD (a psychological disorder), people suffering from this tend to wash and clean themselves obsessively, to the point of hurting themselves. And she sounds like she's suffering from depression too. You'll need to get her to see a psychologist/psychiatrist.</p>
              <p>In addition, her kids are still young, and may already be traumatized by what is happening. This would greatly affect them in future, so you need to minimize the damage and even try to reverse it as much as possible.</p>
              <p>In short, your own problems (lack of gal frens) are really insignificant as compared to these. Act now, or you might regret it in future.</p>

There was once my sister was sleeping it was like wee hours and he wakes my sis up because my sis forgot to clean the stove. He don’t allow my sis to sleep unless she cleans up the whole kitchen ! His husband abuse maid before. Sentence to jail last year and was release this year June on tag because of good character and officially free from jail in August. I can really feel that he is torturing my sister . Be it physically or mentally. My sis even told me something like , ” One day when i gone mad , i might just take a knife and stab him to death and i will jump to death myself. “</p>

              <p>You seem to be able to identify problems quite well. I feel you'll grow up well to be able to help others in future because of what you have seen/experienced yourself, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">provided you make good choices in your life.</span> </strong>Everyone is responsible for their own lives. The people in your family have their inner issues to resolve, but they must want to resolve them. No one can be helped if they themselves don't feel they have a problem, or they don't want to be helped.</p>
              <p>As a former poly lecturer, I've come across many youngsters with various backgrounds (not well-off to the very rich) with very messy lives. You are at a very vulnerable age, and you're faced with many problems in your family. But you have to take very good care of yourself, and not mess up your own life, by getting involved with insincere "friends".</p>
              <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">For you as a girl, having a bf who brings you trouble rather than truly caring for you, because you feel lonely is a huge risk you have to watch out for. Being lonely for a period of time is better than having a bf and "friends" who are not genuinely caring towards you. When you can present your true inner good self, genuine friends will naturally be drawn to you. But be patient. :) </span></strong></p>
              <p>Be kind to yourself, don't burden yourself with others' problems for the time being, as you are not in the position to help now. Get your essential educational qualifications first. If finances are a problem for your education, there are bursaries that you can apply for. Go out there and see the happier and more positive side of Life, outside of your family.</p>
              <p>If you view Life with dark-tinted glasses all the time, you won't be able to see the colourful and bright side of Life, and you won't feel good about yourself or feel happy, and you'll only attract more negative people who can worsen your situation. You have to feel happy first, before happy and positive things can happen in your Life, and then positive people will be attracted to you. ;)</p>
              <p>Take care ya! <a title="Self-love" href="http://www.rainbowjigsaw.com/2010/06/importance-of-self-love.html">Self-love</a> is what you need now.</p>

              To angel7030: Leave my sis alone ? What if its your sis ? Do  you like to see your own family members being abuse ? Life or money is much more important ? Think again.
              Different people have different perspective. I know , but in general no one likes to see their own family member get hurt. What if the next time round tragedy really do happen ? I am gonna regret for life. Do you understand ? You can talk so easily , because talk is cheap. It don't happen on you. When u are in other people's shoe or situation , you will then understand how they feel.

              <p>Sometimes, you have to help others first before you can help yourself. In this case, it's TS's family who is in need of help. When a family member suffers, ALL suffer.</p>
              <p>So, the saying that "help yourself before you help others", should only be applied to people whose lives do not directly affect you. In fact, it'll be completely impractical not to help her sister, because if her sister becomes unable to care for her kids (due to abuse or insanity or death *touch wood*), then the responsibilty will fall onto TS and her parents. How will they be able to cope? TS will have to struggle with work and babysitting, dun even need to think about furthering her studies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So TS, good luck, it'll be a tough journey, but if you perservere and put in all your efforts, I'm sure one day you'll find life improving for you and your family.</p>

              Thanks little miss bonkers. Angel won't understand because she said that she have no sister. I guess she's living in her own world. And angel , TRAGEDY COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IF THERE'S SOMETHING DONE. TTFU , she's weird lah basically. She's those type can " bu guan jia ren de si huo " as long as she's alive and happy can already. So Selfish.

              <p>Without me being a devil advocate, you may not truly appreciate what you have and what nice peoples you have around you. I hope all end well for your family and apologise for my teasing part with you, my last advice is that whenever something happens, stay cool and look at all angles, especially from outside the box, do not just look it at face value ya, in this way, you will think better and solve your problem in a better way.</p>

              <p>And I thought my problems were bad enough but they're nothing compared to what you're facing. It's understandable that with these background problems, you'll find studying quite difficult to focus on although you can also use them to empower your discipline and focus.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is your father the passive leader of the family or is there someone "in-charge" to make a stand? I think it is important for someone to step up and deliver solid advices to your fellow family members, from your brother and his GF [Living with you and your family members? WTF charity isit!], your sister and her husband [His obsessiveness for cleanliness does not condone the violence] and whichever other relatives that are up to no good.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If not, all you can do is endure and do what you're currently doing, helping in any ways you can and focus on improving your current life. Some people rather be abused/taken advantage of than face a much more drastic change to their life, and by separating husband and wife, you might just cause more damage in the long run.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Other than that, I can't offer any advice which doesn't include slapping all your family members and telling them them to wake up their ideas.</p>

              <p><br>Oh, let me try,</p>
              <p>Long ago, in Singapore, when peoples were very poor, there were no jobs other than those hard labour for men and farming for women, even that also hard to find. So, as daughters of that time, unlike today gals like me everything also bo chap,  they are mostly very filial piety to parents, they wanted to help their parents in coping up with the family foods and daily expenses, so they went out to work, most work as flower sellers, papaya sellers, match stick sellers, cigarette sellers, sweet sour prune sellers etc etc...and also durian sellers.</p>
              <p>They will roam the streets selling their stuffs, so for those selling flowers, peoples will just call, Ah Hua(flower) come here! then those selling durian, peoples will just call, Ah Lian!! come here! selling sour prune was called as Ah Mei, and so on. That was how these nick names arrived. However, pedalling along the street, these gals learned to be streetsmart, they need to be more rough and strong in character in order to survive, so in a long run, people look at them as not ladylike, very rough and talk loud.</p>
              <p>That bring us to today, whenever any lady act rough or do not have a ladylike in them, most people label them as Ah Lian, Ah Hua, Ah Mei etc etc...Hope u understand now.</p>
