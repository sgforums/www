              <p>Its ok to be a loner in school.</p>
              <p>However are you being true to yourself? Do you really  avoid social interaction with people or are you just incapable of interacting with people and using this loner term as an excuse.</p>
              <p>To survive as a loner you need to be true to yourself. Understand that being a loner is not socially accepted in mordern day society. You will DEFINATELY be scrutinise by people who practise or what they call the modern day social etiquette of society.</p>
              <p>Alot of people have misconception of being what a loner is. Often it is mistaken as arrogance or retardation or even incompetance(since teamwork is critical criteria in the working aspect). They get the impression that loners are people who don't speak out at all, have poor communciation and such. All which maybe untrue. Because there are loners who seperate their professional lives with social lives. When its time to work, they bring their A game and perform and after work they go back to becoming the loner selves. You will have alot to prove and even then people aren't that willing to accept someone that is different. Some will even try to convince you that you're mentally sick and you need help but in actualy fact, they're the retards for not understanding that each and every one of us are unique individuals and it is through circumstances and experience that lead and guide us to become who we are.</p>
              <p>Since you're alone, you don't really have anyone who you can explain to. Only to yourself. So you really really really need to understand where you're coming from because by being true to yourself you will avoid of unnecessary conflict with yourself. Sounds ironic isnt it but it true. Because as a loner, people will gossip about you and even stir rumours up all which you're defenceless since you have no one to step up for you but yourself. There are loners who fail to accept themselves and get greatly affected by these gossip mongers and then they start hating themselves for being loners.</p>
              <p>You need alot of confidence, to stand up for youself to accept who you are. You need to convince people that being a loner is what YOU what. It is something of choice and not circumstances. It is your choice to be a loner and not because society has outcast you and hence u become the loner that you are.</p>
              <p>Basically you need to toughen your mentality. Don't be shy or afraid to step up for your rights. if you feel you're being treated unfairly then voice out. Also be accepting of others if you want people to accept you. Have an independant mind set. Don't be a push over. Learn your rights, you rights in society and the right to be the unique individual that you are.</p>
              <p>Just some difficulties you might face as a loner in school</p>
              <ol>
              <li>No one picks you for group project and you're left hanging by yourself and then embarassingly the teacher has to assign you to a group.</li>
              <li>No one inform you of the latest updates in class schedule/project/deadlines.worksheets</li>
              <li>Idiots who try to convince you that you're sick and depressed when actually you're not</li>
              <li>Emotionaly bullying, mental bulling, probably from idiots who have a wide circle of 'friends"</li>
              <li>Embarassement when nobody sits beside you in class and you find the surrounding seats along your row to be empty.</li>
              <li>Peopl who fail to acknowledge your existance even thou you're there.</li>
              </ol>

              <p>Hey all. As the title suggests, how do I survive as a loner in school?</p>
              <p>I was a loner and an outcast in JC. As you could imagine, I was totally ostracised by my schoolmates/classmates and was greatly affected. My grades went down hill and was finally down with depression. I was then kicked out of school because of my illness.</p>
              <p>I do not like to talk much, but I always try my best in conversation and making new friends.</p>
              <p>I finished serving NS and am waiting for school (Poly) to start. I am afraid the same thing would happen again. Please help.</p>

              <p>To be successful in life, you need EQ and IQ.</p>
              <p>It is no use to have high IQ when your EQ is low.</p>
              <p>You need to learn how to deal wif people n how to make alliances.</p>
              <p>Make friends is very important part of life. Don't be afraid, go out there and try.</p>
              <p>Next time in working place, you will need to demonstrate your ability to succeed not only by working hard and efficient but also knowing how to influence and lead people.</p>
              <p>I have a Malaysian uncle who only have primary school education but is a successful construction magnate, housing developer and oil palm estate owner. Why? Not because he was good at his studies but it was because he knows how to make friends and business contacts. He worked his way up from a poor guy to a rich guy.</p>

              <p>Basically you need to toughen your mentality. Don't be shy or afraid to step up for your rights. if you feel you're being treated unfairly then voice out. Also be accepting of others if you want people to accept you. Have an independant mind set. Don't be a push over. Learn your rights, you rights in society and the right to be the unique individual that you are.</p>
              <p>Just some difficulties you might face as a loner in school</p>
              <ol>
              <li>No one picks you for group project and you're left hanging by yourself and then embarassingly the teacher has to assign you to a group.</li>
              <li>No one inform you of the latest updates in class schedule/project/deadlines.worksheets</li>
              <li>Idiots who try to convince you that you're sick and depressed when actually you're not</li>
              <li>Emotionaly bullying, mental bulling, probably from idiots who have a wide circle of 'friends"</li>
              <li>Embarassement when nobody sits beside you in class and you find the surrounding seats along your row to be empty.</li>
              <li>Peopl who fail to acknowledge your existance even thou you're there.</li>
              </ol></div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Tip:</p>
              <p>If nobody sits next to you. You have to voice up and say "Why nobody sitting next to me?"</p>
              <p>That will bring attention to everybody and perhaps a kind soul would consider you.</p>
              <p>Next, dress well, comb your hair and make sure you are neat and tidy. This would exuberate confidence and make you feel better about yourself.</p>

              <p>Thanks for all the advices!! I'm feeling a bit stress now. Haha.
              Anyway, I don't really want to disclose too much information about
              NS and which Poly I'm going to. I don't want to be tracked down!!
              Lol.</p>
              <p>I know some of the mistakes I made in JC for me to end up like
              this.1) I was a god damn nerd, with nerdy hair, pimple face (have
              changed my hair style, pimple problem is at least 80% gone). 2) I
              do follow my classmates for lunch, but I never ate anything...
              3)There was a period of time when I kind of isolate myself to
              concentrate on my studies (Bad move). 4) I joined other CCA that
              was not school based.</p>
              <p>1 thing I did right, I was and still is, quite fit too. In fact,
              I'm one of the fittest in the class!! As for looks, I don't know,
              average I think? I'm not muscular, but I'm fit, no tummy and got
              packs! lol.</p>

              <p>perhaps you are unsure of the real problem why you were a loner.</p>
              <p>having pimples and nerdy hair is no reason for ppl to shun you, and even if you're not fit but you have a great personality ppl would want to befriend you. there's a guy in my class who is overweight and has some pimple scars on his face but the whole class is friends with him, simply because he's fun to be with.</p>
              <p>as for lunch, may i ask you why you're not eating?</p>
              <p>anyhow, i think personality is the most important thing. this is not to say that you've had a bad personality in the past, but rather, i think that you were afraid to let your true self shine through. </p>
              <p>also, self-confidence is important. when in a situation that you're unsure of, keep your head high and dont show any sign of you losing confidence. of course, you shouldn't be arrogant but you should always be confident of yourself.</p>

              <p>there is some truth in your view, but only to a certain extent, in my opinion.</p>
              <p>the world is not as pessimistic as that, ' true friends ' really do exist, and they are the few friends that would belp you when you need it, without expecting anything in return. and not everyone makes friends with ulterior motives.</p>
