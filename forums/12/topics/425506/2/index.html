              <p>Thanks for all the advices!! I'm feeling a bit stress now. Haha. Anyway, I don't really want to disclose too much information about NS and which Poly I'm going to. I don't want to be tracked down!! Lol.</p>
              <p>I
              know some of the mistakes I made in JC for me to end up like this.1) I
              was a god damn nerd, with nerdy hair, pimple face (have changed my hair
              style, pimple problem is at least 80% gone). 2) I do follow my
              classmates for lunch, but I never ate anything... 3)There was a period
              of time when I kind of isolate myself to concentrate on my studies (Bad
              move). 4) I joined other CCA that was not school based.</p>
              <p>1 thing I did right, I was and still is, quite fit too. In fact, I'm one of the fittest in the class!! As for looks, I don't know, average I think? I'm not muscular, but I'm fit, no tummy and got packs! lol.</p>

              <p>actually if you can survive through army. then i guess there won't be a problem for you in poly. reason being. army got much more fucked up people in it compared to poly.</p>
              <p>so i guess to survive as a loner in poly you jus gotta b more hardworking. i guess it would still work out. jus my thoughts.</p>

              <p><br>Exactly, after this job, I went back to school, I can even talk freely with the principal, and my teachers also said, I talk like a pro, so matured, and when I see my singaporean classmates, all still like kids looking for mommies. And that is where I become a business woman of today. Just waiting for Forbes to interview me.</p>
