              <p>Hey all. As the title suggests, how do I survive as a loner in school?</p>
              <p>I was a loner and an outcast in JC. As you could imagine, I was totally ostracised by my schoolmates/classmates and was greatly affected. My grades went down hill and was finally down with depression. I was then kicked out of school because of my illness.</p>
              <p>I do not like to talk much, but I always try my best in conversation and making new friends.</p>
              <p>I finished serving NS and am waiting for school (Poly) to start. I am afraid the same thing would happen again. Please help.</p>

              <p>Focus on your grades and results. Work hard, and just focus on scoring and doing well.</p>
              <p>Once you become one of those at the very top, people will start looking for you for help.</p>

              <p>Hey all. As the title suggests, how do I survive as a loner in school?</p>
              <p>I was a loner and an outcast in JC. As you could imagine, I was totally ostracised by my schoolmates/classmates and was greatly affected. My grades went down hill and was finally down with depression. I was then kicked out of school because of my illness.</p>
              <p>I do not like to talk much, but I always try my best in conversation and making new friends.</p>

              <p><br>Hi Benedict,</p>
              <p>You need to do another self-assessment, because you must be doing something wrong to draw friends away from you despite your tries to be friendly.</p>
              <p>From my experience outcast students are always the quiet type. Perhaps you need to start talking more. Also, smile when you talk if you dont, it makes the mood of the conversation friendlier very effectively.</p>
              <p>Good luck on your journey to make more friends... start right on day one when your poly semester start :)</p>

              <p>first you need to maintain a neat and tidy appearance. so people won't shun you.. you know people la.. always judging books by the covers.<br>second you can start by offering to help people.. then people will appreciate you for helping.. for those who don't appreciate you - close 2 eyes la don't get angry <br>third.. read some self improvement books and try to put into practice some of these into practice, one at a time.. <br>fourth.. when you go poly pls don't be a screwed up project mate. pls put in your efforts (also you need to choose the right project mates!) and study super duper hard and smart.. its true what Forbiddensinner say.. Do remember to join the poly events.. have a life.. you speak less nvm.. just speak quality stuff.</p>
              <p>Good Luck!</p>

              this is a phase we loners all go through. People say you don't have a life.
