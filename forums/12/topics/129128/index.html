            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys..<br><br>My gal just ended a 2 year r/s with me. Last week. I am feeling the full impact of this sad and depressed mood.<br><br>The reason she gave is that after 2 years with me, she now wants time to go out and catch up with all her friends. And plus she is pursuing her degree now, Its very taxing for her. My world crumbled, I cannot believe she wants to do this to me.<br><br>We were doing very fine and both our parents liked us alot. Apparently, she is trying to let it go now. I heard from her that she is fine now, and happier. She just wants to break free of the feeling of having someone to "report" to... I have never resticted her, unless she is going back home late (4am++) then i will worry. Her place is very deserted.<br><br>I think now its a case of she wants more. During this 2 years, I have done so many things for her and things which I did only for her and not the previous r/n. She knows it too, and she appreciates it alot. I think my mistake was to put in too much into this r/s. She simply pulled out of it and I was left picking up the pieces. I have to drink myself dead drunk everynight at home to make myself sleep.<br><br>Waking up in the morning for work is worst. Knowing that something is missing in my life and its torturing..<br><br>During this 2 years, what ever I did, I put her above me. That is why now, hte impact is much much bigger for me than her. Reason is simple, I put in more than her.<br><br>For some reasons, I have no friends and my social circle revolves mainly around her when she was around. Right now, I am so afraid to step out of my home.. Everywhere are memories of us.. HOW??<br><br>I totally have no mood to talk to anyone and simply lost enthusiasum in life. One conclusion made by my brother is that... She is not worth it.. You put in so much and she simply left you, w/o even hesitating..<br><br>I have send out many emails to her and there is no reply. But when I called her, she answered. Apparently, she still wants us to remain as friends. I don't know how to. Its very difficult to forget that we were once an item whom everyone envy us....<br><br>Right now, I am really at a lost. Can anyone please post some nice advice for me??<br><br>Lost and Lonely.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Almost exactly the same situation as me. Well, it's damn tough at first, because I always tried to patch up with her. The thought that there's a chance to revive the relationship made me keep all this problem to myself rather than letting my friends know. As a consequence, I became very depressed and lived like a zombie each day.<br><br>It was until it became very clear cut that she's made the decision and was strongly against patching up, that I decided to give it up.<br><br>Things got a bit better, I started talking to friends about it. I no longer hid the pain I had been suffering inside me.<br><br>I guess this is a period that we'll need to go thru after a r/s failure.<br><br>Ask yourself, are you going to give up on her, or still hoping that she'll be back by your side? Is she very firm on her decision, or will you be able to make her think twice? Also, is this a problem between just you and her, or is there any third party?</div>

In the end you'll find standing by their side is someone unfamiliar..<br><br>Drowning yourself in drinking wont help you in any way.. it does harm to your health too! The next morning you wake up.. is still the same.. So why torture yourself..?? Since she has already decided to leave.. and have already move on.. I guess you try to let go.. She made herself clear.. and i think she won't turn back..<br><br>What is done is done.. there's no need to cry over it.. Pick up yourself.. and lead your own life again.. Remember that your world does not ONLY circular around her! Try to gather some friends and catch up with them.. or join some activities.. or you wan.. you can join the outings in sgForums.. get to meet and know new poeple..<br><br>Cheers..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>During this period, keep yourself extremely busy. Your fav hobbies, places you nber been b4, things which you have attempted b4, meet new friends, find those old friends. It will help in a long term....Anyway, whatever we have said, you wouldnt be able to listen in.....your heart will be still with her during this period, hoping that she will come back to you. Reality is always cruel. This is the time where your mental strength comes in, whether you can turn this to a positive lesson.

A person does not just change overnight and turn against a loved one the next day. There are always signs to indicate rocky shores ahead in the voyage of love. Most guys just happen not to be sensitive enough to catch those danger signals in the relationship, that's all.<br><br>Yes, for all you've said and done, you do at least deserve some kind of explanation why your ex-girlfriend initiated the break-up. A "good talk" is definitely in order, but the problem is: In her mind, she may have already given you that "good talk" and explained herself clearly, so no more words is necessary.<br><br>If she refused to say any more, other than hoping you could continue to be her good male friend, then respect her wishes and let go. You said you've "been through too much", then take this one more setback in your stride -- one more scar added to the many you have received before should not make too much of a difference.

Maybe you are right.. Things just have to end somehow or rather. Along the way, I have made myself the best guy for her. She got all she wanted. I ask for nothing but I gave her whatever she wants.. Because I love her too much.<br><br>She told me that if she needs someone to marry to now, I will be the right choice. But after thinking over clearly, she said right now, she needs her freedom back and she is happy.<br><br>Its so yucky... arghhhhh. Actually the change started when she started school.. S'pore Institute of Management.. Before that she was working.<br><br>While she was working, things were fine.. We enjoyed every moment and she is just glad that she has me as her BF. Until when she decided to study...<br><br>Her schoolwork, social life with friends all came into the picture. We met lesser and it s fine with me. Do you think it was a case of her taking me for granted and thinks that whatever i did for he ris insignifigcant??<br><br>It hurts to think that whatever i did for her is no longer important. We even plan to go on a trip to on our anniversary in June. If she has seen this coming, then why bother to even discuss with me about the trip at all?<br><br>One sad man....<br><br>Hope to hear from you... carpe diem jur.</div>

Serveral people in this forum have post topic related to this issue(could be in different title) however, the answer or advise or suggestion is mostly the same. Do spend some time to read what others have advise and suggested in this forums.  I fully understand there is no such thing as two simiar situation however, it doesnt hurt anyone to read what others had been through.<br><br>Regards<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mal_colm1979:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi guys..<br><br>My gal just ended a 2 year r/s with me. Last week. I am feeling the full impact of this sad and depressed mood.<br><br>The reason she gave is that after 2 years with me, she now wants time to go out and catch up with all her friends. And plus she is pursuing her degree now, Its very taxing for her. My world crumbled, I cannot believe she wants to do this to me.<br><br>We were doing very fine and both our parents liked us alot. Apparently, she is trying to let it go now. I heard from her that she is fine now, and happier. She just wants to break free of the feeling of having someone to "report" to... I have never resticted her, unless she is going back home late (4am++) then i will worry. Her place is very deserted.<br><br>I think now its a case of she wants more. During this 2 years, I have done so many things for her and things which I did only for her and not the previous r/n. She knows it too, and she appreciates it alot. I think my mistake was to put in too much into this r/s. She simply pulled out of it and I was left picking up the pieces. I have to drink myself dead drunk everynight at home to make myself sleep.<br><br>Waking up in the morning for work is worst. Knowing that something is missing in my life and its torturing..<br><br>During this 2 years, what ever I did, I put her above me. That is why now, hte impact is much much bigger for me than her. Reason is simple, I put in more than her.<br><br>For some reasons, I have no friends and my social circle revolves mainly around her when she was around. Right now, I am so afraid to step out of my home.. Everywhere are memories of us.. HOW??<br><br>I totally have no mood to talk to anyone and simply lost enthusiasum in life. One conclusion made by my brother is that... She is not worth it.. You put in so much and she simply left you, w/o even hesitating..<br><br>I have send out many emails to her and there is no reply. But when I called her, she answered. Apparently, she still wants us to remain as friends. I don't know how to. Its very difficult to forget that we were once an item whom everyone envy us....<br><br>Right now, I am really at a lost. Can anyone please post some nice advice for me??<br><br>Lost and Lonely.</div></blockquote></div>
