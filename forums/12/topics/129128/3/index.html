            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Malcolm_1979,<br><br>No point forcing yourself. Take one step at a time, moving on seems so hard and hurt but remember, like what others has said, dun look back. Maybe she had thought of ending this relationship and she prep herself for it. Maybe she maybe self-centred but someone got to be a victim.<br><br>I am one once, life was tough, studying, working, kept dwelling into how my ex betrayed me, kept thinking of the wonderful, as well as bad memories, etc etc. but in the end, what do I get in return? Receive a news that she has engaged with her bf. Is this what I should be rewarded for what I hav done for her? If her heart has left me for other guy, there is really nothing I can do. Rather than staying in tha past, I would rather choose to move on with my life.<br><br>My friend told me that her aunt did not get married cos she had been hurt before. She is still single cos most prob she as no confident in relationship. Think abt it, do you want to stay in the past or find a new girl in future who really treasure you.<br><br>As what I have mention before, every relationship fails cos the chemistry has died off and when either of the party tried to rekindle a failing relationship, it wont last. Really need both party to be committed.<br><br>A couple of months later, you may be giving such advises to the next victim of a failed relationship.<br><br>Take care.</div>

One reason i'm afraid of starting a new relationship, despite being intensely lonely, is i know i have nothin to fall back on shld it fail.<br><br>Unlike majority of "normal, fortunate" people, i have no frens to fall back on, to confide my problems.<br>Though my last reationship was more than a yr ago, i'm still leading a very solitary life. somehow, i felt my recovery &amp; life in general would had been much better if i had a few close frens who cared for me.

Last week. I am feeling the full impact of this sad and depressed mood.<br><br>The reason she gave is that after 2 years with me, she now wants time to go out and catch up with all her friends. And plus she is pursuing her degree now, Its very taxing for her. My world crumbled, I cannot believe she wants to do this to me.<br><br>We were doing very fine and both our parents liked us alot. Apparently, she is trying to let it go now. I heard from her that she is fine now, and happier. She just wants to break free of the feeling of having someone to "report" to... I have never resticted her, unless she is going back home late (4am++) then i will worry. Her place is very deserted.<br><br>I think now its a case of she wants more. During this 2 years, I have done so many things for her and things which I did only for her and not the previous r/n. She knows it too, and she appreciates it alot. I think my mistake was to put in too much into this r/s. She simply pulled out of it and I was left picking up the pieces. I have to drink myself dead drunk everynight at home to make myself sleep.<br><br>Waking up in the morning for work is worst. Knowing that something is missing in my life and its torturing..<br><br>During this 2 years, what ever I did, I put her above me. That is why now, hte impact is much much bigger for me than her. Reason is simple, I put in more than her.<br><br>For some reasons, I have no friends and my social circle revolves mainly around her when she was around. Right now, I am so afraid to step out of my home.. Everywhere are memories of us.. HOW??<br><br>I totally have no mood to talk to anyone and simply lost enthusiasum in life. One conclusion made by my brother is that... She is not worth it.. You put in so much and she simply left you, w/o even hesitating..<br><br>I have send out many emails to her and there is no reply. But when I called her, she answered. Apparently, she still wants us to remain as friends. I don't know how to. Its very difficult to forget that we were once an item whom everyone envy us....<br><br>Right now, I am really at a lost. Can anyone please post some nice advice for me??<br><br>Lost and Lonely.</div></blockquote>are you handsome ?.. is she pretty? .. if it is, maybe thats the reason she went steady with you 2 yrs ago .. and maybe thats the reason why you 2 were once an item whom everyone envied ? maybe she went for your looks 2 yrs ago and is now bored of it ??<br>i have a female friend .. this is the reason she gave me on why she broke up with her bf  ..</div>
