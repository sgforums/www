            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Ask yourself...why is she happy now?<br><br>If keeping her by ur side will only strangle her and toture her slowly, would u bear to do so?  If she is not happy with you, why not just set her free?  I know it's hard.  2 yrs r/s and she could juz walk out of your life like that and seems to be happier than before.  It took me quite a long time to realize this...tho we always say 'loving someone is want him/her to be happy' but how many of us actually learn to do that?<br><br>it's definitely not easy to let go, forget the hurt, forget the times spent together, those happy moments...and be frens.  But it can be done.  It juz takes time..Until u wake up and realize that there's no point holding on..then you will want to move on and lead your own life..accept the fact that she has walked out of your life and you are back to yourself again.<br><br>I personally find it hard to be frens with my exs..I tried and failed..but at least I try...It's also a test telling you whether you have gotten over her.  It is quite impossible for you to be frens be her now but give yourself some time...time to get over it..and contact her again..truly and sincerely wants to be frens only.  It's painful..when you lost contact or dun even have the courage to talk to and look into the eyes of someone whom you love...<br><br>Like what Axel said, If you really love her, you got to set her free.  If she returns in time, you will know that she's yours.  Time will tell, but to got to help yourself get over it..drinking wun help solve problem..it will create more problems.<br><br>An end to a r/s brings you a step closer to the right one. </span></div>

(we often went out with each other's friends) It was only after 1 mth of persistence that I realised there's no way I can keep her with me. So, I began to confide in some of my closer friends, and it's definitely a gd feeling. I don't need to keep everything inside me anymore. (by the way, I find confiding in female friends easier.

Again.. err honest response yah?<br><br>I think you seem to be someone with a very narrow perspective in Life.<br><br>That's why when you are with your girlfriend, you dont seem to have other friends, and you are perfectly happy having a 'small life circle' involving just her. You don't seem to care much about your family or your work or have any hobbies. I don't know whether you are possessive or not, but I do know that many people like this have difficulty 'GROWING' mentally because they don't put themselves or willing to challenge themself to learn something new or do something different. In the end, as time continue, you will end up becoming a very 'stagnant' person.<br><br>Learning to grow out of a mentality takes time AND IS PAINFUL. Every learning experience is painful. Every rejection from friends, from possible lovers is painful. Every insecurity, Every sense of failure when you try something new and FAILED is painful.<br><br>My point is - the pain is universal. It is not yours alone. BUT you can choose to look beyond the pain to see what you have gained.<br><br>In breaking up with you, your girlfriend is setting you free. If you have been with someone who's personality is like you, the two of us will just obsess over each other until the rest of the world is lock up outside, feeding upon each other in a relationship based on need and dependency.<br><br>But, now, you have a choice. Like a bird with a cage door just open, you are now afraid and terrified of the outside world. There are big monsters out here, and you might not be as safe. But there's a lot of explore... a lot to see.. just waiting for you.<br><br>Be brave. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Why don't u tell us abt ur hobbies?<br><br></div>

Last week. I am feeling the full impact of this sad and depressed mood.<br><br>The reason she gave is that after 2 years with me, she now wants time to go out and catch up with all her friends. And plus she is pursuing her degree now, Its very taxing for her. My world crumbled, I cannot believe she wants to do this to me.<br><br>We were doing very fine and both our parents liked us alot. Apparently, she is trying to let it go now. I heard from her that she is fine now, and happier. She just wants to break free of the feeling of having someone to "report" to... I have never resticted her, unless she is going back home late (4am++) then i will worry. Her place is very deserted.<br><br>I think now its a case of she wants more. During this 2 years, I have done so many things for her and things which I did only for her and not the previous r/n. She knows it too, and she appreciates it alot. I think my mistake was to put in too much into this r/s. She simply pulled out of it and I was left picking up the pieces. I have to drink myself dead drunk everynight at home to make myself sleep.<br><br>Waking up in the morning for work is worst. Knowing that something is missing in my life and its torturing..<br><br>During this 2 years, what ever I did, I put her above me. That is why now, hte impact is much much bigger for me than her. Reason is simple, I put in more than her.<br><br>For some reasons, I have no friends and my social circle revolves mainly around her when she was around. Right now, I am so afraid to step out of my home.. Everywhere are memories of us.. HOW??<br><br>I totally have no mood to talk to anyone and simply lost enthusiasum in life. One conclusion made by my brother is that... She is not worth it.. You put in so much and she simply left you, w/o even hesitating..<br><br>I have send out many emails to her and there is no reply. But when I called her, she answered. Apparently, she still wants us to remain as friends. I don't know how to. Its very difficult to forget that we were once an item whom everyone envy us....<br><br>Right now, I am really at a lost. Can anyone please post some nice advice for me??<br><br>Lost and Lonely.</div></blockquote>You were too extreme on her.<br><br>You have no life of your own.<br><br>She's probably quite unlike you.<br><br>It wasn't about any restrictions or anything.. It was more like an 'emptiness'... Without a life of your own, how do you expect to fill hers up?<br><br>What you should be doing now? My advice is quit crying and living in self-sympathy...

            <div class='col-md body'>I say be thankful that she at least had the heart to breakup rather than leading you on.I find that to be more distressing,you will get over it though.Time will heal but if what she says is true,there is a high possibility that you guys can get back together,just give her time now though with an occasional chat,stop what you are doing now by sending lots of emails,maybe a talk once a week for now would be sufficient give her time and space.If she realizes that what she wanted is not what she is looking for,she will come back for you.</div>

Do you truely think that a relationship could survive on LOVE itself and deprive it from other components, which you thought that love is exclusive and other thingy have no connection to it?<br><br>This scenario should violently wake you up. (Or at least my coming words should)<br><br>No woman would want their man to survive on them, leeching them emotionally. People are telling you that you gave your world to her and that's so loving, you are an item everyone did envied, blar blar blar; I am telling you that your love meant nothing ultimately - what you have done equates to nothing. Loving? Then <span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>why</strong></span> is this relationship failing despite the effort put? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You will probably realise by now: You can give the whole damn WORLD to her, like you have mentioned, however what happens in reality is that, is she seeking for the WORLD or rather, your <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>GIVEN </strong></span>world? Kinda like trying to sell electronic products and advertise massively in unrelated-non target market channels like fitness magazine. Who in the world would be motivate to buy your products? Sure there will be customers, but it will make up less than 10 percent of your sales. Sergio Xyman Unorthodox marketing theory states that generating awareness doesn't guarantee sales - Unorthodox CloUdiSm states that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>efforts in love doesn't guarantee desired result. </strong></span><br><br>Interestingly, you said you have never restricted her, but that's in your own dictionary. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Reality speaking, you did</strong></span>. Restricted her as in she has to comform herself into having ZERO lifestyle outside her BGR. (This subconscious change is a psychological influence from you. A simple way to explain this is when we stick around with negative people, we will gradually be influenced into such mindsets, vice vista).<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> It's NOT her, neither it's something she wished to become.<br><br>The reasons she gave to leave the relationship are symptoms of your wrapped personality in love. The real underlying truth is that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>YOU had became someone completely different from what she has expected in the first place</strong></span>, something that your love has transformed yourself into. 'It's still you, but not you anymore.'<br><br>Seriously speaking, chances are, you wouldn't be able to reconcile. So you can drop the option of waiting or trying to get her back. You can resist the idea of trying to get a life, but eventually circumstances will force you to. Your karmic pattern will repeat itself again and again and again and again, until you gain the wisdom to realise what went wrong in your attitude towards BGR from this post.<br><br><blockquote><strong>One conclusion made by my brother is that... She is not worth it.. You put in so much and she simply left you, w/o even hesitating..</strong></blockquote>That's old school and is usually advice given by people with simple intention of trying to console. I will tell you that: Her departure HAS a cosmic lesson attached to it - the ugliness in your personality towards BGR. If it's not mend, you could either repeat what you have went through, or end up with an unhealthy relationship with both party sucking emotional vitae out of one another. And you would probably experience this thing called 'BGR ceiling' as stated in CloUdiSm. (Explaination would be another topic altogether)<br><br>P.S: Improve or perish from impoverishment. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

People are telling you that you gave your world to her and that's so loving, you are an item everyone did envied, blar blar blar; I am telling you that your love meant nothing ultimately - what you have done equates to nothing.

The real underlying truth is that YOU had became someone completely different from what she has expected in the first place, something that your love has transformed yourself into.
