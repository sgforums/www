Imagine how long you must work to earn that kind of money, by normal means, you work until you die still havent earn that much.<br><br>So you just concentrate on this 2 years, find a gal who really love you, treat you nice, and get married with her. But she must not know about this big amount of money you going to get. And before getting married, go for check up that she's healthy to bear a child for you.</div>

Absolutely. However the crux of the question is should he do it for money? Romance aside, if inherit money is what he is after in the first place, wouldnt that already make him less of an ethical man.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

These two are very different things u know. 2 is utterly inhuman but 1 is not so bad rite.<br><br>Not like he can just push the woman aside after getting the money.
