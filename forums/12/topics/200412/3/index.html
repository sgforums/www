Then on the death will, A's grandfather left a sum of US$1 million for A.<br><br>A's father didn't get any at all as his father somehow disobeyed the grandfather and married A's mother who was not from rich family. They eloped and stayed in Singapore and got married.<br><br>So basically you can say A and his family has been living in poverty for the past twenty years or so.<br><br>Then somehow there's a statement in the death will that if A is able to get married at age of 26 and able to have a kid by age of 28, he will get to inherit another US$5 million if the kid is a male. 2 million if it is a daughter.<br><br>So now A is 24 years old. 2 years down the road to 26.<br><br>A is still now single, and he has no luck with girls for the past few years despite his efforts in wooing. So somehow there maybe a problem to get married at age of 26.<br><br>So what should A do? Should he just anyhow get a girl to get married for the sake of money then divorce? or should he remain single until he met his true love (which maybe too late??)?<br><br>The money will go to charity if A is still not married by age of 26.<br><br>what will you do?</div></blockquote>A should just tell the granddad to screw it !!! Since gran think so much of status, that he is willing to let go his son.  This type of man money also want to take - asking for touble !!!<br><br>So what happen if A get married, but cannot produce a child ? You divorce the wife and find another wife ? Yep A will stay in the room do it till he die . Nuts.</div>
