Many things can happen in 2 yrs wor...<br>But seriously if not married by then, so be it. He did not gain anything, but he did not lose much either. Besides the $$$ going to charity is a good cause. But your friend should NOT get obsessed in getting married within the next 2 yrs simply for the inheritance. It will not do him any good. Your friends have 2 yrs to think abt it.

U think the high divorce rate is due to those people not knowing about true love? Why aren't their love always there for them?<br><br>U're wrong, love and money are not too different.<br><br>If u put in effort and care, love can become stronger and money could grow, making ur life even better.<br><br>But if u take things for granted, love will fade and be lost just like your money.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't believe in marrying for money. I think your friend should just try to lead a normal life as much as possible and let nature take its course. Should he really meet a girl whom he likes and who reciprocates his feelings, he should observe very carefully before committing himself and telling her about the money.</div>
