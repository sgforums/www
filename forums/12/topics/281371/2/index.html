Based on how I feel, I feel that what he meant by giving too much is actually 'love'.<br><br>Showing care and concern is definitely not akin to gambling. This cannot be use as an example because I feel that Love is not about gamble and hoping for returns, but giving unconditioned love as the main point.</div></blockquote>The instinct to protect ourselves is still there.
