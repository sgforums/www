            <div class='col-md body'>I think alot of young guys make the mistake of bending too far backwards to please the object of their affections.  The more the girl gets to do this, the more she'll think you've got no backbone.  Girls make alot of demands, but it's a way of sh*t testing you.  We ladies like to see a <strong>strength of character</strong>.  You give in too much, you're showing you've got no backbone.<br><br>Despite what girls may say to you, always remember that girls like a guy to be in control.  Not to the point of being a control freak, but be able to "handle" her.  For example.  At the 1st sign of disrespect from her, you make it clear you're not happy (by ignoring her, or talking very little).  Then when she calls you wanting to come out, you make it clear you were not happy over whatever thing she did to disrespect you, and the only way you will hang out with her again is if she .  If all you want is a kiss, get that.  If all you want is for her to dress sexily, get that.  If she refuses, end the conversation pleasant and short by saying she can call back when she's ready to make up for her boo-boo.<br><br>Whereas, most guys will just try to be "nice" to her, give her whatever she wants.. she will quickly get bored with such guys.

            <div class='col-md body'>Never give in too much nor do too many things for the girl or she'll take you for granted...... unfortunately, there's no hard-and-fast rule what is "too much" - you just gotta assess the whole situation........  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You give because you want to...<br><br>I think us human beings have this thing about protecting ourselves. There will come a time when we start to question whether we are doing too much, and whether we should stop. The answer to this is, do you think it is worth it if you continue?<br><br>For example, when you are gambling, you have lost over 1000 bucks, and you will automatically stop and think, have I spent too much on this? Should I spend more? You will spend more if you think the outcome is worth it, when you think that you will be able to recoup your losses in the end.

Try talking to her, let her know how you are feeling. Tell her that you feel that it is very stressful to be the one giving in all the time. See what's her response. It will help you to know whether this rs will change for the better or just continue to get worse.<br><br>Good luck <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Based on how I feel, I feel that what he meant by giving too much is actually 'love'.<br><br>Showing care and concern is definitely not akin to gambling. This cannot be use as an example because I feel that Love is not about gamble and hoping for returns, but giving unconditioned love as the main point.</div>
