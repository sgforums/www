              In our society, there are some groups of people who are less accepted by others.
                                Most of the time, these groups of people are different from the majority.

              <p>Yes, very important. Because our society is filled with too many bigots.</p>
              <p>People who r narrow minded, unable to accept differences and assume everyone must be just like themselves to be considered normal.</p>
              <p>However, if one doest care what these bigots think, then NO. </p>
              <p>But we all want to please our love ones.. No matter how bigoted they r, so YES..important.</p>
              <p>Therefore, it's all about your personal preferences n perceptions on what is important.</p>

              <p>To answer your question, being socially accepted is as important as you want it to be. Some people crave for that kind of comfort, nothing wrong, so it's important to them. For people like me, I hide at home all the time working on my dreams, I don't worry about being socially accepted, so it's not important to me.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, wanting social acceptance can be an advantage or a disadvantage, it really depends. For example I graduated with Masters degree and getting a job will net me about $8k/month. It is easy to crave in to family or social pressures to get a job. But since being socially accepted isn't important to me, I went the other way and start my own ventures. Of course I never felt happier making this decision. But assuming I crave for social acceptance and do what my peers do, I would still be dragging myself to work everyday instead of living the life I want to live now.</p>
              <p>So whether social acceptance works in your favor, it's hard to say. As long as you're happy with your life, I think that's the way to go. Because you only have 1 life and it's too precious to live your life any other way.</p>

              <p>Depends on where you are. If you are in spore then yes - if you're in your 50s unmarried - you tend to get stigmatised. People are fickle but that is life. Asian culture concentrate on the group's interests.</p>
              <p>If you are in the United States - single people in thier 50s maybe viewed differently because the divorce rate there is high and culture there is known for individualism.</p>
              <p>So if you think you are stigmatised - then better go overseas to somewhere culturally different.</p>
              <p>But whereever we go there is always discrimination so don't expect social acceptance. This is human nature.</p>
              <p>Ultimately it all depends on you and how you face up to being stigmatised.</p>

              <p>My take on the issue:</p>
              <p>For those who are too lonely out there,don't beat yourself up on the issue.</p>
              <p>In SG ,its a dog eat dog,every man for himself world out there.People may not bother with serious relationships.We are undeniably very superfical with our fellow man.This is brought upon by our materialistic sociecty.It may not be entirely your fault for not being able to make real friends.Most friendships nowadays wont get past the superfical stuff. </p>
              <p>To talk and ''be friends'' to others, you have to like what they like and only talk about what they like. Doesn't seem so  bad now right.You may have 1000000 likes on facebook,but whos going to actually talk to you on a serious level?</p>
              <p>My advice is that if you want something from people,simply ask for it and get to the point.Its not about who you are,its about your mindset.</p>
              <p>One who is different from the rest doesn't have to be metal,crazy or a lunatic.Its not like there is a standard absolute law given to us humans telling us how to think,feel and act. In other words don't send yourself to IMH just because of some emotional problem. </p>

              <p>My take is, if you are in your 50s, be it uncle or aunty, forget about marrying anymore, already half body inside the coffin liao, still want to marry for what??? Dun waste people time and your time, just be single, party and stay happy all the way.</p>
              <p>I am doing a project of making a retro afternoon on weekend for those 50s and above peoples, they can come and party, drink and meet each other, socialise and network, an extra income for my pub.</p>

              <p>Live life on your own terms. Being yourself is important because when you measure yourself against other people expectations, you're doing yourself a great disservice.</p>
              <p>Let me explain. If we were to judge a Cheetah (the world fastest mammal) based on the IQ test, we can safely say the Cheetah is a retard, because it will score about zero but we all know that Cheetah is not low in IQ. Similarly, if we were to judge a fish on how fast it can climb a tree, that fish will think itself is stupid for its entire life. I hope you see what I am trying to say. If you were to judge yourself on the terms of others, then you are selling yourself short.</p>

              <p>While it is important to be yourself, just how much is it "acceptable" in the context to be yourself. We are social creatures. Moral standards will affect the social norm in the environment as well.</p>
              <p>I mean like if you are an asshole and you hang around assholes, I am sure being an asshole is just normal. In fact.. being an asshole is encouraged.</p>
              <p>Birds of the same feather, flocks together.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think the best way about it, is to set you own standard. When you put your bar up, your morals and principles, then naturally you will meet people of that standard.If you cant, that can mean perhaps the environment you are in does not allow you to, or whatever reasons. But it is not always your fault. Maybe you are really stuck in a society of assholes and you but only the few enlightened ones.</p>
              <p>Unless you compromise yourself and sink down to their level, you will then find yourself in this vicious cycle of being yourself while trying to be socially accepted.</p>

              <p>Money can be a help in getting your socially accepted, but it gives you a fake acceptance most of the time, and once money is gone, you may find yourself in the most unacceptable state in the society. Just ensure that your money last and keep coming, with it, more or less you are serve better than the norm, but that does not imply that you are accept in the society base on your personality and character.</p>
              <p>You do not hv to think much about it, just remember these three words in your life, and you find yourself getting accepted in a normal way. It can come in any languages,</p>
              <p>Please, sorry and thank you.</p>
