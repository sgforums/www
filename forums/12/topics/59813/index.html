            <div class='col-md body'>Funny things are how we looked into handling of situations. Yr mind has been set to make him leave his bad company but u can't do so coz he's determined to stay there for time being. So when u can't get wat u wan, u started to get confused and seek for advise. Wat we say or type here isn't gonna do much help if u dun wish to take any actions on it and u will continue to live in confusing world again. When i mentioned time will change everything, i'm also implying that on you. Patience is not the bottomline but the last resort if u loved him very much. Then again, loving a person at this time and having to love him for the rest of yr life is another issue. If u do love him, love him thoroughly also, that includes who he is now and then. If u try to change him, that means u are changing the person that you 'll LIKE to have. that is not love, that is making him another 'property' of yours. Think deeply, is it what u wan eventually? what if he mention "If u love me, love me wat i am now and dun ask me to change!" to you? how would u react? Life is complicated becoz we never know what another person is thinking and drew up our own conclusion, but things aren't the way we thought it should be.<br></div>
