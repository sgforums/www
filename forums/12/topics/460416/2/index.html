              <p>whoah angel7030 I am quite appalled by your criticism. Isn't this the right section to post? If you're into storytelling, you're in the wrong thread. I don't have to prove anything to you or have you believe in anything. I mean if you don't have anything constructive to say, why are you posting in this section, it is quite puzzling.</p>
              <p>Thanks to everyone who contributed and helped me in ways more than I expected. I will look into the Raffles hosipital group as well as the self-help annoynomous gmail group.</p>

              <p>Wah must be very pathetic to wank at your gf's sister.</p>
              <p>I want to keep all my porn DvD also cannot because I stay with girlfriend. Its hard to wank when your girlfriend is around. My toilet don't have lock, so when I shower she always come in to take her tooth brush or her eye liners. So how are yuo able to wank?</p>
              <p>But whenever she's away for overseas work, I call up my cheongster gang and we go to nearest brothel, woohooo !</p>
              <p>I think you have low self esteem, after all you are a guy, you are made to swing. Come on, just get rid of your regrets and start being yourself, get as many one night stand as you can.</p>
              <p>I've been lucky so far but i afraid when time for me to get married I sure have to cut down.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> You seemed to have an awareness that
              'something' is not quite right; somewhat skirting around the border
              of promiscuity (or have your already crossed it?). Personally, that
              depends heavily on your perception of what defines a 'cheating
              behaviour' - apparently, you seemed cool about having light petting
              and kisses with others, hence your thoughts about having 'no sex'
              non-committed flirting relationship might seem to be 'alright' to
              you - but I doubt your other half could readily accept this
              arrangement unless this is an open relationship.</p>
              <p>It is always good to seek additional help if you could
              you feel that you are losing control. However, I just want to
              caution you one important thing: it is easy to give ourselves a
              label of 'addiction' so as to abnegate your responsibility of your
              action because we often 'attribute' the cause of our action to our
              'addiction', when in fact it is but a matter of choice.</p>
              <p>For example, have you encounter times when you need to
              pee, but because of that fact that you are in the middle of a
              conversation/meeting, you actually made the choice to hold your
              toilet trip until the conversation ends? Surely, peeing is a
              <em>natural biological urge</em> and it seemed crazy to stop
              yourself from going to the loo - we do put ourselves in
              discomforting situation unconsciously, due to variety of
              reasons. </p>
              <p>The only difference between my above analogy is that
              choosing to go to the toilet abruptly is unlikely to bring about
              serious repercussion from your significant other, while having sex
              with someone else behind your gf's back
              <strong><em>is</em></strong> a morally questionable choice. You
              could say that I have a 'sex addiction' and I have 'no choice' but
              to keep a list of numbers so that I could pick from the list
              randomly whenever I wanted, so as to satisfy my physical
              needs. </p>
              <p>However, the point is that keeping this option in this
              fashion is likely to ruin your relationship in the long run. Surely
              you could remain the way you are, but your outcome is clear - it is
              a destructive road ahead unless significant changes could manifest.
              In some cases, you might not get a second chance. If your deemed
              that this relationship is important to you, then given your current
              lifestyle, realistically, it does not help you to stay 'dry' and
              instead, promote this 'old' behaviour in an exceeding dangerous
              manner (clubbing/flirting/excessive engagement in porn, etc)</p>
              <p>I can see that you are contemplating; however, the
              choice between contemplation and commitment towards resolution on
              your issue is usually separated by one huge chasm - whether we
              <em><strong>really</strong></em> want to resolve it. If not, it
              will end up like having eczema on your last finger - we don't
              usually give a damn about it until our skin start cracking,
              bleeding and flaking. </p>
              <p>P.S: Myth buster number one: you don't have to be sick
              in order to see a professional. You could see a counsellor and just
              have a chat to understand about the scope of your
              problem. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>I find this spot on.</p>
              <p>Correct me if I'm wrong TS, but what I'm seeing is that although you're aware of the wrong, you are still proud of your sexuality and how girls are attracted to you.</p>
              <p>Like what Yunhaier mentioned, I don't think you're willing or ready to resolve your issue yet but just trying to find an excuse to abnegate your responsibility and blame it on what you call addiction. If this is true and you allow yourself to continue this manner and lifestyle, then you will regret sooner or later because this is more dangerous than what you may think.</p>
              <p>I have two friends, the guy has the same problem as you. He lost the girl he loves the most because he made her think he only treated her like one of several toys he used to get laid after she found out he had many nsa relationships behind her back. Few years past, she is now happy with an awesome guy but he couldn't get over her yet and hasn't had any other true relationships since then now in his 30s and wants to settle down, it's pathetic. His relationships are ruled by sexual attraction because he can't seem to get emotionally attracted to any one any more.He admited it was lots of fun but when he reached certain age till now, he feels really lonely and crazily longs for an emotional touch but it's just hard.</p>
              <p>You're lucky because your girlfriend hasn't found out about your other life. Yes she forgave you after that affair but if you continue to cheat on her and she reveals more, I don't think there will be a second chance as such. Even if she can tolerate your sin one more time, it's not that she will forget but choose to live in deep pain. If a girl truly loves you, I don't think she can accept you having that lifestyle. If a girl is cool with that, she is either after you for something else (money, maybe, if it's your way around girls) or she has no emotions.</p>
              <p>Hope you take it seriously as you said and your problem will be sorted out soon.</p>
