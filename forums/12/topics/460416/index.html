              <p>Need some serious advice / or simply hear me out.</p>
              <p>I've been lurking around here on and off once in a blue moon and there's something bothering me for a long time and I need to get it off my mind.</p>
              <p>I'm a working professional, below 30, getting married next year, we even bought our own BTO. I have a healthy and loving r/s with my gf who is a SQ cabin crew. She's pretty, has very nice body and all. A lot of people may be envious of what I have, but inside I actually felt very lonely (or not enough). She gives me a lot of attention but whenever she is overseas I crave to resolve my insatiable desire for sex / hook-ups.</p>
              <p>I actually have a list of contacts of flings to talk to and hang out with whenever she is overseas (which she often is). I went dinner/drinking/clubbing with them behind my gf's back. I know it's wrong but I can't help it. I just enjoy the thrill of the danger and also the company of the girls. We never have sex but mostly some light petting and kissing.</p>
              <p>Now by no means are the girls whores. They are also working professionals, some with bf as well. It's just we have had a long lasting relationship flirting and such, and I know my way around with girls :)</p>
              <p>I don't know what's wrong with me. When my gf is with me I am perfectly fine of course. But when she's not around, I feel like a dog looking around for a bitch to fuck (without the fuck of course).</p>
              <p>And the worst thing is, I may have a crush on her younger sister as well. She just turned 20 and I have already went clubbing with her once (just me and her). Though she looks up to me as a brother and a future brother-in-law, I don't know how I can control my advances on her.</p>
              <p>I'm not ready to visit a shrink because I know I'm not sick. Do I have a sex addiction? If so, how can I change? I have a addiction to porn as well and I can mast multiple times a day. Please help!</p>

              <p>I actually felt better just writing it down. I know it is self-control and you are right. I can't afford to lose everything. But I can't help it. I even googled 'sex addiction' and I even feel I fit the profile.</p>
              <p>I know this is a real problem and it is pretty rampant everywhere too. Maybe I should seek professional help. But I don't know where to start. Maybe that's why I'm here.</p>

              <p> Hi Foreveralone, my advice to you is DON'T do anything you may remotely even feel regret about. <br><br>You need not be sick before you see a shrink. You may not even need a shrink, just visit a counsellor and you might get the help you need.</p>
              <p>Unless you are willing to accept the consequences, if not don't do anything at all.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Need some serious advice / or simply hear me out.</p>
              <p>I've been lurking around here on and off once in a blue moon and
                  there's something bothering me for a long time and I need to get it
                  off my mind.</p>
              <p>I'm a working professional, below 30, getting married next year,
                  we even bought our own BTO. I have a healthy and loving r/s with my
                  gf who is a SQ cabin crew. She's pretty, has very nice body
                  and all. A lot of people may be envious of what I have, but inside
                  I actually felt very lonely (or not enough). She gives me a lot of
                  attention but whenever she is overseas I crave to resolve my
                  insatiable desire for sex / hook-ups.</p>
              <p>I actually have a list of contacts of flings to talk to and hang
                  out with whenever she is overseas (which she often is). I went
                  dinner/drinking/clubbing with them behind my gf's back. I know it's
                  wrong but I can't help it. I just enjoy the thrill of the danger
                  and also the company of the girls. We never have sex but mostly
                  some light petting and kissing.</p>
              <p>Now by no means are the girls whores. They are also working
                  professionals, some with bf as well. It's just we have had a long
                  lasting relationship flirting and such, and I know my way around
                  with girls :)</p>
              <p>I don't know what's wrong with me. When my gf is with me I am
                  perfectly fine of course. But when she's not around, I feel like a
                  dog looking around for a bitch to fuck (without the fuck of
                  course).</p>
              <p>And the worst thing is, I may have a crush on her younger sister
                  as well. She just turned 20 and I have already went clubbing with
                  her once (just me and her). Though she looks up to me as a brother
                  and a future brother-in-law, I don't know how I can control my
                  advances on her.</p>
              <p>I'm not ready to visit a shrink because I know I'm not sick. Do
                  I have a sex addiction? If so, how can I change? I have a addiction
                  to porn as well and I can mast multiple times a day. Please
                  help!</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p class="MsoNormal"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> You seemed to have an awareness that 'something' is not
                  quite right; somewhat skirting around the border of promiscuity (or have your
                  already crossed it?). Personally, that depends heavily on your perception of
                  what defines a 'cheating behaviour' - apparently, you seemed cool about having
                  light petting and kisses with others, hence your thoughts about having 'no sex'
                  non-committed flirting relationship might seem to be 'alright' to you - but I doubt
                  your other half could readily accept this arrangement unless this is an open
                  relationship.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">It is always good to seek additional help if you could you
                  feel that you are losing control. However, I just want to caution you one important thing: it is easy to give
                  ourselves a label of 'addiction' so as to abnegate your responsibility of your
                  action because we often 'attribute' the cause of our action to our 'addiction',
                  when in fact it is but a matter of choice.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">For example, have you encounter times when you need to pee,
                  but because of that fact that you are in the middle of a conversation/meeting,
                  you actually made the choice to hold your toilet trip until the conversation
                  ends? Surely, peeing is a <em>natural biological urge</em> and it seemed crazy to stop
                  yourself from going to the loo - we do put ourselves in discomforting situation
                  unconsciously, due to variety of reasons. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The only difference between my above analogy is that
                  choosing to go to the toilet abruptly is unlikely to bring about serious
                  repercussion from your significant other, while having sex with someone else
                  behind your gf's back <strong><em>is </em></strong>a morally questionable choice. You could say that I
                  have a 'sex addiction' and I have 'no choice' but to keep a list of numbers so
                  that I could pick from the list randomly whenever I wanted, so as to satisfy my
                  physical needs. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">However, the point is that keeping this option in this
                  fashion is likely to ruin your relationship in the long run. Surely you could
                  remain the way you are, but your outcome is clear - it is a destructive road
                  ahead unless significant changes could manifest. In some cases, you might not get
                  a second chance. If your deemed that this relationship is important to you,
                  then given your current lifestyle, realistically, it does not help you to stay
                  'dry' and instead, promote this 'old' behaviour in an exceeding dangerous
                  manner (clubbing/flirting/excessive engagement in porn, etc)</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I can see that you are contemplating; however, the choice
                  between contemplation and commitment towards resolution on your issue is
                  usually separated by one huge chasm - whether we <em><strong>really </strong></em>want to resolve it. If
                  not, it will end up like having eczema on your last finger - we don't usually
                  give a damn about it until our skin start cracking, bleeding and flaking. </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">P.S: Myth buster number one: you don't have to be sick in
                  order to see a professional. You could see a counsellor and just have a chat to
                  understand about the scope of your problem. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

                  usually give a damn about it until our skin start cracking,
                  bleeding and flaking. </p>
              <p>P.S: Myth buster number one: you don't have to be sick
                  in order to see a professional. You could see a counsellor and just
                  have a chat to understand about the scope of your
                  problem. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>Thanks guys for the responses. I am sure I am not alone on this. It is an addiction, less of a choice, it's when self-control isn't viable, you know? That's why I'm recongizing it and this is the first step. I hope as well that I will be able to stop this before it's too late.</p>
              <p>I was actually caught cheating on her once and it utterly destroyed her world. She has since forgave me but then again, I know if this had happened after we were married it would have been a different story. She also didn't know I had intercourse with that other girl, otherwise she would have left me already.</p>
              <p>And this is one of the two affairs I had that she found out. I have already ended both affairs since that incident. I was actually having 2 affairs at the same time. It was pretty crazy I must say. Funny thing is each girl thought I was with only them. It was fun while it lasted...</p>
              <p>Maybe because I'm a Gemini, I think I do lead a double life. Any Gemini out there can relate to this?</p>
              <p>My ROM is end of this year. I hope I can improve a lot by then.</p>
              <p>The question I have is if I am stripped of my "choice" to flirt/swing, what is the alternative outlet that can fulfill my needs when my gf is not around. I must say it is the "variety" that gives me the most excitment and pleasure and there is nothing that even remotely come close to it (e.g. outdoor activities, friends, gaming). I even wank to her sister's pictures sometimes. It's like I have the complete package for me but I seek for more outside. Like I said, it's fun while it lasted, only until I'm busted. Think I should start looking into abovementioned consultation helplines.</p>

              <p>Most of this guys like TS are dreamer, they either get knocked badly on the head or get poked by some bad genes, but I suppose they can be good scriptwriter, too bad posting here.</p>
