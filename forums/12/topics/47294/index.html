            <div class='col-md body'>A certain daughter complained to her father about her life and how things<br>have been so hard for her. She did not know how she was going to make<br>it and she wanted to give up. She was tired of fighting and struggling.<br>It seemed that just as one problem was solved another arose.<br><br>Her father, a chef, took her to the kitchen, filled three pots with water and<br>placed the fire on high. Soon the three pots came to a boil. In one he placed<br>carrots, in the other he placed eggs, and in the last he placed ground coffee<br>beans. He let them sit and boil, without saying a word.<br><br>The daughter sucked her teeth and impatiently wondered what he was trying<br>to do. She had problems, and he was making this strange concoction. In half<br>an hour he walked over to the oven and turned down the fire. He pulled the<br>carrots out and placed them in the bowl. He pulled the eggs out and placed<br>them in the bowl. Then he ladled the coffee out and placed it in a bowl.<br><br>Turning to her he asked. "Darling what do you see?"<br>Smartly, she replied. "Carrots, eggs, and coffee."<br><br>He brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and<br>noted that they were soft. He then asked her to take an egg and break<br>it. After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard-boiled<br>egg. Finally, he asked her to sip the coffee.<br>Her face frowned from the strength of the coffee.<br><br>Humbly, she asked. "What does it mean Father?"<br>He explained. "Each of them faced the same adversity,<br>212 degrees of boiling water. However each reacted differently."<br>"The carrot went in strong, hard, and unrelenting. But after going<br>through boiling water, it softened and became weak."<br><br>"The egg was fragile. A thin outer shell protected a liquid center. But<br>after sitting through the boiling water, its inside became hardened."<br>"The coffee beans are unique however. After they were in the boiling<br>water, it became stronger and richer."<br><br>"Which are you," he asked his daughter. When adversity knocks on your door,<br>how do you respond? Are you a carrot, an egg, or a coffee bean?<br><br>Are you the carrot that seems hard, but with the smallest amount of pain,<br>adversity, heat you wilt and become soft with no strength?<br>Are you the egg, which starts off with a malleable heart?<br>A fluid spirit. But after a death, a break-up, a divorce, a<br>layoff you became hardened and stiff. Your shell looks the same, but you<br>are so bitter and tough with a stiff spirit and heart, internally.<br><br>Or are you like the coffee bean? The bean does not get its peak flavour<br>and robust until it reaches 212 degrees Fahrenheit. When the water gets<br>the hottest, it just tastes better. When things are there worst, you get<br>better. When people talk the most, your praises increase. When the hour<br>is the darkest, trials are their greatest; your worship<br>elevates to another level. How do you handle adversity?<br>Are you a carrot, an egg, or a coffee bean?<br></div>
