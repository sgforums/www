            <div class='col-md body'>Get to know a gal recently and get her HP number. Have been calling her and sms her but conversation has always been short cos she also say she was busy at the moment. But normally she do chat and reply to my SMS.<br>However, last few weeks, attempt to call her, but somehow nobody pick the call. Even sms her to ask her how she is doing, but still no reply from her. So uneasy till SMS her that if she dun want me to call, then at least sms me back to inform me. Then IMMEDIATELY she sms me say she was busy at the moment....<br>Like to ask all gals out there<br>1) is she just being polite to reply my sms, and just dun know how to reject me? Probably after a few weeks, she may think it is best not to SMS me back, which may be what she is doing now... BUT again, won't she took the opportunity to SMS me back not to call again when I ask her?? IF yes, why still SMS me to say she is busy, which puzzles me (is she really busy??)<br>How would you gals reject a guy who keep calling and SMS you, but you have no interest in him? Say busy?? Dun pick the call or reply SMS AT ALL???<br>Guess all guys here would be interested to know too<br><br>To all guys here :<br>2) If you are in my situation, would you keep calling and sms till she reply? I mean, how many of you are ALWAYS eager to know the reason why a gal gives you cool and hot. Who know she was REAL busy, and won't you be kicking your own butt if you make the wrong guess that she was not interested in you<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Girls sometime just need their space, the more you want to get to know them the more you tend push them away. Just relax for a while and take a few days off. For both her sake and yours. Start wooing her again after that but this time go slowly. Get to know her as a friend first and then drop little hints every now and then that you like her. The key is to not rush things and take things easy...<br>Good Luck~!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>=============================================<br>It is not a word, nor a single action.In truth, it can never be wrong Like the sunrise, perfect in every possible way.It is many things and yet it must exist In the small space of the heart.Once found it can bloom endlessly, with no cease.It can choke one's throat, bring one to tears...But it never hides in shadows or in darknessIt never feeds itself on deception.It grows with trust, honesty and compassion. Nothing less, always more.<br><br>Dragonlance<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Juz to make you guys confused, WELL, i only sms and call her once a week/2weeks!! Dragging to 2 weeks becos like you guys, I thought since she is busy, I should try not to push myslef over her. Also, the moment she said she is busy, I immediately tell her I would call next time and hang the phone. Sometimes, I did get so confused that I remember asking her whether I can call her again or is she really busy, and she said yes...<br>BUT AGAIN, I was wondering, maybe she thought I had no sincerity, who knows! Me trying to stay patient (like what you guys also would do), but who knows, I may be acting wrong. Nevertheless, she may be studying for exams now. Most likely, I may be giving up.... If I waited for her exam to over before calling and sms her, that would be more than 1 month!!! How leh....<br>Whatever, thks for the feedback  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, if I'm in ur situation, I will play it cool.. As u haf mentioned that u just got to know her, y not take things as it goes?? It could be becoz in her life, studies is her first priority.. She probably knows ur intentions, and somehow feels that it's affecting her studies... Dun think that gers are that insensitive. For instance, it's only when a guy is interested in a ger, he will ask for it, on their first meeting.<br><br>From wat u mentioned earlier, it seems as though both of u haf just met and just beginning to know each other. She's probably doesn't like the idea of revealing too much of herself to someone new.. Humans are like this.. I dun think u will tell meabt about urself if I just send u a SMS now rite??<br><br>My advice is take it slowly.. Dun make urself fall head over heels so easily... Give her some space to breathe... Get to know her like know u get to know any other female frens.. I dunthink u will SMS other female frens like u will for this girl rite?? Just imagine, when u dunno this person, yet he wants to find out who are u, wat u doing now... This could be wat's in her mind, "Who are u to ask these qns?? Even my parents dun ask tie me so tightly."<br><br>U want SMS her?? Say words of encouragement.. That's a gentleman.. She will be touched.. Understand her situation, treat her like a fren first.. U still haf a long way to go in life.. Better that u know her as fren first. then u rush things. Coz even now, I'm sure, ur head is filled wif her, can't really think straight too.<br><br>Afraid that u will lose her?? There's still plenty of chances.. the worst thing that can happen is both of u are together liaoz but both also not happy... only bring misery to urself if u dun know urselves well..<br><br>Think I tok too much...<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>
