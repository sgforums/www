            <div class='col-md body'>[quote]Originally posted by ahkeat:<br>[b]today, his family got some baby birthday and his dad invited her to go.<br>i asked her if she will not go, she said'i mit u tmr?'<br><br>i was sad..<br>as i browse thru my phone, i saw all those lovely sms that she used to send me n thought to myself that its all useless to me but think that at least she should keep them or do whatever with it. i sent all the sms back to her before i deleted them all away..<br><br>she reply 'i used to love u so so much eh  i wanna love  so much again. i stay home u come over?'<br><br>She even goes to his family function?  That denotes how close they are.<br><br>She said she is numb about both of you.  if she is numb about him, why is she exasperated when he is angry with her?  if she is numb about him, will she be delighted to receive his call that she has to "dash to her room" to chat with him despite you were with her?<br><br>Truth is, she is numbt about you, not him.<br><br>You asked what you should do.  Ask yourself.  She does not love you anymore, are you still going to stick around and be a spare tyre?</div>
