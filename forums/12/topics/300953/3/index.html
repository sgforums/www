'he' came in. 'he' was just a random friendster guy that pm her. 'he' was at the right time , at the right place. 'he' console her whenever we have fights, basically acting like a good guy.<br>i know of 'he'.<br><br>'he' have been doin alot for her. like accompanying her whenever she needs, no matter how late, like popping over whenever she needs company. these are things that im not really able to do. i got ns, no personal transport while 'he' owns a car n can go around as n when he pleases. im not rich so i do not have the luxury of taking a cab.<br><br>they got closer. 'he' started to display his true color as 'he' know she likes him now. 'he' keep asking her to break off with me but she didnt wan to and got angry n threw his wallet away. he was upset n went off, she went crying to me asking me what to do to appease him and she dun wan to chat with me becuz she needed to talk to him desparately. i knew it was over by then. i confronted her n ask her to pick n she picked me. i was happy but she was not goin to let him go, she said she still wan to keep him as fren. im soft hearted and thought she will do it(my frens say my heart super big)..<br><br>anyway, they were still on talking terms which got me upset  but i decided not to say anything as i thought she needed time. the dreadful moment comes, she started to treat me very coldly till i cannot take it n asked her(EG, when i was at her place, he called she would pick up the call n dash into the room. i was quite upset as the day b4 she promised not to hide anything. so i decided to leave and she remained in her room and didnt bother to even give me a call. she claim it was just politeness to move away to talk)<br>she said it not abt him. she say she feels numb abt me n him. she appreciate what i do for her but she could not reciprocate anymore. she dunno how.<br>she wanted to come up with some kind of mutual conclusion but we didnt really get to any..<br><br>im really upset now. shd i just get over her n move on or try to salvage this r/s??<br><br>she is a really nice girl. her character n personality is what is still keeping me.. haiz..<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> This whole drama mama karmic-fueled relationship between the three of you centered on one classic problem that always spark similar crisis - your woman's definition of love.<br><br>Her perception of love lies largely in the realm of emotions (CloUdiSm states the three realms of relationship is divisible by physical, emotional and spiritual); and the direction of this relationship is fetter by her intense need for companionship much more than love per se.<br><br>In other words, regardless of what Love means to you - if she doesn't have companionship, she strays easily. Such archetypes of mates are highly volatile and mutable - they seek to stabilise their emotions through the presence of their partner and they reckon such companionship as Love.<br><br>Not saying that Love doesn't have companionship, but when you reverse this equation - what I am saying to say is that not all companionships are love.<br><br>I was talking to my jie mei the other day and she suffers from this problem. Her rationale is that when she doesn't have her other half around, she finds herself easily 'strayable', especially when other guys are around when she is feeling 'low'.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You see, Love is a constant - it isn't a variable.</strong></span> It doesn't matter what your external circumstance is, but if this basic condition of Love still lies undisturbed, indeed, this relationship has transcends the need for a marked boundary to function as a 'relationship.<br><br>What kind of Love does one command, or wished to command, if his/her is so easily influenced by his/her environment?<br><br>Because a relationship is but two entirely separately individuals, with vastly different psychological mindset, personality and home environment, coming together - via freewill - in this imaginary bonds we call 'Relationship'. The truth is that we are not bounded into any relationship like what you could do to two items by tying them up with a nylon thread.<br><br>But we stay 'bounded' because in our hearts, we appeared to have melded into one. Therefore, in that sense, if we could detach this heart away from another just because the circumstance seemed 'fertile' for it, perhaps this love isn't functioning the way it ought to be.<br><br>Love never stays stagnant; it either provides growth or degenerates. Therefore if you cannot seem to achieve growth, chances are, it could be declining subtly without your acknowledgement. And I can tell you that it's not just negligence that is causing this .<br><br>This seeming-innocent-friendster-message-turn-into friend scenario is so gawd damn stupid. Let's preview the rationale behind this 'innocent' message.<br><br>Conditions before a guy would message anyone in friendster, that is not his friend, to 'ai cho peng you mai?' would be:<br><br>I) She must have looked attractive to him.<br>II) Please refer to (I)<br>III) Please refer to (II)<br><br>Duh.<br><br>Do anyone seriously think that guys message another woman in friendster just because he somehow, 'miraculously and mystically', finds her personality appealing and wants to know her? I think it's more likely for a guy to have taken fancy at her 34C, for example.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Understanding this, it's even more gawd damn bloody stupid for one to even buy such 'marketing tactics' employed by a guy through such medium. But the fact is that if it does happen, it only reveals one thing - that your woman will definitely not be able to withstand any form of relationship crisis because she is far too malleable and so easily subjected to 'mass marketing'.<br><br>And in economics, it's the law of supply and demand - she needed someone to be there, while he is seeking for one gawd damn bloody stupid woman to response. I can tell you that this guy probably messaged one hundred other ladies, spending his time prowling in friendster and sniffing out the more 'chio' ones. The other 99 probably don't give a damn.<br><br>The gist of his thoughts probably goes like this:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">'Oh, someone did response. That's great! Time to zoom in for a 'catch'. Oh, got boyfriend? Who gives a damn. Army ar? Great! Because girlfriend sure kanna neglected one. Wah this woman very emo somemore. Good good. Bf no money, lagi best. Kanna-neglect-plus-emo-woman is best recipe for a snatch thief like me! Wahahahahhahahahahahhahaa... chong ar!' </span><br><br>The classification of this technique, I have seen and studied previously is segmented under the umbrella of 'AOBD' - the lesser version and to me, the strategy is passÃ©.<br><br>Seriously, I say you deserve someone better. Personally, I cannot stand needy mates. Not because I am emotionally cold, but because my aspiration in life cannot be tied down by a partner who is needy and only seeks the companionship in love and not greater things in life.<br><br>In love, you need someone to walk your life with; side by side, hand-in-hand.<br><br>Not someone that craves for your attention to play with them all day.<br><br>In that sense, your growth will only limits itself to companionship and you will never grow out of this shell to fully experience the extend of the true power in love. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

              <p>thanks guy for all your opinions. yeah i have broken up with her.  mayb in near future just keep her as a friend. i just met her ytd, i thought im ready emotionally to meet up. but i guess i was wrong.. im still quite disturbed when she sms -you know who-. looks like i need to stir away from her for quite awhile to let me broken heart get mended up..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and yeah, dun ever encourage any of ur friends to tear up some other people's relationship... its bad for everyone..</p>

              <p>Bro,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>you see, some people get over broken heart : 1. Fast, 2. Slow, 3. Never</p>
              <p>your "headache" now should be which category to choose.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If a lady vacillates btw two then there is no "true" affection and love towards 1 in the 1st place. Hence today u may be able to win. But tomorrow and the day after??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I gone thru the same experience like you. My category is btw 2 and 3. Hopefully not 3.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Let go.... Army life and buddies will be the true memories that you should cherish. Trust me when the smoke dissipates and the sun shine, make no mistake army life and friends make for the better part of life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Take care.</p>
