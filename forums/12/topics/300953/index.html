I paused for 5 seconds. For that 5 seconds, it seems like 5 mins with many thoughts running in my head. Somehow, this seems to be an expected shock. Somehow, I just dont want to give up. And eventually somehow, I remember the initial reasons on y I accepted her - To keep her happy. Because of tat, I shallowed some air, pick up the courage and told her tat it is better for us to have time for ourselves. During these time, u will not need to care abt me and able to do anything that u want for yrself. I will wait u for a period of 10mths. Of coz, she feels guilty, I console her and the conversation ends.<br><br>Of coz, I m not the give up type person.

How can my gal be so happy and so near with a guy who has feeling towards her.. and if she still keep in contact.. for me, i believe, its still more than a fren..<br><br>Ask this to yourself..<br><br>IF lets say this case is opposite. You're the one having the prob like ur gf.. if u somehow know a gal really like u and u know shes courting you, will u still keep in touch with her or always accept her call or sms? Will u do it ? and yet, u tell all these to your gf and let your gf jealous and worried bout u ? Wheres the logic ?<br><br>I dont know if the gal is testing u to see if u really love her. but the way shes doin it is just too much.. she should have stay a distance from the guy. not still keeping in touch even though its wrong...<br><br>Just break up. later she will know whom she should really pick in the future. i bet she will regret cuz that guy doesnt seem to be nice too to be 3rd party even though hes 25. Age doesnt matter here, the mentality matters the most.<br><br>Tough to let go the one you love, but doin the right things and choice will never make u regret in the future.<br><br>Good luck. Hope your gf realy know what shes doin. I hope she grow up and learn her lesson. This guy will somehow leave her one day cuz hes a playboy and doesnt know what is right or wrong.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think her heart has changed. What can you do to salvage the relationship ?<br>Thing happens and perhaps both of you are not meant to be. It is really nobody's fault here cos feelings cannot be controlled. It just happens that the new guy is there at the right place at the right time when she needs someone to lean on the most. Perhaps she is not mature enuff and strong-willed in her heart for you. Perhaps the love that both of you have isn't strong enough to withstand external intrusion. Since this has shown that the love can't be tested, then just forget it.<br><br>Quoted: "She was numb about you and him". I am guessing that she had been battling her emotion over you and him and come to a point of time that she became sianz about it. I don't think she deliberately wanting to cheat on you. I also guessed that she had accidentally fall in love with there third guy.<br><br>Yeah whatever it is, decide on some thing that lessen the pain for both of you. Yeah, can you stand her talking to there guy infront of you when she is with u?
