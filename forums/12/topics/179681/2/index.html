Seems like you know the value of friendship more than those who take it lightly - so don't change who you are. Even if you lose this group of friends now, at least you know you didn't 'betray' your own principles, which will last you in life far longer than any group of friends.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>being neutral means u dun take any1's sides, that way u dun offend any1<br><br>By being with the popular group doesn't guarantee that these friends/people will  be with u 5-10 years down the road, the same applies to being with the outcast  group. Some of them might even lost contact with u 5-10 years later.<br><br>If u want to be friends with both groups, just strike a balance. Say for example, fuss with the popular group while study with the nerdy group. If the popular group ask u why u are with the nerdy group, just say u gals dun want to study with u wat, etc<br><br>Anyway, u are going 2b Sec 1 next year, most probably u won't b seeing this bunch of friends, so why trouble urself over such issues, better concentrate on getting good grades for PSLE<br><br></div>
