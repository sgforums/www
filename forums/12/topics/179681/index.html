We shouldn't really belittle the teens' problems all the time... At their age, they can be quite emotionally vulnerable... And it certainly doesn't help when most of their friends could also at a relatively immature stage, and talking to adults about such things are deem as waste of time on trivial matters... As we can see EVEN FROM ADULTS... Some people can really take things quite personally...<br><br>Sometimes we should attempt to teach them to walk out of it rather than brushing their matters off as nothing most of the time...</div>
