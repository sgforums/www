I even dropped by her school to look for her unannounced to tell her how much I miss her and love her and we talked for a bit before she told me she needed a cooling period to cool off. <br><br>Honestly I was devastated and smothered her with messages of how much I love and miss her daily and even called her but to no avail during the cooling off period. I know I should not have done this after consulting some of my friends.<br><br>After 1 week she texted me saying she thought enough and that she came to a decision. That she don't think that we can ever resolve the issues that she thinks are problems in our relationship. I replied citing to meet up for her to break the news to me as a courtesy of our 3 years relationship and she agreed to the meet up after her upcoming exams.<br><br>I asked her to allow me to buy her a meal when she came over for the agreed agenda.

              <p><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> Certainty it sucks having to experience break-up during NS period - especially given that, though you may desire to spend more quality time with her, you are probably <span style="line-height: 1.231;">fettered by regimental constrains that shackle your time in a major way.</span></p>
              <p>She seemed to have made a calibrated decision and the mutual factors of physical and emotional distance would probably aid her to exit readily. Hence, your chances are probably slim - even if you win this single battle of 'winning her back' now - this relationship would not likely to survive a protracted war.    </p>
              <p>You are already doing your best in trying to secure a date with her insofar as you could brandish a fighting chance to convey what you need in hope of having to touch her enough to come back. However, my sense is that a<span style="line-height: 19.6959991455078px;">ny attempt at behaving melodramatically (from you) is likely to reinforce the symbolic message that her choice (to leave this relationship) is more likely to be right than wrong.</span></p>
              <p>She does not actively appear to look for resolving problems in the relationship; she probably gave up trying to manage them and calls to abandon ship - with or without your consent.   </p>
              <p>P.S: You might feel bitter over this brutal callous reality that she chose to leave you at this juncture - but perhaps some love are akin to bubbles; they are not made to last forever and burst instantly in face of gnawing adversity.</p>
              <p>I am sure it is amazingly beautiful while it lasted. Unfortunately, we can't control when bubbles will disappear - just like we have no control over when love will crumble from within. <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">  </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span></p>

              you love her but she obviously doesen't love you .
               she obviously thinks youre some sort of burden in her life and getting rid of you would be much better for her life. she would feel more at ease.
                      
              you get her back for?? 
                      
               to break up all over again?
                      
              well anyway if you wanna get back with her , maybe you can remind her of what shes got to lose if you and her break up for good. Love needs reminder ...of the good times spent .. of what was done... . thats why some ppl break up  and get back together in the end.
                      
              thats what im doing .. coz im in the same situation as well...to get back my boyfriend of 2 years + whom i believe i really cant give up ... &amp; i can say im nearing success... since hes the one calling me to talk to me now. ^^

              <p>I know that all what she is giving to me now are all excuses to start with. And as you mentioned getting rid of me so as to rid her of troubles. I wanna chase her back is because I really love her and I even though of having plans with her in the coming furture.</p>
              <p>From now until the time we will be meeting. I am putting all my effort into doing up a Jar of memories filled with 35 scroll to signify 35 days apart from each other. An on each scroll will be one memory of our happy times together. On top of that I am as well writing a letter to give her on that day as well as a poem.I hope this will be able to get her to reconsider as afterall its after her exams period and hopefully she will be able to think straight without any distractions.</p>
              <p> All the best for you as well ;) I'm sure you will be able to get back togehter with him ;)</p>

              <p>My problems had already been resolved. During this one month I have been looking into matters that my gf has mentioned as issues in our relationship. </p>
              <p>Therefore during this one month we had little to no contact with each other. Hence hopefully when we meet up I will be able to share with her that I had looked into those problems and hopefully she will reconsider. </p>
              <p>Althoogh i know the outcome might still be the same. But at least I walked away happy knowing I resolved issues that to her seemed impossible to resolve. </p>

              <p>Hey man,</p>
              <p>Smothering her with love at this point ain't gonna bring her back to you. If you want her back, listen to my advice.</p>
              <p>Break it off with her, and don't contact her for the next 3 months. Go out and meet plenty of girls. Get new hobbies. Starting working hard to chase your dreams. She will start to see what she lost, and her attraction for you will increase again.</p>
              <p>There are plenty of fish in the sea. <span style="line-height: 1.231;">After 3 months, if you still love her, you can casually ask her out for coffee just to catch up. From there, if you've really become a better man, she will see it, and be receptive to you.</span></p>
              <p>I wish you the best.</p>
