              <p><br>wrong... lend money can, but make sure you're a happy person even if the money is not recoverable... i usually give to my friends assuming it's really sincered but small amounts, a few thousands i dun have, a few hundred for good friends is ok i think. for my best friend, all he want to take also can lah. i even set half my will to give when i die.</p>

              <p>Hi, my father only has one brother on his side. I have never met
                  him before. I know from my mother he is estranged from my dad and
                  he is not living in S’pore. Nobody knows where he is after 40 over
                  years. On my mother’s side, my aunts are all old and some also
                  passed on. One of my aunts as I mentioned before lent money to my
                  older sis which she never repaid and somemore avoided aunt’s phone
                  calls. The relatives on my mother side are all scared to have
                  anything to do with us. I can understand that. Who want to be close
                  to our dysfunctional family. If no one there wants to help, I have
                  no authority to force them or ask them to do so. Such is life. Own
                  family problems ownself settle.</p>

              <p>Your parents and older siblings are predators. It is easier to take advantage of family members because we usually don't guard against family as much as we guard against outsiders.</p>

              <p>You would not be in my list of people I want to thank becos' all u really do is ranting. I have a hard time trying to read what u wrote and trying to make them coherent. My kids won't get to read this I will make sure cos' the things u wrote here are really hot air and firework. Talk abt standing up for yourself. I am standing up for myself now. How abt that? U r still a hypocrite to me. You persistent posting in my thread is not acts of forgiving more like pettiness, immaturity and narcissitic.  You prefer to attack other people's family and I emphasize here: don't act smart and asked me why I never stand up for myself. Ok? If u were abused as a child, do u think u had the strength, means and courage to fend for yourself? If everybody can do like what u said, there there;ll be no more abuses in this world.</p>

              <p><br>But hor, sista, family very hard to open mouth leh, especially family business, sometime in private corporation, you can just scold or yell at subordinates or superior, then walk off or F off, but family cannot leh, end of the day, still need to dinner together, so it is kind of awkward within family members to really tell you the truth or what they think, some sibling keep problem inside so long until one day...BOOMMM! kill the father or shoot everyone down. Do not think family no need guards, it can be more dangerous then you thought ya. Some people dun like to go home one leh.</p>
              <p>I believe each famlly also need to cultivate their own behavor and culture, it should be more toward a jovial and relax kind of culture, allow problem, allow mistake and alway be open and most importantly, happy and humorous like me.</p>

I am trying to keep a positive attitude. I will devote my energy, love and time to my hubby, my 2 kids and to my mother-in-law, she has been very understanding abt my situation.:)

              <p>hi starz... seems like there's a lot of arguement over here against cassey! lols... i've nth against anyone here but starz i jus feel that forgiveness is not necessaryily totally wrong. However, it does not work for you and will not work for you right now also.. Probably in future. Personally my mum have been a victim of verbal and some sort of mental abuse frm my grandpa and grandma back when she was young. Forgiveness came to her only when grandpa passed away and after we cut ties with my uncle. Forgiveness is always good to embrace, but not in all circumstance.</p>
              <p>Whatever blabber cassey has said, is in little sense correct but in full sense not applicable to you at all. Do not get heated up at whatever he says because this aint gonna help you in your problem but getting heated up clouds your views actually.</p>
              <p>I believe i asked about your husband. What is his stand on this issue? Since your issue is with ur parents side, how supportive is your husband in assisting you in dealing with them? I believe the last resort would be to cut off ties with them... if really nth else can be done to resolve the issue. If not, the anguish and anger you are feeling will jus snowball.</p>

              Hi thanks for sharing. My husband totally supports my decisions. We have in the past tried to reconcile but it didn't work so we decide to cut off ties with those undesirable people (except my younger sis). We are both staying focused on our kids. When I came to this forum, I was confused but now I know what to do. No one way/solution works for everyone but it works in my case.  I have come to understand life is too short to keep holding on to people who do not genuinely care about me. I want to say thank you all and take care everyone. :)
