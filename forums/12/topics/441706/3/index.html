              <p>To Casey1215: I did visit my father once with my hubby n kids even though my dad used to treat them as transparent. But forgiveness wasn't on my mind when I saw him after such a long period of time. I am just numb when it comes to my dad. I am more focused on the medical bills cos' forgiving really cannot solve the $ problem. It is not a priority for me. I find peace and freedom when I am with my kids, hubby and some genuine friends who care abt me. It's like living in another world, a wonderful one.</p>
              <p>To MasterMoogle even though u r not going to post here again but in case u read this, I did suggest to my mother abt using my CPF but after discharge, dad needs to go for follow up consultations, medication etc and she said these need to be paid in cash. Abt seeing MP, perhaps.Thanks for your idea.</p>

My younger sis is also targetted cos' she is married but no kids and she's working. My older sis no need to contribute cos' my mother always says she 's broke. I have been a stay at home mom since my firstborn and throughtout the years, every wedding,funeral of distant relatives, I am asked to pay more. She will use the same speech,' you all pay more cos' u all can afford it" My brother and me are not on good terms as expected after years of abuse. I dunno if he contributes and the amount he pays. But younger sis and me have to pay same amount even though our domestic situation is different.</p></div>

              <p><br>Your family has got a very warped aka crap idea of kinship and money... i believe your sis actually has a better place in their heart and condone all of her actions especially to you. It certainly would not feel well in your position. I think if you are feeling so much stress now, you probably should get your husband to make your family(meaning u and your husband) stand clear to your own family. No means No... ultimately you are a married out lady... use those traditional morale thing to talk to them i guess. Aint married not sure what i can offer you. But probably you hubby can come out to ease some of ur burden. Some parents and siblings are jus pure nonsense.</p>
              <p>As for cassey, nth against you but yes forgiveness is correct, but it is not applicable on every case and scenario, as for TS, i feel forgiveness is not quite possible. Too much of bottled up things and it all takes time. It does not help when TS is facing a immediate problem here but we are offering a solution where we only see the effects 10 years later. Forgiveness is not easy, importantly, it takes time and support for that to take place. TS needs real suggestion in solving immediate problem. Forgiveness is all good, but not useful in this case.</p>

              <p>Always remember that in a family dispute, there are several versions of the same event.</p>
              <p>The perspective from the parents will differ greatly from the view of the TS, and the opinion of the other siblings will also be twisted.</p>
              <p>So it is best to just hold you thoughts and emotions, and try as best to be calm and keep the peace.</p>
              <p>Just met an in-law at the funeral of a great uncle. The last I saw them was when the children were in JC, now the children are married and have children. Missing gap is because of quarrels over money too. Which now seem petty, the amounts involved around $10,000. On hindsight not worth maintaining animosity for so long over that  amount.</p>
              <p>Help out a family member, where you can. Don't if you can't. Don't be forced into something you can barely do.</p>
              <p>And if you do help, be magnanimous about it.</p>
              <p>Don't as in this case, lend and then sulk about it, and spoil the relationship, and risk losing the relationship together with the money.</p>

              <p>ya, life is not long, money is a material, can be earn or can be lost, just take your lesson in life and move on. I got one classmate who borrow me 1k last time at Haig girl school, she was suppose to help her jobless parent to tide over the difficult time of financial recession, I broke my piggy bank and give to her, cos I rich mah. Then my dad thot I spent on barbie dolls, bought me a big elephant Bank. After so many years, I already forget about the 1k she owe me, we still stay in contact, and met up several times at some outing or school reunion gathering.</p>
              <p>During this year CNY, She and her parents visited me, which surprised me, cos I never old classmate's parent visiting me. My Dad and grandma was very happy to welcome guest, especially during CNY to our house, her parents drove a 7 series BMW into our front lawn. Brought along a big CNY hamper with a bottle martel bleu on top, her parents gave me a ang pow, after they left, I opened it, a cheque of 5 thousands was then with a small paper note written, "Dear Angel, without your help, we might not be here, kindly accept our gratitute for your help during our difficult time, thank you"</p>
              <p>I shown it to my grandma, she said that is too much, must return, but i took the money and went to korea for a wonderful tour...</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>To mancha, u can say lif someone lent money but don't sulk when things go wrong later. This isn't just abt money lent. This is abt family member borrowing money and then proceeded to cut off ties with u.I did not on my part initiate the breakup of the relationship between me and my sis. My mother asked me to call my older sis and offer an apology for the dispute. Are u kidding me? My hubby &amp; I are not pleased becos' there is obviously unfairness in this case where bad behaviour on the part of my older sis had been condoned. I can forget abt the 8k but  not the hurt. You know the term 'respect'?Basic human respect. We got none. Money is money but what is worse is getting your feelings trampled on and people not showing you an ounce of respect. Yes there are many different versions and many different sides to the same event. I am not perfect, no one is. Don't say over 10k a family can break up, even over 1k, there can be family disputes.</p></div>
