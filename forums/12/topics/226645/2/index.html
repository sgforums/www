Have you listened to hers 1st? REALLY listened?<br><br>You are still in a denial stage, so its natural for you to ask many questions and wished time could be turned back and such.<br><br>Can I ask you 1 question though: Are you in JC or poly or ITE or taking 'O' levels?</div>

As of this period and given the pattern of how Singapore education works, your A lvls are of higher priority at the moment.<br><br>Focus on this and take your stride in the rest. You have to be resoinsible for your life. Some more Christmas is around the corner! Woo hoo~~~!!!<br><br>Enjoy the holidays while you can because yor 2nd year is going to be pretty tough. Not only that, once you finished your As and enlist into NS, you are going into another phase of your life which you will learn more things. Then comes the life in University......<br><br>You will have to prepare and quite alot.</div>

Is there a mutual connection? Im afraid not. There is no chemistry any more. Girls are very particular about chemistry in this modern age, in fact all ages.<br><br>This relationship has ended. Episode closed.<br><br>Learn from this relationship. Just let go. Don't be like other stubborn threadstarters. It will come to no end. The more you seek, the less you shall receive. The more you apply pressure on her, the more she will run. Learn to face the truth and you shall become very strong.<br><br>doko<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> When you have obediently placed your love on a meticulously crafted, jeweled pedestal and worshipped her like some forgotten goddess - it's no wonder why you have to keep up/increase the 'offering' or 'tributes' to placate her unpredictable tantrum in relationship, albeit her rewards for your effort may not necessarily means genuine love on her part.<br><br>In simple: you reminded me of an idol/fan relationship. You being the crazed fan, would even give her the moon if you could possibly get it, while she being the idol may appreciate the kind of special... personal attention you are showering her, but that doesn't mean that the idol sees the fan BEYOND that of a fan.<br><br>I hope you understand what this mean because if you have to keep catching up and running after with her, eventually, you will lose yourself to emotional fatigue. As long as your goddess is angered, your fear of losing her supersedes logics and other emotions. Your unhealthy devotion gave in to her every whim and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>this relationship becomes an obsession more than being love driven.</strong></span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You may think that you love her very much, but looking from my angle, that's probably more narcissistic than you could possibly imagine. Like a crazed fan, you probably think that your affection worth the most cent and that the consideration of her love doesn't really matter as much as yours. CloUdiSm refers this as the Clytie complex.<br><br>You formed her safety net - she knows that she is free to do anything she desire, even if her loyalty becomes questionable because you are always 'beneath' her. You are NOT allowed to judge her because she is always angelic... even if the truth might suggest something else. Never have you walked beside her like a respectable boyfriend... always living as a lesser entity... alternating between a crazed fan and a zealous acolyte. This has taken place ever since she caught your eyes - it has begun from '<span style="font-style: italic;">...the coward who blends into the shadows like a chameleon...</span>' as written in your earlier paragraph.<br><br>How long are you going to keep up with all these? You mentioned that your rebounded-relationship belongs to an unfortunate category of a love bred from hallucination and interestingly, what makes you think that the one you are so crazy over is indeed 'The One'? By claiming that you know... you know... doesn't make it a fact: Many came before you in this forum and make the same claim... ultimately, they shed the same tears.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>With time, you will realise that you wouldn't be able catch up anymore and starting falling back... in which your relationship will degenerate further. </strong></span><br><br>P.S: Given your age and mindset, I don't think you could understand much of this essence? I supposed you have wasted much of yourself (and money)... revolving your world around her presence, which ultimately gives you nothing but tormented pleasure? With the absence of wisdom, one can only hope to finish repaying their karmic debts before they find themselves moving on. Evil as I may sound, you probably need more cosmic lessons and suffering before you could 'grow'?<br><br>Cheers</div>
