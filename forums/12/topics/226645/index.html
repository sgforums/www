            <div class='col-md body'>hi i'm really new to this place.. a friend kinda recommended me to this place.. hahas my story's reaaaaaaally long.. so bear with me alright? it may mean  nothing to readers, but in my heart, it holds such importance and would affect me for life..<br><br>i'm really down recently.. i've been in love with this girl from my secondary 2 class since i first met her.. i found her delightful and perfect, what i find to be the perfect girl.. i've always admired her from afar being at that tender age of having first trod into puberty.. she was popular in school, many guys were smittened by that voice of an angel and that radiant smile compared only to the sun.. unlike the other guys, i was never able to talk to her.. the others were buzzing around her like bees only to receive huge amounts of her attention, whereas i, the coward who blends into the shadows like a chameleon..<br><br>however, a friend of mine who happens to like her as well aided me in the 1st contact.. i managed to speak to her, not verbally, but through the internet.. i was happy for it was the 1st time i actually spoke to her.. since then, i seized every opportunity possible to speak to her through the internet, and looked forward to it every single day.. i existed in school only to see her dearest face and existed at home only to await her arrival on the internet.. that was life for me.. a little romance for my little world which consists of her and i.. wasnt before long did she ask for my mobile number.. i was shocked but excited.. i was euphoric in ecstasy when she 1st msged me.. i replied immediately and joyfully.. life was a bliss - i had her attention, me and me only..<br><br>through a really amazing twist of fate (and a little help from the kind souls which are our friends), we actually got together as a little couple.. it was even her who initiated it.. i was really happy.. but little did i know this spelt trouble for my little world of romance.. it was really great at 1st, but soon, our weaknesses showed.. i lost my best friend because of our little happy news.. my best friend abhorred me for "stealing" his dream girl away.. he spent a load of time on the emphasis that he loved her and she only belonged to him.. but when i took her away, he got upset with me and never spoke to me again.. instead, he stepped up on his efforts to woo her, to prove that he was indeed the only man she deserved.. i became jealous when he walked her to school and even walked her home.. it was stronger when i realised i could never do the same as he.. even as a couple, i still had no courage to speak to her in school.. crossing paths only made me turn away to pretend that the average looking floor tile was intriguing to the extent i had to stare at it.. we quarrelled a lot due to such events, and eventually, she asked for time out and what trailed was horrible.. i walked away from this relationship not only with scars on my heart, but the terrible hatred of the men in my level, for having been the most popular girl's boyfriend, currently ex-boyfriend..<br><br>i lost my friends, my results plummeted, guys hate me, girls think i'm a jerk.. i lost faith in everything i did and cried my holidays away.. luckily, i had a friend from back in sec 1, who was always there for me.. a kind-hearted malay girl who stood by me even when she was in a distant land.. she told me to be brave and get back what i lost.. to fight back what belongs to me.. unfortunately, all was too late for me..<br><br>sec 3 - a year which i suffered most in.. singaporean students generally enjoy secondary three as it is a year of leadership in your own CCA, great flexibility in work and life, as well as the attainment of wearing long pants for the guys.. hilarious as it sounds now, we were pretty excited about the change in garments.. the bells of christmas and the sounds of new year have past, but my heart remains in the year my heart was scarred with her name etched across the middle.. i lived that  year in much agony and angst as i watched her new relationship blossom into something sweet and tender.. the truly horrific truth was actually that the "he" was my best friend, the one i always trusted.. but no one dared tell me, no one did told me..<br><br>sec 4 - when hope rekindled for me and not too late as well! she was framed to have been a cheap girl who hugged another guy when she had a boyfriend.. "he" broke up with her for he claims the above.. i thought it was a chance for me, and yes it was, but it never revealed itself, for i was in love with someone else.. this someone else was of such purity and innocence that she resembled my 1st love.. i loved her a lot despite differences in views.. but i gave her up.. i lied to her and chose to stop loving her because i feel that i can love my 1st love again.. i believed i could.. i have no idea what harm i have done to my new love, for we both know that our feelings were mutual.. yes i did love her, but i loved my 1st love as well.. at this point i know i might be some sort of double crosser or any ugly term may be used on me, but i chose to love my 1st love.. i know that my feelings for her are real, and the new ones are just hallucinations.. i felt sorry, but i had to put my interests in front.. yet again, through yet another amazing twist of fate, we were together again.. this time, i had changed, i was no longer that spoilt little child i used to be.. i learnt to cook, clean the house, buy groceries and everything that i used to need a caretaker for.. i was more mature now for this relationship..<br><br>needless to say, it was a great relationship.. i loved her a lot and never did stop.. the love grew and grew.. it was amazing.. but then again, weaknesses revealed their hideous faces once more to spoil our relationship..<br><br>valentines' day - the day that lovers have their feelings grow way stronger and enjoy a happy evening in each other's company.. i felt that mine would've been no less, in fact, even more for i had done much preparations.. 76 red roses, representing 76 days of pure love and passion for my one and only, inconjunction with one outstanding white rose, representing the purity of the past 76 days that we have been together, as well as a perfect colour to describe the love that was in the air of our 77th day as a couple.. divine chocolates that outshine the word "cliche".. i had these prepared for our time together.. i was excited and knew it'll be an evening decribed only by the word "perfect".. however, she decided not to wait for me, and left for home.. without even looking at me.. i called her, but she hung up on me.. my heart was utterly broken as i threw the chocolates and roses into the smelly bin.. she apologised yes, but my heart could never be mended back..<br><br>the holidays soon arrived yet again.. a time to rejoice yes? but no, it wasnt.. gangsters from her college began stalking me and presented hostility.. reason was simple, one of them likes her and demand i leave her.. i was stalked.. i was even once followed to my apartment.. luckily, i stayed at a condo and managed to elude these ruffians.. i had a friend from the same college as her who helped me by calling the police.. i was safe from this situation, but not from their threats and challenges when he tried more and more to date her.. the biggest question was, why did she give her number away?<br><br>lessons during holidays were inevitable especially in our generation.. we had a date, which was i whip up something really great tasting for her to judge.. i waited for her for 2 long hours.. she promised to wait for me.. she said she'll be earlier.. she promised.. but yet, she was in the north with a guy who obviously has a crush on her.. she was watching him dye his hair.. i cried and cried.. i learnt that they exchanged messages frequently and even wrote testimonials that were mushy to each other.. she even revealed her password to him when it was supposed to be something that she and i shared.. she and i only.. he deleted much of the stuff that i wrote for her by hacking her account.. she said it was i who was hacked and refused to listen to me.. sigh.. i was really really hurt.. very badly..<br><br>bad things happened a lot between us over the year of 2006.. it's been more than a year since we've been together.. she's made my life really ardous and difficult.. she msgs other guys and denies to me and demands that i stop thinking badly of her.. she claims to have cut herself to rouse my attention but i've been in contact with her a lot and if she did cut herself to rouse my attention, there was no way i cant see any wounds.. indeed, it could be my inability to realise it, but i've always checked her hands for wounds, i never liked her hurt.. she says that i think of her as a cheap girl who only cares about being pretty and having the affections of guys.. she says that i think that the only reason she's with me is so that she could make use of my affections for her.. but she's stopped smiling at the things i give her.. i always buy her things that she wanted, no matter the cost.. at first, she was greatly delighted and so was i.. soon, that delight faded away into emptiness.. i miss her joy and laughter.. i miss her purity and love.. i love her a lot, more than anybody else.. that's for sure.. i know it, i just know it..<br><br>right now, she told me not to talk to her until the day i stop thinking of her as a cheap girl who just wants to look pretty and seek affection of guys and want to make use of me monetarily and emotionally.. she added that she'll continue loving me till the day i can change that mindset.. this is the 2nd time she's told me to change.. the 1st time we broke up, she said the same to me.. i gave in the first time, but i'm not sure if i should this time, cos i really dun think it's my fault this time.. please help me.. i love her a lot.. more than anything... i've thrown a lot away, even my future when i decided to stay in singapore for studies.. help me..<br><br>if you happen to know who i really am when you read this story or recognise my user id, please dun tell her.. please.. i'm really desperate that's why i'm turning to this..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Everyone has a story to tell. And wow, you indeed have gone through quite a lot of rough times!<br><br>However, you are still young. Take this as an experience. I feel that romance at your age is mostly puppy love, pardon me for saying that, but, it's the fact.<br><br>Throughout the story I realized one thing - that you kept focusing on that girl.. as if she's your life and you can't live without her. That's the beginning of your downfall you see. Being too dependent on your partner will spell disaster for the r/s. Both parties (especially the girl) will soon become tired (if the guy is becoming too dependent on her affection). Don't ever let this happen again in future.<br><br>Take this time off and do some other stuffs. Make more friends again since you've lost quite a number some time ago. Do new things and learn new stuffs also.<br><br>Cheers!</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Let me try to summarise while I possibly can at best:<br><br>1. You are obsessed with her due to the fact she is your 1st love.<br><br>2. You shower your attention to her 100% and neglect many others because you have no idea how to handle a relationship with another person well.<br><br>3. You do not trust her 100%. Not to worry, she trust you even less.<br><br>4. You have no idea what to do next after all the mess you are in.<br><br>5. You cannot forget her easily after all the time, $$$, energy and many other things you invested in.<br><br>6. This has affected your life in general.<br><br>7. You even rejected another potential love that could blossom even better because you cling on a slim hope that you can get back together with your 1st love.<br><br>I have many options for you to consider. It may have a severe impact on you and the people around you should you choose any of the suggestions I made. So THINK carefully...<br><br>1. Carry on having the slim hope of getting her back. What may happen is that you carry on neglecting many things and future developments of your life and others while you wait.<br><br>2. Let her go and rebuild your life and relationship with the people around you. You may feel something gnawing at your heart initially, especially whenever you see her or think of her but you can get to build up a better relationship with people and better yourself in person while you are at it.<br><br>3. You can attempt to be a "bad guy" and make mess of what is already a mess in this part of your life and grow up to be a jerk.<br><br>4. You can find someone mature, a teacher you trust, or parents whom you are comfortable with or counsellor or anybody who can give you sound advices and help you recover alog the road.<br><br>There are more severe and extreme options which I think you can do away with. Actually I think you have a rough idea of what you are about to next.<br><br>Just remember: a chapter in your life has finished, flip to the next to see what new stuffs await you. It is good though you penned your issue here as you are willing to trust this to the readers here. Thank you and I pray for you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yeah, agree to Bontakun's words.<br><br>Seriously, just move on already. At first it may seem like the impossible and your world revolves around her being in it, but you will come to realise after letting go that there are many things out there for you still. Studies, girls, comfort, games etc. All these things are out there still for you, not just her.<br><br>Change your mindset and your thinking now, either live in despair or brighten up and live on. Everybody hits a rough patch now and then, but at least they try getting past it, not dwell on how pathetic or sad they are. Of course, you must give yourself a certain time to heal and carry on. Remember to expand your social circle too, it helps!<br><br>Its a tough year, but look forward to the next year for more new hopes, new life and new obstacles.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, firstly i would like to say it sucks having such a kind of feeling/relationship at this type of time and u are feeling down about it especially when its the festive season.<br><br>But from reading what u have wrote, u're still young and maybe its time to move on. Expand your social circle, get to know more people around you.<br><br>Ask yourself this question, u might think that she is the "one" for u. But by expanding ur social circle, u might get to know others who might be also the "one" for u. Think long term, is she really the "one" u want to marry next time, marriage is not a joking matter. Its no fun and games, maybe exploring your options would be good.<br><br>Lastly, i actually dun advise starting a relationship from young unless u know what u are doing. Its can be just the looks, personality and character of a person that makes u attracted to him/her, but will she stay on like this forever, are u able to be patient with him/her forever? When it comes to marriage and having kids, these are 2 different things to consider from a relationship. When u are older like about 20/30+, can u live on with her forever and stay happy. No marriage/girl/thing is perfect in this world, think long term so as it will maximise ur happiness between both party.<br><br>I would advice that u move on... Good Luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

But I think you are just one of her little puppies.<br><br>doko</div></blockquote>i will disagree with doko on this one. i share the same sentiments of, to put it bluntly, dumping her and moving on. but the reason is not because you are one of her little puppies. i don't think that she is that kind of person, because she wants you to change. anyone who loves you will want you to change for the better. but she didn't understand the fact that nobody can make someone change. a person can only change for himself. nobody can do it for him. if he doesn't want to do change, then too bad, there's nothing more that can be done.<br><br>i think that you should move on, because both of you are already at a stage where you two have misunderstood each other so much that there is no trust anymore. trust is probably what relationships are built upon. so if there's no trust, there's no relationship. that's why you should move on.<br><br>one thing to note, to gain back trust is near impossible. it's possible, but not within a short period of time. so if you want to get back to her, you have to regain her trust, and her, yours. but since it's going to take years and years to regain back the trust for each other, might as well move on now, because there is a high chance you two will forget each other and look for someone else.<br><br>in conclusion, move on because you two don't trust each other.</div>
