            <div class='col-md body'>I have E, E, O (O is for maths, other two are science subjects) for my A level grades, as well as B4 in GP.<br><br>I regret somewhat that I could not put in my best effort last year due to a lot of emotional turmoils. I loathe going to school, almost lost my mind because of it. Hai, to think about all my friends going uni and me being left alone in this condition is a bit depressing, but no use over crying spilt milk right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Actually, even if I did well, I will also not know what path I would like to take in uni.<br><br>According to my teacher, since I passed the A levels, I can only retake A levels as a private candidate. I don't mind that I'm given the chance not to go back to school, though I heard private candidates must have a lot of self-discipline. This is not a problem, but I would like to hear about what one should be doing in the next 3 months if one is going to take this route.<br><br>My teacher told me the syllabus would be the same. Have checked it out and it is. But I hear June paper is more difficult than the Nov paper. Should I seek out for help or ride it out alone?<br><br>I would also like to hear about those who chose to retake A levels as a private candidate in previous years, and how they fared.<br><br>I think my SPA was horrible because I am not very good at handling apparatus. Should I go for the practical paper instead to "put back" those lost marks?<br><br>Alternatively, I can go poly, but I am hesistant on this route because I simply do not know what I want to go for. It was the reason why I chose JC first, and found it to be some kind of mistake.<br><br>Overseas is not an option here.<br><br>And because I have the cursed minimum grades for University entrance, I have to fill up the application forms. Which courses would be good to go for? I have my eyes on NTU's ADM, but with a noobish portfolio (no previous art instruction, I only draw in my free time for fun) I doubt I will be able to make it with this sort of grades  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Would appreciate any other advice and information too. Thanks!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... only a few months to prepare for the june paper, it would be an uphill task for you. I think that most people would have returned what they have studied back to the teacher by this time. Anyway, try hard and get a decent grade to get in the university.</div>
