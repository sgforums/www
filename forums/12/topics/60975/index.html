I was rather taken aback but I was not aroused at all. The place was rather secluded cos we are waiting for our friend at level b1 in the shopping mall. I allowed him to so call "hug" me and didnt question abt it. I assume we just playing since we are talking abt gals and stuff.<br><br>What surprised me is tat the friend tat we are meeting had oso becoming "touchy". How ever he was oni interested in touching him... I just laughed it off... Three of us are good friends... we noe each other for abt 7 mths oready. I was oready starting to feel abit confused abt the touching each other stuff.<br><br>Next week we met again the same thing happen and I touched him more this time... we didnt kiss... yucck. I even sat on his leg and waited for the other friend to arrive. (he was always late)<br><br>This time the other friend touch him, I felt abit jealous...

I need some help here... thanks<br><br>I'm oready 21 both of my friends here are 19  </div></blockquote>It kinda difficult to convince and explain, but rather none of the above makes you gay unless you choice to follow your soul's energy (In my view, has more feminine energy). Your acts simply signify your subconscious needs - emptiness could be fill by anything. Your attachment to him is just a way to fill your void. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> As for your case - its a matter of choice. Your ain't sexually turn on by his act or him personally. Biologically, you are born a male (regardless of what you have been in previous life) and have to learn to be one. This is where your freewill is employed to choose the kind of path you wanna walk.<br><br>P.S: Nobody can influence you to become gay (although there are factors leading to it); overall, you made the decision yourself.<br><br>Cheers</div>

It is ultimately up to you to discover and get to know yourself better, if you're gay or not. No one better than you is able to provide you with the answer.<br><br>For sure i do know that i am not, absolutely, and neither do i like being touched, especially by male friends, less friendly pats on shoulders etc. I am definitely not someone who would sit on the legs of someone.<br><br>Time will tell you the answer, not to worry.</div>
