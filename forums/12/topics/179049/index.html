            <div class='col-md body'>I was reading through several similar topics in this forum. That was in the past..when I had nothing much to do.<br><br>It goes like this...<br><br>I had 2 great friends. My best mates I would say. X was a boy, and Y was a girl. X and I didn't really know Y at first, even though we sort of known Y 6 months ago.<br><br>Then suddenly since last year November, the three of us became good friends. We often went out together for movies and etc. We even walked each other home since we lived close to one another. Anyway..this went on until January, when I felt that my feelings for Y had slowly crossed the boundaries of a close friend.<br><br>Anyways..I brushed it off as myself thinking too much la. Didn't dare to try anything funny too, cause I had a previous experience of BGR which ended pretty badly. So I didn't ask for much, just hoped that things will stay this way.  But after some time when the feeling didn't subside, I thought "Yea...maybe I've really fallen for her".<br><br>I mean it's like....she was the only one that was able to motivate me to study the subjects I usually hated. She's also the one that made me feel good about myself.<br><br>I thought of maybe confessing to her sometime after Valentines. Sometime when I would walk her home at night. But somehow...there was also slight rumours that my friend X liked Y. Then last week, on the night I decided to tell her about how I feel. My best friend came up to me and told me he confessed to Y the night before yesterday and said Y agreed to be his girlfriend.<br><br>My mind just went into a blank la. It was so sudden. I was like..just suddenly lost in nowhere. I still had to force a smile on. And to take photos of both of them together, looking so sweet together.<br><br>They also said that they regarded me as their best friend, and I was the only one they intended to tell so far. All the more I felt guilty la.<br><br>It's just so painful to see them together now...(all the more because they insist I tag along with them). I can only force a curl on my lips when I've with them.<br><br>Tell me what to do?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>9 years ago, something similar happened to me and my 2 gd friends. X, Y and me were in the same class during sec 1 &amp; 2. I like X, am good pals with Y, but X and Y confessed to each other on New Year's Eve 1999 that they like each other. I was pissed off that time because I had asked Y many times before if he liked X, but he always say NO, and that was before I confess to him I liked X.<br><br>In the end, I realise that nothing is going to change the fact that they like each other, and so carried on being good friends with both of them, even though in the end they didn't get together. There's nothing u can do if the gal treats u only as a gd friend, u just got to accept it, and wish the both of them well. And up to this day, I still carry a torch for that gal, even though i know its impossible between us, and despite having gone through several other relationships. Now, i only want her to be happy.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by nanren4ever:</div><div class="quote_body">9 years ago, something similar happened to me and my 2 gd friends. X, Y and me were in the same class during sec 1 &amp; 2. I like X, am good pals with Y, but X and Y confessed to each other on New Year's Eve 1999 that they like each other. I was pissed off that time because I had asked Y many times before if he liked X, but he always say NO, and that was before I confess to him I liked X.<br><br>In the end, I realise that nothing is going to change the fact that they like each other, and so carried on being good friends with both of them, even though in the end they didn't get together. There's nothing u can do if the gal treats u only as a gd friend, u just got to accept it, and wish the both of them well. And up to this day, I still carry a torch for that gal, even though i know its impossible between us, and despite having gone through several other relationships. Now, i only want her to be happy. Doesn't matter if it is with me, or someone else.</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> ..</div>
