            <div class='col-md body'>CAUTION:<br>Let me just say LDR is full of sorrows... when you're apart you miss the person, then when you're together you await the day you part again... a vicious cycle...<br><br>Let me give you this formula:<br>As long as the days spent together does not exceed the days spent away from each other by a ratio of more than 1:1, chances are still good.  When ratio becomes 1:5, then chances are like 1 in a million.<br><br>Give you an example:<br>Before having the LDR, what is the time you were together? say 1 yr<br>Time to be apart: 3yrs - holidays(you see each other) = 2.5yrs<br>Thus, the ratio will be 1:2.5.<br><br>A ratio more than 1:2 is tough cause its 1 year of solid foundation but 2 yrs of ghost(anything can happen) foundation.<br><br>HOW TO SURVIVE LDR?<br>Lots of communication!!!<br>First, get boardband or DSL or CABLE and a headset...<br>Second, get game voice .<br>This is a voice program, very easy to use, its even connected to MSN program, so just click on the nick and you can talk for hours for free! Anywhere in the world! The most reliable as well!!!<br>Third, Perseverance and Trust... and most importantly LOVE!<br><br>Be sure to set 'dates', like lets meet tonight to talk... try to set aside a weekend a night to talk... during the weekdays maybe twice... and basically this is what you call, dating... without being physical...<br><br>Wish you all the best!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okay, my last post was for general public....<br><br>This post will be your you ernesttantan.... helping you out more since we share the same last name! =P<br><br>Well, its totally up to you... basically you need to give assurance to your gal that you will be able to provide for her. Tell her that you really see the two of you walking down the aisle... let me say this, but as a guy you should'nt lose confidence or show that you have no confidence...<br><br>Example, would you tell your men in war that we're going to die and that all of us might die? Or would you say, lets win this war!<br><br>Since you're working... maybe you can afford overseas calls on IDD... if you can, then try to look for cheaper plans as well.... I am sure your phone bill is quite scary!<br><br>Girls like surprise visits, well who does'nt... even if its just a day, so be it, for a special day... its the thought that counts...<br><br>5 years is bit hard to imagine and might be scary for the both of you being so young... Try to take it phrases... Dun think of the final picture yet... think of the both of you are happy and you should be happy to last 6 months and how grateful you are... you're the happiest person in the world to have her... such n such...<br><br>You have to give me more info in order for me to help you.... what I said is to sweet talk your girl and communicating more...<br><br></div>
