Myabe his frends can't commmunicate wif him, or parents or anyone can't be his outlet vent in life... that's how it usually happens.<br><br>On the other hand if he tells u specifically that he wants to commit suicide, likely he wun be..coz he's still has a clear mind to think that he wants to die.. however if he starts to tok funny abt things in life then u have to watch out.. saying things which is not the usual him... it's better to listen if not likely than not u know wat will happen next. Coz it's usually the person is trying to relate something to u. hoping for the last of hopes that someone will at least be his outlet. even just being a listening ear and gif him a shoulder or a pat will let him feel more comfortable and will at least feel that someone still cares abt him.<br><br>Well actially if u were to say cut the wrist I can tel u that's not the best method of committing suicide.. pple do that becoz they watch too much movies and did not learn much on biology... there's another spot near it will kill anyone in a faster time. but I wun say it coz this meant to be a aunt agony section so is improper to put it here.<br><br>anyway, Keyi are u facing any problem?? can share it wif us.. we will try our best to help...<br><br>I care, and We, Aunt Agony, care...<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)<br>~.~.~</div>

There're always 2 characters living in you.... One LIVES... The other STAYS....<br><br>[/B][/QUOTE]<br>From a psychological point of studies, it has been known that a human consist of his/her 'self' and 'spirit' (This is not a spiritual or fiary tale thing and has been widely applied on psychological studies..). Pardon me if I've forgotten the terms for them as I've always been a VERY LOUSY 'student'...<br>And your 'self' is one who is most of the time handling with problems in your life and doing most of the thinking... Your 'spirit' is the one with 'the light'. It gives you the 'instinct' which PERSONALLY I would like to think of as a RANDOM ADVANCE PROCESSING. A calculation done through your brain way pass your own 'usual capacity' and understanding that you would doubt if the 'random logic' that suddenly pops into your mind actually make sense or not? The 'spirit' reflects the nature of you and could lead you to an 'advanced stage' once you understands it well (Understanding yourself 'in a way'?). Real nature of the 'spirit' has been unknown but PERSONALLY, I would like to think that they're more than just a character...<br>When 'spirit' and 'self' works hand in hand, a person would usually feel at ease and with 'strength'.... When the 'spirit' and 'self' works in opposition a person would feel 'irritated', starts to hate himself or herself for some reason(s) or no apparant reason(s) at all.... STRONG conflicts between the two usually would result in some disturbed behaviours or psychological problems....<br><br>------------------<br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Using suicide as a way to escape the harsh reality of life is hardly a solution. Being alive is a beautiful thing. Do not abuse this right by doing things u might regret later. Whether there would be an afterlife for u to carry on is out of the question. U will never know until u have been there.<br><br>Normally, a person who intends to die would not tell anyone. He/she would just go ahead and commence the deed, leaving instructions behind to give answers. Those who cut their wrists are hardly seeking suicide; they just need some attention to their plight.<br><br>kofguy:<br><br>True. The fastest way to die in Singapore is to just go up to any HDB flat's highest storey and jump down; a straight road to death.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Life is plentiful.

The way he would react would depends on his ability, his thinking, the situation acting around him. No doubt a person can choose whichever way he would wanna react to the situation. BUT that is only built on a very basic surface level of a THEORY. A LOT of time he wouldn't be given that option to complete.<br>If only life follows the THEORY as it is, many in life would not have STRAYED or WORSE, PENISHED. Not all are born with a golden spoon in their mouth.. To SOME, NOT even cosy clothes. The designs sent into their heads might have already been distorted in the 1st place.

Why do you think 'you have to be in their shoes in order to say their shoes stink'? Because very often then not, mistakes are made not by only a decision... A single step, a solo stage.... It's a ongoing process... So COMMON, so PAINLESS... So 'scary'? When a person's shoes stink, it usually don't happen overnight neither... It's a PROCESS.... And those processes are just as plain and normal as the things we're doing now in life.... Falling in love is not a sin...? But perhaps hurting someone in the process is...? Driving a car is NOT.. Knocking down someone IS....<br>Bear... The things they 1st did were 'innocent'... Some might be 'very wrong' and acted upon out of harshness, while others are just plain HUMAN CHOICES... Just like the way we do MCQs in our lives... Yup... You and me... And very often then not we don't always follow EVERYTHING people tell us to do OR choose when we're doing those... Because IT'S OUR OWN LIFE... WE.. Want to be the CAPTAIN of the SHIP... Yes... Be glad that most people like you and I can THINK... While others NOT... And just too many possible factors to be involved here that the list would go on... ENDLESS... Don't mind if I save my breath? When formula of the chemical equation don't add up together EXPLOSION happens...<br>NO ONE wants to get themselves HURT or KILLED in the 1st place... MOST won't wanna HURT or KILL another... But for some their BOATS are already sinking.... That's what you people are here for...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Ease their pains.... BUT while doing this... REMEMBER, NOT to CONDEMN, BLAME, CURSE... For who they are (not?), but for what they are CREATED... (Through who's hands shall that be?)<br>I believe you people are here to CARE and LOVE for another... And sadly enough not many people learn to cultivate this habit of survival.... And as I SPEAKS of 'ARROGANCE' and NON-RESPECT, YOUR MIND is SINKING YOU.... You DID NOT FAIL to see me CREATED in MY EYES, in YOUR FACE....<br>BUT just as I would like to remind you... Our objective here should be CLEAR. To save another soul before becoming one OURSELVES....<br>AND your dissatifaction (I should believe?) you hold against me.... Should not be, though this is YOUR GROUND..... AND NATURALLY, as I'm a DEVIL.... My WORDS would be... 'WORK' come FIRST....

            <div class='col-md body'>I almost gave up writing to forums because there's nothing much of interest that holds me.  I get bored easily.  Like u, i like to be alone, and be left alone.  I don't remember crying at all.  Ok, i did cried once or twice before.  Suicide is for the birds, there so much to live for and many more to enjoy.  I like to write in your style... like a journal, non-stop all the way.  Not reading them after i'm done but knowing that i feel so much happier after its done.  If one contemplates suicide its because there's no longer any hope left in the world.  That's foolish, if there's no hope there's will be nothing to look forward to.  Don't u want to find out how life will be 10 years down the road.  How sorry your friends and relatives and parents will be, if something untowards happen to you?  Any after suicide what?  Does the pain and sorrow ends there, or will it be carried on in the next life which may become  worse.<br><br>Many of my friends have attempted suicide by swallowing 50 panadols, 100 panadols but these things doesn't work.  Swallowing dettol doesn't work... i used to scold them that they can't even do a decent job killing themselves.  Giving up on life is the biggest loser of them all.  No respect for life... is the worst thing a person can be.  Anyway, these things always pass after a while.  If u need someone to complain, u can mail me at jazz_1971@yahoo.com  I doubt if i'll be checking into sgforums now.  Excuse me, but life's busy and life is too beautiful to be wasted being stuck at the PC the entire day.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>[This message has been edited by Klactovak (edited 04 June 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, first of all... Give yourself a chance.  Stop thinking about suicide and STOP thinking that u're a loser because everybody is a loser in some way or other.<br><br>Even the very rich man, may be a loser when his children doesn't respect him.  But look on the bright side, I know people who don't have much money but i rather be their friend because they have a kind heart and not a vicious tendency to discriminate and look down on people.  Have a little faith in yourself, think of the happy things.  When u scored an A star on a spelling test, your teacher praising for being polite, that kind of stuff.<br><br>Now stop crying and go drink a BIG glass of water.  Then figure where u want to go in life?  Continue to be a loser or stand up and be yourself.  Remember people like Abraham Lincoln, he failed many many many times before he became President of the USA, Einstein being ridiculed for his slowness but see what he has made of his life.  Beethoven was short, squat and ugly (to most people) he became deaf but what about his beautiful music.  Try listening to his Moonlight Sonata or his late string quartets.  Thomas Edison failed a thousand times or more before he discovered the filament that can give off light.  You can be one of them.  In everybody is a seed for good or for evil... don't waste it.<br><br>Stop worrying about people's views of yourself because YOU are living your life not them.  Many people are all out to lower your esteem, don't give them that privilege to destroy your happy life.  Show 'em what u can do.  I think i better stop.<br><br>Take care.</div>

A bit but its never the end of the world.<br><br>Just live a little better at a time and don't worry too much.  Crying too is good for health.  It releases emotional stress but remember to wipe your tears when u're done and carry on.  Think about it.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
