            <div class='col-md body'>When a person wants to die, he won't tell you?<br>Wrong. He will drop hints here and there, just whether subtle or not.<br>Death is the last thing someone will resort to, so before that he must have tried other ways to solve his problems.<br><br>Dear keyi, if these all the problems you are facing, you know you are not alone.<br>When something bad happens, I will always tell myself, "At least it is not worse than this"<br>Why do your parents scold you for your poor results? If you are someone else's child, will they bother? They care about you and your future. And how your future will be, your results is important in determining its path.<br>There's this old chinese nursery song, "The world's mothers are all the same" But its not true, as parents are also individual with unique characteristics. The way they handle situations are different. Some parents are encouraging when their children's results are poor. But many others, prefer to scold and point out the possible source of the problem. What can lead to poor results? The most possible reason is, you didn't try hard enough. Of course your parents will think you didn't study. Do you want them to think you are stupid instead?<br>About friends, yes, it is sad to have made so little true friends in life. But would you rather make less friends or friends you did everything to help them only to be stab in the back? Friends that praise you up to the skies but bad mouth you behind? It is sad to say that when u miss the school days time to make friends, it is harder to make true friends as you get older. But it does not mean it is not possible.<br>Think carefully. Are you sure that you are good at NOTHING at all? Think think think again. I'm sure there is. Maybe you can't see it. But someone will. Everyone will have something you are more talented in. Maybe you just haven't realised it yet.<br>Ok, if I go on I will never stop. But really. If a person can have such great a determination to end his life, I'm sure he can put in that determination into living his life well. Its much simpler than slashing your wrists.<br><br>------------------<br>**I want u to be with me.....<br>be with me in the morning...be with me in the nite...with me when its dark out...with me when its light...<br>I want u to be with me...no matter what we do...just keep this reminder...of how much I love u...**</div>
