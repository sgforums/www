              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Hey guys. I need some advice. I've been seeing this girl called
              XY for awhile now. Recently, we just officialized our status as gf
              and bf. But the thing is, I found out through my sources is that
              she's acutally attached to 30 year old guy called C. But C isn't in
              Singapore for the next 6 months.</p>
              <p>Also, she's staying at his place for now. And when I confronted
              her about this, she said that's the ex-bf and she's renting a place
              from him. Although she said this was her ex-bf, I received news
              that they were actually planning to head to ROM end of this
              year.</p>
              <p>So right now, she thinks I'm completely unaware of the fact that
              she's two-timing me and she doesn't know that I'm aware of the ROM.
              My issue is how am I'm gonna put it across to her so that she
              becomes completely honest with me.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The world has changed alot indeed, nowadays gf and bf status can be "officialized"?</p>
              <p>Anyway.....</p>
              <p>Misogynist, you must know that even though you have "officialized" your status as gf and bf, IT doesn't empowers you with any special rights or authority over your gf. If you can't understand and respect that, then you are just another possessive bf. And I will not have any pity for you cos any girls who ends up as your gf will ended up getting hurt and their innocent destroyed.</p>
              <p>Do you really love her in the first place? Why do you even want to trick her to go into a relationship with you? Is there even a need to "officialized" your relationship status between the both of you? What are you afraid of? Are you telling us that your gf is NOT ALLOWED to leave you? Why are you even plotting how you are going to trap and force her to stay in a relationship with you? What does this relationship means to you? Why do you strongly believed in your sources but not your own gf? -&gt; How can you say she's committing infidelity when she's not even married to you and you don't even own her like her parents?</p>
              <p>All these questions are valid and they are also important for not just you, but for all the guys out there.</p>
              <p>Lastly, what is love to you? If love can be reasoned in a relationship, then love will no longer be precious cos YOU have already given love a value/price in your relationship.</p>
              <p>Think carefully before you do something that you will regret forever for the rest of your lives. Don't make the same mistakes that alot of guys have done in their relationships. Cos you definitely do not want to be one of them, and you are definitely not going to be one of them.</p>
              <p>You can make the right decision on your relationship, think about the reason why you want to love your gf in the first place.</p>

              <p>I guess this is the key. Or rather, it takes a backseat to all other emotions of TS'. E.g. anger, indignant etc etc.</p>

              <p>What I'm trying to say is, perhaps the problem already existed at the beginning of the relationship? I mean, what sort of mentality did he carry at the inception of the rs? What is he truly in for? Example: companionship, hence didn't really work at the emotional understanding of partner?</p>

              <p>My question here is: is this a hurried process or is the TS eager to hurry this process so as to "chop" (booked) her?</p>
              <p>More haste, less speed. Sigh... the problem of a fast-paced world. Relationships cannot be hurried. Intimacy cannot be rushed.</p>

              <p>Even if one is staying with you, you can't help it when one choose to two-time the other. "there is a will, there is a way", if the girl really want to find other guys while with you, there is no way you can do to try to avoid it.</p>
              <p>One advice. "Let go."<br>Cheers.</p>

              <p>You have to let dump her or let go.</p>
              <p>You could enjoy sex with her until you get tired of it and confront her with the situation and demand a break up. Or just confront her now and break up. Either way, she's definitely not for a long term r/s and is not worth it for you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And do wake up. Girls these days are not gentle, naive sheep. There are many manipulative vixens in sheep's clothing. When it comes to manipulation, whatever men can do, women can do it better.</p>
