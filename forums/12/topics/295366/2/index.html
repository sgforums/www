In this era, bosses have to change their mindsets if they want their employees to change theirs. If bosses are not confident of their employees, do not employ them. Do all the work yourself.</div></blockquote>You sound very defensive and unhappy with the way the forumners reply to your thread. Did they hit a sensitive note or hit the nail on the head? Must be or else why would you be so agitated? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So you don't like your boss to probe into your emails? Resign then! And start your own company and be your own boss. Then show your former boss you are a trusty boss and you believe fully in your staffs. You will not in anyway probe or spy into your employees emails.<br><br>But then usually hor once you become your own boss you will sing a different tune simply because the business is now yours! You will inadvertently has the duty to guard your business like a hawk. You don't want it to collaspe!. It is your baby! You make it a success and you are proud of it and in no way you want anyone to jeopardize your company. You wouldn't want your employees to betray or selll your secrets of success to another company. And then you will start to 'look' into your employees's emails because you suspect your employees may not be really that loyal to you!<br><br>Comeonlah young man/woman. It's a vicious cycle. When you are the boss you will do exactly what your boss is doing to you to your staffs too. Deny it all you want. This is how all bosses react once they feel their business is being sabotage. No dumb bosses in this world will fully trust their staffs 100% one.<br><br>Obviously your behaviour or your work attitude has given rise to suspicions to your boss and that is why he is probing into your mails.<br><br>Anyway if you are not guilty of anything so why do you feel so affected by what your boss is doing?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
