Worse, your boss can use that against you to give you the boot and not pay you any form of compensation should he don't like your face anymore and you can't do anything because you have violate the company rules and abuse your rights. Sure to die one. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks forumers!<br><br>Your views have been invaluable.<br><br>Just for the record, I always abide by company regulations and probing my work doesn't bring me any good nor will it boost my confidence. In this era, bosses have to change their mindsets if they want their employees to change theirs. If bosses are not confident of their employees, do not employ them. Do all the work yourself.</div>
