              <p><br><strong>Local U is for losers and farmers</strong>. Its not as if you secure a place in Harvard or MIT or Chicago or Oxbridge. <strong>Do you know how many Singaporeans get a place in the undergrad school of Harvard every yr? Less than 5. MIT? Less than 5. Oxbridge? Less than 5.</strong></p>
              <p>Do you know that local U graduates are called farmers? What's so confidence-giving about this? The only thing you should feel is hopelessness because all this means is you're slated for a life of loser-dom and peasantry. In fact in places like RJC and Hwa Chong, to end up in local U like the lesser mortals from ordinary JCs is an utter disgrace. Its so disgraceful that the number of places given out by the local Us is higher than the A level cohort. The excess in number is attributed to the poly grads. This means that as long as you make it to a JC, even the worst JC, you can get a place in local Us which is just shitty and disgraceful statistics.</p>

              <p>The term for local grads is farmers, it's widely used in the civil service and armed forces, maybe the younger people don't know that.</p>
              <p>I neither graduated from a local U or a top Uni,,but i do think its funny how these lousy local unis defensively come up with all sorts of rubbish excuses whenever people observe they are so shitty they don't have a single Nobel affiliation, yet when they do what they do best which is hooking up with top universities in "tie-ups" by throwing lots of money to them for free holidays to the tropics, they will boast about those universities' Nobel laureates. Its so funny hahahaha cannot ever eat grape so say grape is very sour.</p>
              <p>Recently, MOE announced the new university for top poly grads SIT which will offer courses from five top universities, it also used the fact that one of the 5 universities Munich Institute of Technology is a multiple Nobel winner.</p>

              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">MOE knows full well the local universities are lousy when measured by international standards, but it has no choice because these universities are managed by it and moreover with local universities giving out degrees to almost all locals who apply and lousy local uni forming the bulk of our so called graduates, they got no choice but to put up and carry on the wayang show. Whatever pathetic cachet comes from the endorsement of MOE itself, yet even with the state endorsement in play, it still commands little worth in the eyes of private employers here. The govt knows full well of that, which is why they send all their top brains top scholars overseas to top universities mentioned that take in only 5 Singaporeans a yr.</p>

              <p>I guess it's no "coincidence" that majority of those from loser (aka local) unis cannot make it in life compared to the 5 who make it to elite universities lah idiot. Its the laws of the averages. If i had a dick that didn't work, I'd most definitely subscribe to the belief that having a workable dick is not important. Idiot.</p>

              <p>The term for local grads is farmers, it's widely used in the civil service and armed forces, maybe the younger people don't know that.</p>
              <p>I neither graduated from a local U or a top Uni,,but i do think its funny how these lousy local unis defensively come up with all sorts of rubbish excuses whenever people observe they are so shitty they don't have a single Nobel affiliation, yet when they do what they do best which is hooking up with top universities in "tie-ups" by throwing lots of money to them for free holidays to the tropics, they will boast about those universities' Nobel laureates. Its so funny hahahaha cannot ever eat grape so say grape is very sour.</p>
              <p>Recently, MOE announced the new university for top poly grads SIT which will offer courses from five top universities, it also used the fact that one of the 5 universities Munich Institute of Technology is a multiple Nobel winner.</p>

              <p>haha, all I see is ad hominem attacks and fallacious peceptions on our local uni here. That's smart - how some people can digress from the focus of the thread to attack our local uni, just with the mention of local uni by TS.</p>
              <p>I will digress:</p>
              <p>To those ignorant prestige whores, I wonder do you even know the admission criterias to enter those UK and US uni - I bet you must have thought that straight As are needed to enter, lmao.</p>
              <p>Let me tell you this, to enter UK unis, like Imperial for eg, you can afford to even get an E for GP while you had As for your 3H2s, Ha (Even YJ ppl have been offered a place by there that too!). Try entering NUS chem eng., law and med and you will be rejected straight away.  For eg, I have a senior who has C for GP, As for 3H2s, is accepted by Oxford but is rejected by NUS law. Wow, our local unis are that 'bad' huh - and so much of the false generalisation by you ppl!</p>
              <p>You sound as if anyone who took A levels is guaranteed a place in our 'lousy' local U. And you said the no. of places allocated is more than the no. of A level students?! Any A level student who know what you said will be scorning at yr intellectual myopia. (Are you even an A level student before?)</p>
              <p>Go check out how many A level students qualify for those top UK unis, but are still choosing to get admitted in local uni - because of $ issues or they do not wish to be that dumb to sign a bond, not because they are peasants like you. Oops, thanks gdness all my 5,6,7 As friends - one is applying for nus nursing too - are not so ignorant to sign a bond just to be a prestige whore like you! Ha, you think going overseas top uni is all abt prestige and future. Lemmi tell you, besides abt quality education, you have the opportunity to widen yr horizons - to avoid behaving like a frog, like you! Prolly with yr sucky attitude, then the local, or even overseas, deg. u possess will be like a trash!</p>
              <p>And your engrish prease, it's atrocious for some parts of the post- pls avoid disgracing yourself. And may I ask whether are in those top unis too? oops, I doubt so, coz you said &lt;5 ppl (Lmao!) can enter Oxbridge every yr - it's so lucid that you are behaving like a frog! But if you are one too, you are a disgrace to yr alma mater.</p>
              <p>So who is saying grapes are sour now? (why this usage of this phrase in the wrong context, troll?) coz you can't even enter our world top 1% local uni? or psychologically bruised before? If you wish to troll, pls do so intelligently!</p>
              <p>Wait, do you think I am one of those prospective local uni 'frog' students speaking up for myself? Sorry nope, I have received offers from Imperial and UCL. I believe that I need to fight justice - through ad hominen attacks, unfortunately - for my fellow contemporaries who are insulted by lesser mortals, blighted by their own myopia and abhorrent attitude, like you!</p>

              <p><br>you are right</p>
              <p>but to me, 10 years is too big a gap</p>
              <p>7 years still ok</p>
              <p>dun forget, love aside, each year gap represents a different mindset of the generation</p>
