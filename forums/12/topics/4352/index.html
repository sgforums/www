It really shows that these pple really want to help.<br><br>There was even a time when I walk back all the way to find that person who ask me to doate. coz I dun have small change in the first instance... the person has done her job so will I do my part... it's just a couple of dollars.. these pple need it more than I do...<br><br>And there was this time when my fren was complaining that he's standing beside a broken radio.. coz I was there yelling, 'donations please'... Then came this guy who was walked back and put a dollar into the tin, i turned and passed him the sticker, he just say he donated, and this time rd he's doing it becoz of the voice.

Its like you have money donate, no money bo pian have to siam mah. We don't know the person, how do we know whether she/he do donate?</strong><br><br>i do experience times when i m really broke. However, wat i usually do is juz give a frenly smile, say no and walk away. If i've already donated, i would juz tell the others so, then walk away. Coz you give frm your heart, dun really have to be bothered if the others still wan u to donate.<br><br>'He who considers too much will perform little.'<br><br></div>
