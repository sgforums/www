              <p>THE LONELINESS PHASE: Feeling as if no one understands or cares.<br><br>SOLUTION: Surround yourself with people who do care, and who openly say so. Remind yourself often that you are loved.</p>
              <p>THE DEPRESSION PHASE: Feeling sad, worthless, and foolish. You may have trouble eating and sleeping, and you may imagine that you'll never find anyone to love again.<br><br>SOLUTION: Allow yourself to feel your pain, but do not wallow in self-pity.

              <p>These are my few dimes. I'm not sure if it will help.</p>
              <p>When one is depressed, one tend to see the world as bleak. It becomes an unrealistic view. Though the media love to report on negative stuffs like war, murder etc but we musn't forget that there are also tremendous kindness in this world... that didn't make it into the newspaper.</p>
              <p>You can try this method.Contemplate on the kind acts people have done for you. There are things that you most probably have taken for granted. For instance, Your parent's concern for you. </p>
              <p>Another example is that we depends on the toil and sweat of the farmers who plant the rice. Now, it is by kindness of others that we have food to eat. It is by kindness and generousity of your parents that you have everythings that you have. you can see, you can talk, you can think, you can attend a university education.</p>
              <p>Rejoice and be grateful for all the things that you have had.Rejoicing is an excellent antidote for depression. Rather than thinking about how awful the world seems, we make our mind happy by thinking of all the positive qualities that we and others have and all the beneficial actions we and others have done.</p>
              <p>And for the break up, it takes time to get over it. Be patience and kind with yourself.</p>

              <p>Haiz....Bro, we are all in the same boat. We all felt the same for you.</p>
              <p>What ever is it, it is just a test. It is a test of character, thus dun give up so easily.</p>
              <p>My wife left me with my kid in tow.....what worse can that be....I had only myself to blame. No one else can take the rap but me. I am not trying to say that my prob is gravier than yours, but I just want to tell you that there are people facing the same problem as you. For your info, my wife had left me for a year.</p>
              <p>Similar to ur ex, my wife spoke to me with a cold tone, laid with much sarcasm on it at all times. I cannot argue the fact that i am very frustrated about this, but there is nothing i can do to change it. What is done is done.</p>
              <p>Well, we all learn from our mistakes and hopefully to progress forward in the future. Sometimes, we still make the same mistakes, thats human nature. But what is important is that we must learn and push on, trying to minimize the same mistakes. </p>
              <p>{(Woman)}</p>
              <p>At times, i do not understand how can a woman possess so much power to change a man's mind. Well, as you had experience, she had drag you down much to the pit of malice. Learn, and understand why she left you. Feel, knowing this feeling allows you not to repeat the mistake you make.</p>
              <p>Straight to the point, all i can say, chin up soldier, there got to be someone out there for you. Someone who can understand you, Someone who can bring your trust into her heart and someone who can be there when you need her most.</p>
              <p>{(Friends)}</p>
              <p>I just had a big argument with a couple of my best friends over some very trivial matters. Haiz, once again, i overlook the pettiness in this situation, thus blowing a small matter into millions of debris. Now they are ignoring me.......Hiaz, what am i goin to do? TS, i feel sad but i am telling myself, there got to be a way to handle the delicate matter. As for you, look around you. What have you done to deserve so little respect from your friends??</p>
              <p>Not wanting to bore you, allow me to end this reply by repeating myself again, Dun give up searching for hope, there got to be hope some where out there. It may take days, weeks, months or even years to find the one you love. It may take a big man's heart to say sorry to a person, but it pays big.</p>
              <p>Kudo's to you for admitting your problem, least i know that after reading all the replies from the kind public to your topic, i got the slight tingling feeling that you are ready and prepared to rebuild the very foundations to your life again.</p>
              <p>Feel free to PM me if you feel like. I will be gadly to help you if i can..... </p>

              <p>Hi Sephiroth,</p>
              <p>I'm wondering have you been cultivating friendship when you are in a relationship ?</p>
              <p>Im going to ask u some questions, but instead of answering them now, see if you can find the answers within you.</p>
              <p>1) Do you realise that you will have to let go of her at some point in life?</p>
              <p>2) How much more time do you need before you will be ready to let go of it?</p>
              <p>3) Will you become less when you let go of it?</p>
              <p>4) Has who you are become diminished by the loss ?</p>
              <p> </p>
