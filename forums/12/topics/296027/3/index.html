            <div class='col-md body'>Hello dear (:<br><br>I've just typed one long post, but something went wrong and now I have to type it again (darn). But I'll cut to the point.<br><br>Please stop drinking your nights away, you know it does not solve anything, so stop doing it. Instead of thinking about her 24/7, build a wall around that thought, and do something to get that out of your mind. Hang out with your friends, make new ones, get a hobby. Anything but drown yourself in alcohol.<br><br>If I were you, I'd break up with her, even if it hurts me. Being hurt by her is much worse, in my opinion.<br><br>Why break up, you may ask.<br>There are two reasons - you can find out her true feelings, and maybe get rid of all the suffering you are going through.<br><br>There are 2 possible situations during the break up scene:<br>1) She'll accept it, no questions asked (or maybe just a "Why ?").<br><br>If this is the case, then you have made the right choice in breaking up with her, because if she does not show emotion, it means she does not feel as strongly for you as you do for her. And you deserve more than that.<br><br>2) She'll show emotion, cry, and ask questions like why, what went wrong, etc.<br><br>If she does something like this, then comfort her and tell her why you decided to break up with her. Tell her you don't feel that she's treating you as well as you treat her, and you don't want to waste your life away waiting for her to show her true feelings. If things go right, and you find out she really does love you, you still can take back your "break up". Ask for another chance for her to prove that she loves you.<br><br>Sometimes, the only thing you can do to get a heart to spill its true thoughts, is to just break it.<br><br>I hope this post helps, good luck with your relationship (: Any questions, just quote me and ask (:</div>

You have no real confirmation whether there is something fishy going on between them but dude, this line alone is bad enough -  when your woman is ok with a cooling off period without putting up a fight or wondering why, her interest in you is waning. The real problem isn't the guy, because even if you manage to bash this one with a stick, there will come another, and another.<br><br>Fretting over her 'guy friends' is not going to help. And it is true that men don't keep pretty girls around for the sake of platonic friendship (unless they are blatantly gay), but by making her promise never to see him again you are showing her your insecurities and insecurity in a man is a bit of a turn off. Besides, if she wants to see him, there is no way you can stop her - it is impossible to keep any woman on a leash.<br><br>The biggest mistake you can possibly make dude, is making her choose between you and the boys. Why don't you demonstrate some confidence by telling her you are glad she is hanging out with these boys and if she wants to go out with a hundred others, she should be your guest and go ahead, play with them and have a good time?<br><br>Since she is perfectly fine with not seeing you for a month and then take some time off, don't call her, don't send her messages, make zero contact and find your life outside of this heavy duty relationship.<br><br>Just my two cents worth.<br></div></blockquote>X2  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>well said mate!! totally agreed!!<br></div>

Otherwise this would be a much easier world to live in!<br><br>It is ok to wallow in your sadness for a while, or to get drunk at times. But this is not the time.  Not yet.  Rather, this is the time for you to sort out your thinking about your relationship and your future.  If a month later, things really dont work out, then start drinking.  Numb yourself abit, then move on.<br></div>

I ask her why is it that she is going out with him? and she explained that it is because that she just wants to know more friends.<br><br>I understand that it is perfectly fine to know more friends, however I think that the guy is interested in her hence his persistence. And I did voice out my concern to my girlfriend and she promised me she will not go out with him again. That was 2 months ago. Yesterday, she went out with him again.<br><br>Today, I told her in person that we should stop seeing each other for a month and really decide on whether we should continue with this relationship. She agreed.<br><br>I have been with my girlfriend for about coming to 2 years. Currently I am a civil servant but come next year Jan I will be quitting my job and concentrate on my degree. I took this step to enhance my paper qualification so as to increase my chance of getting a better paid job. She is supportive but she also understand that I will not be able to be as stable as before when I quit my job.<br><br>I am sad that this has happened but I also need some assurance from her. Am i selfish in asking her to stop seeng this guy?? objectively there is nothing wrong with her seeing other guys. emotionally, i am actually quite bothered by her willingness to go out with him.

She will be more convinced leaving you IS the right choice.<br><br>The only way a woman will feel regrets for leaving a man is when she realized the man is happier without her.<br><br>Yes, go volunteer your time.<br>Go travel , go LIVE YOUR LIFE.<br><br></div>

Dude, when your gut is telling you not to call this woman, don't call this woman. Don't make the move. Let her come to you.<br><br>Has she called? Left you messages? If she's leaving 20 messages and calling 5 times day, pounding on your doors and begging you to take her back, then maybe you'll have a chance with her (apparently not). You have done everything you could. You've begged. You've made the effort. You've told her that you love her. So if she no longer digs you, she no longer digs you. Let your ego take the beating because there is nothing left to do. Just let it sink in. Then ride it out.<br><br>When your girl is acting cold towards you, don't start getting down on your knees and begging for her again. Why beg? Why hang around for more beating?<br><br>You're just feeling the pain from rejection that's all and it happens to the best of us. Take care dude. Before committing to a woman, best to commit to yourself.<br></div>

And I did voice out my concern to my girlfriend and she promised me she will not go out with him again. That was 2 months ago. Yesterday, she went out with him again.<br><br>Today, I told her in person that we should stop seeing each other for a month and really decide on whether we should continue with this relationship. She agreed.<br><br>I have been with my girlfriend for about coming to 2 years. Currently I am a civil servant but come next year Jan I will be quitting my job and concentrate on my degree. I took this step to enhance my paper qualification so as to increase my chance of getting a better paid job. She is supportive but she also understand that I will not be able to be as stable as before when I quit my job.<br><br>I am sad that this has happened but I also need some assurance from her. Am i selfish in asking her to stop seeng this guy?? objectively there is nothing wrong with her seeing other guys. emotionally, i am actually quite bothered by her willingness to go out with him. I am very sad cause I have put in alot of effort in maintaining this relationship but she is just not being helpful. </div></blockquote>forget about her.
