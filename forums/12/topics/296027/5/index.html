            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, I was away for work past few days and now finally have time to post. Ok yes i know it is hurting that she is keeping her options open, I know that i am the one who is not in control. It is painful that this is happening to me the second time and I am still thinking of it til now. However, the last time it happened to me, I was overseas and I couldnt prevent it. Painful but I got over after 1 year. Now my second relationship of 2 years also faces the same problem.<br>I think it is inevitable that gals will always have suitors no matter which country we go. As long as there are human beings, social interaction is bound to happen. After which feelings developed and one thing leads to another. etc etc. We humans are complexed animals because of our feelings. If we are devoid of it than hey we can become a beast.<br>I am giving this relationship a chance because I have put in lots of effort to maintain it and I see it a waste just to let it go. I still have feelings for my girl even though she is keeping her options open. But there is a reason to it, my career is not establish and I am going to concentrate on my studies next year, any girl will feel insecure even if she loves you very much, this is Singapore and our society has brought us up as such. I dont blame her but myself cause we are at a different path in our life and I was the one who initated this relationship.<br>I dont know what the future has install for us, nobody knows maybe she will just leave me for another better guy or maybe she will still be there for me til death do us part. Either way, I have prepared mentally. If she leaves for another guy than I know that she is not the one for me. If she stays than I can understand her love for me better but it doesnt end there effort have to be consistent from both party to maintain a relationship.<br>I will never be like last time when things go against my way and I do harm to myself. I realized that it is pointless but rather I will let nature take its cause and dont be too hard on myself if things turn against me. I have gone through a low point in my life the past week and now the only way is up. just like the stock market, there will always be either a bull or a bear run and sometimes the occasional horizontal. But hey this is life, I will embrace it with happiness need to release my sadness. God bless all of you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Exactly, finish your studies first, we gals will be waiting for you, yo dude, as a gal, let me tell u the truth, you gf have a flowering and flirting heart, no true love, when a gal really love her bf, she will wait for him, go out only with him and do things for him. She will never go out with another man without your permission.<br><br>Since she is not respecting and cherishing this love, forget it, lesson learnt, love school fees paid,  life goes on and let live for a better tomorrow.</div>
