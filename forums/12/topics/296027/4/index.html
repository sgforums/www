I have been drunk the past few nights and nothing seems to be solved. I am just waiting for her to call me but I know the reply, i need to accept whatever god has put in faith of me. I am so tired. anyway a big thanks for all the kind souls who have bothered to reply to this mail. I promised that no matter what is going to happen, I will post the outcome in this forum which has been supportive of my situation.  A million thanks to all of you</div></blockquote>Hi moletan2003,<br><br>I think jojobeach and nehpyh gave very good advice on your situation, and there's nothing I really can add that they didn't say.<br><br>Apart from one thing,<br><br>You mentioned that you have acknowledged the problems/weaknesses in the relationship which she has pointed out. But apart from acknowledgement, have you given the commitment to change? For example, if she feels that you didn't show enough concern for her, do you really understand her without resentment, and if so, can you change? (Like someone pointed out earlier, spending time doesn't necessarily mean showing concern).<br><br>You may have tried and failed many times to change things, and if that's the case, she may have a harder time giving you a last chance.<br><br>That's really nothing wrong in a woman (or man for that matter) fighting for her own happiness and seeking greener pastures if her current relationship doesn't meet her needs.<br><br>Like nehpyh mentioned, if she decides to throw in the towel, then there's really nothing much you can do. But if she hasn't, I am sure you can demonstrate your commitment to change things.<br><br>Hope that helps. Good luck!</div>

When I was in the army, I called up this girl I like everyday (we have to queue for the coin phone then), and she gave me the impression that she liked me as well, until I realised she had a boyfriend for several months.<br><br>But not all girls are like this.. Perhaps TS's girlfriend is only trying out and is still working hard, and I thought every situation is different.<br><br>By the way, I was the "other guy" 10 years ago to my girlfriend, and she went out with me whilst still in the relationship with a hopeless guy who didn't even do anything for her birthday and only wanted to do physical stuff. But she gave him plenty of chances, and he didn't take it nor want to change anything. So I "won" her over and gave her a better life which I think she deserves.<br><br>But your situation is still a good reference for TS, I believe.<br><br>Take care!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys, I called my girlfriend yesterday. (my rational thinking lost) Meet up with her at her place. We hug, I told her I still love her and want to give the relationship another chance. She agreed but said that she cannot promise anything cause she is still confused and need some time to think. She also mention that she wants us to be normal again saying that she is soft hearted and that she still loves me. I stayed over at her place yesterday.<br><br>here is how I feel, after this incident, I realised that I have become too dependent on her for emotion support, everytime I stayed over at her place, called her, tell her I miss her etc etc. Now I want to make a difference, I will learn slowly and surely to keep my life filled with other activities. I do love her and want us to be together but she needs to be reasured by having someone whom she can depend on. I will try to work towards that but at the same time prepare myself emotionally when one day she might really wants out. I hope that day never comes and I hope one day I can tell you guys in this forum that I am getting married with her. I really hope I am making the right decision.<br><br>From the bottom of my heart i really thank all those friends who bothered to read my msg and give your advice to me, I really appreciate your efforts.

Don't sound too desperate because she will know that she has you by the balls. Show her that she's merely an option, not a priority (regardless what the truth is). You will look like a guy who has a life, friends of his own and pursues other activities, and her existence merely enhances your life. Show her that you don't need her, and if she decides to leave, she'll be losing out more than you will be.<br><br>Moral of the story: never act like your life depended on or centred around a girl.

Can he handle what he'd have to go through/risk to do that?  Does he want to?  And even if she comes back, will she treasure the chance?  Or just use it to further convince herself of TS's weaknesses, enjoy the ride, and then repay TS's love by running off the next chance she gets?<br><br>I think only TS can answer that and decide for himself.  Sometimes it's easier to cling onto something, than admit defeat and let it go.</div>
