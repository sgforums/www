            <div class='col-md body'>Ya the future looks bleak.... I know because of her fifth time going out with this guy and she broke her promise of not seeing him again. Is promises important?? Am I sensitive?? What I belived in is that she should not break her promise to me after sounding off my concern to her. She never the less broke her promise and I must admit that she is reconsidering her options. It will happened sooner or later if her heart is not with me. At least i have woken up my idea. I dont think i should see the guy, there is really no point in doing that cause it is not that guy's problem. If my girlfriend is serious about me she would not even bother about him. I am sad that she has chosen to do this though.</div>

Please allow me to explain.<br><br>(1)<strong> Putting the relationship to risk</strong><br>In a relationship, if the person views the relationship importantly, the person will not want to risk the relationship. Going out alone with another guy on outings can easily send the wrong idea to the other guy. At the same time, she will never know what will happen during the outing. I don't want to elaborate on a recent uproar over a sgforum member's allegations against a moderator's issue. There is nothing wrong in getting to know more people. But why does it have to be alone with another guy? There's nothing more she should probe into another guy's life apart from what is achievable going out in a group outing.<br><br>(2)<strong> Supportive of temporary break up</strong><br>I will use the word breakup as she will be entitled to do anything she wants during this period when you two are not meeting up. This 'anything' includes getting emotionally, sexually involved with another person. Or she probably had already. In a normal case, the other party will not be supportive towards a temporary stoppage of meet ups.<br><br>(3)<strong> Pursuit of higher education</strong><br>While I applaud your determination to scale higher in your educational level, I must remind you that it is a big commitment in all aspects. Including financially. An extra commitment will mean an extra stress. You will be virtually crippled financially if you resign from employment. Even after you receive your degree, you will also need some time to consolidate your foundations in the industry as a new graduate considering your temporary absence from the working sector. On the contrary, have you gave thought to a part time degree instead?<br><br>Please allow me to analyse your character based on what you said. You're a very responsible person who has a certain degree of ambitions towards a better employment leverage. At the same time, you are somewhat authocratic and want things to be done in your way in most of the times. Slightly towards the possessive type of bf.<br><br>Therefore, I think that you need to let go of this relationship and seek another one. But at your current stage, I would greatly encourage you to concentrate on your career. A suitable girl will come by your life again to help you get over the part your current love is vacated. A good time to talk about relationship is after you have been well stabilised financially. Of course unless God arranges for someone before that instead.<br><br>Do not feel compelled to agree or disagree with me in main. You may want to convert to PM if you wish to discuss further.</div>

I reckoned that the last thing you would ever want to see is this same vicious cycle befalling on you again for the third time or beyond.<br><br>A perfectly satisfied woman can never be seduced - surely, there must be that little subconscious frustration or unsatisfied needs that go unnoticed throughout the course of your relationship, which conjured the 'push' factor for her to look elsewhere. I won't say that it's unreasonable for you to be insecure, because somehow, your woman does show signs of drifting and you seemed powerless to do anything.<br><br>Somehow the excuse of having 'to know more friends' is but a facade to date other guys and to jump ship when the opportunity arises.<br><br>The crack is NOT caused by her trying to expand her social circle outside that of her relationship - but rather, if the introduction of this guy could possess the power to devastate your relationship, I say it's more than meets the eye because if your relationship of two years cannot even handle the appearance of one fellow - looks like the structure of your relationship isn't as sturdy as you might thought it could be.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Love can withstand any adversity ONLY if it's true to its highest and most sacred intention. Superficiality and inferior love will only crumble with the passing of time for a feeble relationship cannot endure the decomposition nature of time. Time, being the greatest test of love, will always seek to comminute - what years of relationship you took to build - overnight</strong></span>... like how fragile a glass can be... smashing delicately against the brick wall.<br><br>Sadly, if your love decides that she wants to out, there's little you could possibly do to restore this damaged relationship. For love has neither auto-save nor backup function to return back to the 'golden age' of your relationship. Your request for a cool down period probably hints that this relationship is almost as good as gone.<br><br>A cool down period hardly serve its original purpose - more often than not, it's usually served as a preparation for one to leave the shore to pursue new isles.<br><br>This period might just give her enough clarity to take flight and fly high. And you: the time for acceptance and the courage to walk forward.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
