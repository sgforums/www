In the begining, you feel that it was all fun and cute of her, but with time, it gets annoying because she cannot give you the kind of mental and emotional frequency you should have when you already secure a relationship with her.<br><br>Unless CloUdiSm remix II - Beta law: communication, in short, states that difference is wavelenght will repel partners even before chase begins.<br><br>Then in the first place why did you chose her? <strong>So you didn't knew her enough as a friend to understand if she is really suitable for you</strong> - this is a killer. Had a good friend who suffered this problem as well - thought that love could conquered all, but when he was in the relationship, everything seemed different.<br><br>I suggest that you need more than just your normal talk. It has to be a serious, no-nonsense kind of soul talk. This talk has nothing to do with telling her stop being childish, etc because surface problems will remain unless the roots is tackled. Go there and start your conversation. Ask about how she sees this relationship; your love; you; what defines them; etc.<br><br>Then you will discover many things you didn't knew.<br><br>P.S: How long you knew her before getting together? less than 3 months? How long have you both been together?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

I admit we are thinkin at diff. levels.<br><br>We really hitted it off pretty well last year, she was intro by another fren of mine, its been already 6 months. Things were pretty sweet for the 1st inital 3 months (honeymoon period).<br><br>As to ur no nonsense kinda talks yep i did that too, i read up on alot of relationship books on dealing with a partner whose maturity level is much lower. but that didnt work out, it always ends in her sobbing and me coaxing her.

I admit we are thinkin at diff. levels.<br><br>We really hitted it off pretty well last year, she was intro by another fren of mine, its been already 6 months. Things were pretty sweet for the 1st inital 3 months (honeymoon period).<br><br>As to ur no nonsense kinda talks yep i did that too, i read up on alot of relationship books on dealing with a partner whose maturity level is much lower. but that didnt work out, it always ends in her sobbing and me coaxing her. She says she treats this seriously. And i wanna believe her, but sometimes her actions really casts doubts into my mind.</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> A good effort on your part and continue them.<br><br>Her action never says that she don't love you - it's merely her personality that 'spice' up your relationship. There are three things you have to do:<br><br>I) <strong>Recongise the land mines</strong>; namely the areas where you will blow your top when she persist in her behavior during such situations/timing/events/etc. She has to know, so she will know when and where to avoid stepping onto your temper.<br><br>II) Realise that changing a person will not work, because in the end, she will not be herself and you will lose feelings gradually. Don't attempt change - attempt improving. She has to know specifically the issue before you can exercise improvement upon that area. By telling her 'xxxxxxx' will not work - <strong>guide her, the way you want her to learn</strong>.<br><br>III) <strong>Learn to beauty of compromising</strong>. If you noticed, II and III has to work hand-in-hand. Her behavior may have flaws, but so are yours. Patience is the key to these three points and with patience, you will develop a kind of compromising.<br><br>P.S: She still loves you - that's most important. Think about it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
