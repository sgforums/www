There are three things you have to do:<br><br>I) [b]Recongise the land mines</strong>; namely the areas where you will blow your top when she persist in her behavior during such situations/timing/events/etc. She has to know, so she will know when and where to avoid stepping onto your temper.<br><br>II) Realise that changing a person will not work, because in the end, she will not be herself and you will lose feelings gradually. Don't attempt change - attempt improving. She has to know specifically the issue before you can exercise improvement upon that area. By telling her 'xxxxxxx' will not work - <strong>guide her, the way you want her to learn</strong>.<br><br>III) <strong>Learn to beauty of compromising</strong>. If you noticed, II and III has to work hand-in-hand. Her behavior may have flaws, but so are yours. Patience is the key to these three points and with patience, you will develop a kind of compromising.<br><br>P.S: She still loves you - that's most important. Think about it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers[/b]</blockquote>yup i admit we are all not perfect, no one can say that they are always rational in thinking all the time.

(sympathetic and emotional p.o.v) this sparked off a heated debate. Needless to say she got very worked up, kicking up a fuss on how I failed to understand the feelings of the average taiwanese, whilst for me I was taken aback on how emotionally charged she got just from watching a protest thats a few thousand kilometres away. I backed off before it esculated into yet another arguement.<br><br>Eg. 2 This time we were watching the Taiwanese talk show Generation (the guy with a crow on his shoulder) topic of the show was "People who 2-time" In this programme people who 2-timed came out to be asked questions by people who have been 2-timed before. Of course temperatures raised as the people who have been cheated blasted the perpertators. My gf too joined in the fray of openly bashing them, I was once again just giving the 2-timers a the benefit of the doubt by reasoning with my gf that might be underlying causes to what they have done. (BTW the 2-timer was a guy)  I thought i spoked in a very diplomatic way, but my gf didnt think so, she snapped back and thought i was supporting him and asked "why? u wanna 2-time oso izit?" I kept quiet and let out a huge *sigh.<br><br>Perhaps it is her teenage angst? too emotionally charged? I've been trained to question everything I see and always look at things that go against the flow of people's view its in my job to do so. perhaps leaving this trait back in the office is the thing to do.<br><br>As to what Yun said, thanks for the advice!

Its how we look at the situation, besides everyone is different, what works for u might not for me. but i would like to share my experience here with people using the forum as an avenue to air my thoughts n grievences. Perhaps friends and family will have their own biases influencing their decisions but total faceless strangers are neutral hence the openess in my thread.
