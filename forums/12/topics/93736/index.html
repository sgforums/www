If she did she won't be treating you as how she treated her previous bf.. Cant you see that the situation is similar.. And i guess you should know why and have a clearer picture of why they broke-up..<br><br>Well.. this is the phrase of your life that you have to go thru.. you should help her.. and enlighten her.. though maybe you both won't last long.. or maybe yes.. try to let her see the light.. let her understand more.. you both are young.. don't worry.. you learn as you go.. rigth now.. jus talk to her about it.. whether you both can continue anot.. end it good also.. i rather you both are still friends back then..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers..</div>

I think you're being overly jealous... Sending sms, forwarding e-mail attachments... Very common nowadays... As you pretty much know that she always have things to talk with you, don't really expect her to be a vrey quiet girl?<br><br>I would like to see her as a spontaneous girl... Active and alive... Like a beautiful blooming flower in your eyes? Flowers are meant to be beautiful... Don't kill it... Be glad that she's your flower... But don't mean that you should be stopping the others from admiring her? Build up a GOOD FOUNDATION for your relationship if you're afraid? By being ovrely jealous is just taking a step forward to the tombstone of your relationship... You're only 16 and she's 15... Expect MANY CHANCES for her to CHANGE in the future... But no matter she CHANGES.. What sort of changes might incur between your relationship with her... Would very much depends on WHAT YOU DO TODAY....<br><br>About others' compaints about you stabbing away people's gf... HECK. Her relationship with him is OVER. And FORGIVE them as many people often only see from a VERY STRAIGHT NARROW VIEW... Besides.. Your friends should be YOUNG... GOSSIPS and such are just PART of their world..?</div>
