              I even relate my story to my lady friend and she said she hates those thai and china girls because they come singapore to snatch their future husbands blah blah blah. In the end i wasn't the one who need help. 
              
              
              Thanks everyone for your most honest opinions. I'm in control with my emotions and i know about these kind of thai girls. Perhaps you can call me naive, not loyal son or whatever. I've already decided what to do.

              <p>Bro, you have my support. I think many people will know who is Ananda Everingham, the thai australian actor who starred in shutter, pleasure factory and the coffin. </p>
              <p>Not many people however are aware about his parents love story. his father who was a journalist at that time, swarm across the mekong river from thailand to save his mother who was a Laotian and was being pursued by communist forces. </p>
              <p>Well, I can only say love transcends all borders, and besides you won't have to swim across mekong, shes right her in Sg. All the best to you bro! </p>

              <p>You said you know what to decide..?</p>
              <p>So what have you decided..?</p>
              <p>Let me tell you what you should decide.</p>
              <p>Cut off all contacts with her, and do not ever visit any prostitutes again.</p>
              <p>I can see where your path is going, if you insist in trying to "save" her.</p>
              <p>You will just have lots of messy business and will eventually break up with her.</p>
              <p>How long have you known her..?</p>
              <p>You said u have bad experiences with 8 other girlfriends before this...what makes you so sure this one is so special..?</p>
              <p>Just because you met her and lovey-dovey, what does that supposed to mean..? Why not you call a helpline or a chatline, or visit counsellors, they can also make you to open up. But what does that mean...? Does that mean anything..?</p>
              <p>You met her in a vulnerable state, and she was also in a vulnerable state, that doesnt mean anything.</p>
              <p>I think you better wake up.</p>
              <p>Maybe I can give you a different kind of suggestion....</p>
              <p>Try to focus on career....money....dont think so much about girls....do you understand what Im saying.....focus your mind elsewhere. Think of your future plans....make some goals....be more ambitious....persue those goals...</p>
              <p>If you put your mind on work and career, you wont think so much about girls anymore....and wont be so down depressed and self-pitying yourself like that anymore....</p>
              <p>Shift your attention elsewhere.</p>
              <p>For this case, take it as a bad episode and a mistake of youth.</p>
              <p>Do not go deeper. Extricate yourself.</p>
              <p>I think you must be very careful and weigh the words that I say. If you go deeper, you will just eventually carry more emotional burden, have lower self-esteem, and have more issues in the future.</p>
              <p>Certain mistakes are hard to recover from. These kinds of dangerous minefields can seriously scar you for life and affect your sense of self-worth. Nothing good will come out of it. You just had a fatamorgana, you were in a vulnerable state. Now wake up and face the real world and be a man.</p>
              <p>I recommond you to cut off all contacts with her, no more visiting prostitutes of any kind, work on your career, save some money, and search a real girlfriend.</p>
              <p>That is in sequential order....you have to do it in that order.....</p>
              <p>First you need to build up your career up to a certain level first....before you can attract serious girlfriends....do u understand....so work on it...</p>
              <p>Finding prostitutes is a shortcut and a remedy that does not work.....no good will come out of it....it makes you sidetracked and makes you dizzy....and will make you wounded and have issues in life.....</p>
              <p>It is not going to succeed.....u better change course now.....I think you can understand what I say.</p>

              Reverse gear liao. We are meeting up for dinner and movies like any other couple. We are getting to know more of each other. Yeah i agree it was a bad idea to bring her home so soon. She felt really bad that night. We are going to take our time for ourselves and enjoy each others company .

              Reply to: Meat Pao
              
              Actually this is the 2nd time i called for sex. I used to be attached to work in bangkok for 2months. A colleague of mine owned a pub in Pa Pang (Bangkok). I used to hang out at his pub very often because got free drinks. I met a lot of these bar girls. I've heard so many stories and some of them even offered to sleep with me for free. I admit i was tempted but i never once did. I've seen how they cheated other guys money, every month they have 2-3 so call "boy friends" sending them money and they are so proud of it. 
              
              My first time calling a hooker was at geylang on my 18th birthday,sponsored by my friends.
              Didn't like the experience at all. When i stepped into there, i felt sad for them. As usual we end up chatting for half an hour and she offered me to be my tour guide if i ever visit bangkok. Lol so weird for a hooker to offer me to be my tour guide. In the end i never call her.
              
              I decided to call for an escort just out of curiosity from an escort website. I admit i felt kind of lonely that time which made up my mind to call one. I thought their job is to accompany you for meals and have chit chat. Didn't expect to end up in a hotel with her for sex.
