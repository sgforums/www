              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I met a thai girl whom i got to know from a escort website. I booked her for 2 hours for sex. But instead of doing anything, we actually just chat, massage each other's back and joke around for the whole 2 hours. After that, we went for makan and i sent her back to her work place at orchard towers. Then she sms me telling me that i am a real gentlemen and feels good been with me and hope we can be good friends.</p>
              <p>The next day, i realised i can't stop thinking of her. I called and chat with her ever since then. I even had foolish ideas of finding her a decent job in singapore or some way to stop her from working there. ( Of cos thats impossible i know ). And worst of all i was her only customer for that whole week. As business is pretty bad at orchard towers and she doesn't do business with those ang mohs. i asked i could go down and visit her, but she refused saying she only wants to see me outside and not in this kind of place.</p>
              <p>Then i decided to invite her to my house for dinner. She responded very happily and even went to shop for some decent clothes so she can wear it to when she meets my family.</p>
              <p>On that fateful friday the 13th, i brought her to my place, intro her to my mum and had dinner. Then we went to my room and chat , surf net. She was really very happy and we even discussed about the next day program. Then my mum asked " Is she staying overnight?" I told her maybe. Her face turned really black and said "NO"</p>
              <p>I was somewhat shocked and i suddenly felt everything is going to go wrong. I begged my mum but she refused. I really dont know wat to do.. cause i actually told the thai girl she could stay over, and my parents will be ok with it ( I brought ex gf to my place before to makan and overnight but my mum never make noise ). I went back to my room, and asked her if she wanted to go clubbing. She looked at me and asked whats wrong. I just told her the truth that my parents dont like you to overnight here. After that the thai girl said she's ok with it and that i can tell her the truth. Then she continued serving net and suddenly broke into tears.</p>
              <p>I was SHOCKED. She cried. I asked her whats wrong she refused to tell me. Then my mum sms from the living room telling me to ask her to leave. i really didnt know what to do, i felt like as though my life is over. Then i asked her to dry up her face and we leave the house now.</p>
              <p>I brought her to hotel 81 and when we entered the room, she was still crying. After she settled her crying, and a long persuading, she finally told me. She told me she put a lot of hope in seeing my family and she even spent money to buy decent dressing for me. She even took a day off from work just for this day.</p>
              <p>I apologised and kissed and hug her. She then said, hooker and customer shouldnt have fall in love. I just told her that it's my decision to love her. We chatted about each other's problem, about my strict family and her finanical budern. She has to drink herself drunk every night so she can sleep otherwise she cant sleep. Its really sad. i really wished i can do something for her, and i thought i could make her life happier on friday but it turned out to be like this.</p>
              <p>I send her home and gave her 100 bucks. I went home without shedding a single tear throughout everything. The moment i lied down on my bed, i simple broke down. I just couldnt stop crying. In my heart i kept on cursing myself.Cursing myself why am i born in such a strict family and when i didn't study well enough to have a higher paying job. Then i thought of putting a stop to our relationship. I called her told her that today will be the last time we see each other again. She kept quiet for a minuite, and told me she really dont wan me to leave her etc etc etc.</p>
              <p>In the end i couldn't bear it, and i told her i will call her again. I really am at loss. i really dont know what to do. To be frank, i broke down several times typing till here. I hate my parents and i hate myself. I really wished i can do something to let her have a better life.</p>

              <p><br>Hmmmmmm.................................</p>
              <p>You didn't tell us what's stopping you from giving her a better life.</p>
              <p>Although we know that your Mom doesn't like her from the first impression, but that only means your Mom is not going to give her a better life.</p>
              <p>But you can give her a better life, so why are you upset?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unless you tell me you need your Mom to approve your relationship.....like you're her daughter like that...............</p>
              <p>So share more on what's stopping you from giving the girl a better life.</p>
              <p>Are you sure you are not thinking too far into the future already? If you are, could you please tell me the winning numbers for Toto in the future?</p>
              <p>Please don't make your own lives even more miserable than it is already is. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>I met a thai girl whom i got to know from a escort website. I
                      booked her for 2 hours for sex. But instead of doing anything, we
                      actually just chat, massage each other's back and joke around for
                      the whole 2 hours. After that, we went for makan and i sent her
                      back to her work place at orchard towers. Then she sms me telling
                      me that i am a real gentlemen and feels good been with me and hope
                      we can be good friends.</p>
              <p>The next day, i realised i can't stop thinking of her. I called
                      and chat with her ever since then. I even had foolish ideas of
                      finding her a decent job in singapore or some way to stop her from
                      working there. ( Of cos thats impossible i know ). And worst of all
                      i was her only customer for that whole week. As business is pretty
                      bad at orchard towers and she doesn't do business with those ang
                      mohs. i asked i could go down and visit her, but she refused saying
                      she only wants to see me outside and not in this kind of place.</p>
              <p>Then i decided to invite her to my house for dinner. She
                      responded very happily and even went to shop for some decent
                      clothes so she can wear it to when she meets my family.</p>
              <p>On that fateful friday the 13th, i brought her to my place,
                      intro her to my mum and had dinner. Then we went to my room and
                      chat , surf net. She was really very happy and we even discussed
                      about the next day program. Then my mum asked " Is she staying
                      overnight?" I told her maybe. Her face turned really black and said
                      "NO"</p>
              <p>I was somewhat shocked and i suddenly felt everything is going
                      to go wrong. I begged my mum but she refused. I really dont know
                      wat to do.. cause i actually told the thai girl she could stay
                      over, and my parents will be ok with it ( I brought ex gf to my
                      place before to makan and overnight but my mum never make noise ).
                      I went back to my room, and asked her if she wanted to go clubbing.
                      She looked at me and asked whats wrong. I just told her the truth
                      that my parents dont like you to overnight here. After that the
                      thai girl said she's ok with it and that i can tell her the truth.
                      Then she continued serving net and suddenly broke into tears.</p>
              <p>I was SHOCKED. She cried. I asked her whats wrong she refused to
                      tell me. Then my mum sms from the living room telling me to ask her
                      to leave. i really didnt know what to do, i felt like as though my
                      life is over. Then i asked her to dry up her face and we leave the
                      house now.</p>
              <p>I brought her to hotel 81 and when we entered the room, she was
                      still crying. After she settled her crying, and a long persuading,
                      she finally told me. She told me she put a lot of hope in seeing my
                      family and she even spent money to buy decent dressing for me. She
                      even took a day off from work just for this day.</p>
              <p>I apologised and kissed and hug her. She then said, hooker and
                      customer shouldnt have fall in love. I just told her that it's my
                      decision to love her. We chatted about each other's problem, about
                      my strict family and her finanical budern. She has to drink herself
                      drunk every night so she can sleep otherwise she cant sleep. Its
                      really sad. i really wished i can do something for her, and i
                      thought i could make her life happier on friday but it turned out
                      to be like this.</p>
              <p>I send her home and gave her 100 bucks. I went home without
                      shedding a single tear throughout everything. The moment i lied
                      down on my bed, i simple broke down. I just couldnt stop crying. In
                      my heart i kept on cursing myself.Cursing myself why am i born in
                      such a strict family and when i didn't study well enough to have a
                      higher paying job. Then i thought of putting a stop to our
                      relationship. I called her told her that today will be the last
                      time we see each other again. She kept quiet for a minuite, and
                      told me she really dont wan me to leave her etc etc etc.</p>
              <p>In the end i couldn't bear it, and i told her i will call her
                      again. I really am at loss. i really dont know what to do. To be
                      frank, i broke down several times typing till here. I hate my
                      parents and i hate myself. I really wished i can do something to
                      let her have a better life.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> Falling head over heels with a prostitute are occasional topics that
                      would pop its presence into Aunt Agony every other moment. In my 8
                      years here, I remembered telling those guys, having exact same scenario
                      as yourself (you can consider them as your predecessor), to report with
                      a reply/topic/post if they are successful in their relationship with
                      these ladies. You know the happily ever-after kind?  </p>
              <p>None did. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
              <p>***</p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> Before
                      we start claiming human rights issues about the fact that prostitute
                      are also human beings requiring basic socio-emotional needs - this is
                      in fact a red herring to the real fundamental issues in love, which are
                      classic technique naturally 'used' by our individual cosmic lessons,
                      which could conveniently put us in intensive karmic relationship
                      without resistance. The informal fallacy that prostitute also deserve a
                      partner, in this case, is but a smoke screen to conceal the root of
                      issues - the deficit in learning about love. </p>
              <p>Everything occurs
                      within a one week time frame and such pace of
                      advancement is likely to an Uranus-influence relationship. Your failure
                      in previously relationship seemed to share a common factors that (1)
                      you based your decision entirely on affect and (2) you don't exactly
                      know your partners very well when you end up in a relationship with
                      them.</p>
              <p>First
                      law of CloUdism states "it is we who chooses our partner, not the other
                      way round.' As much allocation of blame you have attributed to your
                      previous girlfriends, wouldn't you agree that having nine unsuccessful
                      relationship are blatant signals that the root of problem are probably
                      strong hint of suggestion that you are likely the main reason for it? </p>
              <p>You
                      mentioned that such disappointment has prompted you to dial a call
                      girl; hence your real agenda is that you wanted a girlfriend, so what
                      you did was to attempt to switch from a paid sexual service to
                      'convert' them into 'legitimate' relationship. You have used
                      monetary payment to get pass your first door (the approach) because in
                      any given chase, for the masculine role always suffer from approach
                      anxiety (fear of rejection). Your failure in several preceding
                      relationships has created what I termed as love fatigue and in
                      response, people always hasten the process to get to where they last
                      stopped in love.</p>
              <p>This creates several structural problems in love, often only expressed itself in later stages.</p>
              <p>The condition of this fact doesn't alter, even if you get to know her better before committing anything.</p>
              <p>Also, I believe there are certain amount of Transference (shifting your
                      emotions towards this woman, bounded by paid services to response in a
                      certain manner, simultaneously illicit your desire to forge deeper
                      companionship). She reciprocated in a manner (both physical and
                      personality) close to your ideals, but I must remind you that these are
                      merely perception exuded on her part, which might not be consistent
                      with her actual thoughts and feelings. </p>
              <p>Man just loved playing
                      the knight in shining armour; don't over identify yourself with the
                      role of a rescuer. Albeit it feels good on the ego, but you subject
                      yourself to blind compliance. Blaming yourself for her helplessness is
                      step one.</p>
              <p>P.S: You are pretty much fixed in what you plan to do
                      and like all others before you, I shall say the same: do let us know if
                      this has evolve into a successful outcome. I should still be around. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>I met her in HK while asking for directions, and of course i chose the prettiest person sitting around to ask for directions, she looks chindian more to the chinese side, which I think is damn exotic hehehe <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>
              <p>For some reason, most women with Thai blood in them are very gentle and caring, I mean yes some Singaporean ladies are like that too I believed, I've had SG gf before but I got sick of them complaining about every damn thing. Haha no offence to fellow locals</p>
              <p>So next time if your BFs or husbands head to thailand frequently for "business trips"... I guess its the same theory as why some girls prefer ABCs or Ang moh.</p>
