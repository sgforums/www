              <p>haha... In a way I second your thoughts. Being too pampered, becomes too demanding and dominant; possess the traits of a man.</p>
              <p>How can we have 2 persons of the same characteristics fusing together?</p>
              <p>Anyway, how old are you this year? And what do you do?</p>

              <p>Your parents are cautious. And I don't think you can blame them
                                      for having such fatuous 'superiority complex' against someone
                                      originating from a country less developed as we are. Sad to say,
                                      this stigma tantamounts to our arrogance when comparing ourselves
                                      to the region yet marvel at people with financial or academic
                                      achievements. This equates to hypocricy.</p>
              <p>I personally think 1 week is far too short. Even though I think
                                      she met countless men who're interested in nothing but sex with
                                      her. You became someone not transactional when you behaved like a
                                      refined gentleman compared to those she met. Take more time to know
                                      her. Maybe you should consider asking her to quit her job and
                                      become a 'housewife'. Please be considerate as her past
                                      'experiences' does not qualify her for a decent job so quickly.</p>
              <p>Do not be surprised that she actually yearns for a decent
                                      family. People living in that regime can actually have such simple
                                      requests in life. If you are really interested in her, you should
                                      not yield to the hypocrital mentalities of feudal tradition.
                                      Rather, work upwards for her.</p>
              <p>I too, was in a similar predicament. But not as deep as you've
                                      endeavoured. I met a prostitute in Filippines during a business
                                      trip last year. She is nothing short of being absolutely stunning.
                                      We hit it off really well and through our communications, I felt
                                      really humbled by her flexibility to accept people of all creed and
                                      race as friends. Having alternative preferences do not make them
                                      less human. And I need a prostitute to teach me this simple moral
                                      concept.</p>
              <p>My customer explained to me that pretty girls in their late
                                      teens in Manila QC without qualifications, without money, loads of
                                      burden, need money fast and have no employment cannot afford to sit
                                      and despair; prostitute themselves.</p>
              <p>Even so, they have never given up the hope to be attached or
                                      married.</p>
              <p>I am not God. And I have no right to judge. Prostitutes can be
                                      people who betray their physical bodies in exchange for money to
                                      survive or bring up their family. I can be someone who lie in order
                                      to get away from something I did. What makes me think I am more
                                      superior just because I make a decent living?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hi MS,</p>
              <p>I fully agree with you. For my case, the only thing i can do now is by working towards it.</p>

              <p>I've hired a called girl cause i feel so sick of the failed relationships i've been through. 9 girls mostly local girls whom i went steady with after my NS. They brought me nothing but anger, disappointment and sadness. I don't know how to put it but i think i really have no luck in meeting nice sg girls who are considerate and senstive (not over sensitive) to me and my friends around me.</p>
              <p>My ex gf is a good example. Go out for dinner with my buddies, need to report to her where and with who. Call me every 2 hours to check on me.</p>
              <p>I Bring her out with my friends, the first thing she do is hug me and talked to me non stop and then only after talking so much then she say HI to my friends. Really got no respect for my friends. Come my house , she chatted with my mum like best friends and wash the plates after dinner.</p>
              <p>Still got many things, too many to mention here.</p>

              <p>Under a local boss. I started off as a techinican and worked all
              my way to an AE. Pay is not high ( around 2k) but planning to
              further studies. Hopefully can get better pay.</p>
              <p>Thanks everyone. I actually feel better. i don't think i want to
              let her go otherwise i might regret all my life if i don't try. To
              be honest i do not understand why i fell for her the first time i
              met her. But i think i understand why now.</p>

              <p>If you intend to excel under a Singaporean boss in a Singaporean company, paper qualifications come first. Competency and results can be compromised. But if you work for a German boss under a MNC like me, paper qualifications can be compromised but competency and results must be outstanding. Take your pick.</p>
              <p>Honestly, since you've the experience as a technician before, you know the ground well. Get some paper qualification and move into a MNC under a Caucasian boss. But ensure you have the competency to do the job.</p>
              <p>Also, I think your parents need to help out by being understanding. I understand how excruciating it is to be left alone struggling with your gf. But as I previously said, you should get to know her well. 2 long ceonversations cannot write the report card. Just like how companies work when they get too obsessed with paper qualifications and neglect the importance of competency.</p>

              <p>Prostitutes are human too. The reason why men fall quickly in 'love' with them is because intimacy response is immediate, unlike ordinary relationships whereby it takes time to even just hold hands.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Men just want to feel 'wanted'. Prostitutes are the ones who have little choices unlike ordinary women who have much more choices to decide. The prostitute will make any man feel wanted, in the hope she can get out of her trade. No human female, enjoys opening her legs 10 - 20 times a day to all kinds of men, the gentle ones to the rougher ones.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The only reason why you are thinking of her is because of such intimacy and her submissiveness. You will never find such submissiveness any where in this world. Only a handful of such women exists and are a treasure for the lucky man, rich or poor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In the prostitution industry, the women are submissive. But do not be fooled. Once they leave the industry, there will be equal in rights and beliefs of ordinary women and will behave as one. The crying tearful pros you met once will no longer be the same. it may be you that will be doing the crying.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore, if you truly love a woman, accept her and be prepared for changes. Do not do it just because of her poverty or tears. Simply means, take your time to know her before making committments.</p>

              <p>Your story is really sad.</p>
              <p>Just my opinion. This kinda feelings usually doesn't last for that long. Whereas your relationship with your parents is for a lifetime? The reason behind them , not stopping you and your ex girlfriend in a room overnight and stopping you from spending a night with that call girl, is apparent. They did it for your own good.</p>
              <p>I just thought you shouldn't have said that you hated your parents. Even in the most financially burdened family, most parents usually want the best for their children.</p>
              <p><br>And perhaps you should stop visiting such places too.</p>
              <p>A relationship that is tied with personal problems on both sides may not end up with a happy ending as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope  you find my advice useful.</p>
