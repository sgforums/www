But if you're into real commitment and a long-term stable relationship, you should be giving each other and the relationship much more respect.. Having more concrete facts before wildfully stepping into it... On the other hand, there's no stopping you from slowly developing further without throwing yourself in at this moment yup...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Otherwise, if you are still available, then when you come back, meet up with him and see. I am sure you are smart enough not to go to dark lonely places with ppl you chat online....<br><br>You sre still young so it seems so big a deal to you. You will soon realise that most of the time, it amounts to nothing. Either you can't stand him or he can't stand you or you are attached or he is attached or whatever whatever... so don't commit to anything or anybody (in your own mind) and just relax and take it easy.<br><br>When the right one comes along who thinks that you are the right one, you will know.</div>
