Lately, I went out with her as she need someone to accompany her to shop for a pair of sandals as hers has already gave way. While walking with her, my heart beat beats very fast. Before i left for home, I said goodbye to her. The feeling is very unbearable. I really wanted to accompany her longer but scared that she will feel embarrassed.<br><br>She has a bf and there's some problems with him lately. She will talk to me about these problems.

But somehow dun have the courage to do so. Been asking myself whether should I go after her or should I give her up since she already has a bf.<br><br>Pls advise! Thanks! <strong></strong></div>

I'm controlling my emotions for her. Been thinking of her almost everyday. She did consider of having a clean break with her bf but no matter what happens or her bf did something bad, she will keep quiet.<br><br>I feel very relax and happy with her. But can't control my feelings for her.</div>

Dun bang your head against it first.. is a 50-50 chance.. she might say yes she might say no..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Yes : is the reason i have given above..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> No  : she only treat you as a very good friend..<br><br>Dun act rush..

I believe u don wan to cause a break up just because of ur un controllable feelings right?<br><br>See how things are getting on.. Should they break up, make sure its nothing to do with u causing the break up.. I guess u don wanna feel guilty too?</div>

And to make matter worst; <strong>moral clashes with emotions </strong>- You don't want step into the picture, yet you can't help it.<br><br>To reveal your feelings now would be the worst of all time - regardless of intention. You will be fueling additional burden onto her emotional baggage and she would probably avoid or keep a temporary distance if she feels invaded and need that personal space.<br><br>***<br><br>Let her walk through this phrase first. Then later, you can consider your option of expressing your inner feelings. However, after that declaration, if your overall intention is to become her bf, then the timing need to be revised again. If your objective is merely to blast out your feelings and release that tension, then go ahead.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
