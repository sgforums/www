            <div class='col-md body'>think if she treasure u as a friend she'd ask for ur forgiveness. cos i really dun see why u should apologize.<br>is it needed when u have done nothing wrong? and if she's really sincere i think she'll at least send an e-mail directed to you and not forwarded e-mails.<br>but maybe you would like to decided whether this friend is worth for u to treasure. but if u r a dear friend to her; she should make the first move...<br>just a piece of advice from someone who had encountered similar situations before.</div>

I mean, regardless of whether SHE is your friend, if YOU are her friend then when you got problems and need someone, you will STILL be considerate and if she isn't available, then you will understand. There are a lot of things in the world in other people's lives more important than you and if you can't can't understand that, how good a friend are you?<br><br>2. Did you specify that the parcel must be sent using her company courier services? Also, after she did it, did you check with her again if the thing have been done and how it has been done?<br><br>If it is something you need to do, then YOU have to take responsibility for how it is done. WHICH MEANS, If you want her to help then you either trust her and let her settle it OR tell her specifically HOW you want to send the parcel. Don't assume it will be done your way if you didnt tell her what to do. And most importantly, you need to check with her if it has been done, how it has been done. It's your job, even if someone is helping you, you still have to be responsible for it if it screws up.<br><br>If you genuinely treat her like a friend, remember she don't OWE you anything for being HER friend.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there,<br><br>yr description of this female fren gives me the impression that she doesnt treasure frienship a lot. she could hv clarify the issue better instead of hanging up on u. but, did u give her a chance to explain. if i did not get u wrong, u scolded her immediately after she replied "why not" to ur very 1st qs (why use DH* when u work in UP*). and u also indicated that she has admitted her mistake.  so...havent u been a little too petty abt that incident?? if it had happened to me, i would feel that its a pity to lose a frienship over such things. I would definitely patch up with her again, after all, u lose nothing by putting in a little effort of clarification. but if u feel ok abt lose her as a friend...then..just forget abt everything. CHEERS!<br></div>
