Put it this way, even if you went to RJC and did well enough for your A levels to go to the top universities on a scholarship, you probably still wouldn't know what you want to do in the long run(I'm not talking about which course of study to pursue here).<br><br>I personally have seen ample examples of people falling in this category whereby they go for something exclusively for the prestige offered at that point in time, only to realise later on they could have been more productive pursuing an alternate course of action. If you're considering accepting scholarships for your tertiary studies, I suggest you think twice if you're not entirely convinced a job with the scholarship-awarding organisation is where your future should be - trust me, you wouldn't want to waste 6 years (is that still the length of bond for an overseas scholarship?) of your prime slogging away envying your college peers living a dream life(which would most likely be the case if you went to what you would consider a "decent university" abroad)...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Then I had to go back to poly &amp; start all over again, &amp; now I'm applying for a place in univ for the 3rd time. Depressed, not even ur turn to say it. And wat's the diff between other JCs, after 2 years the 'A' levels the same what. Ultimately it's the attitude that counts, even if one is from RJC &amp; if his/her working attitude sucks, it's still of no use. Dun be so choosy lah.</div>
