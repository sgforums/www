            <div class='col-md body'>times have changed, dude.<br><br>there are raw 6 pointers who rather stay/go VJC, TJC, AJC, SAJC, ACJC etc. the rankings don't really matter now.<br><br>i know of 8 pointers who wanna stay in YJC &amp; 8 pointers who wanna stay in TJC even though they can get 4 bonus points off.<br><br>does being in a 'elite' institution really matter? to a certain extent, no.<br><br>most of all, is RJC suitable for you? can you survive the elitism &amp; competition in RJC? compare the cultures and environments of RJC and NJC, besides the human relation factors, which appeals more to you? my friend who is in RJC(via DSA) is scorned badly by quite a handful of those elites. who knows, even those who made it to RJC with Os results are scorned by the raffles through train family. its not about the brand, its about whether you can strive in it. think about why do polar bears live in artic regions and not the sahara.<br><br>you got the best possible results and still depressed. hey, 6 - 3 = 3. your chances are darn high. and you are still depressed. think about poor souls who have no bonuses. i don't have the HCL bonus just because the management had all kinds of excuses to stop me from taking HCL though my CL results were A throughout lower sec. i only have 2 points for CCA and another 2 points if i get into LEP. but look, im not that upset, nor am i worrying about not getting into top-notches like VJ or TJ.<br><br>you won't be that disadvantage if you are from anywhere else other than RJC, but you will be truly disadvantaged if you don't have a decent As cert to boast of.</div>
