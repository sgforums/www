If you see yourself working in Singapore in the long-term, are you looking at a career in the civil service or private sector? If you see your future elsewhere, where exactly do you have in mind? Answers to these questions will go a long way towards dictating what you should do, really.<br><br>Afterall, it might not be the JC issue that's the root of the problem here.

            <div class='col-md body'>personally i feel you should think of what you like to do now. as in what you like to study and all. JC style or poly style. but given your points seems like you don't wanna "waste" your points and decide to enter a JC.<br><br>thinking of your rice bowl now ain't gonna really help you. so what if you wanna be an engineer now. 10 years down the road what if the prospect of being an engineer isn't gonna be good. are you still insisting to be an engineer? be flexible.<br><br>study the stuffs you like, excel and bit by bit you'll eventually narrow down your vision and choose the ideal job with good results.</div>

So what if you go to RJ? Would that make you a better person? Does the school make a person or does the person make a school?<br><br>What if I told you that my own brother was an RI/RJC alumni? I kid you not. But is he any better than people from other JCs? I don't think so. Want to know his A Level results? A,A,A,C for Phy/Chem/Maths C/Econs (in that order). On top of that he got A2 for GP.<br><br>I am a TJC alumni. Want to know my results for the exact same combination? A,A,A,A, A1.<br><br>I'm not trying to brag, and my humble apologies if it seemed that way. But did the fact that my brother went to RJC instantly give him better examination results? Nope. Did it instantly make him a better person? Nope, he's the same old guy I've known my whole life.<br><br>Clothes do not make a man; it is man who makes the clothes. Being in RJC does not instantly make you a better person. It is you who makes the school you are in a better school.<br><br>And the fact that 'going to AC doesn't <span style="font-style: italic;">exactly</span> fill you with dread shows that at a lower baser level, you do feel disgusted at having to go there instead of RJC. Come on, the only person you're kidding here is you yourself.<br><br>So my conclusion? Yes, you are being extremely shallow by wanting to go to RJC mostly because of the name. Please do not stain the name of our country's founder.</div>
