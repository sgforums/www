I think that its better if you move on with your life even ifyou wait she said that she wouldn't come back to you and there is no point forcing it.<br><br>She might have thought what it will be like if she continues to be with you... although you may treat her like a queen but your bad temper and whatever habits, which you have may have and if you do it maybe too often. It could cause her to drift further and further away from you.<br><br>I am glad to say that you are one matured guy who would actually sign on and hoping to settled down with her soon. But if she doesn't want to be with you then i advice you not to force her.<br><br>Even if you do wait... will she ever come back? Think about it! If she is meant to be yours... she will definitely come back one fine day. If you really want her back... i think that you should try to change whatever it is that she doesn't like. Treating her like a queen... its not the only thing that what women would look for in a guy.<br><br>Loving someone takes more than just taking care, being there, treating her like queen etc. I know that it hurts really bad... i went with a girl whom i have been together for 6 years but in the end... it didn't work out. Life still goes on! Take it easy and hope for the best!</div>

Treating her like a queen its not the only thing that a women would look for in a man.<br><br>Her love for your have died even she realized that you would be a good boyfriend for her.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Ahworm<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I share your anguish and pain - for you plan your future directed towards the lady of your love, in the end, it crumbles and comes to nothingness.<br><br>You mentioned that it was because of your character that eventually repelled her away - you did nothing to change that during the 3 years do you? Or the attempt wasn't good enough?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Love, often, isn't followed by logics - when you fail a subject, you studied hard - you will pass. Doesn't mean that you put in effort in love means it will blossom. It requires the same, equal attention by both parties. You mentioned you treated her like a princess - so does she treat you like a prince in return?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You can't work on a relationship alone.<br><br>Feelings don't go up and down 100% purely on how you treat her. However, at least, you people managed to stay together for nearly 3 years. I mean, if she hasn't given you any single chance at all - she would have flew away ages ago.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>She has drew the line: saying that you both could only maintain very good friendship. My take is that - respect her decision now for it ended on a pleasent note. Your craving for her is because she left your heart and pretty much enjoyed the pleasure of being single. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> She has started to move on - have you?<br><br>You can't always change to adapt just because you lost something -you have to improve yourself and burn it deep into your character. At the very least, you wouldn't be making the same mistake twice. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Don't panic - understand why you have lost her and govern yourself well first. Whether you can win her back or not - let fate and future decide for themselves. Afterall, it you both were meant to be together, you would. Just make use of your determination and willpower to exercise self improvements.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
