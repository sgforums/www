            <div class='col-md body'>The only way to  improve your English is to read &amp; listen to the news (Channel News Asia on tv or  BBC on radio). Borrow books from sch. library, read Readers Digest, novels, magazines. This will help in your pronunciation. Check Oxford dictionary for the correct usage. As for revision- set a timetable &amp;  study for at least 1- 2 hrs. Take short breaks if u cannot concentrate for long. Have a quiet  study place. Switch off your hp so u don't get distracted.<br><br>As for your relationship with your family, try &amp; talk to them. Your parents may be concern about u that's why they want to know who u are messaging. Try not to get into BGR  yet as it will affect your studies. Avoid those insincere friends &amp; make new ones.<br>Hey! You must be determined to improve instead of moaning abt. it. Everyone faces stress in studies &amp; work. Only if u perserve, will u make it.</div>

How old are you? Guess your life should be pretty much still a long way to go... Ending your life is never a solution to ending your problems.. In fact, it'll usually means MORE problems generated for others... And your 'problems'... It's not like they can't really be solved or deal with in certain ways? Just takes more determination and control of will... The 'journey' of life is long... And I guess you're just about getting started?<br><br>As much as I can agree that there're hypocrites around in our life.. I can ALMOST ASSURE you that NOT all of the people are 'hypocrites'... And most of them are not to the extremes... You'll just have to learn to pick your friends... Learn to fail in picking the right ones... Learn to be hurt... Live that like it or not, you'll still have to live in a world where some of the people may not suit your taste...<br><br>About your English... Listen to more English radio station programmes.. Catch TV... News... Whatever... If you feel that you're really that BAD... START from the BASICS... English is VERY MUCH about FOUNDATIONS... Start from Primary 1 &amp; 2 grammars if you have to... The worst is not when you don't know.. But only when you choose not to learn and know when you know that you needs to....<br><br>Privacy at home... I can't guarantee you anything... I reckon that you should be still at a certain vulnerable age? Even my parents used to do that to me... Heck, I just couldn't be much bothered...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  As soon as they realise that you don't really ahve much for them to 'intrude'... They'll just slowly move away.. More of concern for your development now I should guess? Ya... just part of growing up...<br><br>GIRLS..? Haha... All I can say is... When it's TIME, they'll come... I USED to be the type which girls in the class won't even bother to take a 2nd look or place a discussion on..? (except when I constantly fail my test and exams..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) And NOW? Still the SAME lah....  &lt;<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> "<br><br>All in all, I would tell you just to take things lightly lah... I can ALMOST ASSURE you that you should be facing GREATER CHALLENGES in LIFE in the future to come....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

DUn scare about speaking and approaching them.. you can talk to them in mandarin.. not neccessary english.. if you really feel lousy when speaking in that language..<br><br>For your family.. i think you should have a talk with them.. you are old enough to have your own privacy.. Sit own with them.. and talk to them.. tell them how you feel.. and see what can be done.. afterall they are still your family.. maybe they are jus too concern or over-protective over you??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Language is the only one that cannot be learn like mathematics.. science..n humanities... You have to always use very frequently.. Like speaking writing and talking.. The DUmmy guide dun help at all.. one way to improve is that.. you listen to news (eng &amp; chn), read books.. Novels.. or newspaper.. read dictionary..<br><br>Grammer.. you have to practice writing.. no neccessary must be essay.. one short paragraph.. then maybe you can ask your teacher for help to see where are your mistakes.. Since i guess.. your friends wont help you.. Everyday you do this.. i'm sure you improve in no time.. but you must put in effort.. dun always think that.. there's always tmr tmr tmr and tmr.. like that u'll die in nO TIME too! You see.. you are always afraid of this and that.. dun dare to speak up cos ppl will laugh.. But if you dun keep on trying and practising.. it will be worst! Let them laugh all they wan.. one day you gonna show them how fluent you can be..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>You are lacking confidence.. and feeling so insecure.. well.. i guess.. now its better for you to concentrate on your studies first.. pass this Os.. girls will come now and then.. when you have the confidence and build up the courage.. you will find yourself.. talking to them.. and mixing with girls too.. They are human.. they wont eat you up.. jus treat them like your "buddy".. You still got a long way.. dun worry pal.. this is not the end of the world..<br><br>Dun think so negative.. think positive.. the more positive you think.. you wont feel that bad.. if you keep thinking negative negative.. everyday you wake up.. you always feel like sh|t.. like everything is so meaningless to you.. Death issit the solution for everything.. so what if you die? Ppl always think that death can change everything.. you think it will??   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Stay happy.. Everything can work out.. or maybe you can find someone here to help you out in your grammer.. write something.. one or 2 paragraphs.. then we can help you to correct your mistakes.. if you are scared pl to see.. then PM anyone who you think can help you.. If your friends cant help.. the next best person to find.. is your teacher.. they will do their best to help you.. Tell yourself.. no matter wat you have to pass this exams.. not neccessary must have good gradres.. but at least get a pass.. that will be alright...<br><br>SOmetimes.. don't pin hopes too high.. if not if you fall from there.. it's gonna hurt you alot.. this applies to everything.. anything..<br><br>Cheers.. pal..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi~! erm dont mind me giving some useless advices.. haha.. hmm.. what i think for language is that you should speak more often to improve it.. do more.. =X for girls, i also need help too.. =( I am very shy towards them.. and for the friends thingy, i think you can try changing your behaviour or your attitude? Maybe some of your actions irritate them or whatever.. (no offense tho)</div>
