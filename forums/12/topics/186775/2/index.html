Maybe he felt as though you were harassing him or something?<br><br>My answer would be to just forget about this guy. If he says that he doesn't want you, then so be it: he doesn't want you. You have to respect his decision and move on.<br><br>I'm 23 years old, by the way. I've been rejected by a total of three girls so far. Each time it happened, I decided to respect their decision and move on. It was like a punch in the gut when they rejected me, and it was an even harder punch when they all got attached to other guys later. But I've learnt to accept their decisions and carry on with my life. If they can carry on with their lives, then so can I.<br><br>Also, as you said, he values sex more than relationships. In other words, even if you do get into a relationship with this guy, he's more likely to use you for his own entertainment, namely, sex. He sees women as nothing more than objects for his own pleasure.<br><br>Why do you still want to be with such a jerk, anyway? He is a disgrace to us guys and a bane to you women.

I know it is painful and hurting not being with the man you love. But sometimes I feel you should ask yourself. Is he worth it?<br><br>And not to worry, you are still young. You are 24 years old only...you still have years ahead before you need to settle down.<br><br>Never lose confidence in yourself.

You're not interested in one who's only interested in a beauty's looks but go for personality... And provided that you're one with personality (and no look?)... Guys who just go for looks won't come to you (as per your wish), but instead only guys interested truly interested in personality would like to know you better.... So I guess in the end things should just work out fair enough....? But of course, knowing one of such guys might take some time lah... No point rushing into it also.... But yup.. They EXIST...</div>
