Yes we would prob look a second time at the babe with big boobs or hourglass figure... but ultimately it boils down to "connection"... ur ability to share ur thoughts and feel at ease when u are with the gal...<br>As my fren put it, there are 3 types of gals in this world<br>1) The type to be friends, buddy for a long time (looks dun matter)<br>2)The type for one-night stand, fulfilling all our sexual fantasies (of course looks and figure matters)<br>and lastly<br>3)the type as GF ... she wld fall somewhere between the 2.</div>

I believe it's better to take things slowly and make sure you choose as your partner someone who's genuinely compaitable and in love with you, rather than rush headlong into a relationship just because you think you need to.<br><br>As for what guys look for in a girl, appearances are not really as important as you might think. What really matters is a kind gentle heart and good temperament.</div>
