            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I suppose all hope if not lost if he's interested in sex with you. It would really be bad if he turns down the offer of sex.<br><br>Have any guys went after you before, through out your entire life?<br><br>I'm sorry and sad to say that there are increasing amounts of ladies that are not attached and don't seem to be making any progress in that regard. I know of at least 10 ladies above the age of 30 and show no signs of getting hitched.<br><br>Although I would say not to give up hope, you might want to be prepared that you might have to stay single. Only means is probably get to know more people.</div>
