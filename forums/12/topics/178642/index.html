But all these time I've never actually talk to her before because firstly, I dun know how to initiate a conversation and secondly, she is those type of very quiet girl.<br>Finally, after two years of isolationisim, she created an e-mail account and a friendster account. She had become more beautiful over the holidays. Needless to say, I added her the first minute. Initially, I was very happy...I thought, finally, I have the slightest hope that I can get to know her more. Even though we had both finished our O'levels and is going to take on different path in the future, I still hoped that I'll have a chance, no matter how small it may be.<br>But den I actually found out that at least 20 other guys in this world also like her. Within three months, her friendster account has got 75 friends and over 20 testimonials, with most of them from dirty old man. I had my friendster account for almost 2 years and I have got only 75 friends and over 30 testimonials.<br>I felt so stupid. I just realised I don't really love her at all.<br>You see...sometimes, the more beautiful a girl, the more dangerous. Not because they are evil, but because of the attention they receive from dirty old man.<br></div></blockquote>Gib us her friendster acct/email then...arbo.................NPNT.</div>
