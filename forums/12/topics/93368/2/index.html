            <div class='col-md body'>This is quite a difficult question....  Well, at least you know that he still keeps his ex-gf photos... it'll be worse if he hides everything completely from you...  for me, I think it's alright for him to hide the photos as long as he doesn't show it to you... of course, the jealous streak in you will definitely cannot stand it... one will however learn to live with it...<br><br>But tell you something, there's no point quarreling over such things...  cos when you are married, probability of him throwing away his old stuff is quite high.... especially when you move into a new home... so I think one shouldn't be fussing over things like this and concentrate on building a better and stronger relationship... show him that you are a magnanimous person (but not as magnanimous as to give him away)...  think he will appreciate you even more...<br><br>Moreover, there's no point if he throws away the ex-gf's photos and still keep in contact with them... which do you prefer?<br><br>I am someone's ex-gf now.. and also someone else's gf now... as much as I would like my ex-bf to keep our photos... I can't blame him if he chooses to throw them away... and for my current bf, I know that he keeps his ex-gf's things.. .. but why  force it on him to throw it away? I believe that if he really loves you, he will eventually dispose of his past relationships and stuff....<br><br></div>

Indirectly, you are to demand 100% attention/love/concern/care from your boyfriend and to consciously root out all possible leakage of this quality - this problem lies with your thoughts and not entirely the photos.<br><br>You probably sees love as a form of material possession, in which everything is black and white. In simple, the things you see, you dread. You didn't really accepted him, as a whole package, picking out certain aspects you dislike and wants to phrase them out. Jealousy transformed into petty anger and quarrelling occurs.<br><br>If you know your bf's heart is with you - allow him to keep pieces of his past memory. He will be lying if he tells you he has completely forgotten about his past - nobody will. [b]People moved on, but they don't erase memories like the DELETE button on your keyboard.</strong> The real solution lies in how you want to shift your preception. You can be very picky about food, then at the end of the day when everyone is enjoying their meal - you discover that you are the only one who is 'working' on the food, removing pieces of thingy that looks funny to you.<br><br>Learn to compromise and accept. It will definitely serve you longer in the future. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers [/b]</blockquote>Agreed with yunnie... wanted to post.. but i dunno how to tell you.. but then do respect his decision.. If in return.. he does this to you.. how would you feel.. Sometimes leave some space and privacy for each other.. Understanding is important.. Are you afraid of something? Scared that he might still have feelings for his ex.. when he looks at the photos.. ?? If you believe in him.. given him your trust and faith.. you wouldn't feel this way..<br><br>If his heart is yours... it will be yours.. Don't doubt it!<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
