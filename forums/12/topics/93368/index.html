            <div class='col-md body'>i think it's a case of "the more u dun want me to do, the more i wanna do" kind of thing.<br><br>if u think he treasures these photos, it implies that his heart is not with u. it does NOT matter whether he's thrown them away or not.<br><br>u mean u will feel better if the photos are gone, but so is his heart? or perhaps it wasn't with u in the first place?<br><br>i dun mean to sound so harsh, but i think the more impt thing is whether he loves u. i mean, if possession of these photos means he still loves her, then THAT is the problem u need to look at, not the photos.</div>

Indirectly, you are to demand 100% attention/love/concern/care from your boyfriend and to consciously root out all possible leakage of this quality - this problem lies with your thoughts and not entirely the photos.<br><br>You probably sees love as a form of material possession, in which everything is black and white. In simple, the things you see, you dread. You didn't really accepted him, as a whole package, picking out certain aspects you dislike and wants to phrase them out. Jealousy transformed into petty anger and quarrelling occurs.<br><br>If you know your bf's heart is with you - allow him to keep pieces of his past memory. He will be lying if he tells you he has completely forgotten about his past - nobody will. <strong>People moved on, but they don't erase memories like the DELETE button on your keyboard.</strong> The real solution lies in how you want to shift your preception. You can be very picky about food, then at the end of the day when everyone is enjoying their meal - you discover that you are the only one who is 'working' on the food, removing pieces of thingy that looks funny to you.<br><br>Learn to compromise and accept. It will definitely serve you longer in the future. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

My ex used to tell me that since his ex trusted him to give him the photos, he couldn't just throw or destroy, just keep it loh.  As long as it's not enlarged into half-door size and hanging over his bed, then ok liao lah.  No matter wat, they have been thru some time together, not easy to just throw away.<br><br>How would you feel if 1 day ur bf becomes ur ex and just throw away your photo when his gf suggest it?  Painful rite?</div>
