            <div class='col-md body'>I know her for coming to 5 months and during this 5 months, as usual as most guys will do to a girl when he likes her. Communicating with her, attentive to her needs and so on...<br><br>Few months ago, I told her that I like her. No response so I wait and carry on dating her.<br><br>Few weeks ago, she told me she likes me too but she is not ready for a relationship. Fine. I will give her the time and also the time for both of us to trust and commit more. We are both working adult. Financially independent.<br><br>She is a girl who has plenty of suitors.<br><br>The funny thing is, I will really like to hear from the ladies that when you like a guy, will you meet him even though you are busy or with your group of girl-friends or after your activity be it work, friends or family.<br><br>Ladies, another question is, when you know that there are other suitors after you, and when another guy ask you out for movie, will you go? As for my case, she went ahead and for everyone info, I only went for movie with her once and it was in a case where she was not willing to go.<br><br>My inner voice is telling me that it is not because she doesn't want to go into a relationship. She likes the courtship from man. It is consider very sweet and is even better than in relationship.<br><br>For the man,<br>Am I sensitive to the extend that allowing her to go out with other suitors even she told me that she is going for a movie date with this guy cause she promise to go?<br><br>For the past few months, I'm so tired going after her. I have gave her all my love but she isn't. Sometimes I feel that she is testing my endurance limit and try to push me to the limit. I am sensitive to her needs and being very understanding at all times. I don't mind BUT if she doesn't love you, it hurts so badly.<br><br>Lastly, do you all think that when you are after a girl or a guy, one should remain consistent in his/her target and not be distracted by other choices?<br>When I'm dating a girl, I will choose to think in a way that I will not go out with other girls except her and if it work out. I doubt anyone will like the feeling of seeing the person you like to go out with another suitor.<br><br>I really try my best for this relationship.</div>

I have gave her all my love but she isn't. Sometimes I feel that she is testing my endurance limit and try to push me to the limit. I am sensitive to her needs and being very understanding at all times. I don't mind BUT if she doesn't love you, it hurts so badly.<br><br>Lastly, do you all think that when you are after a girl or a guy, one should remain consistent in his/her target and not be distracted by other choices?<br>When I'm dating a girl, I will choose to think in a way that I will not go out with other girls except her and if it work out. I doubt anyone will like the feeling of seeing the person you like to go out with another suitor.<br><br>I really try my best for this relationship.</blockquote>Both of you are still single, so it's OK to go out with Guy A, Guy B~Z. It's socializing, and you have your own female friends too right? I guess you did the right thing by "not controlling/restricting her".<br><br>At your stage, it's best not to use "allowing her to go", because it'll reflects your insecurity, and women hate such person. (This is what I've learnt during my many years of observation in sgForums)<br><br>Yes, I know how you feel. keep on loving that special someone but the love is not reciprocate. After a long time, you seems to be very exhausted and couldn't go on. This is how I feel too.<br><br>I've learn that Loving someone doesn't mean you need to be together with her, just wishing for her happiness and well-being. If the person you love is happy, you'll be happy too right?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Perhaps this is what it meant by Unconditional Love.<br><br>Yup, for me if I am 'wooing'(or secretly admiring, for my case) this girl, I'll love her with all my heart.<br><br>Actually there is no wrong going out with your female friends, just that maybe  you want need to inform your Significant Other who you're going out with. <span style="font-style: italic;">[In accord with Communication, Trust and Honesty Rule.]</span></div>
