Communicating with her, attentive to her needs and so on...<br><br>Few months ago, I told her that I like her. No response so I wait and carry on dating her.<br><br>Few weeks ago, she told me she likes me too but she is not ready for a relationship. Fine. I will give her the time and also the time for both of us to trust and commit more. We are both working adult. Financially independent.<br><br>She is a girl who has <span style="color: red;">plenty of suitors</span>.<br><br>The funny thing is, I will really like to hear from the ladies that when you like a guy, will you meet him even though you are busy or with your group of girl-friends or after your activity be it work, friends or family.<br><br>Ladies, another question is, when you know that there are other suitors after you, and when another guy ask you out for movie, will you go? As for my case, she went ahead and for everyone info, I only went for movie with her once and it was in a case where she was not willing to go.<br><br>My inner voice is telling me that it is not because she doesn't want to go into a relationship. She likes the courtship from man. It is consider very sweet and is even better than in relationship.<br><br>For the man,<br>Am I sensitive to the extend that allowing her to go out with other suitors even she told me that she is going for a movie date with this guy cause she promise to go?<br><br>For the past few months, I'm so tired going after her. I have gave her all my love but she isn't. Sometimes I feel that she is testing my endurance limit and try to push me to the limit. I am sensitive to her needs and being very understanding at all times. I don't mind BUT if she doesn't love you, it hurts so badly.<br><br>Lastly, do you all think that when you are after a girl or a guy, one should remain consistent in his/her target and not be distracted by other choices?<br>When I'm dating a girl, I will choose to think in a way that I will not go out with other girls except her and if it work out.

If not, what so agonizing about this situation. You sure you love her or not when you hardly know her true characters. Even though I'm a girl I can tell you some girls are very cunning.

Anyway your this kind of love could be an obession so don't get confuse hor.<br><br>As everyone above me oredi said - go out with other gals too - in time to come maybe you find one better than her.

By the way do you know the meaning of MCP (Male Chauvinist Pig)? I read your original post again and again and I don't find anything MCP about you leh. You know MCP is da nan ren juyi right? That means a man who think highly of his own opinion only or a man who feels himself highly superior to women. But since you allow her to go out with other guys I don't see how you can be MCP leh?

She calls you when she feels like it ? What are you? Chopped liver? Second choice?<br><br>I don't really suscribe to the idea of unconditional love unless it's last time. I think this where many guys make this mistake. I don't believe one girl is more special than another. There is something special to everyone. Look, just because the girl has looks and is physically more attractive than another doesnt give her the right to diss another human being like a bad habit.<br><br>Thus, I prefer to date a few girls at a time. You won't feel desperate for love and you can evaluate your choices one at a time like you are shopping for a car. You won't just jump into any car right ? Best of all, you won't feel hurt. She has options and so do you.<br><br>Another thing is when a girl doesn't like you, she will not even care about you, so don't lie to yourself about unconditional love. It doesn't work in real life now unless it's in our parents' generation. The only unconditional love you should always shower upon is yourself. You want unconditional love because you actually hope she will like you. Guess what? She will not once she has made up her mind.<br><br>If she can treat you like a chopped liver, it's best you have the balls and be a man. Be firm with her. Cut her off. Have your stand, that's what we guys lack.<br><br>doko</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>Thanks for all the advices offered.<br><br>I think that we guys or should I say the more conservative, passionate ones will be at the losing side. We need time to readjust our mindset that dating a few girls at time is normal and we shouldn't be restricted to only one.<br><br>Somehow, I do hate the idea of being unfaithful but then we aren't even in a relationship. She encouraged me to look around as well, I shouldn't be restricted to one.<br><br>Since I started this thread, it seems that there are a lot of guys out there suffering the same fate as me. We should really meet up one day and start a new lifestyle.<br><br></div>

I absolutely HATE it when a girl whom i used to like (and she knows it) calls me to "pour her heart out" to me about ANOTHER guy. Sometimes lagi best. At first can tell me not ready, why not we go out more often and see how it goes. Ok lor. Go out. Few months later can call me and complain about her new BOYFRIEND, who neglects her lah simi lan simi lan. Suck thumb be a nice guy, console her, give her some tips. Next week sms me "you are such a good friend, i don't know what to do if i have problems and you're not around. Meet up soon for coffee okay?"<br><br>ni na buay......gek tio arh....<br><br>Got one time also, ask me go out with her. Went Wala Wala. Saw her stupid pharking dragonboat friend and invite him to sit down.  Then those 2 down there hee hee ha ha i alone like one cocck. Next time when she asked if i mind her friends joining us i straightforward tell her "Yes i mind. Why not you meet them instead."  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
