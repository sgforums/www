            <div class='col-md body'>Comparing that way... Understand that no matter how good look, there'll always be better looking people than you.... Besides... Comparing something so 'superficial' to your friendship with her? In fact, I thought you should be happy for her as a friend and stop comparing yourself to her... Just BE YOURSELF...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Everybody is UNIQUE in their own way? Why compare?<br><br>I've also personally know sisters and friends who doll up together (or even for each other)... Share make up and dressing tips... Give comments and such... And usually such people turn up BEAUTIFULLY at parties and functions... And the 'beauty' is not just solely because how they help each other doll up... But the HAPPINESS they share with each other... What's beauty without happiness? Why don't make it a CONSTRUCTIVE RELATIONSHIP and GRAB BOTH 'happiness' and 'beauty' than to be so superficial on only one?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know. I've felt the same way once. Friends usually comment on me looking better, etc, until he changed a bit.<br><br>In a way, i'm telling myself that "I want to be noticed! Look at me! Why are you looking at him?" Sounds pretty bad, but its true. Its a case of low-self esteem(for me back then anyway).<br><br>I asked myself, "Hey, do i want a friend, or do i want to be noticed?". I realised i wanted both. And the only way to do it was to develop a high self-esteem, or to get the attention i need through other ways.<br><br>Perhaps i was too used to having attention when i was in my younger years, kept winning chess tournaments. Since my secondary school, poly doesn't treat Chess as a serious CCA, i've stopped winning, and perhaps i'm not too used to the lack of attention now.<br><br>Even now, i post in the hope that someone will quote me, and say "x2" or "I believe _Aaron_ is right". Its a strange thing isn't it?<br><br>Another aspect of looking at it could be girls just want to win each other. They compete and compete, just for the fun of it. You know you shouldn't be so worked up about it, but if its doing you good, then why not continue?<br><br>Just smile when friends compliment her, and tell yourself that you will be better, in a friendly way. Purge the demon(devil) inside you. This is just the ugly side of you that you will have to live with.<br><br>Or you could, adopt a heck-care attitude. Living with this can really make life easier i feel.<br><br>Pray. Pray for forgiveness, and feel the inner peace within.<br>Meditate, let your mind clear, and focus on a favourite phrase or line.<br><br>Other than taking deep breathes, you could also grab a drink, take a stroll, think of happy thoughts to get yourself out of the situation.<br><br>Whatever you choose, just don't go overboard... Don't try to slim yourself by eating only 1 meal a day, you get the idea. Guess i rambled too much again...</div>

ITS QUITE NORMAL.<br><br>But... this is where years of understanding comes out to play, friends are hard to get nowadays, Best buddies are rare if you only consider those who are willing to sacrifice and share stuff with each other.<br><br>I think the feeling you felt now is just temporary, its hard for you to accept that those attention that you had was suddenly divert to your best buddie.<br><br>Advice for You--- Accept that your friend is beautiful But so are you...<br><br>The truth is every person is like a diamond, you just have to discover it!<br><br>Gd Luck and hope you get over it soon.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
