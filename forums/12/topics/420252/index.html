              <p>Do you agree that there are two sides to a person - for example a person can be sometimes negative and positive ?  Or do you think that one side is always dominant in a person ?  That is, a person is predominantly a sad person or predominantly a happy person ?  </p>
              <p>Would anyone wish to remain sad anyway ?  Or is sadness a result of circumstances which are less fulfilling ?</p>
              <p>I realise that I keep falling back into depression.  Am alone most of the days.  Not sure if this is my nature or due to my circumstances.  I am not always sad, though.  There was a period of my life when I was with happy people and engaged in meaningful work.  I was happy then.</p>
              <p>If I believe that I am a naturally sad person, then would it be counter-productive to change myself to be happier ?  Maybe I should accept the sad side of me ?  Society celebrates happiness and admires happy people.  However sadness is the other side of the same coin.  Sadness should not be despised upon nor avoided.  Can it be avoided anyway if it is part of you ?   Many great artists are melancholy people.  It could just be the way a person (brain) is wired.</p>
              <p>I am a person with much conflict.  The more I seek fulfilment, the further I am from it.</p>

              <p>There are people who are naturally "depressed".</p>
              <p>As long as it's not affecting your life too much and doesn't give you suicidal thoughts, then I guess it should be ok.</p>

              <p>On the other hand, I believe that you should still strive to be happy, or at least be more neutral and not depressed.</p>

              <p>Also if this depression is caused by some past events, you should seek to resolve it ASAP, because this is not a "natural" state for you le =&gt; not due to genetics but caused by outside factors.</p>

              <p>Take a look at baby pictures.... tell me how you feel..</p>
              <p>When they smile, they seems so innocent. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/love.png" alt="love.png"> They don't know what is happy/upset. When their demands (milk) are met, they smile at you. :) Otherwise, they'll create hell noise for you if they feel hungry (creating attentions so that demand can be fulfilled).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Life is always up and down, and I am glad you recognize that. Upset/depress/unhappy are negative emotions,  and most of the time it is very unwanted (cos they doesn't make you feel good). We seek for Happy/euphoria because of the powerful positive impact that changes life.</p>
              <p>The power of beliefs and faith, this is something that can alter your future. I am no religious person, but I can definitely tell you that it has changed my life in a significant way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I believe there is something missing in your life right now. I may not know what is it, but I can definitely tell something is missing. You are trying to spend time searching for the missing piece of the puzzle, and I hope you will find it one day.</p>

              <p>Lingmei: But master, please englighten me</p>
              <p>Master nun: wo de ma, ok, let me enlighten you, then you go and think about it in your meditation. "For without saddness, where can there be happiness."</p>
              <p>Lingmei: Oh, thank you master, that mean saddness is the creator and also part of happiness.</p>
              <p>Master nun: no more question, QUIET!!!</p>
