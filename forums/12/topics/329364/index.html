              <p>I used to have quite a close guy friend...I developed a crush for him but never let him know for fear of hurting our friendship. He was in love with another girl at that time, and I played Aunt Agony to him, listening, consoling, helping him choose birthday gift for the girl, you name it, I have done it before.</p>
              <p>Then one night when we were alone...something happened. It kinda destroyed my trust in him, and he became awkward towards me, and that night (I was heavily intoxicated, otherwise this would never happen), I sorta confessed to him my feelings and the next morning he told me we would never be more than friends.</p>
              <p>But friends we couldn't be from then onwards, I distanced myself from him and never talked to him ever since until recently...but even then I know it could never go back to the times it was before.</p>
              <p>It made me realize...yes, friendship is a very fragile thing, cherish it while you can. But losing friends is something that is very common, once it happens, you just need to learn how to move on. You will meet other friends along the way. Of course the memories belong to you, keep them and when you are completely over him, take them out again and they will make you smile.</p>

              kind of. it was my good friend. Now not close anymore. having said that, maybe it's cuz we both found people whom we love and love us back. i'm over him now completely of course, but the friendship's not like last time.
              
              but then another friend also experienced this distancing since he got attached.. so, the problem may not be unique to me :)

              <p>talk as if really platonic relationship is impossible.  Personally, I believe there can be platonic relationship  when a gal and guy go out.    If <span style="color: #ff6600;">they meet once in a while</span>, two of them go out to catch up with each other, it is OK, it is just friendship.  </p>
              <p>When I see one gal and one guy go out, I don't jump into conclusion that they are an item, they could just be friends.</p>

              <p>I used to have quite a close guy friend...I developed a crush for him but never let him know for fear of hurting our friendship. He was in love with another girl at that time, and I played Aunt Agony to him, listening, consoling, helping him choose birthday gift for the girl, you name it, I have done it before.</p>
              <p>Then one night when we were alone...something happened. It kinda destroyed my trust in him, and he became awkward towards me, and that night (I was heavily intoxicated, otherwise this would never happen), I sorta confessed to him my feelings and the next morning he told me we would never be more than friends.</p>
              <p>But friends we couldn't be from then onwards, I distanced myself from him and never talked to him ever since until recently...but even then I know it could never go back to the times it was before.</p>
              <p>It made me realize...yes, friendship is a very fragile thing, cherish it while you can. But losing friends is something that is very common, once it happens, you just need to learn how to move on. You will meet other friends along the way. Of course the memories belong to you, keep them and when you are completely over him, take them out again and they will make you smile.</p>

              <p>Actually after confession and the ability to remains as friends depends on hw the 2 individual look ,their perspective and maturity .</p>
              <p>I have 2 gd incidents like this .</p>
              <p>1st gal is a very gd buddy , we had mutual understanding n cool headed abt this . We remain strong n friendship is steel .</p>
              <p>2nd gal , she is e more outgoing type , thus attracting more guy friends . I fall for her twice in fact .<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"> 1st time the awkward stage sets in , of cos there is also emotional hurt in me . I took abt 2-3mths recovery time to initiate contact with her again , we became great frens again . 2nd time i have no idea y fall again , so the same cycle repeats , except that i didnt screw it up as much as 1st. All the while i didnt confess , but this time the gal distance herself for good and we nv really got back since .</p>
              <p>To me , i find that gals r much more click-able to me than guys . I tend to have this "cherishing" behaviour towards my gal frens more than guy frens . Probably thats y i can retain n strengthen the friendship.I m still exploring ways to get back contact with 2nd gal , becos i really feel that our friendship is worth it for me to try to get it back but of cos she has to feel the same .<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
