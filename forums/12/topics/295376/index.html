Basically it covers on what happens if a person is abused, but is not covered by child abuse laws because he/she is above 16 but below 21. But I need some 'case studies'.<br><br>I need some people whom I can actually conduct an email interview with. Or if you don't mind, you can also paste your scenario here. Your identities will be kept confidential! If you're uncomfortable, your screen names will do.<br><br>All I ask is for your scenario, like what happened with you and the situation now and what did you do. Oh, you'll also need to be above 16..<br><br>Please help! I'm so dead if I can't find anyone =/<br><br>So sorry if this is not the correct place to post this, I'm really, really desperate. Thanks!

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah exactly.<br><br>that is why it's kind of hard to find interviewees.<br><br>which might possibly be the reason why i seem ecstatic, but is actually not the case. if i were to find joy in the abuse of children, i would not even have bothered writing a story on what can a person do if a similar scenario happens. a scenario would be the personal touch which will hopefully draw more readers.<br><br>i mean, who would want to read something linear, can get it straight off the internet on procedures.<br><br>yeah, so i'm banking on identity will be kept confidential in hopes of people opening up. =/</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most likely people would not know they had been abused. They would think its discipline. And the abused victims tends to be very young children or babies, which means it would be hard to remember that period of time when they grow into adults.<br><br>Or you could just fabricate data. Mr X or whatever was abused as a child. His mom put him into the washing machine, hung him on the ceiling fan while his dad burn ciggarattes all over his body.</div>

You must conquer the fear and not the other way around.<br>This fear will affect your upgrown character and your outgoing attitude towards outsiders. Your fear may affect your family or ur son. You may have violent images install in your sub consicous and may release out in an urge. That mean you will learnt what you had suffered and apply to ur son , wife or any other realative. SO get urself cured right now.<br><br>An example i can list out. IN NS, why an old bird official will sabo or tekan young regulars. Because they suffered during their old days.<br><br>Well. The brain has many section to analyse. I will list out the two la.<br>First one is the learning department. THis department very stupid one. Learnt whatever you see.<br><br>Second is the logical department. This department will filter out the bad one and transfer to the memory department so you will remember that is bad and dun do it. If your department here is defective, then you will tend to learn the bad thing lo and apply it to the other lo. This is what people call EQ la. Aiya fark it la go read up.</div>
