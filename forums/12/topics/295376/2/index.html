            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Thank you so much for opening up, I may not know how you feel exactly, but it must have been awful. Awful probably can't even describe your pain, and I'm so sorry about whatever that happened.<br><br>Just to clarify, you were abused until the age of 19? What age are you this year? I'm guessing in your 20s?<br><br>Also, uhh, your gender? How many siblings? Current occupation?<br><br>Did you know of any child protection scheme then? Or the personal protection order? Why didn't you do anything to protect yourself?<br><br>Erm, If you're uncomfortable about talking about this here, please let me know. I'll drop you a PM!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by marchieaddict:</div><div class="quote_body">I can help you. I am a victim of family abuse.<br><br>Scenerio: Physical and mental abuse<br>Physical -&gt; anything from being stomped on, being belted, being caned, getting slippers thrown at you, getting all sorts of household applicances thrown at you, getting textbooks torn up, getting dinner overturned on you being locked out of the house etc....<br><br>( i know some will say being spanked is normal. Trust me, this isnt normal spanking. It was enough to force me to consider suicide at the age of 11 before somehow it actually developed me into a strong person)<br><br>Mental / vebral abuses: All sorts of vulgarities, being told off better as a prositute, being told cannot make it in life, being told can never make it to uni might as well drop out of jc go study (and hey i the top 5 sec school/jcs type ok),  being scolded for useless etc etc<br><br>What did i do then-&gt; nothing.. but it either makes or breaks a child... it made me very much resolved to break away by studying harder and breaking free.. it turned my younger brother who was a bright child with a PSLE score of near 260 scored under such tyranny into a sec school dropout, AWOL and drifting ard now.<br><br>What happens to me? -&gt; i shifted out the moment i could.. when i was 19... close to 10 years lio... cut off contact with my tormentor till today<br><br>Till today, I cannot bring myself to tell people what happened.. Only very close 1 or 2 friends know what happened.. till now as i am typing this and revisitng a wounded part of me, my tears are dropping freely even tho i have been free of it for the last 10 yrs... Scars such as these can never truly heal...<br>Maybe some people will say this is nothing but to someone who has lived in terror, the fear is very real. Till today, I am afraid of people suddenly standing near behind me because a lot of the attacks were unprovoked and unanticipated.<br><br>Let me know if more questions....<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
