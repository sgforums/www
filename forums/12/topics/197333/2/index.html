And perhaps it's just a not so 'ripe' relationship...?<br><br>You're somehow 'afraid' (inside but you're not showing it)... Lost maybe...? 'Escaping'...? Avoiding certain things...? Somehow you see where the problem lies but you also see her too good a thing to take any risk of possibly losing her... In other words... You don't really dare to make much 'move'... Any 'venture' or gamble which might cost you a 'her'....<br><br>Your 'vision' for this relationship is not far-sighted enough... You rather go for temporaries content... No questions.. No headache acceptance... Downsizing 'existing problem(s)'.... Which often would be seeded deep into the roots of a relationship.... 'Sleeping'... But just waiting to dominate just weeds again one day...<br><br>From your way of handling the current situation, it seems quite unlikely that the relationship might be built upon a stable foundation in the future... Then again, I won't wanna be too quick on commenting that because I won't know if you really ain't taking other alternate plannings at the same time for all these... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> </div></blockquote>hmm if you are refering to the ag <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> e i out in my profile, its fake, but anyway i'll still think about what u've said.<br><br>somethings u've said are right. i see her as someone who is too good for me to lose but i think i am more open to problems than what u've said above. avoiding, no questions, no headache acceptance is not me at all. she knows all about it, those things that i am pleased or displeased with her because when things happen, i'll talk to her.<br><br>that night when i started this thread, i think i am in a rather pessimistic mood myself (probably due to her "coldness" that night. its her mood swing that i am getting familiar to and learning to accept.) so i logged on to seek some support i guess.<br><br>haha.. anyway, thats from my point of view. but i do thank you alot because u make me think about my r/s which i hope to grow from it. btw i am pisces and i my mood is often affected by hers. when she is sad, i immediately feel a sense of melancholic in me. when she is happy, my spirts will be proportionally lifted. that can probably explain why i hate to see her cry  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>i'll keep a note of what u guys have said and learn to be less insecure, do things together etc etc. once again i thank all who have replied.</div>

Your way of handling your relationship.. Hmm... Maybe it's not really a 'young mentality' method but more of your nature then...?<br><br>Are you a 'bochap' person...? Well... Personally, I think you CAN be... You can care quite SO MUCH for someone you truly love and yet at the same time if you're uninterested... You can just be so... Cold and distal....?<br><br>Try to use your care and concern for her to your advantage... Try to make her FEEL your love for her and appreciate your genuine moves for her... Not just taking things for granted... Not asking you to reprimand her though? And make her aware.. One way or another...? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>It's not only so much about the insecurity you're experiencing that I'm concerned with... But your 'break point'...? The point where you start to just give up on things...? And your 'build up effect'..? The one you've mentioned about being happy when she's happy and sad when she's sad...? That somehow might have a negative snowball effect if things might really roll downhill one day....? Dark cloud might just cover your relationship one day, and both of you might just be sucked deeper and deeper into it... But of course, it's all too early to tell if that's gonna happen because I'm still missing on a crucial part of the picture... Which is your gf.....<br><br>Personally, I feel that on top of making her more appreciative of you in certain sense... You should also learn to have more control over your own mood and not let it swing too much according to the relationship... Especially when things are going for the worse...? You shouldn't really let yourself be so easily affected too much by it... Right now, judging by your mentality and taking... You're just too much into that... Take a step and see how things go... External factor controls your relationship too much over...</div>
