If you have no reasons then what you do is suppress the feelings.<br><br>Replace your negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Everytime you have a negative thought, banish it.

You are too accomodating and she thinks you are a <strong>wimp</strong>.

Are you kidding me? You don't get the hint? Her interest in you is diminishing by the minute. Maybe, she met someone new, but is hesitant to break the news to you. Sounding uninterested is just one of her ways to hint to you. It's time you face the harsh reality of a change in heart.<br><br></div>
