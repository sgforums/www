Lots of giving in and apologises to soften her. You cannot be tough on this one. Chances are, she won't just forgive you too easily on this one. Let her know that you've knew your mistakes and won't commit them again. After she've cool down, you MIGHT still stand a chance.

Alternatively... If you just want a break, let me know.. I might also be able to teach you how to do a better job.... Afterall, that's one Devil's specialities....</div>

Just that things often don't happen for no reasons, and some things don't happen by itself. Hence in this case, it's called a 'pushed'. The more you pressurise and corner someone, the higher the likely chance that relative actions would be taken. When you leave her with little choices, even a loyal partner could swift.</div>

Make it a 'double'.<br><br>How long have they been together already? My guess is she's just stuck in between... As much as she loves you and wish to be loyal to you, she's probably somewhere on the same line with the other guy...<br><br>She's emotional... Too emotional to get her thoughts straighten out most of the time... What's making it worse? You're equally emotional....<br><br>Unless you can straighten out your thoughts 1st, make a FAST MOVE in straightening her thoughts out and convincing her that she wants to come back to you (with much consideration to what's really going on between her and the other guy)... There might be a relative chance... Without which, both of you would probably just have to swirl around in 'emotions' and let fate plays its game on you.....</div>
