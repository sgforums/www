You wait and see.. nothing will be done.. If you really want to continue this relationship.. speak up to her again.. Another thing.. do remember that you did invade her privacy by reading her mails..<br><br>Sometimes all you need is not how your hearts feels.. is a matter of what you think about.. Sit down and think whether is she really worth.. She has agreed to you that she wouldn't contact xxx but then again.. she did not hold her promises.. well.. if one cannot fulfil any promises.. don't PROMISE! - it hurts if it breaks.. Are you sure and definite that she will do such things to you again?? You had her body.. but her heart is not with you.. Do think you'll be happy afterall??<br><br>Why not try to see the other side.. When on door closes there's always another one open for you.. Whether you wanna walk to that open door.. is your choice.. loving someone doesn't have to haveher.. but seeing her finding her own happiness.. it the greatest achievement/ blessing you can get/ give..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

And he agreed not to contact her, but I have now found out that they remain in contact.<br><br>For the first .5 second this morning when I woke up, I was so relieved thinking it was only a dream. Then I remembered that it is not a dream, and that I did read those emails. Felt really sad after that. Sometimes really don't understand why my life is so tough. I already had my share of family problem and work related problem.</div>
