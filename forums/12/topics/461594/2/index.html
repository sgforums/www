              <p>However, to ease the awkwardness,
              you might want to surface your intention that you want to know her
              better as a friend willingly and see if that picks up. </p>
              <p>Hence, if you have decide to pursue
              this option, you would naturally need to be more rejection
              resistant and yet be mindful of proceeding in a comfortable
              pace. </p>

              <p>I know my weaknesses, it's the wound I carried over from the past and it's fear of failure as you said that's why I find it hard to make a move.

It's always been that way and I don't know how to get out of this contradiction between the heart and the mind.</p>

              <p>Asking her to meet up after work so it sounds more casual and less awkward, right? Or I should try weekend?</p>

              <p>Thank you everyone for helping me more than I had expected and
              sorry for my disapearance.</p>
              <p>I sent her a text couple days ago just to check out on how shes
              doing. Her reply was normal like before as if nothing happened. I
              don't know it's a good sign or it's that she doesn' care anymore
              because I heard from one of our mutual friends that looks like she
              is getting more close to a guy who is also our mutual friend and no
              doubt he's been attracted to her for long time. She is not at all a
              flirt I'm sure but I know that she is no short of guys hitting on
              her so my chance can be slim. I will ask her out but I think I will
              need to warm up a bit first before doing that perhaps two, theree
              weeks or so.</p>

              <p>Her text was normal that didn't indicate whether she is still interested in you or not but you are so lucky at least she didn't give you a cold shoulder or totally ignore you like some girls would do that's good to restart things with her.</p>
              <p>But there, told you if you don't grab your chance other guys may steal from you. This is time she is perhaps going through some emotional struggle so she will become open and get closer to someone who is there for her. Be warned!</p>
              <p>You may take some time to ask her out later but keep conversations with her going on just so she knows you are still there for her or also think about her.</p>

              <p>Fear of failure, fear of rejection?!! What do many of you guys these days think really? She showed her interest, she asked you out, she confessed to you that's something I actually admire and honestly if I was her, I would have never set my eyes on you again if I knew you like me but you never moved your a** to let it show. I'm curious how long she's been keeping her hope about you when you never asked her out and even turned her down. That's tiring and boring. Sorry TS to sound harsh but she deserves much better.</p>
