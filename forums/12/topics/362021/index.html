              <p>1. You must accept that no two humans will ever think alike. There will always be differences.<br>2. It is only how you bridge those differences, find a common ground and live with it.<br>3. Relationships thus are never easy. But why relationships are common and will continue to thrive is one person's need for companionship. The initial attraction causes a desire to know more about a person, and in time more of the other will be revealed.<br>4. Then it is time when one must either accept that person, warts, flaws and all or reject to find another.<br>5. In rejection, understand there is no perfection. It is only what we do with another's flaw and make the other perfect in our own eyes.<br>6. Understand too, we ourselves are not perfect, and must constantly reflect and accept criticisms, harsh or kind, and if true, we must change to evolve. Failure which we will only lead lonely and wasted lives.</p>
              <p>So should you continue or give up. Only you alone can determine for it is a life you live, no one else can. While it may difficult to change another person, all it needs is only to review oneself, and find how one can adapt to another's viewpoint and effect the change within, little steps and incremental, with patience, a lot of patience. <br>Only you alone can determine the value of your relationship with her. Do consider and reconsider pt.5 most seriously and carefully.</p>

              <p>She told you she is fickle and keeps talking to you about her ex.</p>
              <p>If someone said this, u jolly well take it positively she is really fickle since her action already proved it.Â Â Â  When a person keeps talking about her ex indicateds that she has not gotten over him yet.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself do you want to spend your life with such a person.Â Â  Moreover she is demanding.Â Â Â  She is demanding now, after marriage she will be worse.</p>
              <p>From what I see, this relationship is not worth the keep.Â Â  This is just my thought.Â Â  Decision lies with you.</p>

              <p>she is honest with you how she feels. are you? have you talk to her how you feel when she talks about her ex?</p>
              <p>though people says girls are more sensitive, but there are some who are not. she might not have know that she is hurting you by talking about her ex. (i guess non of her ex have told her about it) she might just feel that its normal talking about it because its already over.</p>
              <p>and are you happy with her? i feel that once there is a break up, a r/s can never be the same anymore. it can either be more treasured by both parties, or the feeling might have already faded more or less.</p>
