She is young,has to work long hours, but has broke up with bf already. She told me she dun want to start a relationship first cos she want a stable career. But to me sounds like a way of rejecting. I will get to know her better before confessing to her since up to now she and I are still communicating quite comfortable, might still have a little chance.
