Its where you can be vulnerable to that person and trust that person will not go on you or stab you in the back. However to attain that kind of trust, one must be willing and have the patience to find out by getting to know the person more and understanding the person. It has to be done by both parties.<br><br>Once you understand that person more, you will know how that person behave, what is that person's quirks and habits, lifestyle and maturity. Once you have these information, you will instantly know how to interact well and better and have no fear conversing in whatever topic you can come up with. The trust is already there and you two know how to deal with each other better.<br><br>Let me ask you: which will be more easier to talk to when the topic is about sex? Someone you knew for 5+++ years or someone whom you knew 1 week ago?<br><br>So... the stability or foundation is the trust and understanding you have for each other. You can add other values in it too. Mine's not the absolute answer but you get the point. This is not just being refered to Boy-Gal-relationship. Its being refered to every possible relationship you can have with all kinds of people out there.<br><br>Beers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
