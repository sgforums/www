Not throughout your own NSF 2 years you also kena confined one... (unless you really damn 'sway'?)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

There may be other possibilities but too little information between you and her. Its between you and her, NOT between you and her being disclosed in the forum here.<br><br>Why? She may be harbouring break up. Whether it comes to fruition or not depends on them. Supposed they break up, then she "stead" with you. It is obvious the dating is mostly based on a bounced relationship (she is trying to fill the void).<br><br>What to do: Suggest more time to know each other as friends, be there for her when she need company. Have fun with her. Do not influence her decision to break off with her current guy or no.<br><br>Ultimately its your decision. Think carefully what you want, what she wants and what her guy wants.</div>
