Perhaps when he's a little older and a little more experienced in life, his perception of things may change.<br><br>In any case, marrying a older woman is a problem only if you wish it to be. Hugh Jackman (Wolverine in the movies) married a woman eight years older than he is, and unlike many other Hollywood marriages, they're a picture of wedded bliss. I don't see him being made a laughing stock at all.<br><br>More recently and closer to home, a 30 year-old man married a 104 year-old woman in Malaysia.<br><br>Age is not a problem so long as both partners are happy together. If people want to laugh at them, then they're a bunch of narrow-minded people. Off-topic, I've also been mocked at for dating Chinese girls (I'm Malay). But I couldn't care less what those narrow-minded twits are thinking with their limited brain matter.<br><br>So why care about what people think of when you're dating an older woman?</div>

Your argument of a 20 year-old guy with no money and a 28 year-old woman with money is actually based on a difference of earning power and not a difference of age as you have tried to describe.<br><br>If the 20 year-old guy has already completed his NS and starts working, he will be more worthy of the woman, is that not? And how about a man and a woman who are eight years apart but have about the same earning power, for Eg. a 30 year-old man and a 38 year-old woman? In this case, there will be no problems even though they have an eight year gap in age as they have the same earning power.</div>

I broke up with the younger girl (is very pretty and 4 yrs my jr) in 3 months, due to incompatibility. I've been in my current r/s for 5 yrs (and still going), and although I don't want to reveal the age of my gf (average looking), she is 5-10 yrs older than me.<br><br>In the initial stage of the r/s, my gf thinks about the opinions from others strongly. Because she's also taller than me, curious passerbys tend to look at us often. So much so that even one ang moh is jealous enough to taunt me about it, lol. So basically, she feels uncomfortable. I did tell her it's ok to break up if she prefers an older man, I want her to be happy anyway. Also, some of my previous friends must be thinking I'm living off her, and of course I let them live on with such fallacies, despite that couldn't be further from the truth, because it happens my gf likes to shop alot and spurge on expensive branded goods and go japan etc, and guess who has to help to pay?<br><br>Maybe the r/s last in my case because I'm super thick skin, I really don't give a da<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>mn what others think. But when I do care, I make sure the accusations are massacre and held responsible. Second thing is that my gf knows I'm genuine and not after her money, anyway she don't have much money to speak off. It might be more dangerous in your situation if your gf have alot of money. And finally, my parents respect my decisions on what I do. They are forced to think that way because I've left home for a few months due to disagreements with them. Basically, I tend to take an extreme strong stand on certain issues.<br><br>What I think is that you either need to get over what others think of you, or it's better for you to find a younger and more "suitable" girl for yourself. I believe if you let your family know the type of girl you like, it's hard for them to ignore it. Oh yeah, in the intial stage of my r/s, I was just about to go into NS and earning peanuts too. During that time, me and my gf normally go dutch. But I guess money is just part of the equation, the other part is your sincerity and personality towards your gf. In your case, I'm sorry to hear that you're under extreme pressure from outside factors pertaining to your r/s. You know what I think about extreme pressures; they can break you, or make you harder and stronger in life.</div>
