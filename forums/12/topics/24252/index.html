Even ugly guys can be rich or caring enough to get nice gfs, why can't you? It's just a matter of overcoming and the girl's acceptance of it.... Ugly guys don't turn handsome so that their gf can accept them? Think the 1st real barrier here is YOURSELF... Having no confidence would definitely affect your personal communication skill to a certain extent....<br><br><strong><br>i basically tried things like taking up a sport, do some breathing techniques and even drank less water. i dismiss the idea that it may have been my hair gel that's causing it or even if its the humidity level in singapore. is it in my genes? if its not, is it curable cuz it really bothers me at this point. it is unlikely to be any of those cuz i remembered that i sweat a lot even in my younger days. i was in top form in secondary school which doesn't change that, but i never fail to feel dehydrated after a soccer match or a cca. these days, i jogged once every 2 or 3 days to sweat it out.</strong><br><br>Have you tried seeing a doctor?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> Our body perspire through pores found on our skin and in the case of 'sweaty palm', sweat glands found on the palm could actually be removed to cure or reduce the condition considerably... Not sure if it's applicable to a body though?<br><br>PERSONAL COMMENT here.<br><br>Your condition could be caused by genetical reason. BUT according to a physiology of a working human mechanism, a body perspire to COOL DOWN the body. By doing extensive HEATY exercises that would make your body burn considerably, you might be indirectly encouraging that EXCESSIVE PERSPIRATION?<br><br>I'm not sure how breathing technique is gonna help on this issue, but REDUCING your water consumption is most probably gonna cause your body to heat up more easily and hence might have an advert effect?<br><br><strong><br>i don't know if i have too much water stored in me or is it my body heating up more often which causes the water to displace the heat thus causing me to sweat uncontrollably. i just don't know!. i don't feel like i'm eye to eye with the rest. i carry a towel around in my bag in case i needed to make a trip to the toilet. is there a solution for this? are there real cures for this sort of thing or is it just me?</strong><br><br>Don't feel too sad about collect a towel around with you ok? Think about how some girls have to carry makeups with them wherever they go?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  If you have a need for it, just do it... it's not like you're causing harm to anyone? Anybody who sees you as weird should be so NARROW-MINDED to do so....<br><br>Another additional thing would be that, since you perspire quite alot and Singapore is quite humid... You would have to keep a GOOD PERSONAL HYGIENE ORDER so as to prevent unneccessary odour or such?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Ok...

            <div class='col-md body'>it is ok .. most guys sweat alot.. i sweat alot even in air con places...<br>it is good to drink more water but it make seems like make u sweat more but your body need water so it is ok ..<br>carry a towel around is ok lah ... u can make it part of your wearing , fashion also .. u never see those amercian black rappers always have towel hanging on thier pants.. even Harlem Yu always carry a towel when you see him hosting super sunday ... and will that guy say before he sweat alot.. sometimes u can even see him taking the towel to wipe off his sweat even he is hosting.. anyway the most important is... HIS WIFE IS BEAUTIFUL .. kekekee..<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>sweat it ok dont smell can liao ... anyway if u smell there is always anit pesperties( dont know how to SPELL)! can dry up your sweat faster.. but sometimes it end up dirty your clothes like make it yellowish... wear dark color cotton materials  will help to absorb your sweat  and dont make it smell much also ...<br>so people cannot see that uare sweating so much .. but it is quite hot to wear too lah ..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why don't you try going to teh doctor to get that lotion...but hey i guess for guys to sweat is pretty normal...in a weather like Singapore, nobody will blame you unless you sweat buckets...i think you should not be too concerned...maybe try to see a doctor, at lease he will be able to tell you whether you are sweating normally or not....and also get your lotion from him...cause sometimes these kind of lotion need prescription from the doctor.</div>
