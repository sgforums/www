            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Gauze:</div><div class="quote_body">My girl is Christian, I'm Muslim and we've been together for around 5 years already. I don't think we had to negotiate much about our religious identity. We simply take interest in exploring them.<br><br>When the fasting month comes, she wants to follow us fasting also. For sunday mass, we'd drop by the church earlier and Id hang out some place else while she attends it. She told me strongly not to force her to wear a tudung, but she tempts me with a yummy looking pork dish while she eats one (she laughs). Normal things like that.<br><br>Religion isnt an issue between us two. So I'd agree with countdracula's post, that its external pressures. Its weird though our parents doesnt seem to mind. Probably its because they secretly expect each of us to convert someday.<br><br>Marriage ah. We're not willing to go through it yet as I'm in NS ord-ing 2008 only. When the time comes, we're willing to undertake the demands for us to stay together. If minds change or the struggle fails, I doubt religion is to blame because despite it, we did drink and got drunk of joy from the same cup.</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I am impressed.<br><br>It's heartening to see your relationship acknowledging religion and love as separate entity because things are quite tricky when 'God' is part of the picture. Many people struggled from this crisis and eventually got defeated by their prudent perception that God must exist first before Love. Assimilation is not the only way to achieve harmony in such relationship.<br><br>Ultimately they suffered the struggle and conflicts from within - a Jupiter affliction in synastry (astrology).<br><br>To achieve harmony, one must work to liberate ourselves from spiritual imprisonment of such reasoning made by man, in name of God and to honor love into your heart in perfect love and trust.<br><br>Why would God forbid something so natural and beautiful like Love? In the end, the suppression is largely self inflicted by man themselves.<br><br>I do not know how long your relationship could continue in such a fashion, but certainly, the higher wisdom that existed in handling your relationship is indeed commendable. Allow me to encourage you to pursue what love wants of you and not succumb to critics of society and all moralistic/religious blasting to condemn your relationship.<br><br>Being zealous does not necessarily mean that one would have a fulfilling relationship - they are mutually exclusive. In fact, I fondly recalled one old aunt agony case involving a promiscuous wife being nine-months married to a pastor due to reasons other than love. The man suspected his wife and controlled her socially with rules, breed from possessiveness and chauvinism.<br><br>It's a pity that I couldn't follow up the case as the TS had stopped replying, but what I am trying to tell you is that cosmic lesson/s in love and relationship permeates anything in life... be it money, life, religion, family or career, being all different aspects of your life.<br><br>Should I burn in hell for relating such blasphemous thoughts, it's because thou art (love) to me a delicious torment. I would rather face God or the dogs of fire acted upon my freewill I have chosen in my life, than to realize that at the end of my road, I am but leading the life of others, not grasping the full extends of my own destiny.<br><br>God grows you spiritually... so does Love. They can complement each other - they don't have to cannibalize each other's existence. It certainly takes some wisdom to look from that perspective. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

If one conviction and love is feeble, you can have the same skin colour, race, religion, status and whatever thingy that segment our society - things just won't work out.<br><br>How long do you want to live under your parent's ideology of what they reckon life is best for you? Even the young birds must one day flap their wings and leave their comfortable nest in search of food for themselves - you will one day fall in love and start a family in the future. These are major decisions in life which you must learn to be responsible for and ultimately learn what's best for yourself based on your own failure and experience.<br><br>Should you fail, you must fail with your own hands and not disrupted by nefarious plots others/society had instilled into your mind, which causes the failure.<br><br>There are some things in life worth fighting for and if you have decided that this love is paramount to your personal growth, you must draw steel and fight for what you believe.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
