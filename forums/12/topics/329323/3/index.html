              <p><br> U know...he got stunned when u confessed and then he said he "will
              give give u an ans soon". In other words, this came as a shock to
              him, he's unsure of his feelings for u and he needs some time to
              cool and think about it, in case he makes a wrong decision.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then he says he's not ready for a r/s. That to me, is pretty
              lame but a gentlemanly reason to tell u "ur not the one".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ur fren seems to me like a person who forces himself to be calm
              and collected (well, he seems to be doing quite well). He tries his
              best to incorporate rationality in his thoughts. Even if he told u
              he has thought of u.....it seems more like stemming from guilt but
              definitely not the "bastard leading u on". He seems like a pretty
              disciplined person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh well anyway, he does seem really difficult to chase cos he
              doesn't believe in coming out alone with a gal. There are people
              made for people in this world, so he may well just not be the one
              "whom u will end up with".</p>

              <p>From what i've heard from GUYS, most guys actually like girls to
              take initiative.</p>
              <p>Blame it on me for being ignorance. But judging from your
              username, i dont recall seeing any GUYS name that start with val.
              So if that's the case, telling me you will never like any girl who
              confesses to you seems like something NORMAL. But then again, if no
              GUYS name start with val &amp; yours do, if you will like to
              confess to girl, maybe you reply the wrong thread? Do read the
              title of this thread again.</p>
              <p>Not that i'm against homo, in fact i'll still respect them
              because they're just being themselves. Nevertheless, i will not
              respect people who dont respect themselves to start with. And to be
              frank, even if people like YOU, who want to reply to this thread,
              they're most welcome because i'll treat all with respect as long as
              they respect themselves too. And definitely, i'm grateful that
              people are actually willing to take time to read the thread &amp;
              reply.</p>
              <p>By the way, you say normally. Sadly, most people like to tell me
              that i'm always the exception. I'm confident of myself, and by
              confessing, it further prove the point. At least i dont feel upset
              with my look &amp; have the courage to confess. I wont hide at one
              side crying over my look, be it good or bad.</p>
              <p>Last but not least, not all people are like SOME, who is so
              SUPERFICIAL &amp; only love the SURFACE. If you fall into that
              category, i feel for you. You've NEVER love anyone truly.</p>
              <p>Do search for the inner beauty of the others. For some may look
              good on the outside but sucky inside, &amp; vice versa.</p>
              <p>Thanks for your reply.</p>

              doesnt change the fact that you are desperate and cheap. the more a girl shows me she likes me and gets all clingy and keeps calling the more sick i get of her. you cant be pretty. no pretty, self loving girl would pursue a guy in that manner. i get chased around a lot by really ugly girls so i know. only ugly girls chase. pretty girls are reserved and get chased instead cause they know they are attractive and guys flock to them instead of the other way round. anyway, you are being dumb for taking a long time to type all that shit out for a guy who doesnt even care about you. dumb slut.

              <p><br>"I'm not ready for a r/s" is a very common way of rejection. And lame because it's not true most of the time. It's a way of not hurting the other party.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There was this girl who liked me and when I expressed, she said she's "not ready for a r/s". But it was not a form of rejection....because her fondness for me signals were clear, it's just that she had a bad r/s which ended terribly just a few months back.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your case, the guy is hardly even showing the faintest of signals and even rejected u....that is after he has rationalised his thoughts.</p>

              <p><br> "I'm not ready for a r/s" is a very common way of rejection. And

              said she's "not ready for a r/s". But it was not a form of
              rejection....because her fondness for me signals were clear, it's
              just that she had a bad r/s which ended terribly just a few months

              <p>Thanks, now i understand more. Previously really is clueless to what you're saying :) and sadly, i do fall into the category of 'not ready for a r/s' too. Which i've told him that also. He has his life while i have mine. In which i'm really busy with as well and i'm not too sure if i can commit myself. Though i confessed, i didnt want to misled him either.</p>
              <p>Anyway, indeed. I'm blinded when it comes to my own matter. But i can always have a clear view of others matter so i do have alot of friends coming to me when they faced problems themselves. I'm AA among my friends, haha.</p>
              <p>Oh, by the way, i wasnt down. Just curious to his stand &amp; thinking. In fact, i wasnt really hurt because i already anticipated his answer so i was prepared for it. But like most, just stubbornly want him to tell me personally, haha.</p>

              <p>Hi all, a new-comer here. Just hope to hear some opinions from

              <p>Before i go into anything, i'll just state my belief first.</p>
              <p>I'm sure alot out there heard of this before: In life, there'll

              way, he's in ns now)</p>
              <p>He'd kind of accompanied me through some highs &amp; lows in
              life, since i'll pretty much message him when i'm bored. So it kind
              of becomes a 'habit' to message him. This 'habit' pretty much
              lasted for a year.</p>
              <p>He's shy in person, but pretty lame when messaging. We'd
              <strong>never</strong> gone out together before. Not one-on-one
              (due to his religious belief that guy &amp; girl shouldnt hang out
              one-on-one, &amp; i respect that), neither in a group. I did see
              him once in a blue moon when there's service. But nothing else from
              there.</p>
              <p>As a friend, i'm guilty but to say, i've flare up at him alot of
              times with some trivial things. I'll ignore his messages &amp; even
              treating him invisible in person. Then when i shimmer down a few
              days later, i'll just message him as per normal like nothing ever
              happens.</p>
              <p>But all the while, he'd never, NEVER ever get angry with me
              before. This really amaze me. Seriously, even at times i find
              myself really unreasonable &amp; i cannot stand myself. I really
              wonder how he manage to bear with me. He told me that he'd been a
              pretty short-tempered person. But he'd learn not to get angry
              easily.</p>
              <p>I dont know. I think that pretty much started things? I mean,
              which friends dont quarrel? Who wont hurl hurtful remarks at each
              other when angry? He never did. And slowly, lately, i realised i
              started to develop feeling for him, STRANGELY ENOUGH. Since he
              doesnt really fall into the catgory of the type of guy i'll fall
              for. It's just very mild feeling, but i noticed it.</p>
              <p>I still remembered i once told him, i wanted a 'house-husband'.
              Someone who would do the housework. And he replied that he's fine
              with doing housework. And though he dont know how to cook, he's
              willing to learn. He seems like the 'perfect' guy for me.
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>I have to say, as
              i've earlier stated, i believe he'll fall into the third category.
              The one that i'll hope to end up with eventually</em>,</span> since, like i say, the feeling is very mild. And i know he wont be
              the one i'm going to love most. But i think up till date, he's the
              one that suit me the most.</p>
              <p>As i'm really afraid to fall deeper &amp; get rejection (yes, i
              agreed i'm selfish), i decided to 'test water'. So just when i
              realise i've feeling for him, a day or two later, i decided to
              confess. But just in case, i 'tested water' the whole day. So i
              asked him if he'll accept a girl if she confessed. He replied that
              it'll depends on who she is, &amp; i was like 'but if you dont like
              dont even need to depends what? just reject', which he agreed upon.
              After which he just stopped replying, saying that he doesnt feel
              really comfortable talking about bgr matters.</p>
              <p>That's it. I've the 'do it now or never' mentality. So i just
              confessed, via sms. I didnt really goes to him with 'i-like-you'
              kind of thing. But i just do it my way which he understands anyway.
              He was stunned. And told me he'll give me an answer soon. Which he
              did next day afternoon. He rejected me saying that he dont intend
              to go into a r/s now or anytime soon. To avoid any awkward &amp;
              continue to be friend, &amp; to be truthful, i just told him that
              i'm not really serious &amp; the feeling is really mild &amp; i was
              just being really random &amp; laugh it off.</p>
              <p>Right now, we're back into the friend zone. However, there seems
              to be a barrier somewhere. Since then, i called him pretty often.
              Nothing better to do, you see. Just bored, as usual. I assume he's
              pretty bored too in ns? Assume. <em>There was once when he, too,
              told me that he thought of me &amp; wanted to call me, but didnt in
              the end.</em> Anyway, i summarise the story &amp; told a guy friend
              of mine. Who say that W is just a bastard trying to lead me on.
              Which i do agree with abit. How can anyone reject a girl already
              still say will think of her? But i think W is just not such a
              person? He doesnt seems like. Cause he seems like the pretty good
              listener &amp; good friend to other friends too.</p>
              <p>Anyway, since the confession, we still message as per normal.
              Most of the sms-es are initiated by me, as usual, but sometimes
              he'll just message me too. However, lately he hasnt been picking up
              my calls anymore. Though he'll still message me after that asking
              if i'd called him &amp; so on. He just say he's not able to, the
              phone not beside him, he's busy, not convenient in ns, etc. I just
              absorb everything, with the thinking that he's just avoiding me
              &amp; refusing to pick up those calls (i guess most will agree with
              me over here). And well, i just take it as it is.</p>
              <p>So the last time i called him was on last Saturday. Which he
              pick up &amp; didnt bother messaging me back after that. And on
              Sunday, i decided not to message him. But at night, he messaged to
              apologise that he's really sorry about not being able to pick up
              the calls lately, in which, i didnt reply back. We havent been in
              contact these few days. He didnt bother taking initiative to
              message me also, neither did i.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So right now, i'm just wondering, what's his stand?</p>
              <p>Maybe is just i think too much. But he'd absolutely no interest
              in me. Fret not, i'm all ready to move on. And in fact i'm not
              staying at the same spot? At least i dont feel hurt or what.</p>
              <p>Just that i'm wondering, what he's actually thinking?</p>
              <p>Will you guys be able to give me your two penny thoughts from
              your point of view?</p>
              <p>Thank you very much, and sorry for the lengthy...essay?

              <p>R-emo, i didn't read the 3 pages of replies so I'm not sure if someone has said something similar.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From a guy's point of view i think he is attracted to you in some way but the feeling is also mild. He sounds like a pretty nice guy to me.. goes for service, willing to learn to cook etc etc.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I was just wondering if he's the kind of guy that doesn't mix around much with girls? Because honestly, I think its quite a poor reason he doesn't think he should hang out with a girl one-on-one due to religious beliefs. If its a friend, its a friend. Why bother if its a guy or a girl? Sure seems to me that he's got some issues mixing with people of the opposite sex. Maybe that's the reason why he rejected you.</p>
              <p><br>Like you said he's a little shy... probably a little too shy then.  </p>
