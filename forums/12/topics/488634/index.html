              <p>I hate UOB because they did wrong on me and cause me to be miserable yet they did not admit it.  They even scolded me, particularly, a manager. </p>
              <p>It happen few years ago, briefly, what happens was, i had 20k on FD with UOB.  It is a way to hide and reserve.  I was supose to have a secured credit card.  Next, i flew out of Singapore, i never receive the card, but that was ok. </p>
              <p>My sister asked me for a loan.  I told her, i did not have it then but may be in over a month's time (I was thinking of the FD maturity).  Few weeks later i called UOB to instruct thst the FD to go to my savings account which is dried out.   I was making plans to move to another location overseas and make new attempt to build my life. With the money i knew i could do things i want to do, learn driving etc.</p>
              <p>But UOB shooked my already misorganize life to miserable confused life.  UOB said i already withdrawn $15k as loan. ??!!!!??? My mind and heart broken into pieces.   After calls i found out that the bank mailed out a cheque of $15,000 under in my name to my mailing address,  treating it like pizza hut orBurgerking offer.   I had no idea and no wish for this to happen.  But UOB did not care.  Because my sister upon receiving it on my behalf, thought that i had response to her request of loan, and instruct the bank to send the cheque, so she bank it into my account, which i gave her atm csrd with over 1k, before i left Singspore, to cover my bills, and errands.   </p>
              <p>My sister paid me back, gradually, but my money came to her at wrong timing and amount, all because UOB decided to mail out the SURPRISE CHEQUE without my knowledge.  Because it was bank into my account, UOB consider they have done no wrong. MAS was ignoring me also.  And oh i continued to be mis organized.   As i was tok busy crying, my plans to move and study and driving, broke into pieces.   I should have bottle up my tall pail of tears and given to them to drink this SG50 celebration.  oh wellll, gd or bad, life goes on</p>

              <p>I support your view on UOB.    it happen they do things without consulting customers.</p>
              <p>have you gone to see the manager at uob personally? IF they do not care , tell them you will bring this matter to public's attention by informing the press, post on internet   .....</p>
              <p>i have problems with UOB.     First, i closed my account with them for UOB provide lousy service.     </p>
              <p>The only service i have from UOB is credit card.   For someone who minimise using their service i do not have their internet banking account.   uob do not accept phone activating for cards.     Went to uob, politely requesting them to activate my renewed card on the spot. The malay staff said yes to help.  therafter she was bloody rude and unhelpful   ..... . typed and typed n returned me my card and asked me to activate myself.  Told  me she just created my uob internet banking account.   She kay kiang to do creation of internet banking account without me saying yes.</p>
              <p>i refuse to do as she instructed. Told her i see no point and no need to have uob internet banking account as activating of card occurs only once in a few years.  I insisted she activate my card on the spot.   Anyway, bloody sicko made me sign 2 times on my card.  </p>
              <p>bloody ..... she went thru a very big round wayang wayang to tell me she refused to help me activate my credit card on the spot.    MOREOVER, THERE WAS NO QUEUE AT THAT TIME.    <span style="line-height: 1.231;">Bloody lousy, lazy, unprofessional!</span></p>

              <p>Thanks guys, your understanding means a lot to me.  This issue will bother me for the rest of my life.  UOB destroys my personal plan to seek opportunity when I was overseas.  I trusted them to keep my money. But they decided to play their own game of marketing money and fly out a huge cheque just like a postcard.</p>
              <p>I thought banks ask permission from customer before sending a blank form.   Is tthis normal, for Singapore banks to send "loan cheques" to FD customers without request or permission.  I am also dissapointed at MAS who has no sympathy for me.  They may agree with how UOB does market money by mailing cheques.  It is shameful acts but they do not feel guilty at all.  It was my first and last FD. My money gone and my opportunities gone.  </p>

              <p>hi fireice</p>
              <p>to answer yr question, NO my sister not shameful.  It all
              happen in sequence.  She thought i had told the bank to send
              it after she had asked me so she can fix her flat she just bought.
               I was going to give hef less and later.  But UOB acted
              by AUTO BANK WISH.  </p>
              <p>You know if someone slip on a banana peel and fall.   So
              you might say "you deserve it!!  becsuse u not looking where u
              walking" and you might say the one who throw the peel is not at
              fault.  the person just provide opportunity for somene to get
              MC and relax at home. </p>
              <p>i understsnd u perfectly,.fireice.  UOB cr manager, was
              more fierce to me, unbelievably. </p>

              <p>People who are down to earth, kind and understanding will not blame and push responsibility to customers treated badly by UOB. IT IS NOT UNREASONABLE to talk about bad service, definitely not a crime to say so.   </p>
              <p>UOB IS NO ANGEL. TS is not the only one and only whom UOB gives BAD and UNPROFESSIONAL SERVICE TO.    UOB is the worst local bank providing worst service.</p>
              <p>Act 1688, have you not been given bad service of any form before? </p>
              <p>THERE IS NO NEED to defend for bad service. This is first of its kind i come across people defending for bad service in sg, no wonder sg is sinking.</p>
