I especially like to paint trees. Especially during evening time, I like to sit down under the shade and paint different types of trees that come across my eyes. So far I have had at least a hundred sketches of them, each drawn from different perspective of view. My fascination with this caused my friends to nickname me, “Tree”<br><br>I am also quite a flirtatious person. I have dated 5 different girls during my high school days, but there is this particular girl whom I like but I never go after. She is just a normal girl, nothing about her stands out in the crowd. But somehow I notice her because of her innocence and her quiet intelligence. We got into the same class during the third year of our high school and as fate would have it, both of us became close friends.<br><br>I am rather popular at school and there were always a lot of girls chasing after me. But secretly I only have eyes for her. But I did not go after her because I felt that she would be too “ordinary” for me. I was afraid I might get tired of her halfway through the relationship and I would put her through the pain of break-ups that I have put so many girls through. I am afraid my feelings for her would not last and I consoled myself by saying that if we are destined to be together, I would not need to do anything and she would still be mine one day.<br><br>She watched me chased after girls and I made her cry countless times. Maybe it is because I am a rather insensitive guy. When I was dating my second girlfriend, she bumped into us while we were in the middle of a passionate kiss. She blushed but managed to shout, “Carry on, don’t bother about me!” and ran off as fast as she could. The next day when I saw her, her eyes were puffy and red. It was obvious she has been crying her eyes out the whole night before. I did not ask for her reason, I have to retain my reputation as a macho guy who does not care about anyone’s feeling. Instead I laughed at her the whole day and even called her names.<br><br>When I broke up with my 5th girlfriend, I decided to ask her out. After spending a whole day with her, I told her that I do have something important to tell her. She said, “I do have something to tell you as well, but you can go first.” I told her about breaking up with my girlfriend. She told me that she has finally decided to get together with another guy, who has been pursuing her for two years now.<br><br>I couldn’t tell her how much my heart ached at that time. I could only put on a mask, smiled and congratulated her. When I reached my home again, the pain in my heart grew so strong until I could not stand it anymore. I wanted to shout but I felt as if there was a stone stuck in my throat. Tears rolled down my cheeks and I broke down. I cried and cried that night. The same way she must have cried over me, over all the things I have done to her, all of them which I have always regretted until now.<br><br>After graduation, she sent me a SMS. I have been reading it ever since I got it. The departure of leaf…is it because of the relentless pursuit of wind..or is it because that the tree never asks her to stay?<br><br>Leaf<br><br>During high school time, I used to like to collect leaves. I used to pick them up and keep them pressed between the pages of my books. Maybe because I felt that, in a way, I have a lot to learn from it. I felt that it must have taken a lot of courage for a leaf to leave the tree she has been relying on for such a long time. Because of this “strange” hobby of mine, most of my friends called me “Leaf”.<br><br>I will always remember the third year of my high school. It is during that time that I met a guy who would have a large impact in my life, someone whom I would always remember no matter where I go. I found out that we shared a lot of interests and maybe this was what that brought us closer together. Until one day, I realized that I have fallen in love with him.<br><br>I was with him when he was still with his first girlfriend. Because he considered me to be his close “buddy”, he would often tell me stories about her. That was the first time I have ever felt so jealous towards another girl. This feeling is something I could not describe, it was a sour and bitter feeling, and it made me felt terrible most of the time. He was only together with her for a short while though. When he told me that he has broken up with her, I was really happy but I had to hide my happiness and spend the whole night consoling him instead.<br><br>However he did not go dateless for long. Soon, he was going out with another girl, who would later become his second girlfriend. I bumped into them once, when they were holding each other close and kissing. I was immensely hurt at that time and all I could do was run off so that he would not see the hot tears that had begun to gather in my eyes. I began to suspect he never loved me at all. It is just another case of unrequited love. But yet he treated me so well sometimes that my heart would melt and I would fall for him all over again. I can say that I am his closest confidante, I know of his habits and his interests but one thing I could never figure out about him is his feelings. I contemplating asking him how he felt towards me but I was afraid of rejection and what effect it would have towards our friendship.<br><br>No matter how much he hurt me, I still stayed by his side. I cared for him a lot, hoping one day he would realize that and come to love me just as much as I loved him. It is like waiting for his phone calls every night, waiting him for him to send me SMS. I know that no matter how busy he is, he would always make time for me. Sometimes I wondered if I should continue to wait. I endured a lot of pain during those years. I wanted to leave him but my stubborn heart wanted to hold on to him. This dilemma continued to accompany me for the rest of my high school years.<br><br>Until my second last year in high school, another guy began to pursue me. At first, I rejected him because I still could not give up on him. But finally, the other guy’s persistence won me over. I decided that I would give him a chance and a small place in my heart….<br><br>He's like a warm &amp; gentle wind, trying to blow a leaf away from the tree. In the end, I realized that I didn't want to give this wind just a small footing in my heart. I know this wind will bring this badly battered leaf to a far away &amp; better land. Finally I left tree, but the tree only smile &amp; didn't ask me to stay. So is leaf departure because of wind pursuit? Or is it because Tree never asked her to stay?<br><br>Wind<br><br>I like a girl called Leaf. Because she's so dependent on Tree, I have to be a<br>gust of Wind, a wind that will blow her away. When I first met her, it was one<br>month after I transferred to the new school. I saw a petite girl looking at my<br>seniors and I playing soccer. During CCA time, she would always be sitting there<br>looking at him, be it alone or with her friends. When he talked with other<br>girls, there's jealousy in her eyes. When he looked at her, there's happiness in<br>her eyes. Looking at her became my habit, the way she liked to look at him.<br><br>One day, she wasn't there. I felt something was amiss. I can't explain the<br>feeling except that it's a sense of uneasiness. The senior was also not there. I<br>went to their classroom, hid outside and saw my senior scold her. Tears were in<br>her eyes when he left. The next day, I saw her at her usual place looking at<br>him. I walked over and smiled at her, took out a note and gave it to her. She<br>was surprised. She looked at me, smiled and accepted the note. The next day, she<br>passed me a note and left.<br><br>Leaf's heart is too heavy and Wind couldn't blow her away.<br><br>It's not that Leaf's heart is too heavy. It is because Leaf never wanted to<br>leave Tree.<br><br>I replied her note with this statement and slowly she started to talk to me and<br>accepted my presents and phone calls. I know that the person she loved wasn't<br>me. But I had the perseverance that one day, I could make her like me. Within 4<br>months, I had declared my love for her no less than 20 times. Every time, she<br>would divert away from the topic. But I never gave up. If I decided I wanted her<br>to be mine, I would definitely use all means to win her over. I can't remember<br>how many times I had declared my love for her. Although I knew she would try to<br>divert, I still had a small glimmer of hope, hoping that she would agree to be<br>my girlfriend.<br><br>I didn't hear any reply from her over the phone, so I asked "What are you doing?<br>Why didn't you reply?" She said, "I'm nodding my head." "Ah?" I couldn't believe<br>my ears. "I'm nodding my head," she replied loudly. I hanged up the phone,<br>changed quickly, took a taxi, rushed to her place and pressed her door bell.<br>When she opened the door. I hugged her tightly. Leaf's departure is because of<br>Wind's pursuit. Or because Tree didn't ask her to stay.<br><br>Can listen to it too  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br><a href="https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/wlee4/www/songs/03%20-%20Story%201%20-%20Tree.mp3" rel="nofollow">Tree Story</a><br><br><a href="https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/wlee4/www/songs/Song%201.mp3" rel="nofollow">Tree Story part 2</a><br><br><a href="https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/wlee4/www/songs/05%20-%20Story%202%20-%20Leaf.mp3" rel="nofollow">Leaf Story Part 1</a><br><br><a href="https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/wlee4/www/songs/Song%202.mp3" rel="nofollow">Leaf Story Part 2</a><br><br>This story is somewhat special to me...it has a special meaning to me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the problem with most nice guys is that they are simply too nice to the point where you become a doormat for the girl you are pursuing.<br><br>Think about it. If you are constantly at her beck and call every single day of the week, how the hell is she gonna appreciate your presence when she knows that she can simply give you a call and ask for help, reassurance, et cetera?<br><br>Don't think that persistingly wooing someone for a year or three will help things. In fact, you are probably on the losing end of what you can do with your life. Think of the number of things you could have done in the past three years! Throw in an extra year and you could have gotten a degree!<br><br>It is much better to focus on your own interests and let love happen. If she is genuine, she will appreciate you for your interests and support you. You, of course, should do the same for her.<br><br>And yes, I'm a guy.</div>
