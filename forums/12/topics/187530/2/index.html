But life has to go on.<br>Goodbye doesn't always mean forever.<br>There will always be a place and time<br>where questions will be answered,<br>words will be spoken,<br>letters will be read,<br>poems will be recited in the night,<br>songs will be sung in harmony,<br>love will be expressed in solitude and<br>promises will be fulfilled.<br>Somewhere. Somehow. Someday.<br><br><strong>Hope for the Broken Heart.....</strong><br><br>It hurts to love someone and not be loved in return, but what is more painful is to love someone and never find the courage to let that person know how you feel.  Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful for that gift.<br>Love is when you take away the feeling, the passion, and the romance in a relationship and find out you still care for that person. A sad thing in life is when you meet someone who means a lot to you, only to find out in the end that it was never meant to be and you just have to let go.<br>The best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had. It's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives.<br>Giving someone all you're love is never an assurance that they will love you back!<br>Don't expect love in return; just wait for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn't, be content it grew in yours. There are things you'd love to hear that you would never hear from the person whom you would like to hear it from, but don't be so deaf as to not hear it from the one who says it from his heart.<br><br>Never say goodbye if you still want to try-<br>Never give up if you still feel like you can go on-<br>Never say you don't love a person anymore if you can't let go.<br><br>- To those who still hope, although they have been disappointed<br>- To those who still believe although they have been betrayed<br>- To those who still need to love although they have been hurt before<br>- And to those who have courage and faith to build trust again.<br><br>It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone-but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.<br>Don't go for looks; they can deceive.<br>Don't go for wealth, even that fades away.<br>Go for someone who makes you smile-- it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright.<br>There are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real. Hope you dream of that special person.<br>Dream what you want to dream; go where you want to go; be what you want to be because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do.<br>Always put yourself in others' shoes. If you feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the person.<br>A careless word may kindle strife; a cruel word may wreck a life; a timely word may level stress; a loving word may heal and bless.<br>The happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes their way. Happiness lies for those who cry, those who hurt, those who have searched, and those who have tried, for only they can appreciate the importance of people who have touched their lives.<br>Love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss, and ends with a tear.  The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past, you can't go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches.<br>When you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was smiling.<br>Live your life so that when you die, you're the only one who is smiling, and everyone around you is crying. Know that someone out there always loves you and cares for you, even in the worst times. Don't ever give up, even when you think you have nothing left to keep going.<br><br>Keep falling in Love...........<br><br></div>
