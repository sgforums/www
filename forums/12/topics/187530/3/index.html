If a girl tells you she's not worth it, she's probably rejecting you. No way a girl is interested in you would say such a thing. Unless... she's Elecktra, has to fight crime at night, and dont want her enemies to hurt you. But do you think that is possible? So no, she's rejecting you. Just be a gentleman, back off first. Sometimes ppl will only realise what they like when they lost it. Let her feel that lost. That is if she feels that way. But if she's actually relieved you stop bothering her, then you are definitely better off putting your attention on someone else. If she's really into you, then she will try all ways to contact you again... then this time the ball is in your court. If you want to win her heart, it's how u play that stroke.<br><br>But the best way is be a soccer star, drive a Ferrari F430 to fetch her out for dinner. Proven to work everytime.</div>

Not with this thought at the back of your mind: I am doing all this for her, so one day she must return my feelings, only then it will be fair.<br><br>Because once you have this thought, you will feel like it is unfair when she rejected you for someone else. You will feel that it is unfair why is it that you have done so much more for her yet she has never given you a place in her heart, and yet someone can just suddenly walk into her life and become her boyfriend the next day.<br><br>Love is something that cannot be forced. It is either there or not. Same goes for chemistry between two persons...if you choose to pursue a girl, do it sincerely and remember, it is your own willingness to wait for her. She didn't ask you to do that. So you cannot blame her when she does not choose you in the end.<br><br>So once rejected, stop thinking it is unfair and move on graciously while wishing her happiness...It is a big world out there after all, so you will meet someone who is for you one day <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div></blockquote>How come so many people try for 3 years and then give up and move on? hmmz...<br>My personal experience is pursuing this gal I really liked for 3 years (20 yo - 23 yo)<br>Same issue as you guys. Gal gives mixed reactions ("I like you too, but...")<br>Gena bashed emotionally left right centre for those 3 years, like rollercoaster<br>All this time, I also had this problem of thinking, I do so much, why I don't get reciprocated.<br><br>After giving up, I expanded my friendship circle, had loads of fun, went casual dating a few times, totally gave up on love until I met my wife.<br>That time, I din expect anything (coz I gave up on love u see), so I treated her as a friend, do what I can for her as a friend<br>one day, she said she does not want to get married, rather be a nun. Without thinking it thru, I told her I will build a hut beside her and become a monk. Then she said I am so funny. Like that then we might as well get married.<br>A few weeks later, without knowing what happened, we were holding hands.<br>A few months later, she became my fiancee<br>A year later, she and I ROM-ed.<br><br>End of the day, I really think there is no right or wrong in a relationship. A gal can accept things from you and still have the right to tell u to get lost (after all you were willing to give, she willing to receive, who to blame?). The pain comes when we guys start to think is it worth it doing all these. My opinion is, the moment you start having these thoughts, then the friendship is coming to an end.<br><br>So how to cope with the pain after breaking away?<br><br>I guess the best way to cope with the pain is to have more friends. Have more friends, socialize more, Go nuts with friends etc. Go on a backpacking trip with friends. Go somewhere alone to have fun on your own. etc. Life is short, no point wasting 3 years feeling painful. Enjoy life to the fullest!<br>At the same time, just continue to be nice. You might never know what will happen, just as how me and my wife got together.</div>
