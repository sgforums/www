            <div class='col-md body'>reminds me of my schooldays of my once-very close group of friends. (4 gals &amp; 4 guys in total) 2 guys fell for one of the gal &amp; both being too shy to 'chase' after her, they use these brother-sister addressing excuse so to get closer to the girl. these 2 guys was specially concerned more for this gal in every of our outings trying to get her attention &amp; such... well,the gal just treat them as brothers only cos she does not want any BGR to affect her studies.<br>oh well.......<br><br>[This message has been edited by yc (edited 09 October 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My brother and I live together after our respective divorces.  It is a situation that works out well for the both of us.  We help each other with our childcare needs, our housing needs, our financial needs, and yes, even sometimes our SEXUAL NEEDS.<br><br>We know there to be MANY others in similar situations (read some of the hundreds of letters at our homepage).  We have even started a service aimed at getting family members together.
