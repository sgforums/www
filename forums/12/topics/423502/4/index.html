              <p><br>Nowadays people pay assasin to kill loan shark. So instead of paying money to loan shark should hire assasin. Nah, I am joking, dun take me seriously.</p>
              <p>Only way is to send yer bro to foreign country, then only he experience change n independence. Send him to Indon lah. There got fewer gambling problem. To some muslim village where people r pious n dun gamble wan.</p>

              <p>Gambling was NEVER the problem, it is the people who cannot control themselves that is the problem.</p>
              <p>I do gamble, about $1-2 per toto draw and it's not affecting my lifestyle because I know how to control myself. I don't bet big (or even exceed $3 per draw) when group 1 is big because I know the odds are still the same. Occasionally, I do win some small amounts (and once grp 3) and reward myself with small treats and it's fun gambling.</p>
