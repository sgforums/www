You see ah, they send 3 patrol cars to catch people like my friends and I playing soccer at basketball court, but they cannot catch the loansharks, very funny right? 3 patrol cars to catch teens playing soccer on basketball court, shows they have enough people, so definitely manpower is not the issue, the main issue is whether they want to do work or just slack only...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this loanshark topic has been on the radio recently, people called in say they give police all the leads such as telephone numbers etc, but police never follow up or track down the leads and never revert to the family involved... the other thing is if they really sincered in catching the crooks, instead of sending 3 patrol cars to catch people playing soccer at basketball court, they could just send 1 patrol car with police in civilian clothes and guard random families so the moment those loansharks come, just arrest them... funny, come to think of it really funny, 3 patrol cars catch teens playing soccer at basketball court but no people catch loansharks, those loansharks run faster izzit, cannot chase them?</div>

              <p>When family is involved, it's hard not to get sucked in.</p>

              <p>One solution:</p>
              <p>Yer father go post advert in newspaper - Say he disown his son. Name: So and So.</p>
              <p>Oso say, whatever the son owe, the father does not wish to pay his debts bcause he is no longer related n no longer live ere.</p>
              <p>Then take the newspaper advert and paste it on yer front door for all the loan shark to see.</p>

              <p>To TS,</p>
              <p>Number 1, you need professional aid to help your brother deal with gambling problem.</p>
              <p>Number 2, you need professional aid to deal with the loansharks which you had done. Your brother must surrender to the police and provide details how he contacted these loansharks so that the appropriate actions can be taken by the authorities.</p>
              <p>As for the rest of the comments on disowning, killing your brother, yadda yadda, these are keyboard martyrs who are most effective only in office typing e-mails of hate, chain e-mails and talk cock. They themselves offer nothing in return to your problem. Nor are they empowered to aid your plight whatsoever.</p>

              <p>Haiz, move house oso no use. The loanshark got way of finding u. Singapore so small, u think u can hide meh?</p>
              <p>One way is the only way.</p>
              <p><strong>Settle</strong> all outstanding loan. Then <strong>disown</strong> the son. Tell all loanshark, tat if the bastard son go n borrow any more money in <strong>future</strong>, father won't help. Simple wat, I am sure all the loanshark come banging at yer door already left all their phone numbers n biz cards.</p>
              <p>Not say simple la. But u gotta do wat u gotta do. No choice. The bro is not going to give up his gambling addiction. If u dun cut him off now, he will drag yer whole family down.</p>
