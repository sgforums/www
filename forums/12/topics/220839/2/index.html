Do it reasonably and within your bugdet.<br><br>If these cant work. Too bad. Your have to give in to her ALWAYS.

As she was my first ever gf, the breakup was very painful for me. but after patching up, i kinda just enjoy the relationship half heartedly. no doubt i love her but i just cant bring myself to be as loving as i was the first time round.<br><br>my gf herself always like to make problems. it's like she is so insecured. she always likes to check on my emails and frenster accounts. everytime some gals whom i dunno adds me, she starts her nonsense and will throw all kinda questions at me. but i do not ask her anythin when guys msg her thru this stupid program called frenster! i haf even stopped chatting on msn whenever she is around as she dislieks me chatting with gals. i mean, come on, wats wrong with chatting with ppl online? i haf frenz who are guys and gals.. and besides, i made frenz with these gals when we were not together. and we are purely chatting and catchin things up. we didn't meet or love each other. is it wrong t obe friends with others when you are attached?<br><br>what irritates me even more is that she always wants to break up. she likes to threaten and say this word. after enduring this type of "break-up" attitude, i finally said enough is enough and left early this year. but 3 months later, i realised that i can't be without her. it's as if i had gotten used to her presence and doings.<br><br>after patching up, i did talk to her about her actions and she said she was sorry about it etc. things went well until recently, she starts her nonsense again. i know that the feelings have died down between us and both of us are trying. but all these quarrels are not doing us any good. and i cant just leave her and break up cause she herself is going through many problems. she has left her house due to arguments with her parents. i feel my gf has a attitude problem. she is very affected by what happens around her.<br><br>for example, if another person is having an affair, she will assume i am or will have one in the future. because of all these thoughts, we haf argues countless times and it is due to thoughts like these(of a different kind) that she left her house and is putting up with me now.<br><br>everyday i come back home after work and play my games or do my stuff and yet she suspects me. i am so tired and sad but then i cant bring myself to leave her.<br><br>i know i am not that good a person too.i am insensitive and she always calls me a MCP(of coz i dun think i am a MCP) i dunno how to love her and neither do i know how to make her feel loved in front of others. but yet she is still with me despite she telling me many times that all she wants is to be loved. i am trying but i cant love her like other guys will love their gf. i am just like that. my love is shown differently and she is trying to accept that i think.<br><br>i am so disappointed that after so long we are still having problems. i am so sure that if we go our own ways, we both can find better partners than each other but i just want her and i hope there is a solution to this. i cant expect a marriage life with suspicions.<br><br>pls give ur views..thanks.. </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The sense of insecurity is usually imaginary - people reckon that something negative will happen even though you showed no blatant signs of drifting.
