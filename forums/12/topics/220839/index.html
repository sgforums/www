I can tell you are a good-looking guy. If not, how is it that your gf so suspicious most of the time involving friendster and other things, that has nothing to do with you? One thing about her- she has very low self-esteem. You know how I advise people in other threads? When the girl has very low self-esteem, I tell them to avoid her like the plague if you want to go in for the long-term. This is what you get if you continue to stay with her in the long-run. That is the solution. Stay away from her.<br><br>I have a feeling you are very popular with the opposite sex, something she is not very succesful in and comfortable with. Am I wrong?<br><br>Let me tell you something: Once the two of you broke up before, there is no way of going back because you are still going to remember all her stupid actions. That's going to turn you off so much. Can you imagine her being your wife, constantly breathing down your neck where the heck you are? You have to find someone better--Im sure you can. Because at the end of the day, you might still want to break up with her because you still cannot tolerate her nonsense. A leopard seldom/never changes her spots. Therefore, avoiding her is the best solution. There are some people you must avoid to retain your sanity.<br><br>Another mistake you made was getting a gf when you didn't love her. Why waste her time and yours? She is going to call you a jerk for this.<br><br>You know why you can't be as loving as before? Because she did not make you feel like a MAN! You are sick and tired of her as explained in your nick. All she ever did was giving you nonsense. You are lucky you are not married. A woman is supposed to make you feel like a man. But she did not fulfil that role. Long-term material? Nah. She is out in my book.<br><br>You know when she threaten to break up with you, you should have said ''okay''. But, you were WEAK and cannot let her go. That's ok because you were human like another guy called mitilagant and tankh80 in other threads. You belong to this group of people after a long-term breakup with their first gf.<br>You have to let it go and find a girl who is not possessive. Really, consider ten times if you want someone like that for a wife. You cannot deny yourself the chance of getting a good one as well as other girls who deserve you.<br><br>You don't tell the girl to behave herself and expect her to change. They are hard-wired that way since 3-4 years old. You cannot change a person. Only they can change themselves.<br><br>You mentioned the feelings between the two of you have died. Assuming that is true, why do you still continue this relationship? Isn't that digging your own grave? Why do you want to stay with someone whom you have no feelings for? No point.<br><br>The reason you can't be loving as other guys is because she did not make you feel loved and/or you don't love her as much because feelings for her dropped a great deal. Understand?<br><br>Actually, you have already answered your own questions. You cannot afford a marriage with suspicions. So my advice: you dump her. There are really better girls. Find a better one not like her. She is trouble all the way. If you don't, just forget all that I have typed and suffer in silence. Unless she changes herself, it's not going to work out for this relationship.<br><br>doko</div>

One thing about her- she has very low self-esteem. You know how I advise people in other threads? When the girl has very low self-esteem, I tell them to avoid her like the plague if you want to go in for the long-term. This is what you get if you continue to stay with her in the long-run. That is the solution. Stay away from her.<br><br>I have a feeling you are very popular with the opposite sex, something she is not very succesful in and comfortable with. Am I wrong?<br><br>Let me tell you something: Once the two of you broke up before, there is no way of going back because you are still going to remember all her stupid actions. That's going to turn you off so much. Can you imagine her being your wife, constantly breathing down your neck where the heck you are? You have to find someone better--Im sure you can. Because at the end of the day, you might still want to break up with her because you still cannot tolerate her nonsense. A leopard seldom/never changes her spots. Therefore, avoiding her is the best solution. There are some people you must avoid to retain your sanity.<br><br>Another mistake you made was getting a gf when you didn't love her. Why waste her time and yours? She is going to call you a jerk for this.<br><br>You know why you can't be as loving as before? Because she did not make you feel like a MAN! You are sick and tired of her as explained in your nick. All she ever did was giving you nonsense. You are lucky you are not married. A woman is supposed to make you feel like a man. But she did not fulfil that role. Long-term material? Nah. She is out in my book.<br><br>You know when she threaten to break up with you, you should have said ''okay''. But, you were WEAK and cannot let her go. That's ok because you were human like another guy called mitilagant and tankh80 in other threads. You belong to this group of people after a long-term breakup with their first gf.<br>You have to let it go and find a girl who is not possessive. Really, consider ten times if you want someone like that for a wife. You cannot deny yourself the chance of getting a good one as well as other girls who deserve you.<br><br>You don't tell the girl to behave herself and expect her to change. They are hard-wired that way since 3-4 years old. You cannot change a person. Only they can change themselves.<br><br>You mentioned the feelings between the two of you have died. Assuming that is true, why do you still continue this relationship? Isn't that digging your own grave? Why do you want to stay with someone whom you have no feelings for? No point.<br><br>The reason you can't be loving as other guys is because she did not make you feel loved and/or you don't love her as much because feelings for her dropped a great deal. Understand?<br><br>Actually, you have already answered your own questions. You cannot afford a marriage with suspicions. So my advice: you dump her. There are really better girls. Find a better one not like her. She is trouble all the way. If you don't, just forget all that I have typed and suffer in silence. Unless she changes herself, it's not going to work out for this relationship.<br><br>doko</div></blockquote>+1</div>

You must ask yourself what is it that you like about her and what is it you don't like. Some things you can live with then okay. Are there more good things about her than bad things?<br><br>But spending 4 years in the relationship and you are still pissed off is more than enough time to know whether you must get rid of her. Some people can still live with such wives and it depends on them. But imagine her trying to control you most of the time, you will feel strangled.<br><br>Don't marry her just because she says so or because you love her so much.<br><br>Being controlled by your own attraction towards her is going to spell disaster.<br><br>When it comes to marriage, you have to think with your head and not with your feelings. Don't try to rationalise her behaviour just because you love her.<br><br>doko</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe your should seperate for a while and think over your relationship whether you are meant to be together or not. Afterall, seperation makes the heart fonder. If she is really meant to be yours, she will be yours eventually.<br><br>If you think you cant be away from her even for that short period of time. Maybe you can make her feel love by springing surprises on her? Like out of sudden buy her bouquet of flowers( NEVER buy during valentine to please ur gf, they cause a bomb). Or get an extremely huge teddy bear, as big as possible. not the ones that are 50cm, around 1m i mean. Girls love surpsises.(think so) But dont spend too much till your broke. Do it reasonably and within your bugdet.<br><br>If these cant work. Too bad. Your have to give in to her ALWAYS. Its all about giving and taking.</div>
