              <p>I've been praised as hardworking from my colleagues but that's not enough...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When I first stepped into the place, I suddenly felt nervous to the point of fainting. It was embarrassing and to add salt to wound, I kept talking gibberish while serving the customers. My superior noticed this and immediately told me if I don't buck up, I have to go.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I did &amp; tried to surpress my anxiety a lot. It worked okay and I tried my best to contribute to my job even if I wasn't taking care of a particular station.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Recently, my superior scolded a colleague and me for looking so lost. He mentioned that if I ever continue looking this way, both of us would have to leave.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I understand that since this is a front-line job, there is a need to be freakishly cheerful at all times. But I can't help but felt humilated to know that physical hard work doesn't really pay off, but only image does.  It's my first time I ever indulge in my job and it's pretty flexible as it gives me time to concentrate on my studies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't possess many skills and I am not that great at manipulating MS softwares. I was told I was slow, nervous and not many have faith in me for holding a job.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am always living on the brink as my pay is only enough for me to feed myself. I don't really spurge on luxuries unless something broke down (like my CD player) But I had to scrimp to be able to afford one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't really have a goal in life. I don't know what I want to do. I can't even get past the people acceptance part, how am I suppose to even think far? Am I going to struggle for the rest of my life scrapping through a job and always be sitting on the potential frying pan?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am in my early 20s, and I've ever been in isolation for 3 years. So I have practically wasted much of my youth.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I thought I am able to get through this...but it seems..my fate has been sealed?</p>

              <p>Unless you have a natural nack for it, frontline personnel need training. Were you given the training? It is not your fault, if you can't perform up to expectation, in a job you were not trained for. Your superiors are examples of poor managers.</p>
              <p>You are in the job for the pay, right? For the time being only, right? Just do your best and ignore those lousy managers comments. They are under stress too, and also untrained for the job, remember that. Ignore their criticisms, do your best, know that you are doing your honest best for the pay. You can be proud of that.</p>
              <p>When the time comes for you to leave, and move on, thank them for the opportunity to work and experience gained. Do not take problems at work personally. It is not, but work related, and when you leave, they are ordinary people who are your acquaintence.</p>
              <p>Your opinion of yourself is one sided. You actually have a balance of good attributes and not so good attributes. But from your post, I see that are heavy on your pootr attributes. Those things that you mentioned about yourself are very minor issues, but you highlight them prominently and repeatedly. Therefore it is no wonder that you feel that you are worthless. People critize you, you critize yourself, so how do you think you will feel? You can't control other peoples' mouth, but you can control your thinking.</p>
              <p>Hey! you are hardworking and honest. You are studying, you got a job thats flexible and allows you to study. Study means you have something going for you in future, concentrate on that, positively. You got a home, parents, etc, when are you going to dwell on these minor good points, - when you lose them, and then post here you hard luck story?</p>
              <p>Two sides of a coin, heads or tails, which side do you want to choose to influence your life?. Are you the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000000;">jam</span></span> ON the bread, or <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the bread</span> IN the jam.</p>

              <p>Go join public speaking or something that will encourage you to talk more. Being in isolation does not help you, it can only save you for a short while but in the long run, we need friends.. we need social activities... get your butt out there and make new friends... join new activities.. get a life :)</p>
