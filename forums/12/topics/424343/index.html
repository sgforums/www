              <p>Unless, you work from home, there is no way to stay at home forever and ever. </p>
              <p>There are cases of individuals such as hikkimoris staying at home the whole day and relying on their investments or online shops, but you will need to have a good portfolio planning and such and some funding in the first case, and some ideas on the latest trends as well as where to get your goods in the second case. </p>
              <p>Maybe you will like to consider further studies, and try getting a better paid job. At the same time, you can look around you and see if there is any individual who you find interesting and will like to consider.</p>

              <p>So as long as you are not doing anything illegal like murder, robbing a bank and kidnapping. So wat is wrong wif a low paying job? At least u r doing an honest day work.</p>
              <p><em>I feel tired of life actually and I really want to hide away from the world forever but how should I go about it ... well, I need the funds</em></p>
              <p>Everybody feels the same way. U think everybody here dun hv stress n problems? U nd to confront yer problems gurl. Wat make u think tat if u go elsewhere, tis problem wont cum back to haunt u?</p>
              <p><em>But I don't know how to work a job...and i'm also halting my (almost useless) education for a while.</em></p>
              <p>If u feel yer studies not helping n u not interested - then drop it. There is always other opportunity n study subject for u to choose.</p>
              <p><em>I just want to stay home forever and ever. (24 this year, Girl/Virgin, Forget about relationships or friends...people are shallow but whatever, I am destined to be forever alone)</em></p>
              <p>Wake up n stop whinning. Everytime u whine, u push back yer life another 2 years. 24 still young. Virgin - gud lah, u want to get pregnant at 16 ah??? People or u r shallow???? If u think negative, everything will be negative. If u think optimistic - positive, things will be much better. Nobody say life is easy.</p>
              <p>Dun take the easy way out, like the crazy littlemissbonkers - choose to live in IMH - surf the forum to look for handsome guys like me to flame (blame Sg guys for the littlemissbonker misfortunes) and hv the boyfren Chocochips sing luv song n pity for the littlemissbonker outside the cell every day.</p>

              <p>Anyways, I was told to go again (sigh) so i'm now holding
              another job that pays less than 1K (permanent) but it's an unstable
              job with basic duties and such a job is not really realistic for
              long-term.</p>
              <p>I feel tired of life actually and I really want to hide away
              from the world forever but how should I go about it ... well, I
              need the funds.</p>
              <p>But I don't know how to work a job...and i'm also halting my
              (almost useless) education for a while.</p>
              <p>I just want to stay home forever and ever. (24 this year,

              ppl obviously dun understand girls.
              when girls whine, they are just seeking for listeners/attentions, not advice.
              
              so, to make a girl happy when they are whining, nod your head and ask some question, then let them know that you are a good listening ear. that will do.
              
              *nod* *nod*
              
              TS probably have lower than normal self esteem, coupled with the fact that she does not like to interact with ppl.
              and for that to happen, my guess would be she does not stand out amoung the crowd, glamorously.
              the fact that she indicate herself as virgin (which does not really ties to any of her whining), can means:
              1) she is desperate
              2) she uses this point to show her lack of relationship exp. probably her frds around her are non V.
              2) she finds this is her few only plus points?
              
              anyway, wad she needs is to find ways to bring up her self esteem and everything will works.
              
              setting a small target, instead of a big one helps.
              i don't believe in targetting for the moon, when u are on earth only.
              smaller than small target will helps a long way too.
              
              small target can range from, i wan to smile 10 times to 10 different ppl today... to.. i wan to smile and start a conversation with the guy/girl i always want to today...
