              <p>ppl obviously dun understand girls.<br> when girls whine, they are just seeking for listeners/attentions,
              not advice.</p>
              <p>so, to make a girl happy when they are whining, nod your head
              and ask some question, then let them know that you are a good
              listening ear. that will do.</p>
              <p><strong>nod</strong> <strong>nod</strong></p>
              <p>TS probably have lower than normal self esteem, coupled with the
              fact that she does not like to interact with ppl.<br> and for that to happen, my guess would be she does not stand out
              amoung the crowd, glamorously.<br> the fact that she indicate herself as virgin (which does not really
              ties to any of her whining), can means:<br> 1) she is desperate<br> 2) she uses this point to show her lack of relationship exp.
              probably her frds around her are non V.<br> 2) she finds this is her few only plus points?</p>
              <p>anyway, wad she needs is to find ways to bring up her self
              esteem and everything will works.</p>
              <p>setting a small target, instead of a big one helps.<br> i don’t believe in targetting for the moon, when u are on earth
              only.<br> smaller than small target will helps a long way too.</p>
              <p>small target can range from, i wan to smile 10 times to 10
              different ppl today… to.. i wan to smile and start a conversation
              with the guy/girl i always want to today…</p>

              <p>Haix...This is not about girl or boy. The reason why I put my gender is previously, people mistaken me for a guy, that's all. As for the virginity, it is to further illustrate that I am not living what the society expects a female to lose her virginity at an early stage (perhaps mine is like a "taboo") But you are right that perhaps I have lower than normal self-esteem.</p>
              <p>Everytime I talk, I feel drained and tired. I don't know why. I don't really enjoy interaction much.</p>
              <p>Anyways, I want to end this topic la because I am currently doing so-so.</p>

              <p><br>I will like to intro her to the way of thinking, most of these people lack of thinking skills and end up with either with only one way thinking or simply think wildly without any basis and framework to follow. And bear in mind I do collect fees for advices on thinking skills but for the sake of my siao bun bun here and many other goondo forumers, like me give you a few tips on thinking skill before you embark on anything.</p>
              <p>1st, before you do anything, for example, finding a job, please collect infomation first and put it into your brain, collect as much information as possible, like what skill is needed, what is the company situation, how is the culture etc etc, collect information only, do not analyse it yet, because if you analyse while collect thing, you will end up debating on one information and forget other important information.</p>
              <p>2nd, sit down, spread out the information you collected, place them at specific category, like benefit in one rows, people mentality and culture in another, and so on, study it and feel it, does it suit you, or do you have other alternatives or interviews which you can go and collect more infomation to compare, set your priorty, but dun go into conclusion yet</p>
              <p>3rd, after collect all the information from all the interview you attended, spread it out again on specific category, then compare and see which is better than the other, from transportation to pay to working hrs and even career advancement. Then take the one that seem benefit you the most</p>
              <p>4th, be cool, let the mind think, before going to accept it, check back, what have you miss out, any flaws in it, then finally, challenge yourself, ask yourself question, if I take this job, what will happen, can i get upgraded, is it really what i am looking for, after 5 years of working, can I advance from this job, and so on. People tends to forget to challenge themselves before embarking on job or other matters, that is why, most end up regretted, demoralised and sad.</p>
              <p>5th, once you have make up your mind, be firm and tell yourself never to regret on what decision you make, cos you have gone thru and think of it in a structured way, then, end up with your gut feeling, a kind of six sense thinking that focus on whether you will make it in this job or not, this is very important, dun blind blind go knock on the wall end up get nothing because you lack the six sense to feel it.</p>
              <p>6th, once everything is decided, be happy, smile and thinking clearly.</p>
              <p>This type of thinking apply to all thing, from getting a job, a bf, a game console, a TV, etc etc.</p>

              <p><br>I will like to intro her to the way of thinking, most of these people lack of thinking skills and end up with either with only one way thinking or simply think wildly without any basis and framework to follow. And bear in mind I do collect fees for advices on thinking skills but for the sake of my siao bun bun here and many other goondo forumers, like me give you a few tips on thinking skill before you embark on anything.</p>
              <p>1st, before you do anything, for example, finding a job, please collect infomation first and put it into your brain, collect as much information as possible, like what skill is needed, what is the company situation, how is the culture etc etc, collect information only, do not analyse it yet, because if you analyse while collect thing, you will end up debating on one information and forget other important information.</p>
              <p>2nd, sit down, spread out the information you collected, place them at specific category, like benefit in one rows, people mentality and culture in another, and so on, study it and feel it, does it suit you, or do you have other alternatives or interviews which you can go and collect more infomation to compare, set your priorty, but dun go into conclusion yet</p>
              <p>3rd, after collect all the information from all the interview you attended, spread it out again on specific category, then compare and see which is better than the other, from transportation to pay to working hrs and even career advancement. Then take the one that seem benefit you the most</p>
              <p>4th, be cool, let the mind think, before going to accept it, check back, what have you miss out, any flaws in it, then finally, challenge yourself, ask yourself question, if I take this job, what will happen, can i get upgraded, is it really what i am looking for, after 5 years of working, can I advance from this job, and so on. People tends to forget to challenge themselves before embarking on job or other matters, that is why, most end up regretted, demoralised and sad.</p>
              <p>5th, once you have make up your mind, be firm and tell yourself never to regret on what decision you make, cos you have gone thru and think of it in a structured way, then, end up with your gut feeling, a kind of six sense thinking that focus on whether you will make it in this job or not, this is very important, dun blind blind go knock on the wall end up get nothing because you lack the six sense to feel it.</p>
              <p>6th, once everything is decided, be happy, smile and thinking clearly.</p>
              <p>This type of thinking apply to all thing, from getting a job, a bf, a game console, a TV, etc etc.</p>
