              <p>Hi</p>
              <p>Would like to seek some concrete and natural suggestions from
              anyone who can help.</p>
              <p>Here's my situation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I notice a girl from my school who is studying the same course
              as me. SOme basic info.. we don't know each, and i'm sure she has
              seen or notice me before in lecture.</p>
              <p>I kind of want to get to know her but not sure if the approach
              is okay. i think we have seen each other several times in school.
              in lecture she usually sit the same position, while i'm sitting
              somewhereee near her. How do i approach her so as it doesnt appear
              too random, or pickup or stupid?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any good suggestions? I'm kind of shy when it comes to this kind
              of pick up, and im not sure if shes receptive though. Any girls can
              offer the female psychology?</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>First thing first, find out if she is single or not. Sources which you can rely on are mainly her close friends, though you can also get some other girl to ask for you.</p>
              <p>If she is single, find out more about her first, especially her personality.</p>
              <p>Direct approaches doesn't work for all girls, and "accidental bumping" also doesn't work for all girls as well. Besides the two approaches, you can also try the romantic approach by getting some flowers/chocolates and asking her out.</p>
              <p>Well, to be honest, if you don't know the girl well, don't expect us to know her better than you do, and don't expect us to be able to give you a "best" method.</p>

              <p><br>I don't understand why you insisted that you get bumped very often because Singapore is very crowded.</p>
              <p>Are you extra large and people really have no choice but to bump into you everytime they need to walk pass you? Maybe they stored their tears and then cry at home later or they just go to the nearest toilet cubicle and cry their hearts out.</p>
              <p>I, don't have people bumping into me at your frequencies even when I'm walking in the very crowded Singapore. People generally have a sense of courtesy and they simply don't bump into you like you're not important enough for them to side-step you or don't give you respect like you're not a human being by bumping into you carelessly or on purpose.</p>
              <p>Are you trying to say that there are many people outside who actually bump into you on purpose? If you say you're very attractive and many guys want to bump into you, then I would like to believe you. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>What does it has to do with temperament? Are you actually tolerating these people who bumps into you? Isn't it supposed to be called personal grace so that you can forgive them? And why would you die of high blood pressure and heart attacks??</p>
              <p>Yes, I'm a princess and sad to disappoint you that none in my family history had heart attacks. How about your family? Do you have a family history of high blood pressure and heart attacks? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Take care and please wear a full body armour like a kettle when you go out walking in very crowded Singapore. I'm not worried about your temperament, but more on your physical injuries due to prolong bumping incidents.</p>
              <p>Take care, please take care, you must take care ... or I'll be quite bored. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>I, don't have people bumping into me at your frequencies even
              when I'm walking in the very crowded Singapore. People generally
              have a sense of courtesy and they simply don't bump into you like
              you're not important enough for them to side-step you or don't give
              you respect like you're not a human being by bumping into you
              carelessly or on purpose.</p>
              <p>Are you trying to say that there are many people outside who
              actually bump into you on purpose? If you say you're very
              attractive and many guys want to bump into you, then I would like
              to believe you. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>What does it has to do with temperament? Are you actually
              tolerating these people who bumps into you? Isn't it supposed to be
              called personal grace so that you can forgive them? And why
              would you die of high blood pressure and heart attacks??</p>
              <p>Yes, I'm a princess and sad to disappoint you that none in my
              family history had heart attacks. How about your family? Do you
              have a family history of high blood pressure and heart attacks?
              <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Take care and please wear a full body armour like a kettle when
              you go out walking in very crowded Singapore. I'm not worried about
              your temperament, but more on your physical injuries due to prolong
              bumping incidents.</p>
              <p>Take care, please take care, you must take care ... or I'll be
              quite bored. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Parn you seem to have no imagination, when you run out of ideas you start
              using personal attacks. Well with regards to your <span lang="EN-US">‘points’ I
              am not extra large, and as to whether I’m attractive…I guess you’ll never know.
              By the way, instead of being so concerned about my looks, I suggest you start
              trimming your over-grown nose hairs first. </span></p>

              you’ve have never been on a crowded train before, if not you’ll fully
              understand why people get bumped frequently. Maybe it’s because you were born
              with a silver spoon stuck up your ass, that’s why you don’t know what it’s like
              to be a typical Singaporean, who has to take the train everyday. </span></p>
