I'm close to a gal and I get to know her as she's one of my colleagues. After sometime of understanding, we began to chat and talk about anything that can come to our minds. We would spent hours talking or sms each other on each other's work and some other personal issues.<br><br>After few months, I found that I've actually fallen for her. I kept my feelings and still treat her as friends. Sometimes I can surpress my feelings and at times it can get out of control.<br><br>I've express my feelings and made it known to her. Initially she's shocked. We still talk as usual till few days ago, she began to ignore me when I visited her at her work place. I sense that there's something which she do not want to tell me. Then I found out that one of her work colleagues spread rumours about me telling everyone that I love her very much! Till now she still ignore me and it really pains me seeing her treating me like this for things I've never done! To be maligned by other ppl, I won't find it hurtful but if the gal that misunderstands you just by listening to other ppl who say about things which are untrue, it's worse.<br><br></div>
