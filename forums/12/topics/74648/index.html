Or u can make arrangements to go see her or wat. GIve in on your part b4 u ask others to give in to u.<br><br>Try to understand why she is so busy and that she has her reasons for doing so. If u are not patient enuff, i guess u can always move on. REm that u are not the only onw hoe is frustrated. Being refused a few times isnt a bad thing at all, u get to train ur patience!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

What you have been trying to do is good and logical for a proper friendship to blossom even further - don't worry; good stuff is worth a little waiting? Or maybe that little waiting will make you discover more about her, which indirectly, didn't waste any time of yours at all.<br><br>There could be more than meets than eye, but possibilities are limitless. Just go with the flow for now.<br><br>Cheers</div>
