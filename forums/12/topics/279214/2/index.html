U suppose to be the pro mah, ok let me tell you,<br><br>Dun be taken for a ride ya, sometime we gals will agree to everything just to keep the conversation sharp and get off the line, later when the dating arrive, we will give excuses here and there to evade the man/boy we dun like.<br><br>Be realistic, if gal like a boy, she will automatically agree without condition and even plan for the dating.</div>
