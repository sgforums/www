Maybe compose urself, such as  "Woke up today, and suddenly just felt like sms'ing u and wish u a Very Gd morning. May ur day today be fill with joy and happiness!" or something like that.<br><br>Next, she most probably would reply and say "thanks, u too!" or something like that. Now u must ask her how's work etc. Then suggest to her that maybe u 2 should meet up for dinner or catch a movie after work. If she say yes, then start thinking of where 2 eat. For recent movies, I suggest u suggest go catch "No Reservations". It is a rather romantic genre movie. The rest is up 2 u liao.<br><br>If not, maybe can find out what sports she likes and suggest doing it together.<br><br>Hope it helps!!<br><br></div>

If u never do, then u may never know just where this budding friendship may take u. If u really don't wanna ask her out so soon, then just chat more on sms/ MSN.<br><br>And also, u gotta forget about the past. You mention ur ex both times in ur posts. You just lack confidence. Chat with her more and then u would be able 2 know more about her, then maybe u can start asking her out</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>how i got to know her?<br><br>i cant really say in case some1 here knows me.. lol<br><br>its something like being colleagues in a very very huge building whereby we only crossed path like once per month?<br><br>and the reason i decided to make a move is cos somehow, i came to find out that she's leaving very soon.<br><br>how i get her number? as u see, i was a chicken, so i got it from some1else who dont really know her but just happen to have her number, so 1 day i was like "aiyah just sms lah, at most kena ignore only" then i asked for her msn and friendster i know its not sincere enough but i guess that doesnt matter anymore<br><br>BTW i passed my basic theory test!<br><br></div>
