              <p>Thats good. Now, for safety sake, I would advise you to work for the 3 months or so until you get enough cash to last, and then take a part time job to suppliment a little, and at the same time you are doing a part time, try to find a permernant job.</p>
              <p>I hope it helped.</p>

              <p>Save up and quit the job. Then hunt for new one, since you say you need 3 months notice, so there's a risk that you need to take.</p>
              <p>About the PC game thing, you can choose not to play what. Spend the same time reading stuff to upgrade your knowledge, etc.</p>

              <p>I seldom hear of people having 3 months notice period. Double check your employment contract though in case you read wrongly..</p>
              <p>You should start to apply for jobs now if you want to change job, perhaps quit your job <br>first so that employers don't have to wait for you for 3 months. Best is if you got annual leave to offset, then your notice period will be even shorter.</p>

              <p>Probably due to his company schedule tat thy require him to give at least 3 mths notice - to fullfill the planned schedule &amp; not disrupt the operations. </p>
              <p>Nobody shld stay in one job til old, it is highly not recommended.  U need to gain experiences in life otherwise u r wastin it.  Do watever u can to enrich ur life, e.g full-time or part-time courses, new hobby etc..to widen ur network.  If tis job cant compromise with ur needs, u shld seriously go.</p>
              <p>3 mths shld b enuf for u to get a job..afterall u are onli 25, not 35.  Tender now &amp; search for a job while u r still serving the 3mths notice.</p>
