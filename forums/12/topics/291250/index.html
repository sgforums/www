Now in secondary school i cant really do the same, as if i do so my results would be in passing-only-grades. cherish your talent; and also because of your talent, you do not have the competitive nature (which is good.)<br><br>Just note that sometimes try to study if u want to achieve, that way, with your talent as a plus-on you'll do very well. Of course not having the competitive nature is sometime good for you; at least you're most probably happy with yourself right?(i feel that way...)</div>

I like to study, but I never want to try hard enough. Im scared that if I try my hardest and I don't perfrom according to this arcane exceptionations of others, I will be letting myself down. I would rather take the easy route, slack and always think I can do better if I work harder. Am I living in self-denial if Im scared to find out my potential?<br><br>Why is everyone so competitive. I can't find the competitive nature in myself. It may sound impossible but I want to do well without studying, or at least studying the minimal.<br><br>I don't even know what course I want to take in Uni. I don't even know what I want to do.<br><br>Now, I need tips to motivate myself. For this time round, I want to find out my potential, I want to know whether what others say is true. I really want to find out. I have been living for all these years and throughout all these years of education, why is it everyone is telling me Im talented, but I don't feel so. There are times when I feel intelligent, but sometimes, I feel so stupid. I don't get it.<br><br>And how do people determine whether one is intelligent or not. My teacher said after teaching me he realised I have lots of potential. My parents said they knew from the way I learn things since young. I really don't know. I don't think it's false encouragement (or just some deceptive stuff to motivate me), but everyone that passed a comment said that. I never heard anyone say otherwise....<br><br></div></blockquote>never perform accordinly with other people's expectations is letting urself down..? lol you are you.. y wan 2 let others decide ur own potential.. ? study for ur own..not for others.. n oso y wna to let other ppl opinions affect u..? dun listen to other ppl's expectations.. jus do wad u like to do.. since u like to study den study lo..<br><br>well i duno if its true...u wan to noe whether u really got the potential to do well in ur studies bcus if u noe u really have.. den u will work hard and get the best results.. if u found out tat u dun have this potential ur teachers have been sayin.. den u will not study.. cus for u..theres no point for u to study so hard if u hav no potential.. anyway so wad if u got potential n so wad if u dun have...<br>even if u have no potential.. u can can do well too.. and even if u have great potential n work very hard in ur studies.. ppl can beat u in your studies too..<br><br>n oso i tink most of the ppl in ur sch is not being competitive.. they jus dun1 to let demselves down by not studyin n fail the exams.. anyway learn to accept failures oso =.=</div>
