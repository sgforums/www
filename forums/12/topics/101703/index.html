            <div class='col-md body'>Well, before I start, I would like to let you know, this is not another relationship story, but this is a real story.<br><br>A guy knows a girl for several years. They have been together and love each other for years. That guy work hard to give the best to the girl, and she is the only one he love.<br><br>Finally, they married. The husband has been working hard to give the wife a better lifestyle. He donÂ’t want the wife to work, as he love her, he want her to relax at home, and perhaps do some housework, and cook some food. But if the wife is tired, he will ask her to rest, and take her out for meal. In order not for her to feel bored at home, the husband encourage her to learn something new, and he found some MMORPG for her to kill her free time. He encourages her to know more people.<br><br>Few months after they married, the husband has been suffered from stress of work, he feel very depress. He hopes and begs his wife to understand him more, but the wife has changed. She has thousands of requests, she demands more and more. Not materialistic, but she demands more loves, cares, and times. The husband still tries hard to fulfill.<br><br>At this time, the wife knows a stranger on the net through an online game. She told the stranger every problem between her and her husband. She trusted the stranger. As time pass, they propose to meet each other. She plans, when her husband is at work, she invited the stranger come to her house. She gives him her heart, and eventually her body.<br><br>The husband trusted her so much, and he never and will never know that her wife loving another man. He still is trying hard on how to fulfill his wife.<br><br>One day, the husband is at work, and suddenly he has a thought. He knocks off early, go to a jewelry shop to buy a diamond chain for his wife, and plan to have a good dinner with his wife. When he reach home earlier than usual hour, when he is at font of the door and about to use his key to open the doorÂ… he heard some sounds, yes, as you guess, his wife and a guyÂ…<br><br>He walks off, he feels extremely sad, and upset. The only thing in his life is she, the only thing to motivate him is she, whatever he does is for her, and he never unfaithful to his wife. ButÂ…<br><br>As he feel there are no more hope in his life, he decided to revenge.<br><br>For subsequent months, he has been having unprotected s3x with lots of pros, what he wanted is to get infected. What he wants is to pass all this to the wife.<br><br>Â…<br>Â… there are still lots of things happen at this period of time, including the wife decided to stay, but the guy still donÂ’t want to let go, and reveal their affair to the husband. And the husband take no action and give no reaction, because he has already know all this.<br>Â… blah blah blah<br>Â…<br><br>and now, they been tested<br><br>Husband: HIV - Positive, HepB - Positive, and other diseases (I canÂ’t actually remember those name)<br>Wife: HepB - Positive, HIV result unknown yet (because has to wait for a period of time for the result to be accurate)<br><br>The Stranger: No idea. But good luck to him and to the one he love.<br><br>The husband has no regret, and he told the wife, even she decided to stay, but her decision are too late. He said, Â“<strong>when you decided to open the door for that guy, and when he decided to step in our house, both of you are decided to have this tragedy. There are no reasons, no explanations, no excuses, because you are my wife, if you really love him, and he really love you, there are something call divorce in this world.</strong>Â”<br></div>

He loved her lots and he was devastated when he found out. they had lots of arguments and such, affecting their kids. He tried to salvage the marridge but failed. He gave up his extremely well-paid job to be with her (He is one of the top executives in a large foreign bank)<br><br>Anyway, the wife left him, and the younger guy she was seeing ran away with her money. She is now under heavy medication for depression<br><br>My uncle is still in an emotional wreck and is not working currently.<br><br>My cousin is at Woodbridge because she was so affected by the divorce and she tried to kill herself a few times till she went mad =\ Not sure how is she now.<br><br>They were so happy back then.
