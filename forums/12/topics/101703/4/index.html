            <div class='col-md body'>So shocking. But i think the husband shouldnt do this. i mean, yes, he gets what he wants. he gets hiv, his wife gets hiv and hopefully theat adulterer gets hiv too. but what about the other pros. by having unprotected sex with so many pros, i bet he passed it on many times after he contracted it. they may be pros but some of them have family too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

But at least, the wife's parents strongly suggested their daughter to move back and stay with them, but the wife insists to stay by the husband side.<br><br>Anyway, we don't see the a$$hole love her. A guy who pushing her for s3x, a guy who hinted her he will reveal everything to the husband when she ask for break-off, and eventually still reveal everything. We guess, that guy wanted the husband to chop his wife into pieces, or at least whack her till she die, this is how the a$$hole show how he LOVE her? Well, he has made a good move by hiding somewhere and let the one he "LOVE" to face all this. What a brave tortoise. Obviously, he just wanted to revenge the wife for asking for break-off. He then is the jerk who show his possessiveness. To posses a s3x slave, rather than a lover, and HIV serve him right.</div>
