He was simply irrational. 1stly, IT'S WRONG TO KILL HIMSELF AND THE WIFE, so by knife or by aids, is not the point. U're supposed to decide to grow old and die with the one u love when u get married, so the point highlighted in red is kinda moot innit? Seems like he wasn't rational enuf to include old age as one of the options. Anyways, LOTS of people have their hearts broken, but not many do stupid things like he does. So nope.
