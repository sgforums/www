Despite the fact that your parents are against you and Chris and the two of you are having a hard time defending your relationship, such an approach shouldn't be CONFUSED with love... Before you decide if you should be fighting for your relationship with Chris, MAKE SURE that he's what you REALLY want... Though nobody can really predict the future, knowing what you want and making sure that you're walking in the CORRECT DIRECTION would probably HELP ALOT for now...?<br><br>If Chris is who you really want, then let your parents UNDERSTAND it...? Your own happiness is in your HAND... Though it might also be your own hands that would ultimately destroy it? At least you've got your say? Easier said than done? Let your parents know what you REALLY WANT... And though they might be around now to STOP you from doing whatever and perhaps in a sense have the ability to stop you from doing what you want... BUT the thing would END one day? Let them UNDERSTAND your determination(?) for love.... And when that day comes, you would still BEND your ways? Whatever they're trying to do now is not gonna help if that's the case... You would just need more time to readjust yourself when that day come...? Creating more unneccessary trouble(s) in that sense?<br><br>Ken or Chris, you decide? Who knows your parents might have their point? Who knows your parents might be RIGHT? But what are you after? LOVE? Marriage? A STABLE relationship? What are you seeking for my friend...?<br><br>Mistakes... Are you READY for them?</div>
