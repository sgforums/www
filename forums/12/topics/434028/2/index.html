              <p>Hello. Please pardon my english. I am in a relationship with my
              girlfriend for 1 month plus. Throughout this period there were many
              unhappy moments. I made a few mistakes that caused her to be really
              mad. I did the following..</p>
              <p>1) told her lies<br> 2) talked dirty jokes<br> 3) not respecting her privacy by showing her <span>SMS</span> to my friend<br> 4) not picking up her cue on where to eat<br> 5) taking a long time to reply to her <span>SMS</span><br> 6) sleeping without wishing her good night<br> 7) not making a phone call in front of her</p>
              <p>Whenever she is mad.. She had done the following..</p>
              <p>1) flirt with guys in the public and giving them her
              number<br> 2) slapping and pinching me<br> 3) insulting my family by calling them low class and other
              vulgarities<br> 4) scolding me fk and bustard<br> 5) calling up other guys and asking them to meet her in front of
              me<br> 6) not being sensitive to her feelings</p>
              <p>Last week incident was the most serious.. I made her mad by
              telling her some sort of a lie and she</p>
              <p>1) slapped me on the face<br> 2) punched me on the face<br> 3) kicked me<br> 4) used her high heels shoe to hit me<br> 5) took my spectacles and smashed it<br> 6) she grabbed my shirt and wanted to rip it.. I told her to stop
              but she didn’t so I pushed her and we both fell to the ground<br> 7) she climbed on top of me and strangled me for 1-2 mind I shouted
              help and the many passerbys almost called the cops<br> <img title="Cool" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool"> she smashed her face mirror and used the shard to cut
              her wrist about 6 times<br> 7) at the end of the day I had multiple cuts, bruises and
              abraisons</p>
              <p>What should I do ? Is it worth continuing on the r/s ?</p>

              <p><br> Before you comment me and label me as a jerk.. let me ask you this.
              If you are me.. how would you feel if you made a mistake and
              instead of talking things through.. your girl go and find another
              guy and ask him to date her out and to kai fang for sex? You tell
              me how you feel? doing that right in front of you? I mean yes I
              make mistakes, but dont you think any self-respecting girls who
              respect themselves and their partner will never do such things?
              what do you have to say about that keyboard warrior jerk.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Your mistake is a grave mistake. What kind of lies are you talking about? Meeting other girls?</p>
              <p>You are not even behaving like a quality boyfriend and yeah not even a goodnight. SMS too expensive? or you just cant be bothered? thats is good enough to reflect how much efforts and heart you had put into this relationship.  </p>
              <p>Also, you did not show any respect to your gf as you show her SMS to your friend. Who knows you might wanna share your girlfriend with your frens since you like to share so much? Not forgetting all your dirty talks, are you even respecting her as a woman?  </p>
              <p> Mistake is not equivalent to forgiveness. Mistake + willingness to change = best outcome for relationship. Your girlfriend is not a saint or even jesus. so what makes you think that she should forgive you each time you make the mistake? </p>
              <p>P/s: Xiao Gou gou is not being a keyboard warrior. its you who cant accept the fact that you are behaving like a jerk. Stop asking people how they feel if there were in your shoe. MCP is always MCP. just too bad that your girlfriend is not a pushover.. </p>

              <p>hahaha I like FI's response. Anyway, the writing's pretty clear on the wall right? She's an emotional baggage. What makes you think she will be a good spouse, mother and daughter in law all in one? Good sex is not everything unless your dick is.</p>
              <p>There are better girls out there. Aiyo but I've got a feeling you will still go back to her. Cos the very reason you're in this dilemma now is because (i think) you don't have that resolute steel in your decision making. Diao diao.......back to square one.</p>

              <p>Kao eh, both of you damn superficial man.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Big boobs = Silicon - fake</p>
              <p>Tight cb = Majiam oni these days</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I agree with Language that TS your story doesnt add up. Initially you admitted you made mistakes of your own and neglecting your gf. And now you paint a different picture of yourself as the victim.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some of the things you said dont make a lot of sense. Not wishing your gf goodnight because you waited too long for her reply and fell asleep? Goodness, if tired wanna sleep already just straight wish your gf goodnight then go to bed lah !!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And what are you both doing for life seriously? Can sms 12 - 5am so garang one? No need work is it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Telling your gf white lies to make her happy? Harlow, an actual relationship is based upon mutual trust and honesty. Who would want a gf / bf who is not truthful and constantly lie about stuff. You can even lie to your own girlfriend le. What makes it so hard for you to LIE to everybody here then?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If your gf really so jia lat slash her wrist so many times, why is it that she is still alive and well now? Shouldnt she be rushed to the hospital already? And you being the wonderful bf you are, like never care for if her injuries, rather you seem to place your emphasis elsewhere. Even if your gf is that extreme as what you say her to be, this is all because of you this supposed bf of hers never show enough concern for her. She is doing all this to seek attention. She do until like that le you still cant figure it out? You are 25-26 years old, not 2.5 years old ok?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After i read already all i can discern is that both of you are just together on impulse. Its more like a fling than an actual relationship. You treat her like a sex toy more than you have concern for her. If pple dont call you a jerk, then what better word to describe you?</p>

              <p>well xiaogougou, my relationship with her is rather complicated. I know I made mistakes, I dont deny that. But I never for once cheated behind her back. Ever since that very first time she cheated openly right in front of me, I find it hard to take her seriously.</p>
              <p>I mean which guy can take their SO seriously when their SO cheat on them just because they make some mistakes?</p>
              <p>For the wrist part.. why is she alive? Why not? She took her face mirror, smashed it and use the shards to slash her wrist. Thus the ‘blade of the mirrors are not razor sharp’ enough to completely severe the veins. Her wrist was slashed and she bled for quite a fair bit. When she tried to slash herself, I tried to stop her and in the process hurting myself too. The bleeding stop rather quickly because the wound was not deep enough.</p>
              <p>Why she wasn’t rush to hospital? Because she didn’t want to. Doing so will cause her trouble with the authorities. And who says I didnt care for her injuries? That day I seek the help of many passerby. They gave me tissue and medication.. but she simply did not want it. What can I do? I even went to the pharmacy to get first aid stuff for her but she simply dont want to be treated (by me or herself or others).</p>
              <p>About the mistakes, yes i made mistakes. But because of these mistakes it causes crazy responses and outbursts from her which I had mentioned earlier.</p>
              <p>I dont think you quite understand my postings. I would appreciate if you are more cordial with your postings instead of labelling someone a jerk when you dont really know the full thing.</p>

              <p>Hello pal, you yourself did not post the full story in the 1st place to begin with. And you ask for pple's suggestions. Everybody else including myself obviously give my feedback based on what we read. Then later you come blame pple for making judgements because of not knowing the full story? Arent you slapping yourself in the face then?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your girlfriend may be a crazy bucket, but the fact is you simply DONT UNDERSTAND WOMEN.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Pple are already telling you straight that your gf is doing these acts to seek attention. And you still dont get it. She needs love and attention. Of course she wont want to see a doctor !! Doctor cannot cure emotional wounds wat  !!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why would your girlfriend go out with other guys? Why wouldnt she? Other guys can be more loving and give her the attention shes so longing for but cant get from you. All she gets from you is neglection, deceit and sick jokes just to satisfy your own crappy fantasies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You said you cant let her go cause sex with her is wonderful and she is very pretty. My gosh, arent you a fking shallow person?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are simply not a worthy bf to be with, PERIOD.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just let her go, she'll do better without you.</p>
