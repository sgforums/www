              <p>Kao eh, both of you damn superficial man.</p>

              <p>I agree with Language that TS your story doesnt add up. Initially you admitted you made mistakes of your own and neglecting your gf. And now you paint a different picture of yourself as the victim.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some of the things you said dont make a lot of sense. Not wishing your gf goodnight because you waited too long for her reply and fell asleep? Goodness, if tired wanna sleep already just straight wish your gf goodnight then go to bed lah !!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And what are you both doing for life seriously? Can sms 12 - 5am so garang one? No need work is it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Telling your gf white lies to make her happy? Harlow, an actual relationship is based upon mutual trust and honesty. Who would want a gf / bf who is not truthful and constantly lie about stuff. You can even lie to your own girlfriend le. What makes it so hard for you to LIE to everybody here then?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If your gf really so jia lat slash her wrist so many times, why is it that she is still alive and well now? Shouldnt she be rushed to the hospital already? And you being the wonderful bf you are, like never care for if her injuries, rather you seem to place your emphasis elsewhere. Even if your gf is that extreme as what you say her to be, this is all because of you this supposed bf of hers never show enough concern for her. She is doing all this to seek attention. She do until like that le you still cant figure it out? You are 25-26 years old, not 2.5 years old ok?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After i read already all i can discern is that both of you are just together on impulse. Its more like a fling than an actual relationship. You treat her like a sex toy more than you have concern for her. If pple dont call you a jerk, then what better word to describe you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              </div>

              <p>LOL... for the first time i kinda agree with xiaogougou... the picture here being painted by TS is that TS is the victim. But if we look at the female POV, cheating/lie-ing is a very serious offence which most female cant accept. TS claims to accept that he have made that mistake but that does not account for any form of forgiveness. Even though the way ur gf shows it is utterly ridiculous and i tink she's psychiatricly unstable. Your actions are non justifiable. Even if you are sleepy, you can still sms her good night wad. it is a matter of effort whether you are willing to do it anot.</p>
              <p>As for the attention seeking part, i seriously tinks that it is MORE than attention seeking actually. Way too extreme imo but still i dun tink there's any love inside ur relationship. Please look into your relationship because it totally feels like a fling where you are giving the impression of a "no strings attached" thing.</p>
              <p>Are you really ready for a r/s?</p>

              <p>TS: You are better to get advices elsewhere, no point continuing over here especially with the unneccesary tone of some of the posters' messages over here. </p>
              <p>Its better if you move on from your relationship, having such abusive gf will do you no favour, as things will just go the same way as it is if you continue. But most importantly, learn your mistakes and move on! :)  </p>

              <p>"Hi destinyz. Thanks for your reply. I agree with some points of
                                      your reply. Yes I know I am in the wrong too. My mistakes like
                                      telling lies cause her to go berserk. But I dont know why she
                                      reacts in such violent manner. Frankly, after last sunday incident,
                                      I am kinda scared of her. She told me that "life has no meaning for
                                      me". " I can go to mustafa center to buy a ultra sharp blade to
                                      slit my wrist. I dare to do it". " I can even leap off a building".
                                      I am really freaked out. To addon, when I am out with her, whenever
                                      a lady looks at her for a 'longer time' she will confront the
                                      person and starts screaming and scolding the person. Whenever that
                                      happens, I just stand behind her and do nothing. Horrible feeling.
                                      It has happened more than 5 times already. It got so bad once in
                                      Mac that I had to packet her food and usher her out of the
                                      restaurant. For the love part, I believe I do love her. Last sunday
                                      when I told her that I like to break off, She cried quite a bit and
                                      I cried too (she hugged me as I cried in her arms). Sex is part of
                                      the r/s that I can do without. Its not always I initiated it. At
                                      times she asked me for it."</p>
              <p>Humm seems like your gf had a bad past.</p>
              <p>1) " Life has no meaning for me"</p>
              <p>It may means she had been rape before or her parents had beaten her before and she feels there is no more hope in life.</p>
              <p>2) " looks at her for a 'longer time' she will confront the
                                      person and starts screaming and scolding the person."</p>
              <p>Means she is scare of letting others know her inner self or she is hidding something from others.</p>
              <p>3)  "Sex is part of
                                      the r/s that I can do without. Its not always I initiated it. At
                                      times she asked me for it."</p>
              <p>Sometimes sex is use for confort and reassuring for some girls, by giving herself to you she may hope that you will be with her.</p>

              <p><br>Hi destinyz. Thanks for your reply. I agree with some points of your reply. Yes I know I am in the wrong too. My mistakes like telling lies cause her to go berserk. But I dont know why she reacts in such violent manner. Frankly, after last sunday incident, I am kinda scared of her. She told me that "life has no meaning for me". " I can go to mustafa center to buy a ultra sharp blade to slit my wrist. I dare to do it". " I can even leap off a building". I am really freaked out. <strong>To addon, when I am out with her, whenever a lady looks at her for a 'longer time' she will confront the person and starts screaming and scolding the person. Whenever that happens, I just stand behind her and do nothing.</strong> Horrible feeling. It has happened more than 5 times already. It got so bad once in Mac that I had to packet her food and usher her out of the restaurant. For the love part, I believe I do love her. Last sunday when I told her that I like to break off, She cried quite a bit and I cried too (she hugged me as I cried in her arms). Sex is part of the r/s that I can do without. Its not always I initiated it. At times she asked me for it.</p>

              <p>You stand there and did nothing? shldn't you be trying to stop her or sth? Sometimes your actions are really weird. LOL... i tink u are not ready for a r/s yet. Let this be a learning experience.But please paint a clearer picture nxt time and do not victimise yourself.Please bring her to see a psychiatrist.</p>

              <p><br>The thing is even though she has abused me but.. for such acts the bruises/cuts/abraisons etc will heal over time. Nothing too serious yet. Also.. whenever she beats me.. after sometime when she mellow down she will at times apologise to me and say that " when I hit you my heart also hurts". And then she will hug and kiss me. When she does that I will go soft hearted and just let the matter go.</p>

              <p>1) told her lies<br>2) talked dirty jokes<br>3) not respecting her privacy by showing her <span>SMS</span> to my friend<br>4) not picking up her cue on where to eat<br>5) taking a long time to reply to her <span>SMS</span><br>6) sleeping without wishing her good night<br>7) not making a phone call in front of her</p>
              <p>Whenever she is mad.. She had done the following..</p>
              <p>1) flirt with guys in the public and giving them her number<br>2) slapping and pinching me<br>3) insulting my family by calling them low class and other vulgarities<br>4) scolding me fk and bustard<br>5) calling up other guys and asking them to meet her in front of me<br>6) not being sensitive to her feelings</p>
              <p>Last week incident was the most serious.. I made her mad by telling her some sort of a lie and she</p>
              <p>1) slapped me on the face<br>2) punched me on the face<br>3) kicked me<br>4) used her high heels shoe to hit me<br>5) took my spectacles and smashed it<br>6) she grabbed my shirt and wanted to rip it.. I told her to stop but she didn’t so I pushed her and we both fell to the ground<br>7) she climbed on top of me and strangled me for 1-2 mind I shouted help and the many passerbys almost called the cops<br><img title="Cool" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool"> she smashed her face mirror and used the shard to cut her wrist about 6 times<br>7) at the end of the day I had multiple cuts, bruises and abraisons</p>
              <p>What should I do ? Is it worth continuing on the r/s ?</p>
