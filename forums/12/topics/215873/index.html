The worst that can happen is that things won't work out, by which point you may have stepped up a little in life and gotten a bit smarter, leaving you slightly ahead of square one.<br><br>On the other hand, if you're the sort to go, "Oh no no, she's too good for me", and then spend the rest of your life wondering "what if I had" like a sad sap, then you never were up to the challenge, were you?<br><br>Either way, the issue's resolved.  The only question that remains is whether or not you have the spine to go for it.<br><br>I used to date the daughter of a Federal Court judge a few years back, and hell, I just walked in like I had all God-given right to be there.  The trick to life is simply to skip the question of "Can this be done?" and go right to "How are we going to do it?" - the old man saw no lack of confidence in me and we got along like a house on fire.<br><br>The relationship didn't work out, but we're still friends, and better still, I've now got a mate who's a big judge.</div></blockquote>That's a good piece of encouragement.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers</div>
