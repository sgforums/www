If you dun like her then dun think about it. You are saying that she may not be what you want in a girl. Do you 2 communicate well?<br><br>and wow sounds like she is a pretty babe also. but you mind alot about her smokes, clubbing? family background and education level meant alot to you? you gotta think about it man, being with someone mean you have to like her bad point first. if you are only liking her good point for e.g good figure and her pretty face then better not. Infatuation dies after a while. As you said you are not getting any younger, its better to think properly whether is she the type of girl for you.</div>

I am not saying that such consideration shouldn't be taken into account, rather, when you start telling yourself that age is catching up on you and probably should begin some kind of relationship, it is but society's influence AND biological pressure on you to began a BGR in order to start a family. Not exactly that of Love.<br><br>We all Love from different degree: how much self actualization you would gain from your relationship depends on which angle you desire to look at and attain. In simple tongue, you WOULDN'T mind trying her out, but is Love really involved? You probably need to do a little self discovery here - you begin to reciprocate remarks that you may not really mean it (or as much): e.g. I like you. Such self dishonesty and delusion will definite add volumes to your confusion and spew more issues as time goes by.<br><br>In fact, you are confused because you wonder if you should try her or not - not exactly whether you Love her or not. Like you have questioned yourself: are we merely friends material or is it possible to bring that level higher? IMHO, if a someone don't really fit into the critical frame of your what you want, chances are without substantial Love, it could be karmic relationship.<br><br>Companionship or Relationship? You could do a little more inner searching here.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Listen to your heart, your feelings. Do you have any feelings for her? Deep feelings? Or just friendly feelings? Don't think of a relationship so fast. You two should know each other better, but don't make her false hopes. Go out with her more times but don't make her false hopes. The time shows. Maybe you discover your feelings, maybe there will be no more feelings then nice friendship. Tell her you need time to  find out if you have any feelings for her but prepare her for the possibility that there will be no more then friendship.<br>If you really have love feelings for her, then don't think about her past background. Don't mix the feelings with the mind. Tell her what you don't like about her and ask her if she can stop to smoke or other things you don't like. You can't change a person, you only can change some of the person's sides. But don't force a change. Never force anybody to change.<br><br>Forget about the ratio and listen to your heart and inner voice.</div>
