[b]I want to get to know her better than rather to rush into things</strong>. I know she a bit upset.... because all she did was to be kind to me and was not able to return the gesture.<br><br>We went on a second outing together and she gave me a kiss on the cheek when i sent her back home. I was really suprised.<br><br>I think , i will take it slow for now &amp; when she asks for my decision, i hope i'll make the right choice.<br><br>Thanks to all the bros &amp; sis for their advice &amp; guidance(^_^).<br>[/b]</blockquote>That's the way man. If u wanna slow down, just tell her in a nice way.<br>A tip u can try, try using "we" and "I" instead of "you".<br><br>And btw to those arse, a wild gal can become guai suddenly, vice verse</div>
