            <div class='col-md body'>I am currently in the States. My living arrangement is such that I am sharing a toilet with a guy from Saudi Arabia. He is the dirtiest pig one can imagine! Among other things, he leaves urine and fecal stains on the toilet seat! I just left a strong note to protest. I feel disgusted and abominated. How can one be so sloppy and inconsiderate. Now, my question is, does his ghastly toilet habit have anything to do with his religious belief or is it just a case of an extremely sloppy SOB?</div>

Tears will just well up in his mother's eyes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I guess you can take him aside and explain to him since you guys use the bathroom, its important that the bathroom be clean for the next person to use. Even better. If there are no girls in the house, just freak him out saying that you have female guests over frequently and they might need to use the loo.<br>I'd imagine the bathroom will be spotless the next day.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Totally understand... I used to rent a room share with 2 other girls... you would think I'm the luckiest guy around... but wtf... the kitchen is always so dirty... everyone just throw their unwashed dishes in the sink and let it stack... and the bathroom I shared with another girl... the floor has tons of long hair! And also the waste bin in the bathroom that I don't use at all... the girl will leave her 'monthly used bread' in it and she never once clear that bin! Ended up I have to clean up all that mess.... omg... those were the darkest months... luckily I had a month to month lease.... I left after a dark winter! And you think only guys are messy... Strangely enough.... they were always so well-dressed and made-up once they step out of the door that you could never imagine they can be so nightmarishly messy behind the doors!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha my flatmate is a nice guy but he has a big weakness - he drinks too much. And he doesnt clear the bottles.<br><br>We had parties on our floow and he would always be buying beer, LOTS of beer. and when the beer is all finished the bottles would be all round the place.<br><br>It was not so bad to collect the bottles and put them back into the beer crate. So several crates acculumated like this. Since my flatmate bought the beer, he should return the bottles to the shop (and get a refund on the glass bottles, for recycling), rite?<br><br>NO! After several days to about a week later, flies started to fly round the bottles. They were like small fruit flies - must have been attracted by the beer sweetness. Soon the flies literally swarmed the kitchen. And this was in the dead of winter!<br><br>So I told my roommate - look, you clear them, or I will clear them! He said ya ya, still he did not do it. Lazy bastard. But I know I couldnt throw away his bottles as I threathened, because the bottles can fetch some money - and I didnt want him to accuse me of pocketing the glass deposit.<br><br>So I took the stenched bottles and filled them with water - every single one. There must have been close to 200+ bottles, since there were 9 or 10 crates I cannot remember.<br><br>The flies disappeared. No more smelly beer smell.<br><br>Two months later, when it was time for end of the lease of the apartment, my roommate then emptied the water. He had to, since I told him I wont be touching those bottles anymore.<br><br>What came out of the water? Smelly water, FILLED WITH THE FLIES. OH HOW IT STANK. I stayed downstairs, just quietly laughing to myself.<br><br>One more thing, he doesnt clean the dishes too. Most of the time I did it, cos he would only use that one bowl, and I would use several, so he would ask if I could help him do it, since thereÂ´s not much to clean for him!<br><br>But otherwise heÂ´s a great flatmate.<br><br>One lesson: LIVE AND LET LIVE.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>
