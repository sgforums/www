              <p>well running around doesnt help cause he likes to cheat one time p.e class i ran over 2 round ahead of him and then when i finish i went to drink watercooler and went i was back he said i was too slow and he finish faster than me. wth i clealy ran faster than him. another example is when i already finish the run and i stop he suddenly run faster than me and say i win i win you so slow and i told him the reason but he still say so i still win</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>his cheat as in cutting the run in half like a to b to c like a triangle but he skips suddenly a to c instead of a to b first</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>sometimes i wonder why did i have to meet such a guy or why is my luck so bad and also why did i choose that school sometimes i just wanna make up very crafty plan to get him expel from the school. othertimes i would want to give in and beat him up *as in senting him off to the hospital *knowing i would get expel or sent to boys home. As for his smartness he claims to get 100 for psle and got a prize for being it top for his primary school em3 while i got 159 and i got nothing not even a nice try or anything. i cant laugh it off as it is affecting my studies which i should have done better in psle.He just passed his chinese barely and his mom bought gifts while i tried my hardest and i failed and got scolding from the teacher saying i didnt try hard enough</p></div>

              <p>Then you should stop wasting your time thinking on how to get back to him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He talk to you, ignore him, if he tries to get physical, beat the crap out of him. If he insult you and step over the line (eg scolding your parents etc), give him a good slap, stare him out for the rest of the days.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And spend more time on your studies.</p>

              <p>this douchebag sounds really queer the way you talk about him, and yes ive read every single page and post u entered. detached is rite. grow up, if he doesnt thats his lost. fighting would be a method but only at ur age. when you fully mature, youll find that it doesnt do anything. at the moment, i support you beating him up REALLY JIALAT because its the only way to shut him up. but if youve got another plan to shut him up go ahead. his parents come down kpkb? ask urs come down kpkb back. he wanna thick skin after that? beat him again. then parents kpkb, ask ur come kpkb back. lol. repeated cycle.</p>
              <p>ok on a serious note. try to see him in a goodlight, and if he still looks like a turd sandwich, then beat the shit outta him. LOL</p>
              <p>i wish i was 15 and i was in ur position. i woulda beaten him up. he's 176 and 88 kg, means he is overweight. im 176 and 68 kg. i guess i could run and slap him then run again and slap him then run and kick him in the nuts</p>
