              <p>Don't blame him. You still still a chance to go to a poly or JC. You'll do fine.</p>
              <p>For his type of people, if he is talking in class, you can always report him to the teacher.</p>
              <p>Your friends will not really want to talk to him if he keeps up like that.</p>
              <p>Another way is to tell him that you will talk to him at recess time and keep your word that you will do it.</p>

              <p>I tell you. To handle an idiot like that, you gotta be fierce. Dont just ignore. You gotta show him whos da boss. Make him scared until he pee and never have the guts to disturb you again. He sounds like a complete retard to me anyway. Ask someone to grab him, then you award him with many hard slaps.</p>

              <p>Well in the start of sec 1, you should have told your principal or some teacher. He's just being too proud of himself, its either that he has no true friends or he needs attention. Normally when he/she comes from a well off family, they are lonely kids.</p>
              <p><strong>Firstly</strong>, the parents are too busy making money so there little attention towards the child. <strong>Secondly</strong>, he doesn't have true friends that are always around him, maybe thats why hes just jealous of you and your friends. So he either makes up stories or starts lying to get friends. <strong>Thirdly</strong>, he's proud of himself (over confidence). So that's why all these constant bragging is going on and on.  </p>
              <p>I met those kind of people who brag about themselves so much in the end, they are usually just a lonely kid as stated as above.</p>
