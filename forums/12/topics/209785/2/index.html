I never talk to her when i see her in school, i totally ignored her as if i didn't know her. Untill the past 4-5 weeks, we started talking again. This time she seems to be serious. But she is the same old person.. There's is a chinese saying that goes, "Jiang Shan Yi Gai, Ben Xing Nan Yi" meaning that it's hard to change a bad habit or something like that.<br><br>Thanks for all your helpful replies.

This type of girl are plain sellfish and fond of making ppl sad.. by telling a person "I love you" and telling the same thing to another person the next day...<br><br>She probably haven met with some1 she really like.. That is why she is abusing ppl's trust for her..<br><br>The most important thing now is to concentrate on your studies... R/s in school life most of the time wont last.. that is what we call puppy love..<br><br>If you do cherish your life and is concerned abt your future... Sit down and have a deep analysis of what u really wane do in the future... With a stable income.. you can then find urself a partner to be with.. Dont worry there are lots of women out there in the working society...<br><br>Dont ever give up the whole forest because of a rotten tree..</div>
