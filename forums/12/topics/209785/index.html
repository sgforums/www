But every time i knew that she went out with another guy or i saw her sending message to another guy, I would be jealous and dissapointed, and the worst of all, i started to be paranoid. Every seconds I would be thinking about her with another guy.<br><br>It's really tiring for me now as I'm having my o'level, I wouldn't want it to affect my result. But at the same time, i wouldn't want to see her with another guy either. Everytime she trys to hide her phone when she is messaging, i will know it's a guy. Oh well, all i can do then is to ignore. Pretended that i saw nothing and knew nothing about it. Once, she ever show me that it was a guy, a guy who liked her as well.<br><br>Perhaps I'm just a weak guy. I can't do anything about it. I'm always thinking about her, 24/7 thinking what she is doing. All I can do now is to watch her and protect her from harm. But i just couldn't pick up my courage to stop her from seeing other guys. Why is my life full of contradiction?<br><br>I really loved her. I did so much for her and yet she gave me this in return. I'm lost now. Depressed and sad. I can hear my heart shattering now. I didn't know if i wanna continue to do this or not. I prayed to god and hope god would give me his blessing. What a fricking life I had.</div></blockquote>Is she flirtatious?  You have not illustrated any flirtatious trait.  Whats your relationship with her?  If she is single, she is free to know/date guys, you know?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's more important that you concentrate on the upcoming exams rather than be distracted by this relationship. Tell her that you need to stop seeing her during this period and sort it out after the exams. If she really likes you she should understand and wait. If she can't wait then it won't be your loss anyway.</div>
