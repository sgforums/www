You are too good for me.<br>2. Let's just be friends.<br>3. You must think of your studies/career first.<br>4. I am not ready for a relationship.<br>5. I need more time.<br>6. My parents wants me to finish my studies first.<br><br>etc etc etc... Girls don't do direct rejections because we know it is NOT nice.<br>And no, we do not like direct confrontation either.<br><br>So you see, if you are looking for a direct answer, you might as well go date one same gender as you.<br><br>Girls who knows they are attractives DO have a "waiting list".<br>If you are lucky, you are at the top of the list.<br>But if you decide to drop out of the list yourself by not being "available" when she is ready, that's your lugi.<br>Because they typically don't have a shortage of suitors for her to pick from.<br><br>So you see, it's all fair in the game of love.<br><br>Ok I agree, it's your prerogative who you want to support. To each their own. Peace ??<br></div></blockquote>Actually, there also guys who adopt the indirect approach so I won't say it's the sole language of girls. But I won't say all guys do that because it may just be that most of the guys around me do try to be subtle or at least adopt some tact. To add, there are girls into direct approach as well, in fact, often they use the indirect approach is because it's someone they consider a friend and they don't want to risk totally falling out with the guy.<br><br>It's never easy to reject anyone, guy or girl. There's always the worry of hurting the other person's feeling. We all try to do it in the best way possible.</div>

You would still have been able to get your advice and point to him without the usage of certain words. Not forgetting your sweeping statement about guys was totally uncalled for and unjustified.<br><br>My other point was how the way you treat guys tends to be very different from how you treat girls. I merely made a statement that guys and girls should be treated fairly, on virtue of their actions and not straight off on whether they are guys or girls. You kind of side-stepped that with your reply although maybe not intentionally.<br><br>So I don't think I'll be giving you anymore questions lest you put your own meaning in it or have it different from what I intended. Besides, I think I've said enough to put my point across.<br><br>But in any case, enough with the sweeping statements and generilisations.
