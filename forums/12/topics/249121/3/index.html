I think she provides good advice sometimes. For example, this threadstarter's case is over in my opinion as she had said.<br><br>So if the TS still persists, it's going to push the girl away from him even more.. So threadstarter, if Im in your position, this is what I will do: "dear, I am going to leave you alone and make your own decision. When you are settled in your decision, you let me know then." Then you start finding other girls.<br><br>In any case, keep in mind this girl is history in my book.<br><br>doko</div>

Kind of how people refer to radical Islam. I'm all for women's rights and human rights, but it's a different thing to carry it too far.<br><br>Like indiscriminate male-bashing and being hostile to a person just because he's a guy. Conveniently labelling all guys as perverts who only want to take advantage of girls. The list goes on.... Basically people who carry the feminist issue too far.<br><br>I just hope you're not that type of person, which is also the female equivalent of an MCP. Both are wrong in my opinion.<br><br>And you don't have to be a girl to be able to speak up for ladies.</div>
