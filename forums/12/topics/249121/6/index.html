People tell you one thing, you have a tendency to bring it a different direction altogether. So a few times, I have to keep clarifying or rectifying.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>Did I not already mentioned I don't give a damn what you think about me ??<br>And why must you keep trying to tell me things I don't care to know from you ???<br></strong>[/quote]<br><br>You can say you don't care, but it doesn't change the validity of the things that have been said. Besides, I can understand your responses. At least you've been quite consistent with what we know of you.<br></div><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>This tread belongs to TS not me. </blockquote></div></blockquote>Well, what prompted me was you being unnecessarily mean to him. Anyway, I did try to be concise, but you kept trying to bring the point elsewhere.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>So quit nagging at me "hoping" I will change.<br>Because I am what I am, and I didn't come here for your advise.<br>I am perfectly happy living my life as it is. OK ???</strong></div></blockquote>Yes, you are what you are. Proven.<br><br>But, I'm not commenting about how happy you are, that was never the issue. It was about sparing a thought for others with the kind of replies you make. Just because it makes you happy doesn't mean it gives you the right to be mean, that sounds so much like an MCP. The world doesn't revolve around you, you should know that. I believe you've been a much less selfish person after becoming a mother.<br><div class="quote_body">[quote]Your persistency is very nauseating you know ! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> </div>Nauseating persistance would be when you persistantly change the meaning of what people tend to say, put words in other people's mouths and blindly label or make sick conclusions about people.<br><br>Now that, is nauseating.</div>
