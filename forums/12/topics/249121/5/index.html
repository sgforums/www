It's one thing to be clear cut, but it's a different to be way over and extreme. Sometimes, if you don't take things into totality, you will jump to wrong conclusions. Like saying all man are gullible, assuming every guy is a lecher and a pervert, thinking a parent displays a different love just because he is a father of sons and not daughters.<br><div class="quote_body">[quote]And no, I think of my glass as half full.</div>It seriously doesn't seem like that.

She will not choose you despite not going back to her ex. She has already dropped hints that she is not considering you.<br><br>Ultimately, you do what you feel like doing and I can only say be true to your heart. But honestly, it doesn't seem promising now, especially since you really seem to want to make her your gf now. Whatever you do has to be sincere. But if it's not meant to be, then let it go.<br><br>Just continue to be her friend because the very least she would want to is to lose a friend. Whatever happens in future, happens. But for now, don't force it no matter how much you feel like it. It's not a good idea to persist after she has said no, well kind of.<br><br>That's my suggestion, ultimately whatever you do, you must feel comfortable doing it.</div>

Do the right thing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Im not asking you to bash the other guy up. Ask yourself what do you really want from her? Sex, relationship or both? Or is it just the pride for your sake so that it feels good to win a girl from a rival? Or is it everything? What do you really want ? I think you are just fighting for yourself.<br><br>Im telling you confessing to her will get you rejected again because she has rejected you before. Im telling you not wasting your time on someone who doesn't feel it for you is the smartest move you can make. When a girl doesn't feel it for you, you can do nothing.<br><br>In fact, the best thing you can do right now is nothing. Better still, get to know a few more girls. You are placing too much value on that girl who may be overpriced to say the least. What has she done to deserve your reward? Kinda like some overpaid people in Singapore now? Anyway, what I will do is just delete her number and all her messages. Then you will not think about her...makes you strong. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>doko<br><br></div>

That's why SumOne and I are telling jojoBeach she's too extreme and negative.<br><br>Anyway, I do not know enough to say much, but did she reject you before? If she had done the 'soft' approach like what jojoBeach said (eg 'I need to study', 'I am not sure', 'i do not know', which I think is just selfish acts of keeping spare tyres at hand), and you cannot take it, then go ahead and attempt a direct approach, and get an absolute yes or no answer<br><br>Ultimately, I am not interested in gals whom think they are pretty and use that to their advantage (NOTE: I use the word, THINK they are pretty) and get a long waiting list. I don't envy them. In fact, I sympathise with them.<br><br>If your gal is like that, and you cannot close this chapter in your life until you get an absolute answer, then go ahead and do the face to face confession. But BE PREPARED. If she is the type of gals like what jojoBeach spoke about, then your chances of success is lesser than failure.<br><br>When that happens, forget about her, go out with friends, enjoy life.<br><br>When I was younger, I was also pining for a relationship. Actually what I think I should have done on hindsight was to expand my social network more, have more fun, coz that's what you have now, FREEDOM! When you get older and settle down, there are responsibilities and burdens.<br><br>So, do what you need so that you don't regret, but move on if it does not give the result that you want.<br><br>You can msg me if you wish to speak privately and give me more details.</div>

We are attracted to good looking things.<br>That is a fact we cannot ignore.<br>When you go and see a property, you look at the external factor.<br>Does it suit your taste ? Is the surrounding nice ? Is the area too noisy ?<br>Then you walk into the house and decide if the layout is what you need.<br><br>However, true, looks can be achieve with cosmetics.<br><br>Would you invest your whole life savings in a property that looks like a poop shed ? Perhaps you will, if you can see the potential in developing the ugly shed into a world class resort.<br><br></div></blockquote>ah yes... this society is not as utopian as we all want it to be, true.<br>However, 1st impressions only count so much. Beauty is just like your degree certification. It opens the door to opportunities. But if the person is stupid, moronic, no inner personality, to back up the beauty/degree, then they will be kicked out.<br><br>You can even relate your Beauty idea to some Indians from India. They talk talk talk talk talk, but has no substance to back it up, and many of them then get send back to India.<br><br>And also, your analogy on a property is not really correct. In theory, when you said you walk into the house and look at the layout, the correct comparison would be that you look at a gal/guy and able to see her inner personality. Thus, if their inner personality would be as easy as walking into the house to look at the layout, then beauty is not the topmost priority.<br><br>Finally even you admit, a place with a watershed, may turned out to be the investment of your lifetime. A person whom is not as attractive physically, may turn out to be the person of your lifetime.<br><br>So you are contradicting yourself. Are you saying that beauty IS the deciding factor, or beauty is ONE of the deciding factors? Coz end of the day, I am just saying beauty is one of the many factors, and this is the point you are contending with me now.</div>
