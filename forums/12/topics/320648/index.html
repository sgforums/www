              <p>i used to be very close to this girl in sec 3&amp;4 and yes, i did like her but never did express my feelings for her back then because she had a boyfriend. we lost contact after O lvls and now, after 5 years, i managed to bump into her and caught up with old times, nevertheless, my feelings for her start to come back again.</p>
              <p>she is now going through a rather complicated part of her life and she does know abt my feelings for her now. she started talking to her ex-bf (which they went tgt for 4yrs) and they are just friends after a year of breakup. they both agree that at this point of time, they are not ready for each other because they are settling into their so-called-new-life.</p>
              <p>she still does open up alot to me and tells me all her problems and she mentioned if i felt that if she was leading me on (i do not really get this part about leading me on) and whether i felt awkward about it. like duh, of course i feel a little bit awkward, but i feel that its good to lend a listening ear and be there for her when she needs someone.</p>
              <p>she has 2 elder brothers whom she is not closed to and did mention to me that i'm like an elder brother that she never ever had.</p>
              <p>is she trying to tell me to stop liking her? i do like her but not exactly chasing her because i feel it is not the right time.</p>
              <p>my friends tell me that most girls will tend to be cold towards a guy that likes them and tend not to communicate? somehow, mine's a little different..</p>
              <p>should i continue doing what i am doing? or? i dunno.. thanks for reading this long post! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>Right now.. just be there for her, as a close friend<br>hopefully she might fall for you or you can tell her your feelings<br>but she already mentioned that she treat u like an elder brother<br>so don't be suprised if she reject you.<br>about the part "if u felt she was leading u on"<br>i think what she mean is if her behaviour give u any signs or hint that she is interested or like you. i'm not sure</p>
