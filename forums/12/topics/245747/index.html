Lucky I was able to handle after sometime...Usually it takes 3~6mths to get used to the job. If u are hardworking enuff, I am sure u will overcome it somehow. However dun take it too hard even if u can't success, cos at least u put ur best...no regrets. Hope this helps  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

If still cannot, you may discuss with your boss.  Sure, your boss may compare you to the guy who resigned.  Let it be then.  It is better that you voice out and get things corrected and donely properly than to try yet screw things up.  FOr all we know, that guy might have resigned due to the voluminous workload?<br><br>as for 'more than half...' you 'do not understand'.  Try to read and comprehend again and again.  If still cant understand, approach your colleagues, see if they can help and make any sense to you.  If they still cant, check with your boss.  i am sure he wants you to learn and complete your job timely too.  He is accountable for your work to his boss too.<br><br>Dont be too vexed.  There is always a solution to everything.  The worse thing is resign and look for another job.  No big deal.<br><br>*pats</div>

Are they people who might be able to show you the ropes which you've not realised yet...?<br><br>If you seriously think you can't cope and no one's around to direct you at all, I might somehow suggest you quit then to get sacked especially when ya have good profile previously... In case you don't know... Some work place are just like sh|t hole.. They know they can't properly get people to fill up the space, so they just 'cut &amp; paste' without really caring about the conseqence or just let someone be the 'lamb'... Often it's about bad politics...<br><br>Not suggesting that your workplace is necessarily so though...? So it's always good and wise to be careful.....</div>
