            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all, serious disucssion pls, I rec'd this forwarded e-mail. Personally I find it makes some sense as stroke is due to blood clot in the brain (correct me if I'm wrong). What do u guys think could it be jus another e-mail hoax?<br><br>Subject: FW: A needle can save your life<br>&gt; A NEEDLE CAN SAVE YOUR LIFE<br>&gt; Please try this in case of emergency....<br>&gt; First Aid for Stroke<br>&gt; Keep a syringe or needle in your home to do this...<br>&gt; It's amazing and an unconventional way<br>&gt; of recovering from stroke, read it and<br>&gt; it can help somebody one day.<br>&gt; This is amazing, if it works. Please keep<br>&gt; this very handy...<br>&gt; Excellent tips. Do take a minute to read<br>&gt; this. You'! ll never know. One's life may depend on you.<br>&gt; My father was paralyzed and later died from<br>&gt; the result of a stroke. I wish I knew about<br>&gt; this first aid before.<br><br>&gt; When stroke strikes, the capillaries in the<br>&gt; brain will gradually burst.<br>&gt; When a stroke occurs, stay calm. No matter<br>&gt; where the victim is,do not move him/her.<br>&gt; Because, if moved, the capillaries will burst.<br>&gt; Help the victim to sit up where he is to<br>&gt; prevent him from falling over again, and<br>&gt; then the bloodletting can begin.<br>&gt; If you have in your home an injection syringe<br>&gt; that would be the best, otherwise, a sewing<br>&gt; needle or a straight pin will do.<br>&gt; Place the needle/pin over fire to sterilize<br>&gt; it,and then use it to prick the tip of all<br>&gt; 10 fingers.<br><br>&gt; There are no specific acupuncture points,<br>&gt; just prick about a millimeter from the<br>&gt; fingernail.! Prick till blood comes out.<br>&gt; If blood does not start to drip, then<br>&gt; squeeze with your fingers.<br><br>&gt; When all 10 digits is bleeding, wait a<br>&gt; few minutes then the victim will regain<br>&gt; consciousness.<br><br>&gt; If the victim's mouth is crooked, then pull<br>&gt; on his ears until they are red. Then prick<br>&gt; each ear lobe twice until two drops of blood<br>&gt; comes from each ear lobe. After a few minutes<br>&gt; the victim should regain consciousness.<br><br>&gt; Wait till the victim regain his normal state<br>&gt; without any abnormal symptoms then take him<br>&gt; to the hospital.<br><br>&gt; Earlier, if he was taken in the ambulance in<br>&gt; a hurry to the hospital, the bumpy trip will<br>&gt; cause all the capillaries in his brain to<br>&gt; burst. If he could save his life, barely<br>&gt; managing to walk, then it is by the grace<br>&gt; of his ancestors.<br><br>&gt; I learned about letting blood to save life from a Chinese<br>&gt;traditional<br>&gt; doctor Ha Bu-Ting who lives in Sun-Juke. Furthermore, I had<br>&gt;practical<br><br>&gt; experience with it. Therefore I can say this method is 100%<br>&gt;effective.<br>&gt; In 1979, I was teaching in Fung-Gaap College in Tai-Chung. One<br>&gt; afternoon I was teaching class when another teacher came running to<br>&gt;my<br>&gt; class room and said in panting, "Mr. Liu, come quick, our supervisor<br>&gt;has<br>&gt; had a stroke!" I immediately went to the 3rd floor. When I saw our<br>&gt; supervisor, Mr.Chen Fu-Tien, his color was off, his speech was<br>&gt;slurred, his<br>&gt; mouth was crooked-all the symptoms of a stroke.<br><br>&gt; I immediately asked one of the practicum students to go to the<br>&gt; pharmacy outside the school to buy a syringe, which I used to prick<br>&gt;Mr.<br>&gt; Chen's 10 fingers tips. When all 10 fingers were bleeding (each with<br>&gt;a<br>&gt; pea-sized drop of blood), after a few minutes, Mr. Chen's face<br>&gt;regained its<br>&gt; color and his eyes' spirit returned, too. But his mouth was still<br>&gt;crooked.<br>&gt; So I pulled on his ears to fill them with blood. When his ears<br>&gt;became<br>&gt;red,<br><br>&gt; I pricked his right earlobe twice to let out 2 drops of blood. When<br>&gt;both<br>&gt; earlobes had two drops of blood each, a miracle happened. Within 3-5<br>&gt; minutes the shape of his mouth returned to normal and his speech<br>&gt;became<br>&gt; clear.<br><br>&gt; We let him rest for a while and have a cup of hot tea, then we<br>&gt;helped<br>&gt; him go down the stairs, drove him to Wei-Wah Hospital. He rested one<br>&gt;night<br>&gt; and was released the next day to return to school to teach.<br>&gt;Everything<br>&gt; worked normally. There were no ill after-effects.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; On the other hand, had we brought him to the hospital immediately<br>&gt; after a stroke, the victim usually suffers irreparable bursting of<br>&gt;the<br>&gt; brain capillaries on the way to the hospital. As a result, these<br>&gt;victims<br>&gt; never recover.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Therefore stroke is the second cause of death. The lucky ones will<br>&gt; stay alive but can remain paralyzed for life. It is such a horrible<br>&gt;thing<br>&gt; to happen in one's life. If we can all remember this bloodletting<br>&gt;method<br>&gt; and start the life-saving process immediately, in a short time, the<br>&gt;victim<br>&gt; will be revived and regain 100% normality. We hope you can tell<br>&gt;others<br>&gt; about this first aid method. By doing so, stroke may be removed from<br>&gt;the<br>&gt; list of major causes of death.<br>&gt;<br>&gt; Forward this after reading. It will be a good deed indeed. The<br>&gt; greatest risk is not taking one... Make a difference!!!<br>&gt;<br>&gt; "Say good words, have good thoughts, do good deeds, and help make a<br>&gt; world of difference."</div>
