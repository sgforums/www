            <div class='col-md body'>why did you get together with your bf in the first place ? if you had feelings for your best friend already , you shouldnt have accepted your bf . it would be so unfair to him . to think all the while his gf has been thinking of another guy .<br><br>from what i see now , do you mean to say you're treating your bf as a substitute now ? cos you said that it wouldnt be hard to be faithful to your bf now as your best friend has someone in mind , which i intepret to be that if your best friend has feelings for you you would probably dump your bf and be with him . this is just my interpretation . that would be so so so unfair to your bf .<br><br>i suggest . sort out your feelings now . talk to your best friend . find out if he has any feelings for you . if he doesnt , just give up this thought and love your bf wholeheartedly . you have to make a decision , or else your bf would be hurt even more as this drags on .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just some thoughts...<br><br>It's normal to find someone more attractive than your bf (or gf... it applies both ways). The issue here is for you to remember, you've made a commitment at some point in time. It doesn't matter when, but since you've made it, you've got to work at it.<br><br>Talk to your bf about your crushes, talk about your insecurities, talk about how you feel, and it's best to talk as soon as the problem arises. That way, things get brought out and can get resolved sooner rather than later.<br><br>About your problem, realise that there's so much more than just "things we have in common" in a relationship. I just got engaged to someone who doesn't share many things in common with me, but I know I can trust her and that she'll be there for me. Friends who share common interests will come and go, and likewise, your interests will change and you can't possibly change partners just because you change interests.<br><br>Cheers</div>

I wish we could be more than friends but the thing is...I have a boyfriend who loves me very much and he's in love with another girl who doesn't love him. I know i have to faithful to my boyfriend which is not hard at the moment since the guy i'm in love with doesn't love me, but i'm afraid that in the future when he gets over his current love things will be more complicated. We had a chance to become a couple long time ago but he let it slip away. Now i keep thinking what could have been. I try to support my boyfriend and give him as much love as he's given me over the past couple of years but my heart's not 100% in it. Every now and then i start thinking about my friend...How can i get over him?</div></blockquote>go steady with your friend lah. kick your bf away lah.</div>
