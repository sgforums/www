DO you admit that you ever loving your bf at all  since your heart is always thinking of this "friend"? Are you just using your bf for the time being only?<br><br>Let me put it this way if your "friend" say that he loves you, will you dump your bf asap to be with him? lets be honest shall we since no one here knows who you are.<br><br>sadly to say that by making the above statement only shows that you have made up your mind.<br><br>Can I ask the people in the forum with girls like that as your gf will be still want to be a loyal and loving to your girl? Imagine you put years and effort in the relationship only to end up with nothing in the end..<br><br>To girls out there it takes time and lots of effort to be a good bf. Stop trashing your good bf cos in the end you will suffer the same faith too  when the guy u so call love will dump you asap as what you have done.<br><br>Sadly after seeing so many case of the above examples I really do no wish to see another guy to be hurt by an unfaithful girl.<br><br>To the writer have a heart tell your bf the truth and let him decide. If he is dumb enough to stand by you then by all means go ahead. If he is smart enough he will move on.<br><br>Most impt let your bf decide after treating you so well for so long, this should be the min effort by you.<br><br>would you like to feel how your bf would feel if you left him ?<br><br>below is a part of a story of what your bf would be feeling.<br><br>//<br>just felt like letting it out.<br><br>i was there for her when she was feeling down.<br>i helped her up everytime she fell.<br>i gave her all my attention even when others had appointments with me.<br>i sent her home everyday even though i stayed far away and had less than 3 hours sleep.<br>i was there to help her financially if she needed it.<br>i was there to console her everytime she complained and cried that she did something wrong at work.<br>i always put up with her tantrums and never once told her i wanted to break up.<br>i always let her know where i was or with whom and wat i was doing.<br>i always bought her clothes or other accessories but she never wore to let me see<br>even when we did break up once and she wanted to patch back and cried, i was always there for her during the break up and eventually decided to patch back<br>i never once put up any photos with other gals in any website<br><br>but now.. suddenly some guy comes in between us playing the good guy and gives her advise.<br>now she says she is confused suddenly about our love but she denies being interested in him.<br>she now just wants to enjoy life with her frenz partying it out<br>she puts pics of herself n her male colleagues..some of them with arms on her in a website.<br>she removed our pics together and claims that its nothing.<br>she never stores my hp no in her hp but stores that of that bastard.<br>she calls up my female frenz and creates probs and now my female frenz and me dun really tok<br><br>i just feel so bored with this relationship. she has a huge character flaw and all her previous 15 relationships didnt work out. her only 2 longest one was 3 month n 6 months. mine lasted 5 yrs with her. i endured all her crapz and complains and everything. now suddenly she says we are not compatible? why then did she wanna patch up after we broke up?i really gave my all and tried my best but now i just feel i have failed. all other gals i know just tell me that i haf done so much for her and they wish that someone would do the same for them. i really dunno where i haf done wrong. i am tired of always suffering and just want to let all this go. but truth is i am afraid. i am afraid to be lonely. afraid that i will not find another person to love or look after. she does things wrong but blames me and i haf to apologise.<br><br>//</div>
