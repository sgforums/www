              <p>I am a middle age accounting and finance professional with more than 10 years of experience.</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I am facing problem whereby the average period I stay for each of my permanent role is 2 years plus, less than 3 years. Except for my first job where I stay much longer, but that is not directly related to accounting and finance field.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I have valid reasons that are not by my choice such as company restructuring and poor job fit. There was also reasons for career advancement.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Matters got worse when one of the perm role I got into was a poor job fit and the working environment was toxic. So I left the role in 6 months as I was informed that I will not be confirmed.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Thereafter, I could not find a perm role and 6 months later, I took up a contract role with a MNC as I do not want to waste any more time, and subsequently another contract role with another MNC. Both roles were with well-known companies, mid-senior level, complement well with my previous experience and provide very good exposure. The only drawback is that each of these contract role lasted for less than 1 year each even after contract renewal.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Whilst working on contract, I continue to seek permanent roles both within the MNCs as well as externally but with no luck.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Now that my contract role had ended, I find that I am being ostracised by employers and head hunters while seeking for a permanent role due mainly to my job history, even though my salary and skill sets meet or even exceed their expectations.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Some of the head hunters and recruiters propose only contract roles to me and not the permanent opportunities that they have on hand.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">The last straw came for me when a head hunter suggested that my career is over which is my worst fear. I am not very old – less than 40 years and have at least more than 10 to 15 years of working life left.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I feel lost and my future unknown with a big question mark. I do not want to be working on short-term contract roles for the rest of my life. Even if I am willing, there will come a time where this will not work out.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Should I take a chance with another contract role and hope a long term role might come out of it? This will risk further jeopardising my poor job history that I am trying to fix. A recruiter suggested to me that I should not take up another contract role any more.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Given the job market slowdown now, employers are picky over permanent hires and I feel that this is also true for contract hires now.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I am not sure how long it will take for me to find a perm role. If it is even going to come at all…..</span></p>

              <p>Really feel sad about our job market in sg.  You are one of the many victims still stuck in job hunting due to foreigners policy.   Employers here are very extremely nitpicking. It is almost impossible to get permanent jobs here.  </p>
              <p>When I was hunting for job, I encountered problem like yours.   I also notice many foreigners were hired to do the same job I was applying.  As such, my question is, are $$$$$ and political interest at our expense of securing our rice bowls.</p>
              <p>Don't give up.   Continue to search.   You may like to visit transitioning.org website which provides support for job seekers.   </p>
              <p>We have to be firm to allow positive changes to take place  now and future.   By supporting "importing FT" to compete with locals on jobs will continue to make more locals out of jobs and having unnecessary difficulty in job hunting.   FOREIGNERS .... CREATE JOBS for locals ?   This is not impossible but possibility is much lower than influx of foreigners are given employment in Singapore.    </p>
              <p>Think, think, how this situation started, who are responsible .......     Do we want situation to remain status quo or get worst, the choice is for locals to make.   If present employment situation not solved, in future it will affect the kids when they grow up.</p>

              <p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
              <p>I am not sure if i am a direct victim of the government's foreigners' policy. Maybe to some extent.</p>
              <p>But i do know that my employment record is not helping me at all.</p>
              <p>Is it worth the risk to tweak and stretch the employment year of one of my earlier job to limit the damage on my resume?</p>
              <p>Has anyone tried doing something like this before in times of need?</p>
              <p>Please share with me or PM me.</p>
