            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The debate on the issue of virginity has always been in a stalemate. This is because our family, religion and experience shaped our attitude towards this subject. Regardless of the people saying NO or YES to pre-marital sex, allow me to post you one question:<br><br>Can virginity, or the absense of it, substain a fulfilling, promising marriage? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To YES:</span><br><br>Lovers should not be open with their bodies just because they are lovers. You are walking into the tombstone of love <strong>if sex enters the relationship too quickly.</strong> They should only if they are comfortable with each other, no obligation, mutually emotionally stable and satisfied. (Simple words, but not that easy to satisfy the requisites)<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">To NO:</span><br><br>Don't be mistaken, everyone has their rights to look for a virgin bride and everyone is entitled their own decision regarding pre-marital sex. However, <strong>is that SO IMPORTANT as a consideration in marriage?</strong> What if your love isn't a virgin? Are you contemplating to give her up? Or subconsciously devalue her?<br><br>I have encounter cases where people devalue their partner because they are non-virgin and usually, psychologically, it is their hidden self. They may appear to swallow this harsh realilty, but it choke right in the middle - producing invisible resentment and devaluation. And it's just so sad to see the woman having to forgo certain rights in her own relationship just because she seemed 'unpure'. The man don't treat her as well as before - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">even though they may not abuse her. </span><br><br>Purity has nothing to do with a piece of membrane. Purity lies in her heart and her personality and in the first place if that's isn't what you are looking for - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">what's the difference between a man going for external beauty and a man looking for a virgin wife for ego-and-not-for-love purpose?</span> I yet to see a man speaks about his desire for a virgin wife in marriage, but truely doesn't mind if his woman isn't one and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WOULDN'T suffer any of the symptoms above.</strong></span> Almost everyone belongs to either side.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> SibeiSuayKia listed down all factors within the Ego purpose:<br><br>(I) The in-laws, (Even if you never involve in panky hanky before marriage, it doesn't mean you will not after marriage and having pre-marital sex doesn't mean that you will betray marriage in issue relating to sex. This truely depends on the situation)<br><br>(II) The children (Parents engaging multiple partners before marriage in the past? As long as the marriage is NOT involved in this in any ways, why should the children be bothered?)<br><br>(III) The parents (Girls who engaged in sex before marriage considered 'bad' girl? Again, not neccessary)<br><br>Basically, the way how society looks upon and think. (In fact, coming from personal experience, I do notice that man who are easily jealous/practice a little possessive trait/slightly chauvinist, to be quite particular about virginity of his wife.)<br><br>P.S: In love, the ego has to be scape for fulfillment to achieve. Do you happen to know that SOMETIMES, things like these HAVE to happen before one would learn anything in love? Of course, we all have free will - a woman too easy with herself using her OWN FREEWILL will eventually come to realise that she gain nothing from the myrid of relationship she been through. But a majority of non-virgins do not belong to that category.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Speaking of this non- virginitiy issue, my gf told me she is a non-virgin and yet i still accepted her as i simply loved her. I told myself that i am accepting her as what she is now and not accepting her due to her PAST. As time went, this issue kept coming up in my mind. i tried my best to swallow it and just accept her. I was also worried that one day her ex bf might just drop by and he think of her as 'naked' etc. but then my gf did not give her virginity to just anyone but someone she once loved. that's what she told me. but then i can't accept the fact that it wasn't me. kinda sad sometimes. but wat to do? i have to accept her as she is.. kinda sad whenever i forget about thi sissue and it resurfaces in my mind whenever i read an issue about virginity etc. worst is on the roads where those guys ALWAYS look at my gf. Indeed my gf IS HOT(thats what i notice after all the attention she keeps getting!! #@$@$%$).. but then i wonder why can't they just not look at her as she has already been 'taken' with me walking beside her etc?? sometimes i m indeed worried about all this attention that she attracts although i know that she is true to me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>here's my view..<br><br>what is virginity? dictionary.com gives the definition as:<br><br>The quality or condition of being a virgin.<br>The state of being pure, unsullied, or untouched<br><br>Looking at this definition, we shall now apply it to the sexual context.<br><br>to me, virginity is a state of being. A state of being pure and untouched. If u feel that u are a virgin, then u damn well are one. Goes the same for those that have felt violated or sullied or unpure, if u feel that you are any of those 3 things, then u are not a virgin regardless of whether u had sex or not.<br><br>I think the issue u are facing is whether or not u want someone to have... enroached the sanctity of your future spouse. does it matter to u that someone has put a flag up there and said "i was here first"?  Maybe...<br><br>but SHOULD it matter? heck no! its like climbing a mountain. Lets take everest for example. After Sir Hilary climbed that thing and said "Hahaha i was here first!" did he say that no one else can go up? nope. did that stop anyone from going up again? nope. did the mountain say.. "hey.. i only want hilary and hilary alone" ? nope.<br><br>my point is this. If u dun mind climbing the damn mountain, and the mountain doesn't mind u climbing it (at this point in time.. i realise my analogy is getting more and more kinky) go ahead and plant your damn flag on it. will the pleasure of ascending it be diminished just because someone beat u to it? well thats really up to u and your big fat ego. cause thats what it boils down to.. your ego.. can u accept that another man or woman has seen your spouse in all his or her naked glory? that.. my friend is a question u have to answer for yourself...<br><br>for me.... i dun care if my future spouse has had sex or not. as long as she respects her body thats good enough for me. Even if she has had a wild turbulent youth... as long as she's come to her senses..thats fine by me.</div>
