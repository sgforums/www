            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Friend,<br>Let me share something with you.<br>I used to have similar views like you. I had a gal who was with me for 8 years. I used to believe that it was very important to have a so-called virgin gf.<br><br>Back then, my friends around me said I am so selfish and narrow minded. My answer was that yes, for a gf, if non-virgin, it's okie. But later, if she becomes my wife, and we meet each other everyday and when our love is not as 'fresh'...and if one nite I having intercourse with her...I can't lie to myself that half-way through it....she has been naked and done it with another guy before...meaning.........all her so-called virgin body was touched by someone else first...I can't lie to myself that I don't feel anything at all!<br><br>So, I managed to get to know my gal who was a virgin and we were together for 8 years. Last year, she suddenly left me due to personal reasons. Then I start to wonder..what is love? What is all the 8 years spent? What are past memories? Can it really be 'washed'/'deleted' just like a computer?<br><br>It was so devastating (both were at fault for the breakup) that I had months of sleepless nites and not a single day of happiness....<br><br>What's the morale of the above?<br><br>Virginity :<br>- Doesnt mean a gal/guy is pure. Nobody is totally pure - spiritually or physically<br><br>- Doesnt guarantee everlasting love. So since it doesnt guarantee this, why should we be so bothered about it, and consider it as a factor when looking for gf/bf/husband/wife?<br><br>Remember.........................to make a relationship work.........there must be a) communication ; b) understanding; c) tolerance; d) love between each other<br><br>Virginity is just but a myth in the world of relationships.</span></strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps you all are correct, now im trying to play up in my mind a scenario ,<br>whereby this and that happens , if i were a child<br><br>then a guy told you "I slept with your mum/wife before, she's great"<br><br>What would you do??<br><br>1) Fight the person<br><br>2) Ignore and Go<br><br>Nevertheless, if she done it herself , by breaking her own membrane or whatever , nevermind lets move on further regarding pregnancy , would you accept a gal who had a abortion prior to the relationship or would you accept a gal who is a single mother? and you know that the child isn't yours?<br><br>In-depth discussions is always welcomed  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by yahoo.com:</div><div class="quote_body">Speaking of this non- virginitiy issue, my gf told me she is a non-virgin and yet i still accepted her as i simply loved her. I told myself that i am accepting her as what she is now and not accepting her due to her PAST. As time went, this issue kept coming up in my mind. i tried my best to swallow it and just accept her. I was also worried that one day her ex bf might just drop by and he think of her as 'naked' etc. but then my gf did not give her virginity to just anyone but someone she once loved. that's what she told me. but then i can't accept the fact that it wasn't me. kinda sad sometimes. but wat to do? i have to accept her as she is.. kinda sad whenever i forget about thi sissue and it resurfaces in my mind whenever i read an issue about virginity etc. worst is on the roads where those guys ALWAYS look at my gf. Indeed my gf IS HOT(thats what i notice after all the attention she keeps getting!! #@$@$%$).. but then i wonder why can't they just not look at her as she has already been 'taken' with me walking beside her etc?? sometimes i m indeed worried about all this attention that she attracts although i know that she is true to me. </div></blockquote>u juz saved me the trouble of sayin it here!<br>exactly the same as u...LPPL lor...i worst sometime have to meet her Ex for dinner and such coz he n her still frenz...knn...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Never cared whether the girl is a virgin or not. In fact, I tend not to ask just to avoid embarassing her. I don't see how a girl becomes bad just because she is not a virgin. In fact, it may even be good since she may know how to arouse me better  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>What's the big deal with this virginity thing? I am more concern about people having unwanted babies and STDs. Short of that, sex is a part of life and there is nothing dirty about sex and it's experience.

            <div class='col-md body'>My questions:<br><br>1. So if a girl masterbates and her "whateveritscalled" breaks/bleeds, is she a virgin?<br><br>2. What's with the issue of purity and cleanliness? The whole procedure of sexual intercourse is sick, wouldn't we prefer a non-virgin for cleanliness sake? I mean bedsheets and stuff?<br><br>3. How the heck are guys supposed to tell if a girl is a virgin or not? And how are girls supposed to tell if guys are virgins or not?<br><br>4. Why is it that guys are always bitchy about virginity, but we don't see the same bitchniness in girls?<br><br></div>
