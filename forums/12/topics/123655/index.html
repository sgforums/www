And yes, I belong to a water sign and I admit, I'm very cautious and usually guarded but once I let someone in to my close circle, I'm totally loyal to them (unless they prove to be unworthy of it).

            <div class='col-md body'>Tes, your ex has already showed you his true character by his deeds.  In this case, words aren't needed anymore...<br><br>It's hard to accept the awful truth because the truth hurts.  However, in your case, the truth also cuts short the time you would otherwise have spent yearning for him, since you now see the 'real' him.<br><br>I guess you'll need to go through a period of 'mourning' the loss of the relationship first.  Different folks take different periods of time but acknowledge your hurts and it might help at this stage to verbalise your feelings to close friends.  Don't make the mistake of ignoring your pain or pretending it doesn't exist or burying yourself in work / social life / activities because you DO have to deal with the pain and it won't go away by pretending it doesn't exist.<br><br>After that, you'll feel numb.  Then maybe, you might feel some sorta anger and that's a natural progress but it means you're working towards healing.  You might also return to denial at this stage but be careful to steer yourself back onto the right path and not linger too long at the detours!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>When it's all done and you're quite sure you're over him, analyse the relationship and learn from it.  Don't repeat the same mistake again and be a better judge of character the next time round.<br><br>Lastly, don't close your heart to other people... love does await you, if you'll welcome it with open arms!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
