Wat others haf sez'd may be partly true, tt ur bf may be slowly trying to break up wif u, but I feel it may Not be the fairest representation of the motives of the initiator of the cooling off period ( henceforth known as "the Initiator" ).<br><br>So after pondering over this, here's wat I think.  Wat the others haf mentioned may be true.  But there may be another side to it as well.  We shd understand the motives of the Initiator, &amp; examine the reasons why he wans to slowly call thgs off.  OTOH, the Initiator may wan time to sort issues out without any "distractions" or "noise" (I shall define "noise" here as opinions &amp;/or accusations/interference from another party tt may tamper wif the Initiator's ultimate decision).<br><br>If the Initiator's motive is to break up, a time-out or "cooling off period" may be his way of gently breaking the news to u, to give u time to adjust to life without him, &amp; for u to adjust to being emotionally independent of him.  The reason for this cld be tt he still cares deeply abt ur feelings, or, he cld simply wanna give himself time to get out without a big hoohaa.  There cld be other reasons, but this will depend on ur understanding of ur bf to come to a conclusion : )<br><br>2ndly, the "cooling off period" may be due to issues the Initiator feels he's unable to resolve wif other pple interfering in the r'ship.  He may be confused as to wat he can do to make the situation better for himself or both parties, or he cld be in a dilemma whether or Not to continue wif the r'ship.  Added pressure from u or frens may make his dilemma even worse, &amp; thus he needs time to calm down &amp; think of wat to do next.<br><br>Wat u can do during this period is simply, Nothg.  By all means, if u wanna tell him u still love him, go ahead, but dun do so to the pt where u get him even more confused, adding to the "noise" &amp; pressure he might be feeling in the decision-making process, in short, dun smother him.<br><br>In short, sometimes the motives of the Initiator may Not be totally selfish.  Unless pple haf been in the shoes of the Initiator, they wun totally understand the frustration &amp; the hopelessness felt by the 1 taking time out from a r'ship.<br><br>Gd luck, Coco.<br><br>RP<br><br></div></blockquote>thanks RP... but the truth is it's actually me who is thinking of having a cool-off instead. i tink i need the time to sort out my thinking and decide on what i really want. my bf has always said that i'm too reliant on him. so i tink maybe i can take this time-out to cultivate myself to be emotionally independent of him. the effect of every little thing he does is magnified 10 times more on me. and we quarrel alot... sometimes feel really tired as to why we always end up like this.</div>

If you 'cool' off or whatever, you'll realise that #1) you dont need him in your life cos he's nothing but worries and trouble. #2) you'll be able to enjoy yourself with your friends at pubs (if you have the money) better.

If you Ended-up-worst than communicating, it can only be attribute to two factors:<br><br>I) Wrong use of tact in communication. In communicate, we achieve mutual solution or what Organizational Behaviour calls it win-win solution. In love, yes - acceptance and compromising. Tone of speech, emotions and temper has to be in check.<br><br>II) When one side refuse to speak. Communication can only happens in pair. You can't speak to yourself ya?<br><br>One proven fact in all relationship studies is that, most problems origin from non-communication. Sure, few critical issues in love needs more than just plain communication - but certainly without them, you are bound to inflict fractures all over your relationship. And when you both panic and wishes to talk because the relationship is so badly damaged - you both <strong>never knew where to start the repair</strong>.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Some objective of communication is to to understand, place empathy and seek preception/feelings/thoughts/etc from the other party. The more we learn about our personal problems, the more we can see solutions to it. And when both side tries to look for solution - the more effective our solutions is.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There was once my friend who i knew from Sec sch told me about a year ago that I was the most 'normal' girl in school. I asked what did she mean. She said, i didn't have dramas when I was in a relationship in school. Other girls used to lie that they were pregnant and stuff. HAHAH.. now that I think back, i also felt the same way. I was with someone just for the sake of being with someone. I was never happy or comfortable to be with him.<br><br>He never let me meet his parents and I thought he was dodgy cos he had other girls' msgs in his mobile. Hehhee.. oh dear... Lingos was very sneaky once. Anyway he told me that he was going to China for a biz trip. We were mucking around to get these guys' office voicemail msg to hear their voice. His was that he was on annual leave. So i cracked it and messaged him that he was lying to me. I think he got the message when I ignored his phone calls and sms. Anyway, after like one week of doing what I want to do and not having to get his BS sms of meet me downstairs in 20 mins.. i felt so free! So anyway i've learnt that it's better to be alone and free than be in a bad relationship.</div>
