            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Coco,<br><br>I wanted to present u a true &amp; fair view to the best of my abilities, hence my later reply.  Wat others haf sez'd may be partly true, tt ur bf may be slowly trying to break up wif u, but I feel it may Not be the fairest representation of the motives of the initiator of the cooling off period ( henceforth known as "the Initiator" ).<br><br>So after pondering over this, here's wat I think.  Wat the others haf mentioned may be true.  But there may be another side to it as well.  We shd understand the motives of the Initiator, &amp; examine the reasons why he wans to slowly call thgs off.  OTOH, the Initiator may wan time to sort issues out without any "distractions" or "noise" (I shall define "noise" here as opinions &amp;/or accusations/interference from another party tt may tamper wif the Initiator's ultimate decision).<br><br>If the Initiator's motive is to break up, a time-out or "cooling off period" may be his way of gently breaking the news to u, to give u time to adjust to life without him, &amp; for u to adjust to being emotionally independent of him.  The reason for this cld be tt he still cares deeply abt ur feelings, or, he cld simply wanna give himself time to get out without a big hoohaa.  There cld be other reasons, but this will depend on ur understanding of ur bf to come to a conclusion : )<br><br>2ndly, the "cooling off period" may be due to issues the Initiator feels he's unable to resolve wif other pple interfering in the r'ship.  He may be confused as to wat he can do to make the situation better for himself or both parties, or he cld be in a dilemma whether or Not to continue wif the r'ship.  Added pressure from u or frens may make his dilemma even worse, &amp; thus he needs time to calm down &amp; think of wat to do next.<br><br>Wat u can do during this period is simply, Nothg.  By all means, if u wanna tell him u still love him, go ahead, but dun do so to the pt where u get him even more confused, adding to the "noise" &amp; pressure he might be feeling in the decision-making process, in short, dun smother him.<br><br>In short, sometimes the motives of the Initiator may Not be totally selfish.  Unless pple haf been in the shoes of the Initiator, they wun totally understand the frustration &amp; the hopelessness felt by the 1 taking time out from a r'ship.<br><br>Gd luck, Coco.<br><br>RP<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Coco_Coco:</div><div class="quote_body">hmmm....<br><br>always heard people talk about the need for 'cooling off' period at some points in a relationship.. like 'let's not see each other for the time being' and 'give me some time to re-consider this relationship'... etc....<br><br>but wad causes this need to arise?<br><br>will this help or harm the relationship?<br><br>the outcome?<br><br>any past/present experiences to share?</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Coco, circumstances may determine whether the Initiator of the cooling off period decides to end the r'ship or to continue wif u.  Dun try to smother him wif ur love, as this will only confuse him further, give him time to think thgs thru.<br><br>He's probably oredi v. frus cosh he doesn't noe wat to do.  Added pressure may actually cause him to decide to end the r'ship so as to start afresh without any of the old problems &amp; baggage...<br><br>In a nutshell, sometimes it might be an issue wif honesty.  Sometimes, it might be circumstances &amp; pressure tt force him to make a decision tt ultimately hurts both parties more.<br><br>RP<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Coco_Coco:</div><div class="quote_body">or maybe they really wanna the time to think and in the end came to the conclusion it's better to end it all instead...</div></blockquote></div>
