Lingos was very sneaky once. Anyway he told me that he was going to China for a biz trip. We were mucking around to get these guys' office voicemail msg to hear their voice. His was that he was on annual leave. So i cracked it and messaged him that he was lying to me. I think he got the message when I ignored his phone calls and sms. Anyway, after like one week of doing what I want to do and not having to get his BS sms of meet me downstairs in 20 mins.. i felt so free! So anyway i've learnt that it's better to be alone and free than be in a bad relationship.</div></blockquote></div>

(Usually happens in teenage love.)<br><br>Love cannot advance when both are looking at each other - they must look towards one simiiar direction.<br><br>Seven Law of Love state that 'Love always wants more of itself and love always brings up everything unlike itself.' Although this theory simply states that it brings reality into love - 'Love alone cannot sustain a marriage.' is only true if you see love by itself - No form, cannot use to buy anything, cannot eat, etc. BUT one important note is that its magical effect can only work through a soul. And through it's effect, it can brings tremendous result because when you love and wished to see the better of your other half and that's how miracle can happen. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Without love, its almost certain the marriage will fall. Responsibility <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is man's effort to upkeep the marriage because responsibility is a self-imposed liability</span>. With love, it automatically brings responsibility due to seven law of love (it brings up everything unlike itself) - but <strong>responsibility itself cannot foster love</strong>. The relationship will generally be stagnant.<br><br>In simple about what I had posted above: E.g: I am be poor and may not be capable to give my wife a good life. But I truely loved her; what little I have, we share and I gave her the lion's share. I look long-term and strive for my future because I <strong>want her know that she had made a right choice in sticking with me</strong>.<br><br>Do you possibility think this is possible for a marriage where love is non-existance? The thinking, preception, desire and determination? Probably enough for the wife to substain life and decent living - but anything more than that would be kinda difficult. There is no motivation nor cause to work towards. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: In fact, people these days don't feel that love alone can substain a marriage - It is the <strong>lack</strong> of it that makes it such a difficult process to go on. When I say lack, it doesn't mean non-existance, what I meant is that it's level is too weak/immature to enter into marriage.<br><br>Cheers</div>
