Hidding from a problem and pretending that it doesn't exist often won't just make the problem go away...<br><br>It's even more disturbing when he even proposed a marriage on top of all the problems both of you are facing and over such a short period which both of you are in this relationship... He doesn't seems all that capable of solving the problems in the relationship on hand, nor to be able to think what priority he should be having before jumping into a marriage... It seems quite likely that he's also only just hoping that a 'miracle' would happen after the marriage.. Very much seems like one who blindly believe that going into a marriage would 'somehow' just SOLVE MOST of the problems between 2 people if not all...?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>With reference to the previous topic Kuri has cased up, "<a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=233274&amp;page=18" rel="nofollow">Love has no reason?</a>", <span style="color: red;">my opinion still stand</span>. I can only reinforce my statements with the same advice I put in Kuri's earlier topic.<br><br>Kuri, you now have to decide (again) are you going to go ahead with this relationship with him to a deeper level? His "proposed" marriage issue may have you confused, but bear in mind what level of commitment you and he have to make. Think carefully you want to go ahead or backtrack.</div>
