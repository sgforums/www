            <div class='col-md body'>She's really bad to find herself another guy in such a short time. This means that she dun really love u that deeply! Move on, you will surely find someone a MILLION times better, she dun deserve u. Quit the drug hobby pal, it will only lessen your pain temporary, tink of the long term effects it may have on your health, its not worth it to indulge your sorrow in drugs becoz of that bitch. Kick the drug habit pal, clean up, go out, join a youth club or play a new sports to meet more friends and enlarge your social circles, u never koe which girl will be the next special someone u are going to meet in the future who truly deserves u  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To let a girl like this ruin your life is really not worth it. Don't even think about doing drugs or wasting your life away because she is not going to care and you will end up suffering worse than you already are and the problem will still be there.<br><br>My fren is even worse off than you. He had a gf for about 2 years and when he enlist into the army, the girl starts seeing other guys. During a Sat when he booked out, he and his friends saw his gf holding hands with another guy.<br><br>So don't despair, life has its ups and downs. If you fall, climb back up and learn your mistakes and don't make the same mistakes again the next time.</div>

From YOUR POST, I SENSE that it's not that you CAN'T let it go... You've just REFUSED to... CHOSE NOT to.....<br><br>ANGER fills your mind... With contempt, you're CORRUPTED.... Having no one to stand by you and give you a helping hand at this point of your Life is NO EXCUSE to simply let things be... You STILL have YOURSELF... AT LEAST for now.... Quick make FULL USE of yourself... Before you LOST IT TOTALLY.... You'll NEVER KNOW that this point of your Life could prove to be a FATAL TURNING DOWNSLOPE... IF YOU <strong>allow it to happen...</strong><br><br>Cigars, liquors and drugs... HOW MANY PEOPLE have tried it....? If it works there won't be so many suicidal cases arising from it... So many people LOST.... You're just temporarily PARALYSING your mind for now... Let it LAST, and you could be PARALYSING the REST of YOUR LIFE.... OVER a SINGLE WOMAN? Issit worth it at all...? I know this lady is SO IMPORTANT to you.... But you'll never know if there could be a MORE IMPORTANT and WORTHY lady waiting for you in the future of your life.... And you WOULD NEVER KNOW if your life just starts to ROT here... Throw yourself on the floor and let people spit at you...? Sympathise you....? PICK IT UP YOURSELF BOY.... It's YOUR LIFE... Like this is gonna be ANYBODY ELSE's BUSINESS...? If you DON'T pick it up, OTHERS would just STEP OVER IT.... EVERYBODY's BUSY... WHY would they bother to stop and pick up something SO UNWORTHY.... Lying on the floor....?<br><br>DO YOU FEEL WEAK? BECAUSE YOU'RE PARALYSING YOURSELF... HAVE YOU LOST CONTROL? BECAUSE YOU'RE DECEIVING YOURSELF... PICK YOURSELF UP... REFORM.... WORTHINESS IS WHAT YOU MADE OF YOUR OWN... NOT WHAT PEOPLE SEE OF YOU... YOUR WORTHINESS, IS HER LOSS.... HER UNWORTHINESS.... BEAR NOT....<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm was once in the same plight as u r. Worse than u ar 3 years stead. i was 15 since i was with her. We were really happy together, when she left me she only took 3..... yeah 3 DAYS to have another stead.I was devasateted.........it's just like the end of the world. everywhere i go, everything i do She's always on my mind. Life just seems meaningless to me as days pass.1 year have passed,Till now i still miss her VERY much much but what's the use? she wouldn't know that u are missing her.i know that she's very happy with her stead now. All i can do is just pray for her happiness. But look at it another way, ur family and friends will still be there for u.I can say that i will NEVER forget about her and the happy times we had together but all these are the past, only sweet memories are left. If u want u've got to give ur best shot to win her heart back if she really dun give u chance, then u got to move on. Try to give urself this challenge - To live better than her. cos she wouldn't know that u are suffering for her.Time will heal, trust me, U are the one to determind how long this suffering will end cos no one else could. Think about........Hope u can get to ur feet fast cos i knoe the feeling and it's pure self-toture. Take care bro......</div>

It shows that you really love her but she doesn't appreciate you.<br><br>Since she has already made up her mind to break up with you, please try and forget her. If she really treasure you and if she really loves you, how could she love someone else so easily ?<br><br>Do not continue to go for things like drugs and stuffs. It might be hard but sooner or later you'll forget her. Just try your best and I'm sure you can do it.<br><br>Try to look for friends and anyone you feel its alright to talk with. My ex-gf actually loved another guy but my situation was not as bad as you.<br><br>Last but not least, I hope things will be fine and please, don't ever spoil yourself because of a girl.

            <div class='col-md body'>I understand how u feel. I'm in a similar situation as u. Everywhere I go or whatever I do, she juz keep appearing in my mind. She seems to be in my mind every moment in my life and I keep wanting to do things for her.<br><br>The worst thing is that even my friends get sick me, coz everytime I go out with them, I will keep telling them about how I still feel for that girl. My conversation keep revolving around her. My friends keep telling me not to mention abt her anymore, coz that will only make me harder to forget her. But the more I keep things to myself, the worst it gets and the feeling juz gets worse and worse, coz the feeling juz keep building inside me.<br><br>After a while, I feel that I really shldn't bother my friends anymore. I tried not to talk abt her whenever I'm with my friends, but deep down in my heart I'm actually still thinking abt it.<br><br>I almost lost interest in anything. The model answer to this type of situation is to get a life and widen yr social circle so that u will get to meet more people. But even if I force myself to socialize, I may be there physically, but my heart is not there.<br><br>Everyone knows what the stardard and model answer to this type of situation is. But it is really hard to do it. Now, I dun even have anyone whom I can talk to abt this problem, coz I dun want to bother other pple abt this anymore. I will feel bad taking up other pple's time on matters like this.<br><br>I'm still trying hard to get over it. And sometimes I do collapse and dun feel like living anymore. But after struggling for sometime, I feel that it will be too unfair to my family. Coz that will make them feel sadder than me. While I end my life and have no more worries, they in turn have to suffer for losing me as their love one.<br><br>Try to switch yr focus to think more abt those who love u. Your family and yr friends. Do u think they will bear to see u getting from bad to worse? Do you know that for those around you who cares for you, they will feel sad to see u in this state as well?<br><br>One way to start off is to ask pple around u if they have anything you could help them do. Try to take the initiative to offer help to yr friends. If you are good at playing the guitar, u can offer to teach other friends who dun know. If you are good at computers, you can offer yr help to repairs computers for other people. Whatever skills you have, make it to full use. Keep your time occupied with caring and offering help to those around you that may need it. In turn, yr friends will also appreciate it.<br><br>Be a better person from now on. There are others who need you as well. Look around you. There are bound to be pple in worst situation than you.<br><br>I'm also trying hard to get on with my life. Remember that u are not alone. All the best.</div>
