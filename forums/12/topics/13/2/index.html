From YOUR POST, I SENSE that it's not that you CAN'T let it go... You've just REFUSED to... CHOSE NOT to.....<br><br>ANGER fills your mind... With contempt, you're CORRUPTED.... Having no one to stand by you and give you a helping hand at this point of your Life is NO EXCUSE to simply let things be... You STILL have YOURSELF... AT LEAST for now.... Quick make FULL USE of yourself... Before you LOST IT TOTALLY.... You'll NEVER KNOW that this point of your Life could prove to be a FATAL TURNING DOWNSLOPE... IF YOU <strong>allow it to happen...</strong><br><br>Cigars, liquors and drugs... HOW MANY PEOPLE have tried it....? If it works there won't be so many suicidal cases arising from it... So many people LOST.... You're just temporarily PARALYSING your mind for now... Let it LAST, and you could be PARALYSING the REST of YOUR LIFE.... OVER a SINGLE WOMAN? Issit worth it at all...? I know this lady is SO IMPORTANT to you.... But you'll never know if there could be a MORE IMPORTANT and WORTHY lady waiting for you in the future of your life.... And you WOULD NEVER KNOW if your life just starts to ROT here... Throw yourself on the floor and let people spit at you...? Sympathise you....? PICK IT UP YOURSELF BOY.... It's YOUR LIFE... Like this is gonna be ANYBODY ELSE's BUSINESS...? If you DON'T pick it up, OTHERS would just STEP OVER IT.... EVERYBODY's BUSY... WHY would they bother to stop and pick up something SO UNWORTHY.... Lying on the floor....?<br><br>DO YOU FEEL WEAK? BECAUSE YOU'RE PARALYSING YOURSELF... HAVE YOU LOST CONTROL? BECAUSE YOU'RE DECEIVING YOURSELF... PICK YOURSELF UP... REFORM.... WORTHINESS IS WHAT YOU MADE OF YOUR OWN... NOT WHAT PEOPLE SEE OF YOU... YOUR WORTHINESS, IS HER LOSS.... HER UNWORTHINESS....
