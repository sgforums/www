Or private school?<br><br>U know, you have a speakable mouth N a pair of powerful hands and all you need to do is to complain! U have all the right to speak up and not suffering it man! Try to get some justice here if not try to clear the misunderstandings.<br><br>Actually, I think u r just Kan Cheong, stopped a year wouldn't really make much different. Uncle here, stopped schooling for 5 -6 years and now just stepped into ntu. U think life is going easy for me? Come on. Face it man. U r not stupid at all. Try to examine the way of your studying method. I strongly believe that it's ur inefficient method that is hindering you from real understand from memerising. Cheer up man! Take a coolz jog and think about a better studying, learning way that suit you most. Remember, it's not time that's matters, it's your studying method!<br><br>Don't worry. Believe in yourself. I can see the strength in you. Do it!<br><br>ciao</div>

(your lecturer) Afterall, we're talking about YOUR FUTURE here... Not HIS... He could probably just a stepping stone in your life.... He can do whatever he wants to PIN YOU DOWN, but usually you would still have the ULTIMATE CONTROL... He can try to humiliate you but he would still have to give you credits if you deserves them.... Don't be too bothered by such, the society you're gonna step into ain't exactly gonna be FAIR too... If you can't even handle this little 'storm', how can ya expect to handle the bigger ones...?<br><br>Whatever relationship crisis that you might have been facing.... Whatever hardship.... There's ONE THING which I like and in which I think is the MAIN ISSUE here.... <strong>"Now I am back, wanting to achieve my target"</strong> Just REMEMBER YOUR ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE? I wish you ALL THE BEST....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
