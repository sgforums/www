            <div class='col-md body'>I'm the kind of girl who prefers the company of guys. I've always thought it's much easier to get along with them. Today i was proven wrong.<br><br>I was particularly fond of this one guy. Dont get me wrong...we've never been romantically involved. I have a boyfriend and he's in love with a schoolmate. He was easy to talk to, fun to be with and he never tried to get into my pants. In short...we were good friends. We used to stay up late chatting on msn, sometimes even til 4am. He said he loved me(as a friend) and wanted to protect me and honestly...i felt the same way about him. I felt blessed to have a mate like him.<br><br>Now we're growing apart and i dont know what to do. He's spending most of his spare time with the girl he likes and im busy with my studies. He recently said he missed our long talks and i miss them too. It's strange really...he says he misses me but whenever i try to talk to him i hardly get any reply. He either says 'ok', rolls his eyes or keeps quiet. He couldnt care less about anything i say. I can see that i sometimes even annoy him. "You once said you loved me. What happened?"<br><br>Today i got really angry with him cos he's always insulting my boyfriend. Usually i try not to get upset but today he really crossed the line. I said he's got an attitude and he needs to work on that or otherwise i want nothing to do with him. I even deleted him on msn so that i wouldnt get tempted to talk to him.<br><br>I really dont know what to do. I want my buddy back but he's been a real arse lately. Nothing i say can make him change his ways. I think he doesnt care about me anymore<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you claim to be buddy with him? really?<br><br>Possibly I don't think so.... if you are buddy with him, he would not treat you so unless i'll explain otherwise.<br><br>If you are buddy with him, probably he'll still talk to you etc, maybe less now that he got to also entertain his higher priority gf or target. As a buddy fren, u got to be understanding on this really. If not you won't be categorized as that. In fact asking him, "you don't love me anymore izzit" etc goes to show that you are not a buddy or even close to a good fren status. You are not being considerate. So do not be amazed he is irritated of you.<br><br>I do agree you are craving for his attention? ask yourself why? just as a buddy fren? weird... do you crave for your bf attention? if not, weird again. Buddy frens do not crave for each other's attention, but more of a heart-to-heart talk and not "insult" about each other's bf/gf etc, they should in fact respect that also. So based on this, i don't believe so. I believe more that the 2 of you are flirting over than being buddy etc.<br><br>Conclusion probably is your fren thinks inside of him "sorry mate, end of flirting with you for me, I got better things to do, I hope you can disappear from my life for the moment". Again I can predict he might be back into your life when he has no other gals or better things to do.<br><br></div>
