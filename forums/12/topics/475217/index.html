              <p class="MsoNormal"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Dear Auntie Agony</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">U know I am in the state of confusion for the past one week.
              I really don’t understand a guy’s thinking.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Here is how the story goes.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I was training at the gym with my friend when a guy randomly
              approached me for my number. Things went well initially. We agreed to meet up
              for dinner and movie. He gave me a good impression through the dinner and
              movie.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I eventually agreed to watch the second movie with him, this
              time a horror movie – since he was quite enthu about it.  </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Half way the movie, he asked me if I was feeling cold – and my
              response was – nope I am ok since I am wearing a cardigan  and I wasn’t really frighten by the movie coz i
              like horror movie.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Perhaps he realized that he was getting no where , and he
              suddenly whispered into my ears saying that he likes me alots and wants me to
              be his girlfriend and held my hand. I swear my mind was frozen for that second  coz I was really engrossed into the movie.  He asked If I was angry when he held my hand..
              I was not angry , but just in state of shock. I did not pull my hand away. But I
              realized I soon made a mistake.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">He became v touchy the moment I didn’t let go of my hand. He
              pulled me closer to him, and was kissing my hand and head through the movie –
              which made me feeling super uncomfortable.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">After movie, he continue to hold my hand and I did not let
              go either coz I thought I could give this relationship a try.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">He did not want to go home after movie and suggested supper
              near his house. We took a cab home and in the cab, I did told him that we were
              moving things abit too fast.. maybe we should slow down thing alittle.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Anyway , after we alighted , we didn’t went supper coz he
              said he was not hungry anymore. But he said he wanted to drink . so we went to
              buy a can of beer for both of us at the nearby 7-11. Initially, we were
              drinking at his void deck. Soon he tried to coax me to go his house. I initially
              refused, but he pleaded me till I had no choice but to his house.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">So we went to his house and his parents were still awake
              when we entered his house. We went to his room and there was no chair for me to
              , and I had to sit on his bed while  he
              go and showered .</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">At the point, I was feeling v scared coz I felt unsafe and
              started texting my friend to let her know where I was.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Anyway he was out from the shower and wants to cuddle in
              bed. ;x which I agree but soon he was getting out of hand – where he tried to
              kiss me and climbed on top of me which made ma panicked. I was struggling to
              break free, and making a big fuss of wanting to go home.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">At this moment , my friend called, and I answered the call,
              lying to him that it was my best guy friend who called to check on me. he was
              really upset that I choose to pick up the call and reported my whereabout to “him”.
               We had a minor argument – where he
              eventually agrees to hold my hand, and hug and kiss me only and he will not force
              me to go his house again until I am ready.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">He eventually sent me home 
              , and at my void deck, he asked for a goodbye kiss, which I did give him
              but I pulled away again when he touched my breast. ;x  anyway I went home and I sent him a sorry text
              as I don’t meant to end thing lidat.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">The next day, I went to meet my own friends , and most of
              them discourage me to continue with him.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">He didn’t not text me again until night time – around 9 plus
              to confirm our meeting on tues( it was a ph) .</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I did not  reply as I was out with my friends. And by 11 pm,
              he got angry that I did not reply and he called me. actually I was drafting a
              text to him, explaining that I just want to be friend with him first and see
              how things go. But becoz he become too aggressive ,  I was too afraid to answer his call.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Nevertheless, after some texting ( some exchanges of  nasty words here and
              there) – we decided to talk over the phone instead. I tried to explain  to him my standpoint. But to him, he keep
              saying that I am hurting him, gave him a roller coaster ride and playing with
              him. .. eventually he did give in to my request of just being friends.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">After that call, he did not text me again. I tried to
              contact him – texting him if he still wants to meet on Tuesday, his reply was “
              he is already meeting his friend, sorry dear.. “.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal"> <span style="line-height: 1.231;">After that text, I did not hear from him again.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I really want to give this relationship a chance but I guess
              I ruined it with my own hand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">What should I do if I want to win him back.. but yet I am
              afraid that he is just after my body. <span style="font-family: Wingdings;      ">L</span></p>

              <div class="name">this is the oldest trick in the book !!!</div>
              <div class="name">Look back at it yourself<br>1) 2nd movie already you already in his bed !!! =  he know how deseperate you like him already. You like him so much basically willing to do anything - let him touch all over already. If his luck better, you and him already sex already.</div>
              <div class="name">2) since he know you so desperate, 2nd movie jump on his bed, just that day his luck is not good and you still have some small resistance. Now he is just playing the oldest trick in the book - make you feel guilty and you the fault that the relationship cannot move another step.  Frankly in the end you will just be desperate enough to have sex with him just to be with him. After that it become you ownself offer yourself one - when he got what he want &amp; dump you.</div>
              <div class="name">If a guy love you - he is willing to wait and go slow with you. If a guy only want sex - here is a classic example - all in his mind is not you, only your body but how to jump into bed with you.</div>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Dear Auntie Agony</p>
              <p>U know I am in the state of confusion for the past one
                  week. I really don’t understand a guy’s thinking.</p>
              <p>Here is how the story goes.</p>
              <p>I was training at the gym with my friend when a guy
                  randomly approached me for my number. Things went well initially.
                  We agreed to meet up for dinner and movie. He gave me a good
                  impression through the dinner and movie.</p>
              <p>I eventually agreed to watch the second movie with him,
                  this time a horror movie – since he was quite enthu about it.
                   </p>
              <p>Half way the movie, he asked me if I was feeling cold –
                  and my response was – nope I am ok since I am wearing a cardigan
                   and I wasn’t really frighten by the movie coz i like horror
                  movie.</p>
              <p>Perhaps he realized that he was getting no where , and
                  he suddenly whispered into my ears saying that he likes me alots
                  and wants me to be his girlfriend and held my hand. I swear my mind
                  was frozen for that second  coz I was really engrossed into
                  the movie.  He asked If I was angry when he held my hand.. I
                  was not angry , but just in state of shock. I did not pull my hand
                  away. But I realized I soon made a mistake.</p>
              <p>He became v touchy the moment I didn’t let go of my
                  hand. He pulled me closer to him, and was kissing my hand and head
                  through the movie – which made me feeling super uncomfortable.</p>
              <p>After movie, he continue to hold my hand and I did not
                  let go either coz I thought I could give this relationship a
                  try.</p>
              <p>He did not want to go home after movie and suggested
                  supper near his house. We took a cab home and in the cab, I did
                  told him that we were moving things abit too fast.. maybe we should
                  slow down thing alittle.</p>
              <p>Anyway , after we alighted , we didn’t went supper coz
                  he said he was not hungry anymore. But he said he wanted to drink .
                  so we went to buy a can of beer for both of us at the nearby 7-11.
                  Initially, we were drinking at his void deck. Soon he tried to coax
                  me to go his house. I initially refused, but he pleaded me till I
                  had no choice but to his house.</p>
              <p>So we went to his house and his parents were still
                  awake when we entered his house. We went to his room and there was
                  no chair for me to , and I had to sit on his bed while  he go
                  and showered .</p>
              <p>At the point, I was feeling v scared coz I felt unsafe
                  and started texting my friend to let her know where I was.</p>
              <p>Anyway he was out from the shower and wants to cuddle
                  in bed. ;x which I agree but soon he was getting out of hand –
                  where he tried to kiss me and climbed on top of me which made ma
                  panicked. I was struggling to break free, and making a big fuss of
                  wanting to go home.</p>
              <p>At this moment , my friend called, and I answered the
                  call, lying to him that it was my best guy friend who called to
                  check on me. he was really upset that I choose to pick up the call
                  and reported my whereabout to “him”.  We had a minor argument
                  – where he eventually agrees to hold my hand, and hug and kiss me
                  only and he will not force me to go his house again until I am
                  ready.</p>
              <p>He eventually sent me home  , and at my void deck,
                  he asked for a goodbye kiss, which I did give him but I pulled away
                  again when he touched my breast. ;x  anyway I went home and I
                  sent him a sorry text as I don’t meant to end thing lidat.</p>
              <p>The next day, I went to meet my own friends , and most
                  of them discourage me to continue with him.</p>
              <p>He didn’t not text me again until night time – around 9
                  plus to confirm our meeting on tues( it was a ph) .</p>
              <p>I did not  reply as I was out with my friends. And
                  by 11 pm, he got angry that I did not reply and he called me.
                  actually I was drafting a text to him, explaining that I just want
                  to be friend with him first and see how things go. But becoz he
                  become too aggressive ,  I was too afraid to answer his
                  call.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, after some texting ( some exchanges of
                   nasty words here and there) – we decided to talk over the
                  phone instead. I tried to explain  to him my standpoint. But
                  to him, he keep saying that I am hurting him, gave him a roller
                  coaster ride and playing with him. .. eventually he did give in to
                  my request of just being friends.</p>
              <p>After that call, he did not text me again. I tried to
                  contact him – texting him if he still wants to meet on Tuesday, his
                  reply was “ he is already meeting his friend, sorry dear.. “.</p>
              <p> <span style="line-height: 1.231;">After that
                  text, I did not hear from him again.</span></p>
              <p>I really want to give this relationship a chance but I
                  guess I ruined it with my own hand.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What should I do if I want to win him back.. but yet I
                  am afraid that he is just after my body. <span style="font-family: Wingdings;">L</span></p>
              </div>

              <p><img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> You did not ruin this relationship with your own hands; there is no relationship to begin with, so how can you ruin something that doesn't exist? Technically speaking, you didn't agree to be in a relationship just yet. </p>
              <p>You proceeded with intention of a prospective relationship, but he proceeded with the intention of having an express queue to sex. Your womanly instinct already sounded an alarm, which hinted you to text your friend on your whereabouts. Emotionally, you are already confused (together with some alcohol to bring about greater judgment error) - however, I can sense that you still would like to give him a chance (despite all that happenings and your friends' disapprovals). </p>
              <p>His own needs has overwhelmed him completely, insofar that your needs are being compromised. He does not appear to be genuinely interested in knowing you as a person, more than knowing how he can satisfy himself physically.</p>
              <p>He is looking for a quick physical fix; you have to figure if this is what you want.  <img style="line-height: 1.231;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
