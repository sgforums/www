I hope it'll get better cause I dont want anyone else to think I'm mentally ill. Haha.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by PlsDunBanMe:</div><div class="quote_body">Yes I agree partially with you. But I DO help others. YOu ought to see me, but only I know. In CIP for example, Flag Day, I'd be one of the few who'd stand throughout the required time and ask for donatinos from every passing person. My can would always be the heaviest and fullest among my friends. They would go and catch a movie and dumb like 5 cent coins in it to fill it up. I am doing voluntary CIP, in fact, I did CIP for SPCA during the JUne Holidays cause I love working with animals. It's really sad to see those animals euthanised after 2 weeks. If I had the capability to do so, I would adopt as many pets as my house would allow.<br><br>I also agree with you cause I should not have gone from a neighbourhood school to a top 5 JC. The culture is so different. Maybe that's why I canot fit in.</div></blockquote>As alot of ppl advise you, forget these 2 years, just focus on your studies right now, study hard and get out of JC asap. I understand how you feel...the thing is, the 2 years in JC is very tough wher the workload suddenly gets super heavy and everyone around you is mugging and lessons last throughout the day most of the time, so there is lesser time for casual socialising. Hence, you will see alot of 'little groups' being formed where certain ppl will band together to study etc. Yes, it is all the much harder for you as you jumped from a neighbourhood school to a top 5 JC. I do not really know how to put this across but its like these 2 different groups of ppl are on different wavelength and different types of thinking. Its not really to do with snobbishness or anything to do with you but rather you just can't 'click' with them.<br><br>Just to tell you my own personal experiences...it was a cultural shock when I went from one of the top few schools to a neighbourhood JC as I did not do well in my O levels. The ppl in my class are all very nice and friendly and I do manage to lunch with them and all. But I always get the feeling of being an outsider and it will not matter if I am not around at all. I just cannot clicked with them and it was a very lonely 2 years in JC. The type of things they are intersted in and talked about are totally different from what I used to talked about with my old classmates in secondary school.<br><br>So basically, its just a matter of different wavelength and sometimes you simply just cannot click with other ppl even though they might be friendly. But don't worry, the world is a big place and you just got to tell yourself to perserve through these 2 years and get out of JC. You will get to meet a lot more ppl after that.</div>
