            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I'll try to keep this short, I can elaborate if you want me to. Basically, I cannot seem to bond with my class. For example, I would try to socialise with the others by sitting at their table for lunch break, but, all they ever do is talk among themselves while I eat. A lot of times, I finsh eating in silence then walk away, I dont even think they noticed. It makes me feel invisible so I stopped sitting with them after a while. Then now, they still dont notice whenever I'm gone. I'm not demanding attention or anything, I just want to be part of a group that bonds together. I mean, the rest of them are fine, so it is confirmed that something is wrong with me. Is it my appearance? or my attitude? I try to be nice a lot of times. For example, this girl in my class, with whom I have a similar timetable to, I want to get to know her as a friend. Then I try to sit beside her in class. This is how she treats me: When she wants something, she is very nice, smiles and all. But when she doesn't need anything from me, she is PMS and bitchy. But when another guy, also a friend that share the similar timetable comes in, she'd ask me to move away from her so that the guy can sit beside her. Like today, I went in class with that guy friend, she looked at him, only at him, and said "You can sit beside me" That really hurt me a lot, but I try to be nice and I just move away.<br><br>That is only once example from a person. as for the class, they wont notice me when I'm gone. Not even a 'Bye!' Class activities, I am the last one to know and conversations, I have to always initiate and not be the one who gets talked to. Instead I'll be the one doing the talking to someone else just in order to seem more sociable. Honestly, I am jealous of how my other guy friends get attention from the other people. Maybe it's because they think I'm a very serious person, but I try to be a fun person and they think I've gone "mad".<br><br>I mean, it's nice to feel loved by someone else and feel that you play a part in this community. I mean, everyone else in that community seems to get along fine. It must be just me and I'm already having some problems with this. I think I'm cracking under it. I've considered taking 30 panadols after someone I wanted in a relationship rejected me. Also, i have been saying and hearing these voices of both myself and other people. Sometimes, I'd even have conversations with the voices as though they were real people. I don't want to see a doctor cause what would the rest of the class think of me when they know I'm mentally unstable? Help me please. I'm desperate. I've bought the panadol already.</div>

It takes only 20 panadols to cause you to have blood toxicity, so 30 will be fine. And the people I love, they dont love me back or else I wouldn't be putting this down. Or at least, I dont feel their love, yet I have to pretend to be happy all the time. I have done this for a lot of years already and I feel exhausted. Everytime I go into a new school, I tell myself, I have to change, but that never seems to happen. I cannot seek professional help cause I dont want people to know. I'm sorry. But I dont get your point on why "your friends dont worth the panadols"? Please explain.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When I first came to my JC, I wanted to start anew, but then I saw my old friends there so I cannot already cause I must treat them the same as the people I'm going to meet. I dare say that I've changed to become more sociable than before already. but this is not a case of whether am I sociable or not. It's about whether does anyone in the community care for you? I want to be cared for, I already miss that out from my parents. My parents only give me shelter and food, I dont even discuss with them about my personal problems. School is always "okay". You get what I mean?<br><br>I know this case is hard, but I wish someone could help me even though I know it is almost impossible. Thanks alot. I really appreciate your help and concern.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, I must go school cause no one else but me knows of this problem. Like I've said, it's like personality disorder. I treat and talk differently with people in school, at home, online etc. All differently. Also, I slipped into depression for a while when my mom beat me for a few days in a row with a bamboo pole, until the bamboo polebreak and I ran away from home. I can socialise properly in forum is different from real world. In forum I can say anything I want cause my face is hidden by my nick, but in real world I have to act happy.</div>
