            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by PlsDunBanMe:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi, I'll try to keep this short, I can elaborate if you want me to. Basically, I cannot seem to bond with my class. For example, I would try to socialise with the others by sitting at their table for lunch break, but, all they ever do is talk among themselves while I eat. A lot of times, I finsh eating in silence then walk away, I dont even think they noticed. It makes me feel invisible so I stopped sitting with them after a while. Then now, they still dont notice whenever I'm gone. I'm not demanding attention or anything, I just want to be part of a group that bonds together. I mean, the rest of them are fine, so it is confirmed that something is wrong with me. Is it my appearance? or my attitude? I try to be nice a lot of times. For example, this girl in my class, with whom I have a similar timetable to, I want to get to know her as a friend. Then I try to sit beside her in class. This is how she treats me: When she wants something, she is very nice, smiles and all. But when she doesn't need anything from me, she is PMS and bitchy. But when another guy, also a friend that share the similar timetable comes in, she'd ask me to move away from her so that the guy can sit beside her. Like today, I went in class with that guy friend, she looked at him, only at him, and said "You can sit beside me" That really hurt me a lot, but I try to be nice and I just move away.<br><br>That is only once example from a person. as for the class, they wont notice me when I'm gone. Not even a 'Bye!' Class activities, I am the last one to know and conversations, I have to always initiate and not be the one who gets talked to. Instead I'll be the one doing the talking to someone else just in order to seem more sociable. Honestly, I am jealous of how my other guy friends get attention from the other people. Maybe it's because they think I'm a very serious person, but I try to be a fun person and they think I've gone "mad".<br><br>I mean, it's nice to feel loved by someone else and feel that you play a part in this community. I mean, everyone else in that community seems to get along fine. It must be just me and I'm already having some problems with this. I think I'm cracking under it. I've considered taking 30 panadols after someone I wanted in a relationship rejected me. Also, i have been saying and hearing these voices of both myself and other people. Sometimes, I'd even have conversations with the voices as though they were real people. I don't want to see a doctor cause what would the rest of the class think of me when they know I'm mentally unstable? Help me please. I'm desperate. I've bought the panadol already.</div></blockquote>Life sucks rite?<br><br>No one wants to talk to you and u feel like killing yourself?<br><br>JC is a place where studies counts and girls usually go for the ones that are clever and smart enough.<br><br>maybe you should help others.<br><br>Try this instead of hoping your classmates to be your real friend. why not use your time to help others who are really in need?<br><br>There are many people who need help in shelters and in greater stress than you.<br><br>Call any helpline to register to help others.<br>unless you are too lazy?<br><br>JC people are well know for snobbish and think highly of themselves.<br><br>Why let this people push you down?</div>

I dare say it myself. I give my full trust and belief in the people I meet. But I need my friends to talk to. I can't speak to my parents cause we're so distant. My good friends know more of me than my parents do. And what meaningful things are there to do as a student? If I were to see children with no legs, I'd give them cash. ANimals with diseases, I'd gladly pay for their medical services even if it eats a hole in my pocket. I've always wanted to be a vet, but I dont think my current subject combi will allow me to. I dare say I have a compassionate nature that sometimes, I expect returned by other people.</div>

First thing, HOW DO YOU KNOW I'M FROM ACJC? I took great pains to keep people from knowing what JC I am inand apparently, you got it out still. Note: I even said top 5 JCs, not the 5th one. so I have no idea how you got it. Anyway, sometimes, my friends and I do talk about pets and rush into any pet shop whenever we pass one. But the thing goes back to the start, these are not true friends, they simply are going into a pet shop not because of me, but because they themselves like pets as well. What I am looking for, is just someone who is willing to OCCASIONALLY give up some of his stuff just to be a friend. Like what I would do for a good friend. I would give my life.</div>

The culture is so different. Maybe that's why I canot fit in.</div></blockquote>I think i understand what has happen, the people are the so call the bad ones who do bad things and when they see such a good kid like you thats why they siam.<br><br>This is only a training phase for you, in real life is worst, people will be nice to you and stab you behind the back.<br><br>To be in the top 5 JC is not easy, I would like to say congras to you. Maybe you should focus more on old folks and more hadicap people. I also lost my direction once and by helping them made my life more fullfilling.<br><br>No point being friends with your classmates cos they maybe the very ones who will make use of you</div>

But the thing goes back to the start, these are not true friends, they simply are going into a pet shop not because of me, but because they themselves like pets as well. What I am looking for, is just someone who is willing to OCCASIONALLY give up some of his stuff just to be a friend. Like what I would do for a good friend.

            <div class='col-md body'>Please take time and read what I have to say to you (PlsDunBanMe)<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by PlsDunBanMe:</div><div class="quote_body">Basically, I cannot seem to bond with my class. For example, I would try to socialise with the others by sitting at their table for lunch break, but, all they ever do is talk among themselves while I eat. A lot of times, I finsh eating in silence then walk away, I dont even think they noticed. It makes me feel invisible so I stopped sitting with them after a while. Then now, they still dont notice whenever I'm gone. I'm not demanding attention or anything, I just want to be part of a group that bonds together. I mean, the rest of them are fine, so it is confirmed that something is wrong with me. Is it my appearance? or my attitude? I try to be nice a lot of times.<br></div></blockquote>Hmmm... maybe you should see it in another view. It could be possible that they have already formed a clique and decided to disinclude you from their clique. All they do is talk to on another, have fun with one another and go out with one another... often without you in the picture, despite efforts trying to be grouped along with them...<br><br>Don't worry bro... It happened to me in Secondary School before... Maybe they feel that you are "too good" or the otherwise to be in their group, so they purposely ignore you though you were just sitting beside them and trying to penetrate into their clique. Sometimes, they disinclude you because you are "too good" for them... because you are being too nice in school, they feel that you are a hypocrite when you are not, and does not want you to join their clique and ruin their bonding. Most of the time, cliques reject those interested from joining is because they feel that they are "way too good" for you... they look down on you and shun you...<br><br>They are obviously ignoring you, my suggestion is not to join their clique. Don't waste your efforts, brother! If you are really that nice in school, I suggest you reaching out to the unloved ones in your school - those that are lonely and all by themselves... (other than those whom are hated for something bad they have done.) they truly need a friend! These are the ones who are potential candidates to be your friend for life... Do not call them nerds or anything bad about them, cause they are the ones who truly treasure a friendship and cherishes it. All you need to do is take the first step and be friends with them... thereby having your very own group of friends.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by PlsDunBanMe:</div><div class="quote_body">For example: this girl in my class, with whom I have a similar timetable to, I want to get to know her as a friend. Then I try to sit beside her in class. This is how she treats me: When she wants something, she is very nice, smiles and all. But when she doesn't need anything from me, she is PMS and ^%@!&amp;y. But when another guy, also a friend that share the similar timetable comes in, she'd ask me to move away from her so that the guy can sit beside her. Like today, I went in class with that guy friend, she looked at him, only at him, and said "You can sit beside me" That really hurt me a lot, but I try to be nice and I just move away.</div></blockquote>Sorry to break it to you bro... But she does not seem to like you as much as she likes 'the other guy'. She likes that guy... and makes an effort to cause him to sit beside her than letting you sit next to her... You try to get to know her better but she is trying to know that guy better, obviously she is interested in that guy...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I know and understand the pain that youare going through right now, being silently rejected because your beloved has chosen someone else besides you... I gone through the same situation as you... She does not deserve your love, so don't shower her with your love too much since she is not even receiving, do not waste your time and energy thinking about her or approaching her... You are a nice guy, such a girl with such a bad attitude is not worth chasing for... I am sure there are better girls out there...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>My suggestion is to put this matter at the back of your head, do not think too much about it. Try to sit at a place that is away from her and a place that you cannot see her and concentrate in the lecture... Do not waste your years in JC away... Girls prefer guys who are smarter... Do your best academically and outshine the other guy, prove to others that you are not only a nice guy, but you are someone smart in intellect too!<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by PlsDunBanMe:</div><div class="quote_body">That is only once example from a person. as for the class, they wont notice me when I'm gone. Not even a 'Bye!' Class activities, I am the last one to know and conversations, I have to always initiate and not be the one who gets talked to. Instead I'll be the one doing the talking to someone else just in order to seem more sociable. Honestly, I am jealous of how my other guy friends get attention from the other people. Maybe it's because they think I'm a very serious person, but I try to be a fun person and they think I've gone "mad". </div></blockquote>Wow... we really have a lot in common... Well, you have to take things easy and not think too much... you are in JC so that you can study hard and go to University! I know that it is very frustrating that no matter what you do, your actions are hardly being noticed and people do not often 'open themselves up' to you... It is not wrong being serious or nice... but it is certainly wrong trying to be fun or trying to be someone that you are not - people can detect that you are being very superficial and consider you mad. Be yourself. Be true to your personality... If you feel that people reject you because you are serious, so be it! They are missing out how nice a friend you really are...<br><br>In my previous school, I am also like you... not popular in school, silently rejected by my beloved, very hard to make friends despite how nice I am... but I stand by my principles and be the person I truly am! Only when you show the world your true self, despite how serious, how quiet or how nice you are... the world will know that you are not trying to be someone else or being a hypocrite, they will then slowly accept you... After I decided to be true to myself, only then did I start receiving more and more friends who remain true to me until now... Those cliques even the ones I see now, may seem to be very strong in their bonding but they end up going their separate ways as time comes and goes... Do not be too sad over the matter...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by PlsDunBanMe:</div><div class="quote_body">I mean, it's nice to feel loved by someone else and feel that you play a part in this community.

I've considered taking 30 panadols after someone I wanted in a relationship rejected me. Also, i have been saying and hearing these voices of both myself and other people.

I don't want to see a doctor cause what would the rest of the class think of me when they know I'm mentally unstable? Help me please. I'm desperate.

More importantly, I don't see how quantity will ever supercede quality friendships for how exactly do you keep in touch and spend quality time with 1000 friends as opposed to someone who only has 2-3 close friends?<br><br>Nevertheless, I think the chap who started this thread should realise ultimately, you shouldn't need to be somebody else to befriend someone.</div>

So cannot go poly, but I do regret coming to JC in the first place. I could have gotten into a good course in poly with my O level grades.</div></blockquote>In my opinion, u should concentrate on your studies first. A Levels are really important to your future and career prospects.<br><br>Another thing will be try or at least make a conscious effort and talk or say it to your parents be it Dad or Mum abt this problem that you have whoever u are more comfortable to. I believe that they will take their time out, sit down on the table and listen to your problems patiently. They can provide you with advices to tackle with this issue especially A Levels are around the corner. Tell them what you want or anything that they can do for you. I am certainly sure that they will be willing to assist you to tide over this ordeal.<br>If not, u can confide your problems to one of your siblings. Saying out your problems will definitely make you feel better.<br><br>Besides, when you go or NS later after your A levels, you can meet up with more frenz which perhaps one of them can be your close frenzs. Who knows? In NS especially in BMT, we have to do things together. One for All, All for One. When there is a problem with the platoon performance, everyone will make a conscious effort to enhance it. Pkus there are also some activities which tests your ability to lead, teamwork and cooperation of the team during BMT.<br><br>Next thing will be dun let the emotions control you. Ultimately, you have the control of your emotions.  A half filled cup can be viewed as half empty or half full. Cheer Up and Be happy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>
