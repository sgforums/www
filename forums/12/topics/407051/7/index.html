              <p></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I saw the govt psychiatrist, two weeks later , referred through the polyclinic.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I think govt. one is the best, the treatment/consultation is mostly government subsided ,definitely a lot cheaper, like polyclinic rates..(except for certain medications that are not under subsided list), also if you are in financial difficulties , you can approach the social workers under the govt. psychiatrist <span> </span>to waive the bills to tide u over, until u have the ability to pay the future bills.. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">so you don’t need to worry abt getting temp jobs to pay your bills, ok?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span> </span>treatment will take some time, maybe months..( years for me..) you have to be patient..</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">You have to be referred through the polyclinic in order to be govt subsided. Takes a few weeks.(u don’t <span> </span>need to be admitted immediately, only for critical cases, usually through A&amp; E dept), that's why I keep repeating u approach the polyclinic first..</span></p>

              <p><br>Thanks LonelyApple, for answering my questions.</p>
              <p>My advicing style is abit different from others, I need  to understand you in order to find out the real root cause of the hidden fear in you.</p>
              <p>After reading you answers I found this.</p>
              <p>The key point is this " maybe ive always felt inferior. "</p>
              <p>I notice this " feeling inferior " problem keep coming out. It may be your primary cause of your problem.</p>
              <p>1) Did any major  happen when you are 4 to 6 years, an event, an big embrassing incident.</p>
              <p>2) Since you are not the only child can I ask if you got any elder or younger brothers or sisters. This maybe important cos of the inferior fear in you may be cause by them in some cases I have seen.</p>
              <p>3) Star Sign Leo are people who are proud and likes to be the center of attraction,</p>
              <p>but due to their pride they are certain pit falls. If they do not have anything proud about themselves they prefer to be alone and unhappy in the heart cause others are having the main attraction. This is only the general statement of Leos it may not apply to you.</p>
              <p>4) Can you name me a place where you feel very happy about, e.g disneyland.</p>
              <p>5) Do you have any cute soft toys that you like to cuddle in bed? will explain why i ask this</p>
              <p>6) Do you like any hobbies?</p>
              <p>7) If you are in trouble who do you usually turn to? mum, dad, sister, ah ma, dog, cat?</p>

              <p>Hi LoneyApple,</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span><span>"o<span>   </span></span></span> okay, i'll find a psycologist soon:) actually, can u recommend me one? did u see a private or govt one? govt one takes a long time i heard."</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I saw the govt psychiatrist, two weeks later , referred through the polyclinic.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I think govt. one is the best, the treatment/consultation is mostly government subsided ,definitely a lot cheaper, like polyclinic rates..(except for certain medications that are not under subsided list), also if you are in financial difficulties , you can approach the social workers under the govt. psychiatrist <span> </span>to waive the bills to tide u over, until u have the ability to pay the future bills..</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">so you don’t need to worry abt getting temp jobs to pay your bills, ok?</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;"><span> </span>treatment will take some time, maybe months..( years for me..) you have to be patient..</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">You have to be referred through the polyclinic in order to be govt subsided. Takes a few weeks.(u don’t <span> </span>need to be admitted immediately, only for critical cases, usually through A&amp; E dept), that's why I keep repeating u approach the polyclinic first..</span></p>

              <p>Hello Lonelyapple, I will use the Maslow hierarchy of needs as an example. The underlying fundamental of this theory is that the basic level of the pyramid should be satisfied before a normal person like me and you can <span style="text-decoration: underline;">function-physically </span>. For example, foods and drinks to are essential for substainability. Go out to have a decent meal should be the first step you should take. </p>
              <p>To keep it short, your social anxiety problem is not an esteem problem that inflict on you. It actually falls under the love/belonging category. Your strong needs for a social group connections, siblings support or perhaps a boyfriend is crucial before you gain self-confidence and respect from others.</p>
              <p>Do seek proper help because I am not a qualified psychologist. Regards.</p>

              </span></span></p><p>When one tries to think ''positively'' or if one does so it is akin to escaping reality. It is being stubborn ( why stubborn - one sticking to limited beleifs, one's conditioning comes in, encroaches) and the wanting to only look at <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one side</span> of anything of living that causes anguish and anxiety. Anxiety is always the fear of the future or what might unfold. Anguish is the guilt of what one may have been or done which is perceived as ''wrong'' by society or even by one''s folly.</p>
              <p> However, the ignoring does not mean the other that which is ignored is going to go away or ignore one. For eg, does the rain choose where to rain? In a muddy area something undesirable (merely a perception, a prejudice) like a swamp may grow and at the same time in an open garden a rose plant (also perception, also something told to one that this or that is nice) may blossom! However, if one is accepting of the reality of both phenomena - eg hot and cold, love and fear or left and right. one is free. It is the very acceptance that frees.</p>
