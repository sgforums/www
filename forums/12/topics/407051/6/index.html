              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>since young ive been feeling nervous and tense when i'm outside.
              I can't help feeling that people are judging my every moves and i
              got really tense, so tense ..i cant relax my face, i cant smile,
              my face felt numb and this left people the impression of me
              being hostile and it offended them. this happens especially if i'm
              outside alone. when i'm with someone i'm comfortable with, i'm more
              at ease although i might still feel excessively self conscious of
              my behaviour. in the past, i did not understand this feeling. I
              just thought that people are are staring at me, i cant be myself, i
              just stay 'frozen' to the spot for example in the train. i did not
              dare to make eye contact with people because i used to think that
              they can see through me and that they know my fears and will
              despise me. i used to think that people are laughing at me even tho
              they might not have even noticed me! gosh, this feeling has been
              there for years. before i found out the terms of my 'illness' i
              actually wondered if i was abnormal and thought i was the only one
              feeling this way. i was so glad when i found out from online that
              there were many social anxiety sufferers throughout the world and
              they are really the only ones who can relate to me. i always feel
              that this anxiety is a life sentence that i will live with it
              all my life. however, i can't stand it. i read a book about a guy
              who overcame it. He was from the bacholerette-Jamie Blyth. i hope
              i'll be so determined to not admit in this failure and break free
              from this cage.</p>
              <p>i used to skip my meals because i can't go out to buy,
              for the fear is so overwhelming. there was once when i had
              panic attack. i couldn't breathe for a second. one of the
              saddest event is that i can't even sing properly in choir because
              my throat cant relax and my voice was super eerie. i've always felt
              worthless in choir.</p>
              <p>the reason why i feel extremely lonely is due to being socially
              isolated. never have someone close. i find it really hard to open
              up to people, i couldnt express my emotions and felt the need to
              hide them. i yearned for someone who can give me security. i was
              feeling lost, confused and became impulsive, wanting to kill my
              loneliness and finding security. i ended up doing silly things.</p>

              <p>to answer your questions..</p>
              <p><br><em>"are u serious? i mean u get very nervous with people? how the fuck did u overcome this shit."</em></p>
              <p>by first managing and taking control of my social anxiety/phobia problem.., takes time, many years..</p>
              <p><br>i am still on constant maintenance medication. well, for the last twelve years.. , the medication make me calm and less moody</p>
              <p><em>"like especially getting a job. it's the worst shyt. talking to the employee.....and having to perform up to the standards. the more anxious i am, the worst i performed."</em></p>
              <p>I had a very tough time, i didn't stay on long at perm/temp jobs at first,  by trial and error.. until the current one, i still working for them for 7 yrs..(Social Anxiety disorder is a type of mental illness, not many employers can accept, it better not to tell at all)</p>

              <p>the reason why i havent seen a psycologist is bcus i'm afraid i dont know what to say to her. i'm so bad at expressing myself. and i cant decide whether i should take medications.</p>
              <p>sometimes i feel so 'frozen', i cant concentrate at all. Like in class.. or trying to shop for things, i couldnt make a decision, and sometimes people ask for my opinion, all i say is I Dont Know. i just dont know. And i feel so dizzy.</p>
              <p>i'm trying to do more part time job to gain exposure and use the money to boost my self-esteem. and maybe i'll see a psycologist.</p>
              <p>yea who would accept someone with this anxiety. i'll nv tell employers abt it. esp part time jobs.... tt's why i have to pretend like a normal person. but they could tell tt i was nervous. and kicked me off the next day.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">When the psychiatrist have assessed your problems, he will then decide whether you need medication and/or just therapy</span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Hi LoneyApple,</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Tell your anxiety problem in details to you close friend/family member u can trust, then ask him/her to follow u to see the psychiatrist/psychologist, that way yr friend can explain clearly about yr problem to them in case u have trouble explaining ..</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">When the psychiatrist have assessed your problems, he will then decide whether you need medication and/or just therapy</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">The constant stress u experienced from yr anxiety everyday will wear u down soon, in my case I withdrawn and hide in the house for comfort, and serious anxiety sufferer like me then to avoid the places that make me anxious, but the house soon become a prison for me, lock up by my own fear.., you don’t want that to happen to u..</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 10pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">I think it best u don’t try temp job first.. deal with the anxiety problem first ..</span></p>

              <p>nah. nobody understands me. i wouldnt talk to anybody abt it. they dont understand the shit. its humiliating at the same time. everything i do, i do it alone without anybody knowing. i dont have anybody close. tt is why i'm Lonely. i cant open up to anybody.</p>
              <p>i have a hard time working especially in service line. but i dont have a choice. i need money for many things. im really broke due to my impulsiveness.</p>
              <p>(better not rant too much)</p>
              <p>okay, i'll find a psycologist soon:) actually, can u recommend me one? did u see a private or govt one? govt one takes a long time i heard.</p>
