              <p>i did. i went one day to polyclinic and asked doctor if i have depression. obviously i dont. he referred me to a psychiatrist but then nv got any answer.. den i thought whats the point of gg too. whats the use of a psychiatrist. they'll probably be no difference as the counsellor. maybe give pills. idk. counsellor doesnt work much tho. they dont understand at all. sigh.</p>
              <p>i believe god is the answer.</p>

              <p>Ts,</p>
              <p>Understand this lah, the sooner the better - both psychiatry and therapy is  window dressing - ie to make u fit with society and what is deemed (defined) by society as 'normal"</p>
              <p>However, it does not free one of one's predicament.</p>
              <p> I say find or reconcile to this ideas of what eg love should be, what life should be and when u have transcended u will be connected to what you are.</p>
              <p>The problem is that there is a crowd (voice) within u - eg, what is life, ur mother, ur school , tv all give u ideas - now it is whirpool and hence the anxiety the fear. Inner voice means that which is original that which is of u and u alone. It is not easy but being silent it may dawn in u.</p>
              <p>U say god could be the answer. It is healthy and wise but somewhere along the way, midstream one has to eschew this attachment to ""GOD""  and be free and yet live.</p>
              <p>One never finds god in a temple, church or ... if does not connect to what is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">divine within (</span>love and being free). It has to emanate from within FIRST!</p>

              <p>i dont understand what you mean....seeing a shrink to make me fit into the society? ????? what does this mean. not like im autistic or having that kinda mental illness...-.-</p>

              <p>My feeling is that you are perceived as being ''abnormal'' by your own sense of what u think of yourself (aslo your conditioning, your programming, the definitions, the conceptualised models of .....) or others around make you or perceive u to be ''abnormal''. I am not privy to what transpired or what you go thru - <strong>being self-honest</strong> may help you understand.</p>
              <p>Shrinks - why they are labelled as shrinks lah? - simply cos they <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">shrink u</span></strong> (mind is suppressed)and try to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">make u fit to what is perceived as socially acceptable</span></strong> - eg, if society defines a successful family as having two kids, a dog, a house a car as complete anyone who subsribes to such a definition would n ot feel complete. The anxiety of being able to meet that standard/norm would gnaw into one's mind and being. Hence the misery. However, this (anxiety/anguish/hopelessness) can only come about if one conforms, one suppresses what one innately feels <strong>differently </strong>about definitions/ideas of success .... . So in a way a shrinks shrinks u lah. Suppression is unhealthy - it does not go away and will surface, Some cover up and suffer some simply conform and feel lousy. Of course, it is nigh impossible to deny oneself , one's heart.</p>
              <p>As for voices - eg, If i were to tell you that love must have certain traits like ... - and if u or anyone embraces or makes into a belief - it becomes a part of oneself. It is no longer the voice within oneself but another's eclipsing yours (the beleif, the idea ....). <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Parental, societal, religious and political voices</span></strong> do encroach on us - just too bad, many seem oblivious and simply follow. When it is mentioned that one should follow the heart - it means and it must be that has none of the above voices interfering. Otherwise it is not one but so many voices that conflict and hence one is drained or simply feels divided.</p>
              <p>The wise would reconcile this dichotomy of mind and heart.  I<strong>ntegrating</strong> heart and mind and living is freeing. It is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">inward process</span></strong>, nothing outside can help excepting superficial gestures.</p>

              <p>LoneyApple, sometimes the polyclinic appointment system can cock up. The polyclinic sees thousands of patients everyday, sometimes some slip through the appointment system, it happens, so u have to be proactive, and call back to check. I think you should try again, for your own sake.  it's nothing wrong to see a doctor and take medication/therapy if you are not feeling well or sick(minor or serious). The point is to get better/well..</p>
              <p>unless through sheer will, you recover on your own.. then that is good..</p>
              <p>i hope what i said can point u in the right direction..</p>

              <p>i tried going to church recently.what i hated most is the singing part. becus i cant sing when im nervous, and not singing makes me even more anxious...while others are singing i was trembling not knowing where to look and just cant wait for this whole damn singing to be over. (tt's the worst shit of going to church) although i manage to not feel that anxious during the rest of the service when the pastor preached.</p>

              <p>i used to skip my meals because i can't go out to buy,
              for the fear is so overwhelming. there was once when i had
              panic attack. i couldn't breathe for a second. one of the
              saddest event is that i can't even sing properly in choir because
              my throat cant relax and my voice was super eerie. i've always felt
              worthless in choir.</p>
              <p>the reason why i feel extremely lonely is due to being socially
              isolated. never have someone close. i find it really hard to open
              up to people, i couldnt express my emotions and felt the need to
              hide them. i yearned for someone who can give me security. i was
              feeling lost, confused and became impulsive, wanting to kill my
              loneliness and finding security. i ended up doing silly things.</p>

              <p>like to ask a few questions..</p>
              <p>Do you have panic attacks when in crowded places, like school, shopping malls, bus interchange, the markets? and if the place is very noisy, does it makes you even more nervous?</p>
              <p>After the panic attacks happen, do you stay at home only for days, or even months??</p>
              <p>Do you avoid going to school, church, shopping mall, markets sometimes even if you really want to go out because you are so nervous??</p>

              <p>it's lucky that i only had panic attack once. yes i get reallly nervous when there are many many people especially in town areas becus i feel overwhelmed by those rich and gd looking ppl.  but even at markets i feel nervous. i use to not dare to go to the market, i would just skip my meals.</p>
              <p>u noe,, school used to be hell to me. it was a torture.</p>
              <p>nevertheless, i have to act as though nothing is wrong with me. that  is why i force myself to go out alone, go wherever even if im nervous, i just put on a fake front because i cant let people noe that i have this stupid anxiety. (tt's why ppl always have the wrong idea of me. they thought i was stuck up or just a Weirdo)</p>
              <p>do u noe how scary it is to go to the school foodcourt, i feel extremely tensed up.</p>
              <p>i feel very dizzy due to my anxiety. only when i hide in the cubicle, i feel so relieved. i just wish i could hide there forever sometimes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>does this help you to understand? ask me more if u want. but ppl think i can just snap out of it. just go and search youtube or google this stupid anxiety... there are tons of ppl suffering. and they cant snap out of it too. i'm trying but not hard enuff i  noe.</p>

              <p>Hi lonelyapple</p>
              <p>just trying to help here.</p>
              <p>I need to dig a bit in order to find the root of your problem.</p>
              <p>Seems it is cos by by a problem of certain kind of fear that is causing you to react this way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Did something happen to you when you were young that cos you to dislike crowded area?</p>
              <p>2) " i feel overwhelmed by those rich and gd looking ppl. " humm everyone is created differently, why do you feel that people who are rich and gd looking people will look down on you?</p>
              <p>3) Did you parents dis-allowed you from mixing around when you are around. e.g. locking you up at home and not allowing you to go out to play.</p>
              <p>4) Are you bullied when you are in school or playground?</p>
              <p>5) Are you the only child?</p>
              <p>6) What is your star sign? Leo? Virgo?</p>
              <p>7) If you have to go for an outing with friends, which type of friends do you perfer to go out with?</p>

              <p>Hi LoneyApple,</p>
              <p>i reply to your thread becos i can relate to what's happening to u.</p>
              <p> i have suffered from social anxiety disorder too, sometimes it is just a little nervousness and sometimes, it will get very bad, with bad panic attacks, like having a heart attack.</p>
              <p> in my case, at one point, i refuse to get out of my house for 1 and half year before i reach near breaking point, before i finally admit to myself i needed help, it's that or i am going crazy.(my parents are lowly educated, they don't know what is social anxiety disorder..)</p>
              <p>if you went to the polyclinic and the doctor said u were not depressed, doesn't mean u don't have a social anxiety disorder(they are two different disorder), i would nag the doctor until he/she give a referral if i were u..(why? becos i have a real problem), they will call u to tell u the appointment date and venue after a few day becos polyclinic have way too many patients to see at times.., u have to follow the queue. if they don't call back within a week. call to the polyclinic to check again and confirm they have made an appointment for u.</p>
              <p>it's your own health at stake here. u owe it to yourself to get better..</p>
              <p>Seeing the psychiatrist was the first step for me to recovery</p>
              <p>it's true sometimes medication and social therapy can only do so much..(we need put in some effort ourselves), it's effectiveness varies from individuals to individuals. but for me, it gives me the ability get back on my feet, the ability to lead a reasonable normal life.. i hope it can do the same for you too..</p>
              <p>please seek help soon before it get too serious.. when you suffer, so do your family too.</p>
              <p>good luck..</p>

              <p>i tried going to church recently.what i hated most is the singing part. becus i cant sing when im nervous, and not singing makes me even more anxious...while others are singing i was trembling not knowing where to look and just cant wait for this whole damn singing to be over.

              <p>I understand how you feel, some church, their singing is very dramatic. Some raise up their hands and some people start dancing. Sometime, people so excited they start speaking strange tongue. If you are not use to this then you should seek a church whereby their singing is more conservative and not too pentecostal. Don't worry about your singing, most people at church don't sing well anyway, they only concern with their devotion not how well they sing. Even if you sing badly, you sing in big congregation so nobody can hear you. It is like at school you sing the national anthem.</p>
              <p>Since you are young, you can get involve in the church youth or church young adults. They got a lot of special activities, it is your chance to get to know more people and make friends. Take the initiative, don't be scared. If you feel nervous then go more often, after some time you will  get used to it. Don't be shy, this is your life, start taking control of your life. Be bold and brave. Sometimes we get rejected but if we strive we will make new friends.</p>

              <p>I understand how you feel, some church, their singing is very dramatic. Some raise up their hands and some people start dancing. Sometime, people so excited they start speaking strange tongue. If you are not use to this then you should seek a church whereby their singing is more conservative and not too pentecostal. Don't worry about your singing, most people at church don't sing well anyway, they only concern with their devotion not how well they sing. Even if you sing badly, you sing in big congregation so nobody can hear you. It is like at school you sing the national anthem.</p>
              <p>Since you are young, you can get involve in the church youth or church young adults. They got a lot of special activities, it is your chance to get to know more people and make friends. Take the initiative, don't be scared. If you feel nervous then go more often, after some time you will  get used to it. Don't be shy, this is your life, start taking control of your life. Be bold and brave. Sometimes we get rejected but if we strive we will make new friends.</p>

              <p>I need to dig a bit in order to find the root of your problem.</p>
              <p>Seems it is cos by by a problem of certain kind of fear that is causing you to react this way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Did something happen to you when you were young that cos you to dislike crowded area?</p>
              <p>2) " i feel overwhelmed by those rich and gd looking ppl. " humm everyone is created differently, why do you feel that people who are rich and gd looking people will look down on you?</p>
              <p>3) Did you parents dis-allowed you from mixing around when you are around. e.g. locking you up at home and not allowing you to go out to play.</p>
              <p>4) Are you bullied when you are in school or playground?</p>
              <p>5) Are you the only child?</p>
              <p>6) What is your star sign? Leo? Virgo?</p>
              <p>7) If you have to go for an outing with friends, which type of friends do you perfer to go out with?</p>

              <p>since young, i have been feeling this : ppl staring at my every moves. but not when i was born, i guess it started around the age of 4 -6 yr old.  maybe ive always felt inferior. .nah i'm allowed to play with anybody just that i was shy. and i was never bullied never an outcast. and im not the only child. uhm why do you ask about my horoscope? it's leo.</p>
              <p>regarding the type of friends i prefer.... i think i dont know. i havent really mix around for years. (sigh) it suck.</p>
