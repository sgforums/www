              <p>Larry, no matter how depressed you feel, I am sure you will have hopes and dreams. There is no such thing as 'no desire' in anyone. Even monks who claim to have 'no desire' actually desires and aspires for something - to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HAVE</span></strong> no desire.</p>
              <p>What more us common people?</p>
              <p>It is our desires that will give us meaning and purpose to LIVE - so as to achieve those desires.</p>
              <p>And mankind knows not contendment. When a man makes a million, he will want another million. When a man becomes a supervisor, he will want to be a manager. Desires never end.</p>
              <p>And for those who are contented, and aspires nothing more, nor are ambitious anymore would mean they had found their meaning and purpose in life. They had achieve their aims and seek nothing more, other than a peaceful existance with what they have.</p>
              <p>Therefore Larry, what are your rational desires? And what have you done to achieve it? If you have none, then you already have found your meaning and know contendment, need not seek for something that is already found.</p>

              <p><br>Hi <a href="http://sgforums.com/users/259149">Larryteo</a></p>
              <p>You mentioned earlier that you'd feel depressed in one moment and deeply uplifted the next. Well, truth be told, I am like you too. That's my personality. One moment my friends will be sitting around me and I will be laughing and cracking so much jokes, and the next I just totally stopped talking to them. The reason? Deep down, I am a "quiet" person. In fact, I spent more quiet times alone, although they can be bored sometimes. Friends who aren't close to me see me as outgoing, popular and good-natured. But my cliques know I'm not that kind of person. They know that I'm the quietest amongst them. That's why they say I have a "split personality". Some even suggested that when I'm funny, I'm real funny and when I'm dull, I'm a real boring person.</p>
              <p>You said you hardly meet up with your friends during the school holidays. That problem...isn't merely limited to you. Maybe the problem is because you and your friends don't enjoy doing a specific common thing. For me, my problem lies in that my cliques are the very noisy and extroverted types, they laugh and make all kinds of din in public. That's why I feel I don't fit in with them despite always hanging out with them, although we all do get along very well. However, I DO have 2 friends who kind of have the same thinking and enjoy doing the same things I do. We like to talk about stuff that my cliques don't. In fact, the 2 best friends I have are more mature than my cliques and more adventurous.. We do things like trying to sneak up into the roof top of a building when I was 13 (and got caught by the management!).</p>
              <p>To me, that's fun. And there's meaning to life because these 2 friends of mine always find enjoyable activities that we are keen in doing. But then when you do feel lowdown, you may try activities like biking or go kite-flying. I always do that during my lower sec holidays and when you find something that's really fun and best still, find people who enjoy the same stuff as you, you'd think life's amazing.</p>
              <p>Alternatively, you can try listening to music to while the time away.</p>

              <p>I am troubled by this thought.. what is the meaning and purpose of life? Am I really alive? Or is my life just an illusion..? Why is it that I am no longer as happy as I was in the past? I got money to spend, food to eat, but I am not happy. I feel very sad especially when it is the school holidays now. What should I do? I feel very lonely. I have not talked to anyone from school on MSN or anywhere else for many weeks now..</p>

              <p>And I guess our meaning and purpose of life is to get married and create more life and pass down our wisdom so that they too can carry on to multiply their own meaning and purpose of their lives.</p>
