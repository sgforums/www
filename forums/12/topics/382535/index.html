              <p>Hi LarryTeo,</p>
              <p>This is a very common question, but you will have to find the answer within yourself. Only you can make meaning out of your own life, and find your own purpose/reason for living. </p>
              <p>You may be suffering from mild depression, and if you leave it be, it can get worse.</p>
              <p>Since, it is the school holidays now, perhaps you will like to ask your friends out with you for an outing or to visit certain places and have fun. You can also choose to do some voluntary work and meet some new friends.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p><span class="quote">The dog said, "That's too long to be barking. Give me ten years and I'll give you back the other ten." </span><span class="quote">So God agreed. <br><br>On the second day God created the monkey. God said, "Entertain people, do monkey tricks and make them laugh. I'll give you a twenty-year life span." </span></p>
              <p><span class="quote">The monkey said, "Monkey tricks for twenty years? I don't think so. Dog gave you back ten, so that's what I'll do too, okay?" </span><span class="quote">And God agreed. <br><br>On the third day God created the cow. "You must go to the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves, and give milk to support the farmer. I will give you a life span of sixty years." </span></p>
              <p><span class="quote">The cow said, "That's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years. Let me have twenty and I'll give back the other forty." </span><span class="quote">And God agreed again. <br><br>On the fourth day God created man.

              <p><span class="quote">Man said, "What? Only twenty years? Tell you what, I'll take my twenty, and the forty the cow gave back, and the ten the monkey gave back, and the ten the dog gave back, that makes eighty, okay?" Okay," said God, "You've got a deal." <br><br>So that is why the first twenty years we eat, sleep, play, and enjoy ourselves; the next forty years we slave in the sun to support our family; the next ten years we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren; and the last ten years we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone. <br><br>Life has now been explained to you. </span></p>

              <p>People don't usually think so much about the meaning of life unless they're feeling lost and/or down, and it seems to have become just that for you.  You could be tired of your environment, routine, or social rituals.. perhaps all your life you've always been told what to do, what is right and what to become.. and now you're starting to ask 'why'.. maybe you feel like no one else understands, and that you'll be mocked (is that why you're avoiding your friends at school and MSN?).. and when you think about it you wonder if you can truly trust anybody.</p>
              <p>Everyone is different, even if they seem to prefer to follow.  You're alone most of the time now, spend some time thinking about all the things you love best, and what you want out of life. When you start asking the right questions, you'll answer your own questions, everything will start to fall into place and life will go on.  :-)</p>

              <p>Stop thinking and wondering what life is all about. You will never figure it out. You just need to do things. And slowly have a goal for the next five years.</p>
              <p>Start by doing something small.</p>
              <p>Say, that this week you will ______________________. Try something simple and easy. Do this week after week, then go on to something more bigger or complex. You should slowly advance till you are thinking to yourself that you will accomplish something in the next six months. It can be an adventure, travel, or learning French.</p>
              <p>This will train you to set goals. You develop your mind to think far ahead.</p>
              <p>Your problem is that your future is a blank. You need to map out your future. Start the training now.</p>

              <p>Alas, how many of us ever seriously think about the death especially the dying process ie how do one face death when death is imminent, together with the inability to even walk, eat or pass motion or urinate or speak and the unbearbale pain and great discomfort that the doctors no longer can help with medication or treatments ?</p>

              <p>well. I did. when I was working in the hospital last year. I had seen many deaths, people died as early as just born, 12, 15 , 21.... to old age. I had seen people struggling in chemotherapy for 3, 5 years at the end they still died. Some of my friends also have already died 2 years ago. The fact is we are nothing more than a pile of meat.</p>
              <p>Perhaps, I think too much.</p>

              <p>I am troubled by this thought.. what is the meaning and purpose

              is it that I am no longer as happy as I was in the past? I got
              money to spend, food to eat, but I am not happy. I feel very sad
              especially when it is the school holidays now. What should I do? I
              feel very lonely. I have not talked to anyone from school on MSN or

              <p>There is no "intrinsic" meaning of life. Life has different meanings to different people. Once you have lost the meaning for your existence, what you need to do is to create "the meaning of life" for yourself.</p>
              <p>Not "find the meaning of life", CREATE "the meaning of life" for yourself.</p>
              <p>Why do you think people have hobbies, get married, have a career, have affairs, join a religious organisation.... they are creating the meaning of life for themselves.</p>

              <p>Hi Lokey,</p>
              <p>Answers to questions such as this rarely presents themselves overnight. It may take you a year, or maybe even ten, to know what you truly want for yourself.</p>
              <p>But for the time being, the best thing to do is to move on in life, and slowly search for it.</p>
