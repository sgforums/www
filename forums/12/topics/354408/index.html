            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Some time ago , i work for this company as a mascot for an event at marina square. upon reaching the place and since it was my firstday, i met the person in charge and she brought me to this room which was behind our booth</p>
              <p>She told us to place all our belongings there. after that i went out to do my job.After i finish my work, i went back to the room to check my handphone however i found out that my bag was lost/stolen.</p>
              <p>So the question i want to ask u is that can i claim back this money from the small claim tribunal since when i ask my supervisor, she said that the company was not responsible for my lost. However i believe that they are responsible as they ask me to put all my belongings in there and my bag was with all my other friends belongings but surprisingly only my bag was stolen and the total amount of belongings that was inside the bag that was lost was about $1400.Therefore i guys, i realy need your advice on this matter.</p>
              <p>thanks in advance :)</p>

              <p>You just need to learn to look out for yourself when you're
              outside. Treat this as a lesson because there is no way to recover
              your lost possessions.</p>

              <p>i already did that, but the cctvs are a real joke man. when the police brought us to the security viewing room, they found out that the cctv which was directly in front of the room was not actually facing the area. they were facing another area -.-</p>

              <p>u may, if it helps.<br><br>but the more important lesson is to not leave your belongings, valuables especially unattended and not under lock &amp; key. <br><br>even a police report wouldn't help in this case. u got IMEI of your hp?</p>
