Think about this, if lets say he is childish - an aspect that could be discover even as a friend, unlike possessiveness where only being together would reveal it, in the first place why did you accepted him? In any case - your heart falls for him, but your mind hasn't been subdue yet. You thought of the time spent together - wow, its one year and feel reluntant to release this relation. Yes, I know you do love him for who he is, but the mental barrier is still there and you don't realise it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>His possessiveness is choking you and you feel breathless. Since now he already break with you - he initiated the break, the argument is the catalysis that sparks this break - which means you are single now and seeking for people's advice if you should ask for a patch or be heartless and kick him out of your vision forever and ever - one good solution is to *wait* and see if he does anything since he is the one who initiated the break. If he feels that it was partially his fault for the raging argument and comes back apologising and wants you back - and *IF YOU* also wants back the relation - this is what you MUST do.<br><br>1) Psycho and influence and *prevent* youself from having this thoughts - he is childish because he is younger than me. In your mental unconsciousness - you have to also accept him, not just your consciousness. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>2) Communicate and let him know that he is possessive. After letting him know, speak and work out a solution together. If he still insist on his own way of thinking and working, say goodbye to him - he is not willing to compromise - an essential in a relation - so nothing could stop you from leaving except good memories.<br><br>For example: Maybe can go clubbing once a month, go out with cousins and classmate is alright, at times when have to come home late when bo bian one its ok, since you don't do it everyday, kind of thing.<br><br>He *has* to realise that what he is doing is killing this relationship - then only with proper workable solution can the relation gradually improve and grow like its potential could allow it to be. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
