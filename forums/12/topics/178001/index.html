            <div class='col-md body'>Eh want to call cops on them then call la.. dont do things halfway.<br>In the end people will just think you dont have the guts to do it.<br><br>BUT seriously, I remember going to a chalet with my friends when I was 14. I invited 2 friends of my own there, sons of my parents' good friends. And my other friends invited THEIR friends.<br><br>And some of their friends were drinking and gambling (like in all chalets), oh yes, smoking too. Honestly, I wouldn't have really cared. I dont drink, gamble or smoke, but I have friends who are perfectly great people who do. BUT guess what?<br><br>My friends CALLED their parents, complained about this, and in the end... ALL THE PARENTS (6 of them) came down to my chalet to see what's it about. ONE of the parents was a teacher in my school too. I thought that was a really shitassed thing to do at that time. And I still think so now, more than 10 years down the road. It was prissy.<br><br>I think you overreacted. Regards the toothpaste, your friends played a practical joke on you, that's all. Who doesn't play these jokes during chalet? I thought it was quite mild. The uninvited person does not speak for ALL your friends, so why should you flare up cos of what he said or do? You lost control of your temper over a small issue, and that's the reality of it. If I were you, I would apologise to your friends for losing your temper, but explain that it was the guy that really made u pissed. Or else, you will not just lose their respect, but their friendship too.</div>
