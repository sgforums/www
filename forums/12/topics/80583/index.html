            <div class='col-md body'>actually, it's also not wrong to be insatisfied with so many opportunities. As we grow up in life, we have different desires, different needs, and different wants. From young, we want someone who can take care of us, that's our dear mother, later our soulmate are friends who around us.. then we want someone we can try a relationship with, when we meet our 'first love'. Then we want someone whom we think we can be married with and settle down for life. Then sometimes we realise, there's someone else who can treat us better. As mortality is decreasing with the advancement of science, I would say that it's hard to stay with a partner and not change your heart for the whole 50 to 70 years...<br><br>Even then, our friends would come and go... Somewhere I heard on a radio, we will always have friends forever, but not always have forever friends.<br><br>Rather than brood over what is missing in our life, why can't we be happy that we have this moment to spend with the grass which we feel is the best?? At least you know that it's a time well spent, and you'll be happier, rather than being bogged down to find the ultimate soulmate, which is taking your happiness by failing to find it. Whether this grass is the most beautiful or not at the end, but at least you have cherish the moment it's in your hands.</div>

Even it is not, at least do whatever you can when you still have the blade of grass with you. At the end of the day, even if it slips away, you can tell yourself you have tried to save it, and not having to regret blaming yourself that you should have done this or that. Life's is an actual play with no re-runs, when the moment is over then it's gone forever.</div>
