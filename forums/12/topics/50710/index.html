It helped that I had people around me who knew what i was going through. Spent time with them so wont feel so empty. It's really like readjusting your time since in the past, the spare time is spent with significant him. I had to rework my time lor. Stayed away from sad2 songs. I moved on and was over it in a year (we progressed to a pt of talking about even marriage).<br><br>You can do it too!! </div></blockquote>I hope I'll be like u in e near future too...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
