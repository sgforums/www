            <div class='col-md body'>Hi spear, I am going through the same state that you are in.<br><br>Like many others have said, you can't forget, you have to live with it and learn from the relationship.<br><br>It is just like a scar when you have wounded, with the one that you love, that scar will always be there.<br><br>Remember, life is more than just her. Same fate I am in, I am still trying to forget but I guess the only way is to keep yourself busy. Go out and socialize. Take this time to do the things that you have always wanted to do but never have the time for it. Now is the time.<br><br>Take a step at a time, don't leave those things that bring memories lying around, try to keep them one at a time. Get a fresh start and concentrate on your career or studies. Stay focus on that.<br><br>If neither of those work, there are always counsellors to talk to. It may be good to talk it out to them or your close friends. They may be able to help you to a certain extent, but to move on, its all in your hands.<br><br>Thats all I have for you.<br><br>Do take care.<br><br>Have a good day.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you can never forget someone who has made such a big impact on your life. i too can never forget that special someone. even more so when she hurt me countless times and i just forgave and forget. she is the one i love the most but hurts me the most. thru her words and actions i've learned to be more tolerant. maybe if she showed more attention and concern to me it might not happen. now she's distancing herself from me. i really L L but to follow her wishes. somewhere down inside me i am feeling very aggravated and betrayed by her actions. but yet i still feel something for her.<br>you just have to get thru it on your own. things are always like this the recieveing end always gets the most impact of the blow. i don't know if this helps as i really need help on my own. try to think of things objectively and just do it. hopefully it will help numb yur pain.</div>
