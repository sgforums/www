She wants to criticise every single thing you do. It makes her feel happy. And she is not very loving. Would loving girls do that? Luckily you are not married yet. Girls have very good memories when it comes to r/s issues, especially what you did and did not do.<br><br>How long has it been this way? And you ask her how to make her feel happy. That is called begging. You ask her what it is exactly that you do that is wrong. Then you ask her to show you the "right" way.<br><br>Hope it helps.</div>
