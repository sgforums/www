Done alot of stupid things after we broke up. been in a few relationships after her. But will break up after a short while because I am unable to forget her. I am still unable to forget her after all these years. no amount of beer or cigarettes will ease the pain and agony.<br><br>I would try out ways and means to find out news about her. But its hard to do so because I had broken off all connections with our friends. I still have her house number, though I am not sure if its changed. I never got to call her because of all the foolish things I had done.<br><br>What will you do?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ironically, one of the best solutions is to look the girl up, and try to be friends again. Do not do it with the intention of getting her back, do it with the intention of sewing the rift between the both of you.<br><br>There'll be great chance you'll still want to be with her if you've made it to be on talking terms again... But if you have to let go, you just have to. Some things just weren't meant to happen - like why the moon never collides into Earth and just floats endlessly round it...<br><br>Someday, you'll know why she wasn't meant for you... but for now, just hold on to hope on yourself. =)<br><br>Choosing to blurt your feelings out here would indicate that you are strong enough to let your problems be known and that you seek help... Now all you need is to be strong enough to pull yourself through!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I ever had a 4 years relationship which I broke off years ago. I would indeed be happy if he will still remember me. Hey, someone out there is thinking of me! However, I know we were not meant for each other. The past has to be left behind no matter how sweet it had been. Life is not just make up of sweetness but bitterness as well. If you are able to focus yourself in the new relationship, it will equally blossom.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
