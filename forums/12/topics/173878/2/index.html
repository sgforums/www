From my experience, during the teenage years, guys seem to mature a bit slower than girls, hence most of them act in the rough way to get girl's attention. But give them a few years, and they will soon become gentlemanly  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>And don't just judge guys based on those in your school la. Shud go out and meet more people, from all age range, and you will see that there are hopes for guys after all  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

And you've not seen some of the things that girls can do to guys. So no point resolving to gender bashings? All I can say is when you're an a$shole, you're one. When you're not, you're not. Nothing to do with gender.</div>
