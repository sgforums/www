So if you treat a girl just as a friend, go easy on the smiles and stare ok?<br><br>If you don't like a girl who likes you, break it to her gently.<br><br>If a girl starts avoiding you after you reject her, leave her alone for a while. If you still treat her as a friend, talk to her.<br><br>Girls enjoy talking about what they feel. Music, poetry, drawings and writing are ways of expressing themselves (which explains why most girls like writing journals).<br><br>Never tell a girl that she is useless in anyway.<br><br>Being too serious can turn a girl off.<br><br>When the boy she likes calls her for the first time, the girl may act uninterested during the call. But as soon as the phone is back on the hook, she will whoop with joy and immediately start telephoning her friends to spread the news.<br><br>A smile means a lot to a girl.<br><br>If you like a girl, try making friends with her first. Let her get to know you.<br><br>If a girl says she can't go out with you because she has to study, leave.<br><br>But if she still calls you or expect a call from you, stay.<br><br>Don't try to guess a girl's feelings. Ask her.<br><br>Hearing the words "I ♥ you" is a great reassurance to a girl that she is beautiful.<br><br>After a girl falls in love with a guy, she'll wonder why she never noticed him before.<br><br>If you need tips on how to flirt with a girl, read romance stories.<br><br>When class pictures come out, a girl would first check who is standing next to her crush before actually looking at herself.<br><br>A girl's ex-crush will always be in her memory, but the boy she loves now stays in her heart.<br><br>Girls love having fun!<br><br>A simple 'Hi' can brighten a girl's day.<br><br>A girl's best friends usually knows best what she is feeling and going through.<br><br>Girls hate it when a guy pays attention to them just to get close to their 'prettier' friend.<br><br>Love means devotion, caring and happiness to a girl, in this order.<br><br>Some girls care about looks, some care about brains, but ALL girls want a boy who will love and care for them. </div></blockquote>Wah, power info sia, where did you get that?
