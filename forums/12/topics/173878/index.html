            <div class='col-md body'>xinyi!, i m afraid u are doomed to lead a single life u carry on with the expectations. U are looking for the perfect gentleman. Let me tell ya, there is no such thing. The jerks and brats are the real gentleman because they know how to survive in the environment . If lead in the right way, they will progress.<br><br>A nerd can survive too, but think again, a nerd is a nerd. At least he has money he can still find a wife. beautiful too....Both types can find women no problem. As long the uglier ones have cash. But for women, only beauty matters most for these men to choose them...not money or cash...<br><br>Likewise, a gentleman will look for a lady. This probably where the bad news comes in. There are lots of beautiful ladies around for him to choose but there is only a few gentlemen (according to your own version) to choose from for u. <strong>The competition is going to be intense. The most good looking suave, macho guys will also be looking for the most attractive, sexy, feminine women. Do u have what it takes to even compete? The well off guys can choose and dream of a beautiful damsel. Can u?</strong></div>
