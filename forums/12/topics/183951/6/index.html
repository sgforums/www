The company pays for your services and time. So during your working hours it's officially belongs to them, so doing personal stuff while during working hours is 'prohibited'. Your supervisor scold you cuz you openly bend these rules. Please do them discreetly in future mew~  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>

Work Attachments are, largely speaking, an absolute waste of time. They generally benefit neither the student (who is not trusted to do any real work and who is paid very lowly) nor the employer (who gets a seriously unmotivated young man/woman who would rather be doing something else). Can't see why the charade is played out year after year after year.<br><br>That said, if you are really bored and feel under-utilized, you can always ask for greater responsibilites. I suspect you will not do that though, so stop complaining.</div>
