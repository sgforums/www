And fyi, there aren't too many lady-like women too. I do not wish to start an argument about gender, nor do I wish to be on the receiving end of endless brickbats from the opposite sex. Just clarifying that in this day and age, not many people retain acts of chivalry or social graces.<br><br>Unfortunately, as much as it is not your intention to do so, nor would not like to be seen as doing so, you are indeed generalizing with your post, you know. Ending a relationship 'professionally' is subjective: how professional is professional? What seems professional to one party might not seem like it to another.<br><br>And also, people are prone to being brittle when it comes to relationship.

But women have blurred the lines... we now want careers, sometimes take feminism abit too far (like getting offended at men who open doors for us, expect men to share domestic chores, .  This means men are forced to come out of their "safe zones" .. and this safe zone is something they've grown accustommed to over hundreds of years.<br><br>Women wanting rights isn't a bad thing, but we've gotta be fair to the guys too.. not just take swift advantage of our newly-recovered rights like a gloating, big-headed child prefect - the bar has been raised suddenly, and most men are left confused and angry.  <strong>Guys just no longer get the same respect from women for carrying out their traditional roles, it's confusing for them, and it's a big blow to their manly ego - It's like 'Hey, I was happy with the old roles.. it was working fine before, I was doing very well before u started getting all these ideas... so why change?  I'm not too sure about this arrangement and I don't know what I'm doing wrong... '</strong><br><br>Some guys I've spoken with also seem to think NS is one of the contributing factors to why guys have fallen behind (socially).  "Eh.... 2 years away of NS is no joke," a male colleague of mine raved, "Most guys come out of camp a different person.  Just imagine lah, everyday in an all-male camp..unless you very lucky kena post to , where got time for social life.. then army pay like f***.. somemore come out from camp must spend time re-adjust to "normal" life.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, I think frankly its all in the male ego thing lah. Physically we guys are strong...but emotionally. Ha, we aren't tt capable inside. I mean when I broke up, other then coming here to pour my sorrows, I also turned to my female friends. feel that females are much much much more stronger then us guys emotionally, and when why do we fall in love? Other then the thought of getting laid, its coz we feel that we feel that we've found someone of whom we can make an emotional connection with. So yeah...</div>
