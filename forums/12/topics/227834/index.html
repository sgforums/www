            <div class='col-md body'>hm.. i guess bcuz now men and women are equal le loh.. but still in the process of courting a gal.. the gal still got many priviledges such as guy shld pay for the gal cannot any touch if not molest or rape zz. den if gal dun permit guy also cannot force. .veri hard to knoe whether the gal realli got like u anot, always not sure. when long le, suspicion grows, guy jealousy will grow, act like kids,anyhow blow temper, probably even the best tempered guy over long period might not take it. den + a breakup from the gal juz act as the trigger making the guy felt cheated and unable to take it den act so immature loh.<br><br>so i suggest gals shld try to open up, be alittle more touchy wif ur bf or if u realli dun like it den add more gifts and 'i love u's or sometimes give a treat, respect ur bf and give equal priviledges and dun say "i'm a gal so u muz give way to me" i think it juz pisses any guy off. on the other hand, guys shld also try to be more understanding and big hearted. confront her if u think the insecurity is too hard to bear.. if she meant to cheat u from the start, the ultimate outcome will still be a split whether its now or many years down the road. chances that she will like u after u spent many efforts to make her happi when she doesn't even wan to appreciate it is too low for me to even try @ all.</div>
