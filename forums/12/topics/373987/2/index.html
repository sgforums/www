              <p>Frankly, whether one is a Xtian or Taoist or .... is unimportant lar. What matters is whether one can understand, acknowledge and yet  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">transcend one's bigotry, one's prejudice(s) </span>and reconcile to  the differences, the beliefs .... and yet <span style="text-decoration: underline;">relate to what others are</span>. In this instance, your father is a 'conditioned' person and to change him or impose or even assert one's belief or ... is utterly foolish and unwise.</p>
              <p>One who is mature and wise would understand and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">just go thru the ritual.</span> Of course, it presupposes one <span style="text-decoration: underline;">has no fear</span> of losing what <span style="text-decoration: underline;">thinks one is</span>. What one thinks is not what one is. what one is BEING - is the true expereince.</p>
              <p> It is the fear of losing (the religious belief) that is causing these melodrama or if u will, the psychodrama.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Without</span> understanding, she may relent and do what your father or even u want her to do. However, it is going to later surface as a grievance. If she understands and acknowledges her insecurities, fears .... she may be acquiescent.</p>

              <p>It's not able not showing respect to elders anot. Tell yr father if someone force him go church and worship God , how will he feel?</p>
              <p>I believe yr wife will do it , if he really request her to do it. But how can u do that to yr wife when she never forces u to believe in her own religion. She believes everybody shall practice their religion freely. U shall stand by her this belief and be responsible to yr wife too.</p>
              <p>I support yr picking of first option. Wise choice!</p>

              <p>Your father is a manipulative and controlling person. And he is simply trying to extend his control to your future wife.</p>
              <p>If I am your gf, I will reconsider about marrying into your family.</p>
              <p>After married, will your wife be required to live with your family ? If she does, she will be in for a bad marriage due to her in-laws ( your family). A controlling in-law and a weak spouse is recipe for a lot of family conflicts. As she will be the one giving in to your family demand all the time.</p>
              <p>Are you going for a christian church wedding and a traditional chinese wedding ?</p>
              <p>If you are only doing the traditional chinese, and not the church wedding, that means your wife has already compromised, how much more do you want her to give in ? After all, it is her wedding too you know.</p>
              <p>Forcing a joss stick on anyone does not equate to achieving filial piety.</p>
              <p>There are other ways to pay respect to your ancestors.</p>
              <p>A joss stick is merely a tool for a believer.</p>
              <p>What is <strong>disturbing</strong>, is not what "item/object" your father wants her to hold.</p>
              <p>Rather his underlying purpose in forcing her to take something he know is against her religious beliefs. </p>
              <p>Perhaps, by you and your wife giving in, it re-enforced his standing as one who is still in "control".</p>
              <p>Or, using the joss stick saga, is his own passive aggresive way of <strong>disapproving</strong> the union.</p>

              <p>filial piety is a good thing - but when it is use to force someone to do something it is bad !!! Doing it in the name of filial piety is still dumb !!! Since your father is at it, ask him to force you to rob the bank !!! <br><br>Your wife have her right to her religion - your father or you have no rights to force her to do things against her rights. When you take her as your wife - your vow was to love her and protect her - not force her !!!</p>
              <p>Frankly if your father want to live in dark ages - then so be it .</p>

              <p>TS.....Basically you have to answer this to yourself......what do you believe and make a decision and still be able to sleep at night?</p>
              <p>If you believe that your Wife have the freedom to remain as a christian than you have to make a Stand to your FATHER.  (Your Father is basically a selfish Jerk...there are plenty of Parent who never know how to let go... your dad is not alone)</p>
              <p><strong>Ultimately you have to put your lives with your wife First</strong>.   Learned to protect your new found lives with your new spouse. Overtime your wife would appreciate more of you. And she will learned to respect for the relationship between you and  between parents. </p>
              <p><strong>You are Basically establishing boundary between you and your Parents so not to worry about not respecting elderly crap argument.</strong> <strong>At the sametime it allow your wife  to establish boundary with her side of the family. </strong></p>
              <p>If your Dad is worried about nobody worship him after he kicks the bucket just said you will still be faithful to his believe.  </p>
