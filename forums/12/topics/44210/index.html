ESPECIALLY if you are those EARLY BIRDS, try to SLEEP EARLY.... One thing students often have to cope with during exams is the intensity or CHANGE in 'sleep cycle'.... You could still sleep early and wake up early for your studies if you find it difficult to adapt to these changes in life cycle....<br><br>Regarding your 1 hour nap after lunch, some people DO have the habit of napping after lunch... Not that it's totally no good, but if it's giving you trouble you can try....<br><br>1. Cutting down the nap time gradually... It's a mentality and habit thing... You've got to teach yourself that....<br><br>2. If you REALLY NEED to stay awake, you can try keeping your mind OCCUPIED with some things which might INTEREST or STIMULATE your mind a little but not so much until it would knock you off...?<br><br>Regards.</div>
