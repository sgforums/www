It will be more painful for the two of you.  You can say you dun mind but if she says 'I miss him", 'I still love him' etc, can you take it?  One cannot love to order.  If it's meant to be yours, it will be.  Just take it easy, sometimes being frens is better than being lovers.  And then, you are still young, no hurry to get into a relationship.  Hurrying things will only make things worse. </span></div>

It will be more painful for the two of you.  You can say you dun mind but if she says 'I miss him", 'I still love him' etc, can you take it?  One cannot love to order.  If it's meant to be yours, it will be.  Just take it easy, sometimes being frens is better than being lovers.  And then, you are still young, no hurry to get into a relationship.[b] Hurrying things will only make things worse. </span></div></blockquote>[/b]<br><br>yes! dont rush things ... like me ... i m impatient and got her angry ... haiz ...</div>
