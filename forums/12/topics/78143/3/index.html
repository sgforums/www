You care that she might become pressured or stressed up more than you wanting to get into relationship.<br>She might consider you being a gentleman and bonus for you.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Think about it for awhile. Ever heard from a girl whom just hop into a new relationship with your guyfriend. Telling her friends or to you that 'Actually i really miss my ex, i'm thinkin of him all the time...'<br>How would you feel for your guyfriend? Or rather if she's your girlfriend, you never know how she truly feels or what's in her mind no matter how many kisses or how long the phone call with you.<br><br>Well...like you've said. You're going to enter into the same course with her. 3yrs can make alot of difference to affect her again.<br><br>Don't rush, just ready for her to go.<br>Don't be upset cos she never belonged to you.<br>Don't give up cos you never know when she might be yours......in time to come.<br><br>Think think think <img src="http://www.kissorbite.com/forum/images/smilies/crazy.gif"><br><br>Cheers!<br><br></div>

In any other common case, you both would probably be together already.<br><br>Your concluding two paragraph says alot of things. First, too many things are rushing in - she cannot handle it emotionally. You met her for the first time and you told her that you like her and she actually felt the same as well - things are going too hasty. She needed space and time; therefore ex will definitely be used to buy some time for consideration.<br><br>You are like a rushing wind, this relationship will likely to be intense. Continue in this speed, at this current strength, you will see the passion dying down later in the future.<br><br>Why? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You wanted her so badly, then competiting against her ex - this put unneccessary pressure on her, which ultimately kills seduction. You enter into a relationship with her, it will be difficult for you to substain the first 9 months relationship, furthermore she is spolit for choices - you are merely one option.<br><br>You want to fight against competitor; you show her that you are the one and [b]NOT</strong> tell her that you are the best among them. Let make her own decision - you just do your thing. You already asked her to be your girlfriend, then until the time she is ready and wish to commit, then let the relationship begin. If not, always presume she need more time.<br><br>Cheers  [/b]</blockquote>finally expert is here</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmm... Maybe just give her more time, 'cuz it's like wat the others said is true, if she can't get over her ex-es, she can't give you her heart. And that might juz hurt both of u more when she feels that she cannot continue this facade anymore.<br><br>True, she might feel a hell lot for you, but fact is, i personally don't believe that a person can love 2 people at the same time.<br><br>You don't mind her past, but she probably minds it a lot. Perhaps she thinks that it won't be fair to you if she agrees to be your girlfriend, 'cuz she knows that all the time, she'll be thinking of her ex-es..?? (WoMeN!!)<br><br>But then again, is it REALLY necessary for you to get into a relationship so early? After all, there's still at least 3 more years of schooling and since she'll be in the same course as you, there'll be more than enough chance for you to call her out and spend time with her.<br><br>I think mayhaps you give her more time and let the both of you concentrate on ur studies 1st.. I believe that'll not only give her more time to think about relationship thingie and also build a better foundation for the two of you. Think about it, ya?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>P.S: Maybe you should try to distance urself from her from now..
