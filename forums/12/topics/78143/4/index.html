            <div class='col-md body'>hmm.. personally.. i just tink tt even if u 2 get together.. it will be like fireworks.. intense.. beautiful.. but extremely short.. n if u really love her.. yes.. by all means.. go woo her.. but ultimately e choice is hers.. xuan ze bu shi ni gei de.. er shi ta zhi zi de.. u've already told her how u feel.. u've already told her to b wif u... but there's no conclusion up till now.. so even if she get back wif her ex.. there's nothing u can do.. except to wish her well n get on wif ur life..<br><br>i wun give u all e things abt 'loving her means let her go..' or 'she happy u'll also be happy..' cos basically i tink most people will never wanna give up on a person who they love a lot.. cos ppl will always wanna be wif the person who they love a lot.. so wad u can do now.. is just to wait n bide ur time.. try not to contact her for e time being.. spend more time wif ur frens la.. u'e still young.. have fun n make merrY~!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: red;">Blade!!! I was in your position few weeks back. And is almost the same thing happened. I am telling you now although it's going to be very difficult. STOP ALL PHYSICAL ACTIONS WITH HER. Cause when u get physical, you will definitely build up emotions based on being physical.<br><br>Be normal frens, keep that distance there. Stay with her, talk to her. Keep her company. BUT ONLY WHEN SHE HAS FINALLY LET GO OF HER EX, then u move in to really woo n chase her all you want.<br><br>I was in your situation and under the mentality that i could let some girl forget her ex, we both had great time for 2 months, 1 month of going steady n it juz all crashed from there. We are trying to patch as frens now. We got physical damn fast, only until frenching and i really really genuinely loved her. She thought she did too, but turns out i was only her temporary sheltar in her moments of heartaches. She didn't realised she was doing such a thing to me only sometime later when she made a terrible mistake which i dun wanna talk about cause it's over.<br><br>But I'm telling you now. Learn from me. Stop all physical actions n juz be good frens. If u really love her, u can wait for her. Make sure she really lets go of her ex inside. It's a very hidden disguise to go under the situation where she tells u she loves u, looks into ur eye n all logic gets thrown out of the window. Haiz, dun go that way which i have experienced. Of course if u lucky, then u can successfuly detach her from her ex, if not... U will feel damn cheated and even worse!<br><br>The worse type of love is not unrequited love, it is when what you thought was true and real love was actually just a fake dream gone bad.<br><br>Learn from me. Dun suffer... =)<br><br></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HaiZ~ You are in this horrible situation which is hurtin' you so much huh? Seriously i don't know why she's doing this to you. Why does she claim to like you and yet refuses to be with you? Guess she herself is in a frenzy of emotions as well..<br><br>Since she has initiated a "man man lai" situation, then give her time bahx.. But like what Bontakun said: <blockquote>Den heed her advice. DUN BE NICE TO HER.</blockquote>Maybe in that way you can distance yourself away from her and the heartbreak that you most probably might suffer will not be amplified.. Since she can't let go of her ex-es you guys won't be happy together even IF you DO get together..<br><br>After all, how would you feel if you know that whenever the two of you kiss, she's thinking of someone else? *SiGh* Maybe she's afraid of that too..</div>
