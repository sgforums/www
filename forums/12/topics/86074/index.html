            <div class='col-md body'>*Wonders if you'll get to read this post*<br>Alvernia.. If you received a gunshot at the road by the hospital,  you'd have prolly died b4 reaching the main building. Damn that long slope. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyway, back to a more serious tone,<br>here's a few things you might wanna think over..<br><br><blockquote>I am currently studyin nursin course in the poly... Now jus reach 2nd yr... Nursin have always been my childhood dream... It is also my ambition to be a nurse lor... </blockquote>Think.. why did you want to go into this line? Childhood dreams are usually, should i say, stereotypical.<br>"I wannnn to be a doctor!"<br>"I want to be a policaman when i grow up!"<br>"A typist!"<br>"A pilot!"<br>"An astronaut!"<br>"A nurse!"<br><br>What we wanna be usually comes out from out textbooks. I remember wanting to be a doctor when i was still a little tot. I was barely 7 then.<br>Became bent on that noble ambition when my grandpa passed away from lung cancer.. Wanted to be a doctor to heal people, to help others. I was 14 then.<br>Now, I am 18, going on 19 soon. Do i still hope to be a doctor? Ideally yes, but circumstances stop me from doing so. (Read: crap results). So i thought it through. Why did i want to be a doctor in the 1st place? <strong>To help others.</strong><br><br><blockquote>And all my teachers advice me gainst takin nursin lor... </blockquote>Damn the social stigma. I bet they were thinking "16 can take u to better courses.. but why *nursing*?"<br><br><blockquote>Is tis wat i really want? I so dunno... Coz we see all the staff... Some busy till they don go eat... Or they go half hour only... Haha... I really dun see how am i able to do all tis!<br><br>I feel tat myself very bad... I dun lik people around me to be lik moody moody depressed depressed de... Coz i myself is the kind, happy go lucky de... V carefree... End up each time i attachment, in the hosp n at home surely moody lor... Don feel lik smilin! </blockquote>Is it what you really want? Don't judge what you want by how others react to this line.. One man's meat is another man's poison. So how? if you are the typical 'kai xin guo' (happiness fruit. nice to eat during CNY  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> ), cheer up the atmosphere.. spread the joy.. You have no idea how much a smiling nurse looks so much more inviting to an ailing patient than a frowning gorilla. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Find your work dreary? remind yourself about why you wanna work in this line.. For me, helping people, or patients in this case, gives me energy to move on.. The sheer knowledge that they have been made a little better by my effort, however small, warms my engine and fuels my soul. Maybe that can be your driving force..<br><br><blockquote>There is tis pt... Actually she not really demandin...<br><br>The worst i ever met was tis aunty... She very very the demandin lor...<br><br>Tat why lor... I dunno why tis aunty i met jus abit demandin... Not so much as tis aunty... But i very pek chek liao... </blockquote>That's the thing about this line, or any line in the service/healthcare sector for that matter. You meet people, from all walks of like, and all measures of temper. Especially for the obstinate elderly, people can get demanding or heated, simply because... seriously who likes to stay in a hospital? Try to understand.. and try to make their stay as comfortable as it can be.. even if your go all out to go that.. Your goodwill may not be reciprocated, but at least you've fulfilled your heart.<br><br><blockquote>I very worry... I am of coz bent on completin my course... But bent on workin in tis line?

If you hate your job, you'll feel really bleah. I think you know what im trying to say..<br><br>Think about it, and discuss/decide on it.. Good luck to ya..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, i think the i can roughly understand what you mean. Some years back, my work required me to come into contact with the dead. Looking at dead bodies everyday changed my preceptions about life. I realised life is so fragile. I couldn't accept that simple fact in life............ and i end up hating having to go to work too.<br><br>Perhaps you are just not used to the harsh realities of life. Maybe you find it a hassle to serve people. In that case, i do not think that you should go on to be a nurse. Nursing requires much dedication, hard work and effort. It also requires a willingness to serve. You need to seriously assess if you are able to commit and not waste your previous time.</div>
