I can't profess to speak for all the posters, but I noe I've been thru wat u've gone thru, or @ least v. similar to it.  Wat u've described is juz how many parents r *smilez*<br><br>Abt 6 yrs back, when I was 20, I patched thgs up wif my parents &amp; from there, we've built a v. solid bond between us.  That's when they let me in on their side of the story &amp; their feelings.<br><br>Parents r human, they err too, &amp; when they tell u wat to do, they're actually trying to suggest ways for u to improve, &amp; to guide u along life's path.  Some dun treat u as an adult until a later stage, it's juz how life is.<br><br>When u sez ur dad changes his story to suit watever pts he makes/made, it's cosh parents r scared too.  They dowan to appear fallible or inadequate in their child's eyes, simply cosh they're afraid u'll lose respect for them, &amp; will turn away from wat they're trying to teach u.  Sometimes they dun realise tt this cld instill rebellion &amp; defiance.<br><br>Now tt u noe how ur parents feel, try Not to get so upset.  Perhaps 1 day, when ur r'ship wif them has improved (like mine has since 6 yrs back), they'll tell u abt their feelings &amp; fears @ this pt in time (which is, NOW).<br><br>Ultimately, wat's impt is tt ur parents love u, &amp; tho they may be wrong, &amp; irritatingly insistent tt they're more experienced (true, but tt doesn't mean they're right all the time), bottomline is tt they haf ur interests @ heart : )<br><br>RP<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by bismarck:</div><div class="quote_body">i just spent 1 hr arguing with my parents anything from computers to how my sch mates are treating me,how ppl screw up in the most impossible ways and yet have to swallow it all down,how i shld shut the fark up when hijack the prac and do everything on my own without any input from lab partner and we get the best results?<br><br>it seems i cant communicate with my parents..especially with my dad. i cant see waht he wants me to do things. when i do something and he many times just out of the blue tell me he wants he this way want it that way but he made no mention of it. then he says he wanna train me on it but problem is,when i try to anticipate what he wants and he will tell me not to act smart and follow instructions when it is given. like whatever i do he will change the damn goalpost. he is never happy with whatever i do.<br><br>he everytime nvr allows me to talk and he just scolds me or tells me off. then when i interrupt and explain why i did this or did that, he will say he is not scolding me but he is telling me how this world works. i am not aganist his idea of telling me how this world works because i do have to admit because of his job nature he meets up with all kinds of morons at work with more conspiracy plans than hollywood has scripts. but he is always changing his side of story to fit himself. it;s like trying to search for oil when someone tells u it;s in the middle of pacific ocean. u go ard trying to search for a tiny spot in the world's largest ocean.<br><br>it;s not just this arguement that is really pressing me.<br>i am also facing pressure from school to perform and also to handup so many assignments given 1-2 weeks before a week's break and handup so many on day 1. 1 lecturer asks everyone individually whether he/she needs extension or something. some ppl havent even started yet.<br><br>then i am also facing problems with some modules because i am really lost in some of them.<br><br>and also because i am buying some parts for the com, the vendor i am dealing with is hopelessly unprofessional and confused. revised and revised specs and still CMI.<br><br>sigh...</div></blockquote></div>
