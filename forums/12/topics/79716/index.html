Let him decide his own fate and future.. And need to tell him one thing... What's done cannot be undone.. If there's someone who needs to depend on him in the future... If he needs his health back... When he needs his life back... Just tell him...<br><br>Just remember today. Cause it's gonna make out who you'll be tomorrow....</div>
