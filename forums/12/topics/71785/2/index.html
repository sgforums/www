I guess u al r the master of this field, wat u all said really express wat singapore guys are tinking n facing. I totally agree on the facts u al state. The reality is cruel. I guess the low-incom guy like us should jus stick to our parent, provide them the best we can, look after them n n leaed a lonely life till death. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br>I hav a colleague who kana shotgun, he marry his wif few years back. They lov each other veri much. They use to cheong veri thiam, but bcause of the kid, they cut down completely. Nw they stayin at his parent's hse. My colleague earn $1.9k+- n his wif $1.5+-. Accordin to my colleague, he say can tahan lar, but only quite restricted. During a talk cock session, I ask him whether <span style="color: red;">planin for the 2nd kid. He say I siao, where got extra $, </span>extra sperm hav plenty lah. Bt I ask den the only kid wil get lonely, he say no choice lor, his parent no $ mah wat to do.<br>Theres a comment by my ex-colleague which I remember forever. "<span style="color: blue;">IF U DON'T HAV $, DON'T GIV BIRTH, OR ELSE NEX TIME UR KID WANT TO BUY TOY U NO $ TO BUY, HE WIL QUESTION U WHY U NO $ GIV BIRTH TO HIM FOR WAT."</span><br></div></blockquote>I beg to differ. The one in red highlights reasons why singapore's birth rate is declining. There are some ppl in our society who earns minimal and just enough for themselves but they stil had a few children. Being a parent is about sacrificing for the good of ur children. Ur fren could just save a meal or two or save on abit of his own expenses in order to buy his child a toy or wat.<br><br>Think about our parents and grandparents era, they dun earn much and yet they could bring up a few children. It may not be all luxuries to the children but at least they get to eat and sleep well. Tts how our parents were brought up. I think we can learn from them.<br><br>If u really think u want to settle down, u got to plan ahead. There is such a thing call saving up. IF u wan to get married at ard 20+, u can think of plans. Whether it is with ur future wife or wat. Together u can work things out. Thats how problems are solved.<br><br>We do not simply say not enuff money or give a reason and do nothing to chage. OR rather give a reason and dune ven try to solve the problem. I am not responding to any campaigns or what, i just feel problems tt arises can be solved and not just simply give a reason and just kick it aside.<br></div>
