I dun believe tat u need to pay to make friends. But if you are planning to settle down, tatz another story. I intro myself, I'm 25 this year(of posting this reply), male and single. So basically I'm only about the same age as you do so you know where you stand.<br><br>Sad... but the truth always hurts. So I'm going to hurt you now rather then to let you suffer in the future if you are planning to get married now.<br><br>If u get married, is 1.5K  going to support ur family?? I tell u, I'm earning 1.7K a month, I'm single, still living with my parents and itz not even enough for me to spend, for your info, I dun go "chiong" often... only once in a blue moon or got promotion.<br><br>And how r u goin to feed your spouse?? Your future children?? Their education?? Wat about transport?? You and your families' daily meals and needs?? Your flat?? The bills?? Ok, you got an 18hr job, but how long can your body take it?? Wat happens if you fall sick?? I tell you, you can only start a family if you are earning 3k and above, lower then tat, I guess u need to live with your parents, or alone.<br><br>If I were you, I rather save up the money and get a better piece of paper(diploma, degree, masters, etc.) to show to my hiring manger at an interview.<br><br>If you love her, dun marry her and dun let her suffer with you if you think you earn too little.<br><br>I apologise if I'm being too harsh. But best to be harsh now than to see another low-income family suffer.<br><br>P.S.: I admit, although I doesn't like materialistic gals, after reading through wat I've just wrote(above), I'm beginning to understand them.
