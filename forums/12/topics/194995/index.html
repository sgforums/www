            <div class='col-md body'>My case is similar to yours. Just that i've never been in a relationship before. In my case, i feel that you can't actually handle it. I too, feels extremely sensitive when she doesent message me continuously for the 4th day. I would get extremely uncomfortable when i look at her and she did'nt look back. I guessed, if you can. Try to find something else to do on your own, get her out of your mind for awhile. My friend gave me a video to watch when i consulted her. Which turns out to be quite effective.</div>

Just that i've never been in a relationship before. In my case, i feel that you can't actually handle it. I too, feels extremely sensitive when she doesent message me continuously for the 4th day. I would get extremely uncomfortable when i look at her and she did'nt look back. I guessed, if you can. Try to find something else to do on your own, get her out of your mind for awhile. My friend gave me a video to watch when i consulted her. Which turns out to be quite effective.</div></blockquote>a video?? care to share</div>
