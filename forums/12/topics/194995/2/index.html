            <div class='col-md body'>I was quite heck-care with my 1st girlfriend back then(meaning, i don't really bother 2 call her daily, chat with her daily etc) and in the end, i lost her 2 my best friend. After that, i became paranoid, and when the second relationship came, i was more uptight about her, and almost everyday, i will meet her. I became unreasonable whenever she never reply my call, or meet me. We quarrel about that, but didn't break for that reason.<br><br>Sometimes, its all about finding balance. Know when to let go, and when to pull in the rein. If u know ur gf is the happy carefree spirit type, then its better 2 give her some degree of freedom.</div>
