My family have no car and me dun have the ability to own one, so chances for me to practise driving after i passed tp is very slim. Try to drive around short distance or places u familiar. Practise enough there before u go for further places. Take care bro.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Practice makes perfect. If you find it difficult to keep your eyes on the road and navigate at the same time, then drive only when your father or someone familiar with directions is beside you so that you could focus on the road conditions first. If a "vehicle commander" or navigator is not available, it may help if you'd check up the street directory and plan your route first using as many familiar roads as possible.<br><br>Drive around Singapore more often and familiarise yourself with the roads, if you tend to slow down when reading road signs try to stick to the left lane in case you get horned by impatient drivers behind you. With time, you should become more confident such that you could just glance at the abundant road signs and be able to quickly plan your route while keeping alert on the road conditions.<br><br>Even experienced drivers may still face problems navigating, so keep the street directory handy. Drive safely, and don't lose your head trying to impress the girl sitting beside you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Be alert to places with cameras. U learn from observing.<br><br>Another good tip is to read street directory, watch out for outstanding landmark/ bldg. &amp; carparks.

            <div class='col-md body'>when driving ur dad's car, better to have him beside you first... so that he can guide u and also u r more confident.<br><br>more imptly if u accident he will know why it happened and u don't have to explain to him.<br><br>as a start, i recommend u drive during the off peak hours and quiet roads... like at night or something and drive some familar routes , like home to market and back and so on... those u know inside out. only when u r faimilar that start to venture out.....<br><br></div>

Though I am scared initally, but once on the road, everything will just come naturally..hit the expressway, do small roads etc etc..no problem.<br><br>My advice:<br>1. Drive off peak hrs first to gain confidence.<br>2. Always be very patience, and keep a safe following distance.<br>3. Be more confident and drive on your own.<br>Last but not least....<br><br>4.

            <div class='col-md body'>My friend ask me to help me drive his cousin car back home after i passed tp for only 1 mth. I follow him back home and get holland on the expressway road. I have to find a way out myself. I stopped at one of the bus stop and call my friend. He don't any idea where i am and i don't noe how to explain to him. And worse still, I dun noe how to get out of the place using the street directory. Lucky for me I still recongise the place.<br><br>When i start to go, I found my engine stall ever time release clutch and step accelerator. And this continue on the road until i reacha  traffic light. Luck that time was at nite and no much traffic.<br><br>I was then stuck before the traffic light , having no clue what happen. tot the car die on me. Then later i found out i haven release hand brake rite after i start from the bus stop..."omg shit man". After this incident i always look out for my hand brake every time i start the car.<br><br>Moral of the story, sometime shit happens, but don't panic. Everybody got first time. But remember dun speed, anyhow cut lane and u should be fine. But should practise at those less traffic and best if there is a exp V-com beside u.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

We don't even know how's your driving like, how are we suppose to know if your parents' decision ain't really for your own good?<br><br>Anyway, try to go for 'practice' on your more familar roads and routes 1st... Like suggested by the others, pay attention to the roads and routes whenever you're in a car / bus/ whatever vehicle when you're not driving....<br><br>DON'T be eager to 'show off' when you're not even proficient in your driving...
