            <div class='col-md body'>Porns are simply cheap trills which 'may' bares more harm than educational messages.  So watch it with the right mindset as many porns are simply an act of some sick fantasies.. i.e. rape, mind control, etc...<br><br>Oh.. Porns can be as addictive as drugs.<br><br>Regardless, it is pretty normal for guys at your age to be curious about such things.  Problem is, girls at your age may feel that this is a flirty behaviour and more or less, conservative.  This is actually a good thing as girls who are less conservative and careless.. often gets into troubles.<br><br>As for what to tell her? Well, just be honest loh.  Admit that you are watching it or otherwise you probably is not normal.  However, should she disliked this behaviour of yours, well.. it's up to you to convince and gain her trust.  Trust needs hard work and time to build.  So.. good luck to you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

When she's in a better mood, try explaining to her. You should assure her that you won't do it again or harbour any ill intentions towards her. Don't let her catch you again!<br><br>(IMO, girls get freaked out by guys who watch porn because they think the guys will do something to them/the guys are disgusting.)<br><br>Btw, did she catch you watching porn only or did you catch you watching porn + pccing? If it's the second one, I think there's no hope. Unless she's far more matured than you think...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This happened when I was 15. My ex read FHM aloud to me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> And I was totally grossed out cause I'm sure he watches porn. And he has pics of beautiful women in his computer. (naked or not, I not sure. I only seen the ones dressed.)<br><br>Somehow, I didn't feel jealous, I simply felt that he was a sex-starved fella. Even now that we're good buddies, I still feel its gross.<br><br>Such things have an impact on girls, especially around the age of 14-16.<br><br>Funny thing is, I think most girls don't look at pics of naked beefy men. Porn maybe, but not as frequent as guys I'll bet.<br><br>Now I know why men are from mars and women from venus.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
