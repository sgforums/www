            <div class='col-md body'>Dear JD,<br><br>I can almost understand ur situation.  I too, had similiar incident a yr and a half ago.  Similarity, he is oso a senior who happened to b a mgr to where i work.  We happen to hold the same position, but as i was new to the area, i remain humble.<br><br>I did not know when, where or how did i get on his nerve..everything i do, he snapped at me, even to the extend of in front of my staff.  I took in all in with stride...not wantin to create any scene nor makin him looked ugly.  Until one fine morning, he failed or I shld say, missed, doin his job properly..As a proper procedure, I hav to write in our communication book &amp; i swear, i did not make it sound like it was HIS fault, in fact, i din even bother to know who was the mgr-in-charge the previous nite.  In my opinion, if work is not properly done, i wll go to the supervisor, who will in turn, make sure the staff will not b makin the same mistake again.<br><br>The mgr, read the coms book &amp; called upon me to have a seat..There, he ranted on &amp; on &amp; his voice was gettin louder..Again, i sat there, respectfully listened to him, but was gettin intolerable..I held onto my tears.  I hav staff around, it was not right to cry..Then he got personal.  I cldnt take it any more, so i asked him if he was done, i din even bother to wait for his ans, i walked off.<br><br>I hide inside the toilet &amp; released all.  It was after some time tat he peak into the toilet (common),saw me crying, showed little signs of uneasiness.  But he still ranted on (WTF!? I juz needed b left alone!)..in the ranting, i got the msg tat he din want this matter to blown up, juz to settle among us.  (note: he din want our head mgr to know abt tis).  &amp; I din.  From then onwards, he was kinder towards me..<br><br>I know urs might b slightly serious case than mine..but in my opinion, even if the other party is takin it personal, we shld try not to let tat gets into us.  Instead, let's try to understand their situation..We are so much younger &amp; energetic + opportunities in advancement is definately greater than the seniors/elders collegues in our area..It's onli natural tat thy feel threatened, &amp; thus we get their harsh treatments..It's their way of hiding their insecurities..<br><br>JD, tilt ur head to one side &amp; look at the senerios again..u might discover new things.  All the best! ^^v</div>
