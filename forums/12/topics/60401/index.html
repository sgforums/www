Either you subconsciously did something you didn't knew and it was misread from her point of view (probably reinforced by comments and statements) or the surrounding event add pressure onto her view about the friendship between you and her.<br><br>This can be anything fromn innocent 'hint hint' from friends about your intention and ideas to no-prove claims, disturbing cum suaning from them. Chances are, you ain't at the scene to witness or defend yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Regardless of what your intention really are, it is obvious that she doesn't have BGR liking for you OR in some rare cases she has (reserve psychological acts). Unless more information is feed through your post, my stand is no for the latter possibility.<br><br>Advice?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>To maintain the friendship, you have to recognise the 3 factors land mine, personal space and innocent jokes - which will affect the trigger, around your environment.<br><br>Land mine - Watch your own body language especially and avoid throwing extra care and concern, even if you feel that this is what you could do for a good friend (Key point: your preception of good friend to her doesn't mean she feel that same way as well). Once you across the land mine, you activate the trigger. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Innocent Jokes- Ask people around to stop disturbing as it is affecting her. Be serious to them and seek their understanding. I am sure they will understand (generally). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Personal space - depending on their personality, do not invade personal space. This is highly related to land mine. Personal space refers to the maximum behavior you can react in her presence. Probably a friendly arm around her, xianing talks can cease if it is within her PS. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Trigger - the result of her behavior according to the three factors above. Likelihood is negative is the above is negative.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The sum up - be yourself and don't feel that it is a problem because if you do create a scene or talks things out, firstly she will feel that there is nothing to talk about (there isn't a problem, its your thinking and feel that makes yourself comfortable, but doesn't mean she is the same). Secondly, you will be fuifilling her misconception about your relationship with her. Just treat it as normal and be generous about it. Smile and act normally. Laugh and talk as usual. Gradually, she will return to normal as long as the three factors above returns to positive.<br><br>Cheers</div>
