I believe the 'feeling' described here would be more like 'chemistry' in which one party would feel for another.<br><br>It is often not enough for survival of a relationship by itself (even if a relationship manage to survive on this basis alone, it could be defined as quite a 'hollow' one. Note. It's 'hollow' not meaningless or anything.). However, it is more often than not... The very basis for a normal start up of a LOVE relationship...</div>
