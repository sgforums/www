It is so obvious that she had went back to the ruins, while the man she loved so deeply, had already travelled and move across the plains to greener pasture. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Basically, I understand your kind intention in trying to make her give up, but in reality nothing but herself can cease that waiting, pending and longing. The only thing you can do is to constantly psycho her negatively and gradually - avoid using false hope or seemingly-false hope because what she needs now is someone to share the same thinking as her. The minute if you implied something that fuel this hope, she will believe like a blind faith.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Love Law truth number two: No one can make us stay in a bad relationship apart from ourselves. (Only she has the ability and power to leave her past)<br><br>Keep talking to your friend? Nah, you have to gradually shock her with reality truth opposite message from her befuddled mind first. You may have to avoid seeing her too often as well. Plan this well - get another mutual good friend and tell her to hang around and be there for her when it is neccessary. Psychologically, your presence signify one things:<br><br>I) <strong>You subconsciously represent your brother</strong>. Remember the day when we broke up and we felt so hurt, we would tour around the places we used to go when we are a couple? Sometimes, emotions overwhelmed us and we cry. You represent a walking scenario.<br><br>This is also the reason why she will automatically reject other guys you attempt to introduce. The heart automatically shut down and mind switch off - to these guys for since you represent your brother. 'How could she know other guys when she is 'with' him' hidden subconscious thoughts will spring out and the reaction would be rejection outrageously. I suggest attempt Stealth Tactics if you want these guys to succeed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>Level 1</strong>: Avoid mutual introduction first - her psychological automatic thoughts will trigger her defensive mechanism to block off. First tell your other guy friend saying that you have this good female friend you want to intro to him, allow him to see her first and seek for his impression. If it is good, we moved on to level two.<br><br><strong>Level 2</strong>: Somehow in level two, the three of you would have to know each other. I suggest avoid putting three-people-go-out situation, it can be too obvious. A good plan would be a group outing. Although psychological focus is low, but our objective isn't this, yet.<br><br><strong>Level 3</strong>: Once as friends, move on, gradually in Stealth mode - invisible to woman's sensitive mental radar and understand her as a friend. Don't have to do aggressive selling, take things one at the time. As for you, at this level, you would have to gradually reduce your presence as well. This happens simultaneously. There will be an unconscious shift of dependancy from her if the guy witty, adaptable and good enough to follow this plan. Remember I told you about another good female friends to be around her? She will appear at this level. (Must pump message that could implied strongly that your brother had already moved on as well) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>Level 4</strong>: Its beyond your control - like Spirit entering into Mars. Its all about him now.<br><br>P.S: Actually, I foresee that the first guy should fail unless he is trained and experience in the art of seduction, love and romance or simply lucky. But the sad thing is that, the second one should be actual one that can succeed. The first's appearance is to do the dirty job. (Of course you are not going to tell him that), but truely, with very good planning and actions from him, he may succeed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Even if there is a better guy intro to her, she will ignore.  She said that in her heart, there is only this guy.<br><br>I'm sure you all agree that there is no hope in that past relationship anymore, since they were already separated for two years and there is no sign of the guy wanting her back.</div></blockquote>To Honeybunz:<br><br>I and Virginheart were caught in a rather similar situations and both had already keep clear of the gals we knew. virginheart is going to US for his coimpany attachment.<br><br>Basically, I can tell U that the gal U knows does not know what she want. She keep living in the past ---&gt; 2 years of separation and she still cling to the past.<br><br>Let's me tell U the truth: No matter how/what U did, she will never accept U/commit herself to U as her heart is already dead....Is she the type that appears very listless, keep things to herself, a loner and when U mention things about her EXs, she wlll be very excited and will tell U a lof about her association with her EXs?<br><br>If the answer is YES, I advise U to slowly and slowly keep adrift of her as basically, she is wasting your time. She is a stubborn lot who refused to accept new advices/ideas from others. she is letting her past to ruin her WILLINGLY.<br><br>I met this type of gal last 5 months ago...I did try very hard to advice her etc but eventually my close friend adived me to leave her earlier but I did not take the advice and until recently, I foresee it is a GONE Case and so I did not associate with her again. She knew of my intention of leaving her and she did not do anything else although sounded not so happy at the initial stage.<br><br>2 options for U:<br><br>1. Give yourself 2 to 3 months time to convince her of your sincerity and by the end of the period, she can so call WAKE UP FROM HER DREAM, then I  congratulate U.<br><br>2. If U find that she is becoming more and more of a burden to U, make some plans for yourself before U leave her.<br><br>I more or less know the outcome of your situation but I will still encourage U to try your best BUT there are many more things awaitng for U to seek in life.<br><br>Do Update Us of the outcome whenever U can.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey honeybunz..<br><br>i dun really know the full story but i'm gonna tell u that if i were u, i wouldn't stop her. She's found the love of her life. so why are u stopping her? i know u really want to be a good friend and would really love to see her move on with her life. but she's old enough to decide for herself... the best thing u can do as a friend is to stand by her if she falls and help her on her feet again.<br><br>i think u need to let your brother know that she's still waiting.... my best friend is in a similar situation, he's told this girl that he really likes her but she's rejected him sayin that she'd prefer him as a friend. He's respected her decision, stuck to it and they've still been going out like the good friends that they are. my point it.. he's happy.. he's not with her, still loves her BUT he;s happy.. i know he longs for something more... but.. we'll let time settle that for him..<br><br>for your friend, please pass this message on to her... "i hope u find a man worthy enough of your love. girls nowadays don't seem to be able to hold a candle up you when it comes to devotion."</div>

Keep ur fren bz.  Post-split, pple tend to think too much &amp; cry too much whenever they haf free time on their hands.  Keep her occupied, take out her shopping, go to the movies, haf coffee &amp; pple-watch (this is fun <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">), haf gd meals, go for a drink @ a quiet place (I recommend Oriental Hotel, there's an open area wif a pianist &amp; someone singing <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">).<br><br>2.

Then, go buy clothes, bags, shoes, hair accessories (pls hor, if u dun haf the budget, dun go for designer labels <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">).

She might actually wanna indulge in some harmless flirting (read: teasing only!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">).<br><br>3.  Go on a short vacation (or a few short ones, spread throughout the yr).  There're great budget places to go to.

U can oso try KL, JB, etc.  Browse thru the Net for reasonably-priced &amp; gd hotels.<br><br>4.  Avoid bringing up ur bro.  If she wans to tok abt him, fine, but find a way to change the subj asap.  If she asks, dun give her a detailed ans, juz tell her he's happee.  THEN, take her mind off him by keeping her occupied as stated in #1, 2, 3.<br><br>5.  This is linked to #2, boost her confidence, so tt she'll look on the bright side of thgs, &amp; give her hope.  Tell her how prettie she is, how intelligent, etc.  Tell her she'll find somebody who'll make her happee.  Even if she mentions him, ignore it, juz compliment her.<br><br>Ultimately, it's up to her whether or Not to give him up.  The above r only ways to make her feel better.  There's the possibility she'll find someone else, there's oso the possibility she'll still wanna hang onto the dream of being together wif him.<br><br>Wat's impt is tt, u support her &amp; do thgs for her, the way a true fren does : )<br><br>RP<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Honeybunz:</div><div class="quote_body">I know a very nice girl - pretty and petite.<br>She was with this guy for ten years (since her school days).

When u feel like a brand new person, there's oso a boosted level of confidence.  Who noes?  She might actually wanna indulge in some harmless flirting (read: teasing only!!! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">).<br><br>3.  Go on a short vacation (or a few short ones, spread throughout the yr).  There're great budget places to go to.  Redang is a beautiful place, the beach is great, &amp; it's quiet enuff so tt u can tok abt anythg.  Haf a beer @ the beach, eat to ur hearts' content.  U can oso try KL, JB, etc.  Browse thru the Net for reasonably-priced &amp; gd hotels.<br><br>4.  Avoid bringing up ur bro.  If she wans to tok abt him, fine, but find a way to change the subj asap.  If she asks, dun give her a detailed ans, juz tell her he's happee.  THEN, take her mind off him by keeping her occupied as stated in #1, 2, 3.<br><br>5.  This is linked to #2, boost her confidence, so tt she'll look on the bright side of thgs, &amp; give her hope.  Tell her how prettie she is, how intelligent, etc.  Tell her she'll find somebody who'll make her happee.  Even if she mentions him, ignore it, juz compliment her.<br><br>Ultimately, it's up to her whether or Not to give him up.  The above r only ways to make her feel better.  There's the possibility she'll find someone else, there's oso the possibility she'll still wanna hang onto the dream of being together wif him.<br><br>Wat's impt is tt, u support her &amp; do thgs for her, the way a true fren does : )<br><br>RP<br><br></div></blockquote>to sum up this super long but still very thoughtful reply,<br><br>just be the ultimate super optimistic (haha RP...) energizer bunny that goes on and on and on, never giving up on a friend in need and always always being there for her.</div>
