            <div class='col-md body'>TS,<br><br>your situation seems like a termination. can u verify? pardon me for having this impression as u had mentioned about the part - helping your friend. i think in any employment your employer's schedule needs to take priority. as u know, if your services had been unfavourably terminated then u might not even be paid.<br><br>so before you can pursue any further, you will need to be clear on this.<br><br>good luck <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
