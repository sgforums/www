I understand that it is my fault. But i cant be blame partly bcos after the quarrel, he basically neber keep in contact wif me. Now i realli dunoe wat his daily lifestyle is liao.<br><br>When i met him yest, he is so cool n stern. N he sat in his car to pass me my disc(which i borrow fm him) he din say much nor any expression to show that he miss me. It's like pass n go.<br><br>Abt a hr later, i sms him n ask him if we could tok. he call me back. In a frustrated tone, he reply me when i ask him how is he these few days, he say " dun u noe that im bz all these days?', then i say i noe. Trying to find out how u r cos u r not ard to tok to me, and tis is making me uneasy. Then again i ask him if he had forgiven me (cos i send a sorry sms to him previous nite, but no reply). Then he say forgive wat?. Haiz..nvm Then i ask him if there is anything wrong between us? he say no. Then i ask him if he had reach home, he say yes n i ask him to haf a early rest n gd nite. It's only later part, his tone change to beta.Haiz..<br><br>I felt suckyt after hearing his response n tone, but was relief when he say there was nothing wrong. But i still wondering if he still haf the same feeling. If not, i guess, this vday, it wun mean anything more special to me. Btw,he din mention anything abt vday to me also.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote>This is a personal INSTINCTIVE opinion... Err...<br><br>Either you're BUGGING him too much or there's something REALLY WRONG with him....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it all after the quarrel. Wehave many quarrels. n i think mostly i startedthem first. Now that he wanted to concentrate onhis career i guess. Frenz relate their experience to me that saying the r/s is normal. Some din even get in contact wif their gf/ some even 1-3 weeks cost due to bz schedule at work. They keep telling me that he is bz that y he sounded a bit frustrsated. I was being very free at work, yearn for his attention affection which i understand that i cannot be done since he work everyday, n i cant expect him to meet me as n when i like. i juz nid to get adjusted to it now cos it was not the same way as b4.<br><br>Maybe im thinking too much here n there n thus adding pressure to him. I dun realli call him unccessary. He make the calling when he got something to share or go out. I only sms himthose misc sms recently cos he is so cold towards me.Haiz..Love sux</div>
