              <p>simply means be dutiful as it should be as they are your parents...to change a person overnight especially whose mentality has been fixed over such long time is near impossible...if its a genuine case....seek family counselling help if u cannot do it on your own...</p>
              <p>what u have experienced in your current stage of life, dun brood over it...once u r free from that attachment, begin anew and never falter back to their same mentality...</p>

              <p>Frankly, you can't do anything about the parents. The only thing that can be done is give them money, endless amount, and even that is useless as they won't be happy or grateful. So just let them be.</p>
              <p>As for your project mate, he can do something about himself. He must strive to overcome the odds, and better himself. He can only save himself first, before he can help others.</p>
