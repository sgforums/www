I don't know how she feels about me but its like I take 1 step forward, she takes 1 step forward, I take 2 steps forward, she takes 1 step backwards.<br><br>That day, I was discussing with my mother that the most important thing is to get a good spouse. Then my mother compared me to my cousin saying how I've been harping on this girl for years already, while my cousin which is only 1 year older than me already had dozens of girlfriends. She's my mother, how can she not understand that I am the <strong>Devoted</strong> type?<br><br>Which do you think is better? The Devoted type or the Flirtish type?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Dorumon,<br><br>Whilst in most cases, people will prefer the devoted type, I beg to differ.  It depends on the situation.<br><br>1.  If I'm in love with you, &amp; am serious about you, yes, of course I prefer the devoted type.<br><br>2.  However, if I'm Not in love with you, &amp; you're just irritating me with your gestures &amp; scaring me away, then No.  I don't want you to be devoted to me &amp; waste your time.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by Dorumon:<br><strong>I've been wooing this girl for sometime already. I don't know how she feels about me but its like I take 1 step forward, she takes 1 step forward, I take 2 steps forward, she takes 1 step backwards.<br><br>That day, I was discussing with my mother that the most important thing is to get a good spouse. Then my mother compared me to my cousin saying how I've been harping on this girl for years already, while my cousin which is only 1 year older than me already had dozens of girlfriends. She's my mother, how can she not understand that I am the [b]Devoted</strong> type?<br><br>Which do you think is better? The Devoted type or the Flirtish type?[/b]</blockquote></div>
