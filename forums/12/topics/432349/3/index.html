              <p>Get the husband be the shield. Or say the flat is not big enough as you guys are about to start a family and probably a "Big" one?( even though you KIV the plan) Or suggest BTO near their estate and that you will visit them frequently? Then come out with excuses like enjoy couple moment and blah blah. There will confirm have animosity but i dun think that will be permanent. Maybe buy some stuffs for them on every visit? Cant be angry for years right? they will get over it sooner or later. At most. she call up all the aunties and start complaining about in law but then come to think of it, how often do you see them? New year? Christmas? Just smile and skip them la.. </p>
              <p> P/s: I can foresee myself being the unfortunate one.(Coz my bf mum + grandma is such a KPO) so i confirm BTO! Good luck to you!   </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I agree, having a baby don't solve any problem and might even add more problem. First work towards having your own place before settle down to being a parent. Its always best NOT to stay with either side - own and in-law. I have learnt my lesson the hard way. I know not all family is the same, but still the best to enjoy each other company. Moreover, establishing better rapport with each other when baby comes along, both of you will be able to operate as a family on your own. Bonding between 2 parties are very important. As for your in-law, just ignore and tolerate for the time being. Not very good to think of sending her to old folks home just because she is irritating in your eyes. You may never know if anything is to happen, your hubby may blame you for life. Where she stays is your hubby's decision to make.</p></div>

              <p>The chinese saying goes home got one old people is the same as having a pot of gold. Some instead, some get a pot of shit.</p>
              <p>By and large, we must first understand what is old. Since all of us will grow old one of these days, ask yourself, will you be what you are today when you are old? well, you could be thinking I got money, I can travel, enjoy life etc etc...but that is not the case, you may fall sick, go senile like some old uncles here and many other more pyschological and physical effects that will hamper your mental, vision and way of life.</p>
              <p>Be nice to them, they need a listening ear, that is all, your action toward your older folk will protray an example for your children to follow, if you treat your old folks, be it your biological or in laws badly, you can bet that when you are old, your childrens will do it to you, because they see it as norm.</p>

              But on a more serious note - less than 10K is not a great gauge.. 5K is less than 10/k, 8K is also less than 10K. U can buy a place with a combined income of, well, "less than 10K" but I guess you don't want the financial burden associated with it. Unfortunately, we have to pick our battles in life - can't have your cake and eat it. 
              
              U kind of have to decide which riles you more - stress from financial burden or your MIL.. Yr husband's reply sounds typical of someone wanting to end the topic; don't think of it as him taking her side, remember, he's lived with her all his life - the nagging, mahjong playing, interference are things he has been brgt up to live with and thus, something he's used to

              <p><br>aiyo yo, tangalci Manium, sound is good for older folks, your PIL will appreciate if you make more of those noise in bed, it help to rejuvenate your father in law sexual senses to make love with your MIL, ultimately, your MIL will be a more happier woman and be nice to you, make more noises lah.</p>
              <p>If like my sista jojo said, buy TV and video player, which is so cheap now a day, watch porn and up the volume, it can also help your PIL, even yr neighbour may like it. So are the cats and dogs.</p>

              <p><br>i dun make noises, sleep alone still make noises?? then something is very wrong liao.</p>
              <p>No FIL, that is why you got problem, with FIL around, he could had helped you, but nevermind tangal ci, every gals also got problem with MIL, afterall, you are going to be MIL too, funny how, all mother worry about their son getting con by another woman, that is part of woman jealousy and protecting instinct, if you really understand woman and their feeling, you will then understand why she behaves like this, from here, you can better communicate with her in knowing her concern, one of these days when your own son get married, you will feel the same, as some one of your own sex and taken your son, borne by you, brought up by you, love by you, care by you with your life, and suddenly this woman come around and took him away...cruel isn't it.</p>
