              TS,
              
              All these wishing wanting is unnecessary and wasting one's energy. As for your mother in law, nothing is going to change. It is nigh impossible to change another with words or but it is possible to change another with one's behaviour. 
              
              Jojo's suggestion  to be accepting of her is sensible and I would add this - take a look at your own insecurites. Otherwise, ti would eventually implode in you or manifest it in your social cirumstances!

              I had few times, argue with her, asking her not to interfere our private lifes, she will tell her neighbour friends, how bad I treat her, adding this N that too.
              
              We are trying to control our private life to the minimum, as you know, some old flats, no sound proof.
              
              I accept her all the while but she dont accept me, how then ?
              I already do what I should do as daughter inlaw, but she still dont accept me as part of the family, how then ?

              <p>I suggest you take a break from this family life. Let your husband know you need some time to yourself. Be away from the house for a few days.</p>
              <p>Your mother-in law and your husband need to reflect on their own doings too.</p>

              <p>Nothing to do with baby or no baby lah.</p>
              <p>Even you have baby.. she will not change. You think baby will change your status in the family ...and she will start to treat you better ? ..dream on lah.</p>
              <p>Some of my friends also think baby's arrival will change the bad situation to better... in fact.. they get worst. They fight over how to raise the baby.. the old school vs new school methods. They fight over who takes care of the baby.. they fight over the affection of the baby... it's kinda sickening after a while.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your mother in law is trying to establish her position in this family.</p>
              <p>She used to be the Queen of household.. now you come along.. she needs to partially cede power.. her son has to listen to you also wat.</p>
              <p>When baby come along.. she will need to share her son's attention  3 ways ! Soon she'll be throwing a crying fit because no one gives a dang bout her.</p>
              <p>Since your hubby is too weak to fend for you.. then it's time you learn to fend for yourself...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She only dare to bully you because you diam diam.. smash a few tables and throw a few chairs.. she will guai guai eventually lor.</p>
              <p>If your hubby complain.. just remind him that woman is not your mother.. yours is still alive somewhere.</p>

              <p>I agree with what JoJo said that things will get worse if you don't resolve current issues and have a baby. </p>
              <p>I have friends caught in similar situations especially If husband is spineless and MIL is a wayang bitch, it can be really terrible. </p>
              <p>But one thing la, I really marvel them lor coz with the amt of stress I get at work and if my MIL is such a bitch I think I really don't give face one lor. In fact this is the fact my mum is most worried about coz she knows my tolerance threshold with wayang and dramas is  very very low and tell me if ever live with MIL must "REN"</p>
              <p>I told her no promises <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> but ok la, though we don't live with my MIL, I don't think we will have anything to quarrel about since there is a language problem in the first place and if anything happens, the poor guy will be MPB coz he will have to be the translator </p>

              <p>Anyway no baby the problem may not lie with you but with him. Especially if your husband drinks or/and smokes coupled with stress it can also lead to low sperm count.</p>

              <p>Depends on what kind of mommy you have lah.</p>
              <p>Some mother/in-laws know to mind their own business and are really nice to have around especially when you have kids. They are nurturing yet not intrusive.</p>
              <p>The only problem is ... a lot of couples can't enjoy sex when their parents are right next bedroom you see. At night.. where you expect your parents to go ?</p>
