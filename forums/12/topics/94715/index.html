If he is having any second thoughts, that's his problem to deal with, not you. He can do silly things like trying to confuse your heart and mind, but if you were to think about it, you are being affected by his spell because there are still opening in your heart that allow entry of his nonsense in. Don't let it shake your decision on leaving him and take control of your emotions.<br><br>It seemed that he has NOT only truely hurt you, but made quite an impact into your life as well. Promise or not, it doesn't matter. But you have grown and his presence caught your tail - <strong>if you have truely moved on, what he can attempt, doesn't matter at all.</strong><br><br>Relationships made from dubious ground often die in similar fate. You already know what he is like, that should serve to reinforce your stand. You are minding because you have not got used.
