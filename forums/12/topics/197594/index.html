There are alot more opportunities for you to develop your character and gain experiences from many aspects as compared to SIM. To me it's like, SIM is your house garden whereas SMU is the Botanical Gardens.<br><br>At the moment, perhaps people can say that SIM and SMU degrees make graduates equally employable, assuming it's a 2nd upper and above-degree for SIM. But employers may favor SMU graduates because they get the impression that SMU graduates are more well-rounded. In the long run, I think SMU graduates are the ones who will find things easier.<br><br>In conclusion, if I only had SIM and SMU to pick from, assuming both will accept me, I will choose SMU.</div>

SIM is also rather good and its a private uni,the cost would be rather high.<br>just follow wat ur mind tink. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>all the best. u will cum to a decision soon. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
