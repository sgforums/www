            <div class='col-md body'>but nowadays external degrees meaning external papers? they have the same recognition as you study overseas, only different environment sia...<br>taking a degree from unis like Manchester would mean you study more theory. Degrees frm the states would mean much more practical and australian degrees offer a better combination of both.<br>Getting a degree is just a stepping stone to enter any company. Of course good results pay off. But in real life, employers value experience more.<br>Anyway, whatever you studied is probably not what you want to become in real life. You might take a management degree and end up in medical field as a salesperson.<br>Girls who took their degree also end up working as cabin crews for SIA<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

SIM is divided into 2. One is UniSim, which is the 4th university u are talking about. The other is one that offers foreign degrees. And UniSIM has 3 criterias. U must be above 21, have A-LEVELS, and also have minimum 2 years working experience. Out of the 3 critieria, u must fulfil 2 of them. as for the other arm, the one that offers foreign degrees, the criteria differs for each course.<br><br>Hope it helps!</div>
