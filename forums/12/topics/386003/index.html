              <p>Hey all, i've something that's on my mind for quite some time. Firstly, i'm a guy of... legal age.</p>
              <p>Well my problem is that recently i asked my girl for a quick BJ, (shall not elaborate for those that do not understand for obvious purposes...) in the middle of the staircase of a 20 floors HDB flat however, in the process i suddenly saw 2 aged residents walking out of the lifts.</p>
              <p>My first reaction when i saw them was to quickly... zip my thing up and pretend nothing was going on. However my girl told me that she thinks she knows the two of them but didn't knew that the couple lived in that particular HDB block.</p>
              <p>Although both of us had all of our clothings on, fully, nothing undressed or anything... just.. in an awkward position with me standing and her squating.</p>
              <p>Now i am worried that IF the couple is the one she knows, she might get into trouble if they tell her parents. Both of us are of legal age but just that her family is very strict but loving.</p>
              <p>I'm not too entirely sure if the couple saw and realised what was going on as we were fully dressed and the couple just walked past ignoring us.... Maybe they were pretending or they just didnt see anything... I don't know.</p>
              <p>I know it's my fault for attempting this stunt and i'm regretting it as i'm typing.... Advices or help anyone? Oh and yes... i'm a greenhorn (New).</p>

              <p>EDIT: I hope i got the right topic under the right forum as this is a real problem that i'm worried sick with. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Would worrying serve any purpose?</p>
              <p>If you decide to do anything, you should always be prepared for any consequences esp doing such acts in public. Its stupid to do it on the level with a lift which brings more human traffic as well unless the thrill of being seen was a factor in your choice...</p>
              <p>Whether the old couple saw anot or whether they will inform the girl's parents is not anything anyone can predict or know so what sort of advice/help are you really hoping for?</p>

              <p><br>Best way to avoid getting into similar worrying situation again is to faster realise that  you should NOT DO IT again.</p>

              <p>It's around the Jurong area that's all i will reveal. Hmm... not too much constructive comments with the exception of a few. I agree that this kinda act is too risky and it's not worth worrying now.</p>
              <p>On another note, the thrill of being discovered isn't worth the price to pay in this case too. :)</p>
              <p>Time to pray then. Thanks to all who replied.</p>

              <p>1. As you mentioned that the incident had already been 'some time passed', and nothing came out of it, you can safely put your mind to rest that you will be reported to the police. It wont be or even had been reported. And besides, I doubt if they had any photographic evidence to substantiate your indecent act in a public place.</p>
              <p>2. Your gf may have known the elderly couple, but since they did not have a good look or caught you literally with your pants down, it is likely that you both had been given the benefit of the doubt, and the act brushed aside or forgotten. Denial will get you both off the hook anyway, for your gf could have been trying to help you zip up your pants or seeking solace from you on a begging position.</p>
              <p>3. Guilt is a double edged sword:- it can make you aware of your wrongful acts, to know what is wrong so that you will not do it again. OR it can gnaw at your mind and hinder you from progressing and moving on in life. Only the truth and facts will set you free.</p>
              <p>4. In this liberal day and age, not many may would think it is wrong to do what you had done, even if both of you are below 18, but I sincerly hope that you would at least respect women and control your raging hormones.</p>
              <p>Love is more than sex, and should at least reserve it when both of you are more sure of yourself, so that you both may comprehend the true joy of love a sexual union will bring, made more meaningful through a mutual and lasting committment to each other.</p>
              <p>5. Lastly, please think again before committing such acts espacially in public, not just because you would be discovered, but because love is not a sex game to even adults. Today is oral sex, what's the next sexual discovery and the life impacting consequences?...see what i mean on where it will lead to? </p>

              <p>Your points are very comforting and enlightening. I strongly agree on your views. What i'm feeling now should be guilt, i guess i should channel my energy to correct this mistake i made due to.. raging hormones instead of endless worrying which will bring me nothing except uneasiness.</p>
              <p>All in all i guess there's still a long road ahead for me and the meaning of love and commitment... hmm.. maybe i should take the route of discovering that instead of heading down the dangerous "desires" route.</p>
              <p>I see your points and am grateful for your advices. Thanks empowerment.</p>
