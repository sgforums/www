            <div class='col-md body'>Let me ask u guys one question. If there was a girl who was very practical to be with (can work well with you and make your life quite comfy) would you take the girl as your gf even if you have no feelings towards her? The girl seems to have some feelings towards you. In such a situation can love be cultivated, like enter into a r/s with her and try to like her? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear RamblingJoe,<br><br>It's been a long time since you've posted.  How are you, &amp; how is working in Vietnam? : )<br><br>To answer your question, I would hope that my guy isn't with me because of whatever I can bring him, but because he genuinely loves me for who I am.  Just pose yourself the question, whether or Not you would feel good if you found out that a girl wanted to be with you because of the security you bring, Not due to your personality.<br><br>It's hard to fall in love with someone after splitting with someone whom you'd loved for a long time, but before you enter a relationship now, please give yourself enough time to heal.  Only then, will you be able to enter another relationship for the right reason, love.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ramblingjoe:</div><div class="quote_body">Let me ask u guys one question.

Often there're 2 main ways in which things can work out....<br><br>The 1st being the more common one nowadays is to have love... And from there, try to shape it into a lasting (if that's what the couple wants) relationship.... Okie... Maybe I should say 'fulfilling relationship' are better words...?<br><br>The 2nd would be sort of like what Tuatau has suggested and the topic starter has brought up.... 2 people fit into a picture, and see if they can find love out of it.... A more 'misty' way of putting it would be how friendships can develop into love relationships...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You could try to develop the friendship and see if sparks fly... before you commit to a relationship.   If you're still not fond of her, I don't see why you should bother.  Keep her as a friend.<br><br>I'd be  insulted if a guy were with me for convenience.  A relationship is not a 7-11 store, hon.<br><br>As for Tautau's previous post about lasting relationships in our parents' generation ... that's because the cost of divorce was so great that it's a major deterrent.   Now, the option of opting out is easy.   We've totally different mindsets and you won't react like someone from the past generation.<br><br>The dollar and sense mentioned by countdracula is practical but you're not hiring an accountant, nor are you considering marriage yet, so it's not entirely relevant.  Anyway being friends first allows you to find out more about her values and priorities.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ramblingjoe:</div><div class="quote_body">Let me ask u guys one question. If there was a girl who was very practical to be with (can work well with you and make your life quite comfy) would you take the girl as your gf even if you have no feelings towards her? The girl seems to have some feelings towards you. In such a situation can love be cultivated, like enter into a r/s with her and try to like her? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi countdracula<br><br>FYI, I am walking the walk.<br><br>I get your point about money being important in a marriage.  No money = hard life, poor standard of living for family, etc.  I don't refute that.<br><br>Neither did I claim that money ranks lowly in a marriage.  What I meant was ramblingjoe was looking for a gf not a wife thus the situation isn't exactly the same.  But I get that you're warning him of what may come.<br><br>So what are you recommending ramblingjoe do, find a girlfriend or wife purely based on her income potential, financial contribution, and attitude to work and family?<br><br>You know the irony is, if a girl found a husband that way, she'd be called "materialistic " .<br><br>What if feelings don't grow after being together?  End up with a filthy rich couple who hate each other to the core?  That's happiness?<br><br>I think a balance can be achieved.  Personally the very seed of a relationship should be a liking for each other.  After that, the practicalities come in, atittudes to money, career, priorities, etc.<br><br>I don't agreee that practicalities should come before spark.  However that doesn't mean that practicalities should be neglected in preference of the spark.</div>
