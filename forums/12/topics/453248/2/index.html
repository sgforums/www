              <p><br><br>REPORT:<strong> DENIS EDWARD</strong><br><br>SHE was an average student who never knew what she wanted to do in life.<br><br>  But Miss Kylie Chim, 25, would eventually find her calling during a life coaching course last December.<br><br>  The Singapore PR from Macau discovered during the three month course, held in Hong Kong, that she wanted to help other young people find their passion.<br><br>  Said Miss Chim: "During the course, I was provoked into thinking about my calling in life and the values I want.<br><br>  "I found that most young people dont realise their full potential, and I was one of them."<br><br>  The former Shuqun Secondary School student has made her wish to help others a reality by single-handedly rallying a group of volunteers, well-known speakers and life coaches to launch The Powerful Self Workshop. (See details on right.)<br><br>  The free workshop, which will be held this Saturday and Sunday at the Civil Service College, targets people aged 16 to 25.<br><br>  Miss Chim, who plans to be a certified life coach herself in future, said: "I have not had the proper training to run my own life coaching workshops yet.<br><br>  "But I'm very glad that volunteers, life coaches, speakers and generous sponsorS have made this workshop possible."<br><br>  Miss Chim, currently a part-time student at the Marketing Institute of Singapore, finds it challenging to balance her studies and prepare for this workshop.<br><br>  Her parents, who are also Singapore PRs but now live in Macau, have told her to forget about the workshop and focus on school, instead.</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: 115%; color: red;">Perseveres</span><br><br>  But Miss Chim, who has three younger siblings aged between 15 and 18, perseveres.<br><br>  "It has not been easy at all, but it is important to help young people find direction in life," she said.<br><br>  "Many young people I know are easily distracted by material things and they only want to enjoy themselves.<br><br>  "They have not found their innermost passion and what they want to achieve.<br><br>  "I also notice that many young people put their dreams on hold because they want to do things that are acceptable to their friends.<br><br>  "I really hope that those who attend the workshop will find direction in life and develop good values."<br><br>  Miss Chim, who has received $15,000 from sponsors, such as Club Lotus, to run this weekend's workshop, hopes to organise more free workshops for youths in future.<br><br>  Her ultimate aim?<br><br>  "I want  to start  my own life coaching  academy  to train other life coaches. <br>              .<br>  "Being a life coach is a (beautiful) calling and I hope that everyone can find their passion and go on to fulfil their full potential."</p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 18pt; line-height: 115%;">FYI</span><br><br>THE Powerful Self Workshop,sponsored by Nextra Marketing and Business Consulting, Sky 21 Bar &amp; Restaurcmt and Club Lotus,will be held this Saturday and Sunday at the Civil Service College Auditorium.<br><br>  The free workshop, Which starts at 9am and ends at 8pm on both days, is only open to people aged between 16 and 25.<br><br>  The keynote speaker,Mr Stuart Tan, who has been a trainer since 1994, will conducting most of the sessions - including activities to "raise awareness of one's potential".<br><br>  Guest speakers, such as master coach Kelvin Lim, will also handle some sessions.<br><br>  About 150 people have signed up and there are still 150 places available.<br><br>  Those who are interested in taking part should e-mail Miss Kylie at <a href="mailto:kylie@thepowerfulself.com">kylie@thepowerfulself.com</a></p>

I'm not just referring to physical evidences of bully victims (note: miyuki miinggui is not just up against bullying, she spearheaded this support group with other concerns as well), but also scientifically proven statistics and evidences of the psychological impacts that her various concerns have on school students.</div>

              <p>I only know when I was in the Principal's office, I told my Principal her idea was wrong. She insisted, and since my parents think she is right, I decided I am not paying for the extras so I just need to prove them wrong (including my parents).</p>
              <p>When I not happy with the way how they do things, I don't turn up for school and classes to show my contempt (+laziness).</p>
              <p>When my Principal see my results, her face turned black. Why? I proved her wrong and got good grades when she cursed me back then that I will fail if I stopped turning up for classes.</p>
