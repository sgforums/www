              Yes, it is true that of all the concerns about changes in our education system, none gets our attention so quickly as that of a child's well-being. It is important to build a tripartite relationship, that is, between your family, your school and yourself, since you said that you want to achieve your aim using peaceful measures, having good communication will be the key to revolution? :)

              <p>I am not a student anymore and I can only say, there are other help channels available with professional counselors like SOS. Neither are we capable of helping you if you cannot explain the bullying situation.</p>

              <p>Long ago, schools were started by missionaries,volunteers, nuns n priests teach.</p>
              <p>Nowadays, schools r just institutions, churning out educated work force to fill heirachies. Exams, tests r meant to identify n segregate the elite students n average students.</p>
              <p>Elites fill the top pyramid, average forms bulk of the lower rungs hierarchy.</p>
              <p>My guess is u r feeling trapped, hence ur psychosis/delusion as a form of escape.</p>
              <p>Students hav no alternative, other than school. So it's easy to fall into depression n hopelessness when school life rnt working out. Worst when parents don't know what to do for their kids.</p>
              <p>Its tough being a teenager, true, but life goes on. </p>
              <p>Teachers don't need to care , why should they ? What u decide to do with your life does not affect them. They don't live their life through u.</p>
              <p>If u do well, they don't get a n extra leg. If u fail, too bad for u.</p>
              <p>Sure, life sucks at school, well u won't be in there forever. An education is what u need to get yourself out of a meaningless existence. </p>
              <p>Focus on getting that education. Teachers r just facilitators, they don't decide your life, u do.</p>

              <p>Gotta know how to channel the anger the rage the frustration into positive energies that will push you to succeed.</p>
              <p>You are young. Time is on your side. At the moment you are insignificant. You words bear little or no weight. You  have nothing to show and nothing to prove yet. Killing yourself may raise SOME awareness, but life goes on and you will just become a number.. a statistic in teen suicide.</p>
              <p>You have to understand that to challenge the system, you have to beat the system in it's own rules first. E.g get your qualifications and subsequently become a professional or academic, THEN its time to serve them a hard cold plate pay back.</p>
              <p>You have to have a goal and a plan to reach that goal. And NEVER forget. Now make a list.. put down some names. And start working towards your goal.</p>
              <p>Patience and timing is key. By the time you decide to challenge the system or the person,  you would have already been preparing all those years for that moment, and nothing will stop you. Unless you are dead of course. </p>

              <p>Teachers are not Gods, you know. They are humanbeing therefore they got their own imperfections too. Don't place so much expectations on them. You need to find the strength in yourself. Or if you need a friend who never fails you, you can find me. I stand up against bullies for you.</p>
              <p>Don't feel depress. Don't think about suicide. If you need a hug, if you need a friend or a boyfriend, I will always be there for you. Hehehe.</p>
