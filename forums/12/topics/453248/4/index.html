              <p>Changes start from within.</p>
              <p>Like you I am a non conformist, I am always questioning the authority or credentials of people or certain decisions made when I felt it was unfair.</p>
              <p>But what you're fighting against isn't really the system. You 
                                                  actually fighting against the people within the system.There are some 
                                                  who would evidently change the system to suit themselves and then try to
                                                   have you believe that it has been that way all along.</p>
              <p>People are 
                                                  unique individuals and you can't really expect everybody to be on the 
                                                  same wave length as you. Not everyone will just back down when being 
                                                  directly challanged. Infact many will retaliate back.</p>
              <p>Likewise not many want to spent the time and energy or risk when fighting for changes. Most are lazy and would definately take the easy way out.</p>
              <p>How you fight for changes or what you believe in is also 
                                                  very important. Fighting for a noble cause is admirable, but when done 
                                                  wrongly is more harmful then beneficial...take Mikhail Khodorkovsky for 
                                                  example. I'll leave an article of him if you want to read, It is very 
                                                  intresting to me.</p>
              <p>http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/04/vladimir-putin-mikhail-khodorkovsky-russia</p>
              <p>When you're self destructive don't expect anyone to take you 
                                                  seriously. If you do really want to change thing, you should do as some 
                                                  have suggested, which is to get an education, then a better 
                                                  understanding of what you're really fighting for and if its worth it.</p>
              <p>Even if you do fail, pick yourself up and do not change or compromsie yourself just because of that. Instead learn what you must do and not do.</p>
              <p>Last but not least thank the teacher for showing her ugly biased selfish uncaring side towards you BECAUSE it is through that that you will know how to treat others in future and how to become a better person unlike her. Likewise forgive her because she is someone who you would not like to turn into, NEVER let your own hatred consume you. Changes do start from within....question is how???</p>
              <p>And I do not believe you to be crazy, crazy pople will never admit they're crazy <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png">. You're just someone who wants to be heard thats all. Something which each of us really wished but never got the opportunity to be heard :)</p>
              <p>Have a look at the elections ba, you will definately see a change in the past elections compared to the recents one...people are trying to get their voices heard :)</p>
              <p>They will pave the way for the new generation....</p>

              <h6>Tired of being ignored? Want someone to care? Being
              bullied and yet no one to speak up for you? Want your voices to be
              heard? Or simply tired of the education system of Singapore?*<br> <br> Then join STR2012 (you will know the meaning of this name once you
              join the FB group). Our motives are to change the attitude of
              teachers towards students's emotional and mental problem and to
              improve the education system of Singapore.*<br> <br> Recently, Aideen and I had emailed MOE and they've replied, saying
              they have sent our emails to the relevant departments and their
              officers will contact us directly. We will not be satisfied until
              we see then carry out measures to prevent more of such cases from
              happening.<br> <br> A lot of you may have wondered: Why can't we dress and cut our hair
              with freedom? Why must we have exams and tests? Why must we wake up
              so early and stay in school till such a late time? Why are my
              teachers so biased? Are some teachers even qualified to be teachers
              at all?<br> <br> But most of you have seen the above as norms. Where has hope and
              determination gone to? We must change these, to provide a better
              place for learning.*<br> <br> If you are keen, please join STR2012 Facebook group: (since i cant
              post any external links, please go FB and search for STR2012 and
              choose the one that has an icon of a fist. If not, type in facebook
              website as per normal, then followed by groups/426058207426569/)
              More informations will be given there. Anyone are welcome, as long
              as you are brave enough to make your stand and wants to bring about
              changes to singapore's education system.*<br> <br> Best regards,<br> Miyuki and Aiko<br> Founder of STR2012<br> <br> <br> Motives:<br> -To bring about a better education system<br> -Change teachers's attitude towards student's emotional and mental
              problems<br> <br> Expectations:<br> -MOE to carry out the necessary actions, not simply talk and
              nothing done<br> <br> Goal:<br> -To make every student in Singapore enjoy learning<br> -To reduce the number of depressed or psychological cases among
              students<br> <br> How?<br> -Peaceful measures<br> -Email MOE our views and opinions, not stopping till they meet our
              expectation<br> -In case you don't know how MOE works, MOE actually will not ignore
              our emails. They read through every email carefully</h6>
