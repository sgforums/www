She can have bfs at the meantime, she can even change her bfs, but it does not matter as long as she comes back to you finally right ? It is a trial and error process in life. After all the r/s she has, she may finally find that you are the most suitable one. Who knows ?<br><br>One day the love in her heart may start to grow for you. It takes time for love to grow.<br><br>Once upon a time, I used to think that a ger is THE ONE for me, until one occasion when we got to travel together .... for a few months ..... i gradually can't stand her !

Miracles might happen ... as for me ... 6 months ago i met her ... we didn't know each other, but i felt she was the one for me ... a month later, i knew her and another one month later, i told her i love her due to some circumstances ... she didn't say anything ... and now, 1 month ago ... she said she likes me ... but we're still not together now due to alot of problems which i decline to mention ... but just to prove to you ... sometimes persistantence works  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ... i only chat to her in icq/irc ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi aaron84z<br><br>Thanks. But something strange happened. She is totally ignoring me. I sent her gifts from time to time, still nothing, not even a thank you, nor a "don't do that". The only conclusion I can arrive at is she's really determined to make me forget her. And I know she's not the kind who can be swayed. I hope I can forget her totally, because it hurts when I see her or when I hear her name.</div>
