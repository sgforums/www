It would be great if he/she is evolved and knows what's best for the greater good of the relationship. Note: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Its for the greater good, not for personal know-best </span>- how many have actual fallen for the latter thinking that it was the best course of action? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I hate it when people relatively older than me automatically shuts down when it comes to issues of love. Supposedly they 'know' more and unconsciously close the valve to listen - I listen to the words and I know where the damaged roots came from, but the autocratic speaker close listening ears and chose to impart, not to accept.<br><br><blockquote> <strong>"Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young, but set an example for the believers in speech, in life, in love, in faith and in purity."<br>1 Timothy 4:12</strong> </blockquote>Although I am not a christian, I loved this phrase. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Been trying to haul people up the boat and save them from emotional destruction and I hate being in situations where I have to hold back my words because I need to practice Libra's Harmony for the moment. I hate having to be in situations where I don't want to be there, but I can't because I am the only one left. When I strengthen others, other others words and behavior tear down my reinforcement. Faith and willpower wears off... its ok - but the fringing` problem is that my time is ticking, I can't always be there. I am fearing because there is simply NONE that could substitute my role in them.<br><br>The farking problem of being an Aunt Agony is when you know both side so well, you wanna retreat and let karma and experience be their guide instead. But can you chose to abandon your knowledge and seal lips? <strong>Can you chose to watch misery, yet know misery and not prevent misery?</strong><br><br>A quick check of astrology and the current planetary movements revealed a karmic period with certain sign.<br><br>Really... a real test of my aunt agony role. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

For example, would you save a rabbit if it's attacked by an eagle? If yes, then what about the hungry eaglets waiting for the eagle? That's how nature works.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Yunnie...<br><br>just a few tots aft skimming thru some of the posts...<br><br>the world is such that pple judge others based on criterias that are not impt to the issue at hand. not many pple out there realise they are not as smart/wise as they think they are. do not let pple who discredit you based on age, sex, religion, looks, etc affect you. if they want to listen, they will. understandably some of these pple are frens u care abt, some times they just need a listening ear? (ah.. think u know that better than most of us <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> )<br><br>you have proven to give sensible and well thought out answers to many of the confused/heartbroken pple. guess sometimes it is time for things to ride out on their own. if the pits is where they wanna go, let them be. as a fren, you have done more then u can by caring enough to try to stop them from heading for disaster. i'm sure your real life frens are very blessed to have the counsel of a such a wonderful person.<br><br>aside, the full context of the bible verse may not be in the context that you are using it for, which does make some uncomfortable (okie i am uncomfortable). but i guess you got part of it's meaning <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>don't let foolish pple put doubts in your confidence, everyone just gotta realise they are still so many things in the world they know not of.<br><br>take care fren, though virtual but still a fren <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Cheers mate!<br>the_don</div>

Sorry to quote something from the bible, as I'm a christian. The bible actually stated that Jesus only healed MOST(Not ALL) sick or demon-possessed ppl in villages, coz he knows his strength is not perfect and can't endure curing everyone even when his disciples persuade him to continue. Only God can do that. There's no underlying intention of asking you to believe in God and Jesus, but hope to let you know that we, afterall, are just human beings.<br><br>From your posts that I have read, you have already done a fantastic job!<br></div></blockquote></div>
