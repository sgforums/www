She had long time in her to end it.. But then she doesn't know how and where to start from.. So now that you both are arguing over this small little matter.. mine as well call it off..<br><br>Well.. when one started to work.. environment change.. and then you also get to meet more people in the society.. intereact more also.. she also need to adapt to the changes.. But then.. her drastic change in her and towards you and this relationship changes alot.. the topics that you used to talk to seems so different.. it seems tat you both are drifted apart.. she begin to take things for granted..<br><br>If you really feel that you need an explanation on this.. then call her one day and jus talked about as a friend... since both aren't together anymore.. Ask her what really happen to her.. She might have reason reacting in such a way.. But remember when you talked don't ever raise your voice.. talk in a lower tone.. and stay calm.. Slowly talk and let her open up..<br><br>But if she really insisted not to get back together don't force her.. though you really do love her alot.. get the reason and be happy with it.. happiness does not depend on outward things... but on the way we see them.. Move on.. and start afresh..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
