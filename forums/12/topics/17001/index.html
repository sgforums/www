            <div class='col-md body'>this is embarrassing to say because i have never actually made public in forums what i feel...<br>i hope some of you can advise me quite reasonably and sensibly to the following situation.<br><br>I met this guy through a girl friend of mine. I didn't feel anything towards him at first sight because quite honestly he is not goodlooking but pleasant enough.<br>After he met me and we went out together(with friends), he told my friend that he thought i was cute. My friend is really good friends with him so she told me what he thought about me.<br>The thing is that the term "cute" is used very loosely so....i don't know..<br>anyway, what happened next was he asked my friend for my ICQ #. We chat occasionally but i realized that recently he doesn't talk to me if i am online. Is he being shy? or has lost interest? am i just being too paranoid about what he thinks of me?<br>Of course when i start a conversation with him he always replies back but why doesn't he try to start a convo with me first?<br><br>Before this, whenever we went out(always with friends)he makes tons of eye contact with me. And he talks to me quite a bit but only when there are no one around. When we're with friends he seems to be quiet around me...<br>Once i mentioned i like a type of snack, the next time he came he brought the snack for me. Just being a nice guy or..?????<br><br>The worst part is that i've started to kind of like him because of the little gestures he seemingly projects towards me.<br><br>PLease advise as to what i should do next. Should i make a move...can u advise me on specific things that i should do to show him i have a little interest in him and yet not seem desperate.<br><br>I'm just so confuse. Maybe he just thought i was cute and that was it....<br>what do u think?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well the usual deal with guys is that if we show interest and there is no response we tend to back off. It's common because so many girls here just like to "play" with guys. Keep them on the line with no real intention of doing anything. When the guy loses interest the girl makes and effort and then when he responds she backs off. Chances are your guy doesn't want to put up with this sort of crap and therefore only responds when you initiate things. If you like him tell him directly and quit waiting for him to work it out because he probably just thinks you're playing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>vs_junjihyun:<br><br>Pardon me but I believe u are still quite young. U might wanna give yourself more time and opportunities with the outside world. There are still a couple of gentlemen out there who are mindful of these little gentlemenly actions. So don't start throwing your feelings towards them when u are treated with one.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>But judging by the reaction he is portraying, he could be having some affection towards u. U can always test him out, but do be careful and don't frighten him off.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>PS: I hardly think guys can be frightened off by such things.
