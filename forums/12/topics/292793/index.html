Its only when I was chatting with my friends that they commented that the guys were actually interested in me. So, when I decided to give it a try, the next minute when you finally get in touch with the guy within a 2-week span, the guy had already found himself a gf.<br><br>So, this sometimes keeps me wondering that am I really that undesirable for someone to wait around longer than that 2 weeks....<br><br>Well, of course, I would agree with some forumners that it is better to move on if you realised that the person you are interested in, is not interested in you. But if the person that they met is like me, then, maybe, they would have miss something, isn't it?<br><br>Why do guys only drop hints and don't ask directly? I guess it has to do with age. The older a person gets, the more subtle they become. hmm....</div></blockquote>What if a person whom you don't like confessed to you. What will you do? Will the friendship with him be strained? Please stand from his point of view and think.</div>

And yes, I will be friends with him. This happened to me before after I confessed to the guy, years back, and even though we are not an item, we still keep the friendship. Sometimes, its easier to move on when there is a closure, even if the result is not what you wanted.<br><br>But, I guess, not many people are like me.<br><br>I don't blame those guys behaving like that at all. Their behaviour are normal. That happens to girls as well. However, their actions just made me think that I am that undesirable to for them to hang around for more than 2 weeks. Thats depressing!<br><br>Hahaha...</div>
