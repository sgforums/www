Going 2 any dates, I'm for an open mind n ready to accept rejection. I say before even 4 1st date I dun expect love on first sight to be my gf. Relationship needs time to build on..

It is irritating to receive irrelevant calls and sms frm guys who juz wan to be frens. Girls haf better things to do, unless they are lonely and desperate. So I suggest, u stop being so pushy. And, do not try to befren so many girls, it will only make u seem buaya and unappealing. Choose those u really feel u like her. Stammering is definitely a no-no, as much as guys like girls with attitude, girls like guys with confidence.

You nv noe, perhaps they spent yrs wooing the ger? Such things juz depend on fate... I think you shud get a girlfren u really like and not try to noe every girl in the hope that one will eventually be yr gf. This is unfair to the girl and a mockery to relationships.<br><br>*Hope you make wiser decisions in making frens in future.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

When the time comes it'll COME.... Ask only when time is APPROPRIATE and things seem ok... And stop having the 'friends only INTIALLY' &amp; 'don't expect them to become my gf AT 1st SIGHT' mentality... That's your problem... You're NERVOUS and you still cling on to such MENTALITY... Gonna kill you even more....<br><br>Finally, you're pretty much getting quite a lot of good advices here...

In reality, most girls prefer decent looking over good looking and if anything below what they deemed as decent looking, then its a problem if you wanna further any relationship. Good looking guys have its advantage because they would get all the attention from the girls, but there is one important point - There is only a fine line difference between ADMIRATION and THE ONE YOU WILL GET. Everyone likes to look at pretty things, no doubt, but looking/admiring/etc does not anything.<br><br>Trying to ask a girl out is an attempt, but is it a good attempt or a bad one? Any guy could ask a girl out, but its HOW THEY MAKE THEM FEEL comfortable when they are with you that differentiate them from you. Don't talk about being together, talk about being as a causal friends. You said you will get nervous knowing the girl initially, but have it ever come across your mind that this will cause the girl to become nervous too? Woman are sensitive creature and will be able to detect any slight uncomfortability in you which will make them uneasy. Stammering betray your lack of self confidence when approaching woman and when you stop stammering, it does not mean that she would also be at ease at the period of time. What you have been talking about is only about YOU yourself and YOUR point of view. Do you really know what is she really feeling? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> When woman are uneasy, they are likely to be defensive which hinder your wanting to know them more as a friend. Thats constitute the reason why they may not be that willing to open up or know you better as a person.<br><br>Being older or younger is no measure of maturity, for I bet you will shocked to realise that you are being lectured/enlighten/etc by someone who is 7 years your junior, which again explain that age has nothing to do with maturity. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You said you can't stand guys without looks and can get gf so easily. This explain my first point - girls prefer decent looking (of their own personal standard) over good looking ones. And this last part that you mention is a huge MAJOR preception error.<br><br>1) You said guys get them 'easily' - How ON earth do you know that there is no conflict, no hardwork, nothing involved before they were together?<br><br>2) You said that these guys managed to know girls that understand them - Again, how you know? People on the street seemed happy together, but when they have arguments, they fight, do you think you could see all these on the street? Their problems: could you see through the image of THINKING they are happily together WITHOUT conflicts?<br><br>Don't rant about these guys whom you think have all the luck and stuff because only YOU could figure out why things are turning out to be this way. Don't have to change your character because of this, just change the way woman see and feel about you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
