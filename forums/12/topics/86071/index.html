            <div class='col-md body'>u r not the only one counting time till break .. then home! everyone also the same!<br><br>but 1st u have to think about why u decide on nursing in the 1st place. maybe u have seen those tv dramas about nurses, wah patient so nice, fellow nurse so handsome. can get romantic with handsome doctors! those are far and few lor. the good side...<br><br>Now u experiencing the darker side. bad patients, stress, no rest etc. its of course different from study, thats why its called attachment. its a taste of what is to come when u become a nurse. now u understudy nurse and u feel stress, imagine the stress when u become a qualified nurse. do all the shit, endure all the tantrums by the patients and still have to smile when u feeling miserable. thats why nursing also a pretty highly paid job. it really needs one to be totally committed and self sacrificing to be a good nurse.<br><br>Not to scare u. I got a friend whose wife is a nurse. she always busy with her work and tired, especially during the sars scare time while he work shift and got more spare time. slowly they drifted apart. when they divorce, the guy had a baby by another woman  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>All in all, its really up to u to decide if really want to be a nurse. u have to be mentally prepared if u wanna be a good one lor.</div>
