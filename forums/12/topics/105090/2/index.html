            <div class='col-md body'>Look at the bright side of life. Keep yourself occupied, read love novels instead of getting into relationships, go out with friends when you are feeling low, pay the beach a visit perhaps in the evening and stare into the endless sea when you are depressed, talk to your relatives or parents if your feel insecured, dance when you are feeling happy, singing if you are joyful, pray silently if you are afraid, lacking love? Organise a outing with your cousins, reminicise about the old times. Lacking a sense of fulfillment? Try doing some charity work, do not know where to start from? Thats whats friends are for, ask them. feeling horny? Im sure your could please yourself easily, theres no need for a third party. Suffering with no one to pour your sorrows to? There is Aaron, Heng, And so many more in Sgforums that would lend a listening ear. Totally crapped with the busy work schedule that keeps repeating itself? try a vacation to somewhere far, perhaps japan? Check out those frozen cherry blossoms, they are a sight not to be missed.. Don't really like sceneries? you could spend the whole day searching for the best bargains in fashion or explore small stores that sells homemade stuffs or try the local sushi stores: Cheap and delicious. Japan is too far? Try malaysia or Australlia? THey both have their own attractions, just spend a little time off work to research on the countries you plan to visit, Feel lonely just going by yourself? Organise it as a group outing, or perhaps ask a good friend along. Problems with love life? Haha.. Experience gained is always a positive thing. Try and try again. Failure may come, but we are all human. But, choose wisely, the pain from the heart  really hurts badly from a seemingly perfect relationship. Bored with life? Try learning a foreign language, study that foreign country's culture, understand their beliefs. Or Distract yourself with self improvement courses that could ensure you a job promotion, improve your love life, etc. etc. .. An, one of the most novel way of keeping yourself occupied. Keep a diary, address it to a imaginary friend. This, may seem childish, but, effective. If you go to sleep knowing you have written down what has happened yesterday, you will sleep easier. Love yourself, and you are ready to love others, respect yourself, and you are ready to respect others, be true to yourself, and find friends that are true to you. If you still feel a sense of loneliness. Perhaps, I say perhaps, you could join a religion, such as catholic, or christianity, or in fact buddhisim. It doesn't hurt to try, you don't need to instantly convert, you could hang out with these religious people to try out first. Hmm... Alright. I think i wrote too much. Sorry guys, im too lazy to do paragraphing.. Zzz ^_^ take care and goodnitez~<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i do keep a dairy. A habbit from 12 till now... never stopped. BUt then i realized the same cycle kept repeating, falling in love then outta love. you study, then graduate, find a job, turn 18, faster go learn driving... everything is so "Singaporean Routine" lor... even go out with friends, what else they talk about? the typical Singaporean stuff. Cars, Houses, recent tour to Europe, japan... how many kids... some even better, long long time never see, meet up gimme invitation to wedding... It's just depressing.<br><br>I have been reading this Sgforums for quite sometime though i joined only in July.

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly, what  _Aaron_ suggested is not totally wrong... it depends on your motive. If you are sincere to start a new relationship to get out from the past, it's nothing really wrong, though the idea sound not so right (what talking me???), anyway you get the point?<br><br>So long your motive is not for "past- time" or other intentions knowing well that it'll hurt him/ her...</div>

But that's no reason not to love..<br><br>If we give up at something, even though it causes us pain, you're not looking at the ultimate goal.<br><br>Dare i compare this to exercise? Exercising is really tough, especially when you haven't done it for some time. But why do people still do it, knowing its tough? That's because at the end of it all, they can see. They see themselves being healthy and fit.<br><br>Reverting back to relationships, sometimes to Love someone is really tough, but if you can see the ultimate goal(Happiness, Being in Love, having someone to confide your problems to), you'll be able to push yourself ahead.<br><br>Don't be too hard on yourself, and cherish yourself. If you do not have the ability to love and take care of yourself, how then, can you take care and love others?</div>
