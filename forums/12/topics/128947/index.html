            <div class='col-md body'>I must say..<br><br>Once in a while i hear these two words, "love yourself". But i have never truly understood what it meant.<br><br>Does it mean to splurge on yourself once a while?<br>Does it mean not to be cruel to yourself?<br>Not to subject yourself to things you don't like?<br>But how possible is that?<br><br>Does it mean to be more optimistic?<br>To treat yourself better?<br>To love yourself as you would a lover?<br><br>Yet why do they say that only after we learn to love ourself, can we love others? Is loving ourself the first true step in this thing called Love?<br><br>I'm still wondering..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi BabyRS<br><br>The essential of your topic is veru profound.  What I am going to "say" here maybe not what you are looking for.  But I hope my sharing of what I feel can help you.<br><br>I feel basically we are too hard on ourself.   Learn to be more forgiving to yourself.  Learn to  say "no" to thing in life sometimes.  Learn to be more responsible for yourself.  I believe that is the first step to love thyself.<br><br>Regards<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by BabyRS:<br><strong><span style="color: blue;"><span style="font-style: italic;">The time will come<br>when, with elation,<br>you will greet yourself arriving<br>at your own door,<br>in your own mirror...<br>and each will smile at the other's welcome,<br><br>And say, sit here.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think <strong>'Dignity and self respect'</strong> would be tantamount to <strong>self-love</strong>.<br>Maybe having the <strong>confidence</strong> to stand up for what YOU believe in is also loving yourself enough to fight for your beliefs. After all... when you love someone or something you may choose to overlook their/its faults.<br><br>'Self-love' to me is an abstract noun that cannot be easily defined. But the bottomline is... only by loving yourself unconditionally you will then be able to have the confidence to tackle Life head-on. Because whatever it is you choose to do, you will know that regardless of the mistakes that you may make, you are still proud to be you.</div>
