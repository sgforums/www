"listen to mum &amp; me" is one of the "rules" in the "Rules for Riley", seems to make the assumption that it was written by the stepfather. Just what the bloody fuck kind of a mother will allow the stepfather to control her kid like this? She has no respect and love for herself and her kid.

              <p>Just read the article and really wanna point out this particular thing. "listen to mum &amp; me" is one of the "rules" in the "Rules for Riley", seems to make the assumption that it was written by the stepfather. Just what the bloody fuck kind of a mother will allow the stepfather to control her kid like this? She has no respect and love for herself and her kid. That bastard of a man has no right to tell Riley what to do. Without blood relations, nor a history of him bringing her up, he never earned the respect of the child.</p>
              <p>Not to generalize MMORPG players but it's also apparent that she neglected her child while conducting a romance with this man.</p>
