              <p><br>No, both cases aren't similar at all. But if you insisted on the similarities due to the dunking into a pail of water, then I can say I have to declare you as the winner because you sounds so desperate to prove your point. But I don't agree with your point as they are both different cases. (Did girl die? Age of the girl? Motive which led to the dunking behavior.)</p>
              <p>And if you are really desperate enough to bring out your "older" age to compare with me in order to win this post or argument, then of course I will graciously declare you as the winner of this argument. But I don't feel that I have lost anything to your over-zealous attempt to win this argument.</p>
              <p>So I am still not convinced, but I don't mind telling you that you have won the argument to fulfill your wish and I hope you don't need to CHU your "Age" card everytime when you need to win everytime. It won't work on me again.</p>
              <p>Just count yourself lucky that I'm not in a mood to play this argument with you till the end. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>The first I checked, I was correcting your answer that there is no abuse cases in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Does that mean that its picking a argument with you regards to the statistics of abuses cases which you are now obviously ignoring?</p>
              <p>Was Singapore abuse free?  Will you like to provide a statistic, to prove your point?</p>
              <p>I do believe that my correction was justifiable.  Especially in light of your attempts to make a biatch of yourself, by being vague about your observations and demanding that others provide you pin point exact proofs.</p>
              <p>So my final question: IS SINGAPORE WITHOUT FAMILY/CHILD ABUSES?</p>

              <p>I provided a recent example, where father shaked his daughter, then left her lying face down in a pail of water.</p>
              <p>Then after he did his chores, he went and pick the child and put on the mattress, called police and claim that the child was on the bed playing and suffocated herself.</p>
              <p>.........</p>
              <p>A mother, suffering from post natal depression, cannot stand the child crying, put her child into the wardrobe and close the wardrobe.  She then went about doing whatever she is doing in the house, until her husband came home, and asked where is the baby?  She replied that a grandparent took the child out.</p>
              <p>The hubby later hears crying sounds from the wardrobe and went to retrieve the child.</p>
              <p>Above story was not reported to police.  And it happened in Singapore.  The couple was staying in Bukit Batok.  Thankfully, the baby did not vomited after crying so much.  Or it will be what kinda case?</p>
              <p>.......</p>
              <p>One was a indian family of 4 staying in Bukit Ho Swee.  Everytime, that the father drank, he goes home and whip the children and punch his wife.  And the father is not working.  Finally, one child needed to be admitted to KK hospital because of dizziness and vomitting. </p>
              <p>Policemen came, one stripped off his uniform and challenged the father to a one to one fight, the theory of come try beat someone his own size.</p>
              <p>Do you know.....that in the 1990s, law enforcement officers has the saying : Malays do drugs, Indians get drunk and beat their families &amp; chinese fights over noise, terroritory &amp; among family members.</p>

              <p>The first I checked, I was correcting your answer that there is no abuse cases in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Does that mean that its picking a argument with you regards to the statistics of abuses cases which you are now obviously ignoring?</p>
              <p>Was Singapore abuse free?  Will you like to provide a statistic, to prove your point?</p>
              <p>I do believe that my correction was justifiable.  Especially in light of your attempts to make a biatch of yourself, by being vague about your observations and demanding that others provide you pin point exact proofs.</p>
              <p>So my final question: IS SINGAPORE WITHOUT FAMILY/CHILD ABUSES?</p>

              <p>You must be imaginating things.</p>
              <p>I did not say SINGAPORE IS WITHOUT FAMILY/CHILD ABUSES.</p>
              <p>So if your own imaginations is hurting you alot, then you should CORRECT YOUR OWN IMAGINATIONS TO BE MORE P.O.S.I.T.I.V.E!</p>
              <p>But since you allowed your imaginations to run so negatively wild and bring you so much grievous damage to your narrow soul, then maybe what I can do now is to help you to free your narrow-minded soul a little bit ok?</p>
              <p>Reverting back to the post by Master-_-, if you really have to compare the similar case occurances between USA and Singapore, then you need and you only can consider the age of the offenders and the victims/deceased, the motives behind the crime, frequency of the crime, and the extensiveness of the crime.</p>
              <p>You may be surprise to find out that the motive for pure murder won't be on the line for the cases which you have magically produced out of nowhere.</p>
              <p>I am able to comment accurately because I UNDERSTAND what Singaporeans are capable of doing and what Singaporeans aren't capable of doing.</p>
              <p>And you should be able to understand it too if you are also a Singaporean, especially if you have lived with Singaporeans all your life.</p>
              <p>You only need need to search within yourself and the people that you have came across throughout your life and you will be able to agree with me.</p>
              <p>But of course, if you prefers to stick to your own research based on ONLY the crimes committed by Singaporeans, and then use your extremely biased mentality to judge all Singaporeans as guilty before charge.</p>
              <p>Then you are just another retarded retard Singaporean who is trapped within your own narrow insight and unable to utilise your brain to think outside of the box.</p>
              <p>Ohh....to give you a loophole for you to exit gracefully, you can always turn your back against your own country, Singapore and denies living and spending MORE time of your life here in Singapore and you are a non-Singaporean.</p>
              <p>Then I can accept why you don't understand Singaporeans. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You have failed to see the bigger picture with your narrow vision with your narrow-minded heart.</p>
              <p>And that's why you will never be good enough for me, let alone meet me or even know me.</p>
              <p>But I do agree with you on "Never argue with retard, you never can win", because that's what you have set upon yourself as your own limitations.</p>
              <p>I believe I can teach a retard to outclass you as an individual if I want to, because unlike you....I have never set or place any limitations upon myself.</p>
              <p>What if the world have been telling you "You can never be the best as there is always someone else out there who are better than you?"</p>
              <p>Would you have agreed with them and lived out your life as prophercised?</p>
              <p>I don't know about you, but I don't agree with the world cos I know myself better than what the world know/think of me.</p>

              <p><br>Hmm.....I am willing to graciously forgive you for passing your personal comments about me. And the reason is ONLY because you don't know me at all.</p>
              <p>Just using your imaginations to know me randomly is useless, that is because you simply do not know me or anyone else that you have even known personally for several years....presumably people whom you have considered that are "close" to you. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>You can only know me when I allow you to know me, and I don't want to know you because I know you are not a good person or an honest individual.</p>
              <p>I don't need to prove anything to you because I know I am RIGHT. And I also don't do those make-believe in order to convince you or anyone else whom I think are not good enough for me.</p>
              <p>You can always give me credit whenever you realised I'm RIGHT. But will you ever be able to bring yourself to admit that?</p>
              <p>Even if you can do it forcibly, it is not important to me whether you admit I'm RIGHT when you realised it.</p>
              <p>It is more important for yourself to learn, adopt, accept and change yourself for the good when you realised I'm RIGHT.</p>
              <p>You should know, winning does not have any meaning to me. But it does contains multiple meaning for you.</p>
              <p>And I don't plan to change my opinions about you anytime soon, cos you have already revealed the kind of person you are from the way you have expressed while writing/replying the posts. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Poor parn,</p>
              <p>talk about knowing, or dont want to let others know, or expect others to know, or dont want to know others.</p>
              <p>Its a sign of weakness, cowardness, a kinda illusion about oneself and convinced that others are errm....not of their level.....(Yes, it looks like your typing do have multiple meanings to me.)</p>
              <p>But hey, at least this forumers knows that I am a 35 year old Singapore citizen, probably female, divorced, no kids, or no kids I have to bring up, no live born kids.</p>
              <p>Rides motorcycles, attend drift car events, dance social and latin and worked in legal, law enforcements and now kinda in a housekeeper, cook &amp; nanny role.  I think they know what kind of person I am.</p>
              <p>Oh....I forgot to mention......been there done that, seen toyboys, to rich people and their granduer to being there to witness man doing a cat.  Or a man that abuses his family and have police officers took off their shirts to challenge that man to a fair fight.</p>
              <p>Well, yes.......if thats not Singaporean enough, I will be happy for others to brighten my horizon with more Singaporen actuality.</p>
