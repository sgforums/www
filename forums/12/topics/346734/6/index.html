              <p>In the your own words, your common knowledge is very poor. Since when from the dawn of time has "noes, and ditto" became part of Australian culture? And oh SHITS someone on the internet has found out I'm pretending to be of a different nationality! STOPS THE PRESSES!</p>
              <p>Thanks for the lawls in the morning. Right I have to post more consistently, and I have to learn from you what is right and wrong. I'm so sorry that criticised your picture! It really conveys the person that you are truly are! You are a thin, young, good looking, and not to say innoucent Japanese guy/girl who we all know is the person to log on to sgForums everyday and conduct flaming sessions everyday.</p>
              <p>Seriously, do you think anyone gives a bloody fuck about anything you say? I took a gander at your previous posts and it's either 1) flaming wars 2) people ignoring you. Usually I would do the latter but lately I need the perk-me-up from your posts. Thanks I needed that. =]</p>
              <p>Yep, everyone here on sgForums utterly love you and can't wait to read your next post.</p>
              </div>

              <p><br>First of all, you have not been in here long enough to make any responsible comments about me, or even qualified to take part in any flaming attempt on me.</p>
              <p>If that is beyond your utmost capability of understanding, then you are just a RETARDED troll (not just a normal weird troll, but worse) who creates a new account for the purpose of flaming.</p>
              <p>And if you have chosen to join in any flaming attempt on me, then you must be PREPARED TO BE FLAMED TOO!</p>
              <p>Unless you're not only retarded but you are also terribly NAIVE to think that you could simply join in any flaming session and get away with it.</p>
              <p>I don't usually have any heart nor have any mercy for retarded forumers like yourself. who joined in the flaming session without any reason.</p>
              <p>IT's not difficult for others to see that you are obviously a clone of another COWARDLY and RETARDED FORUMER. Because no forumers will even think of flaming another when they only have less than 10 Posts. </p>
              <p>Ohh ya....by the way, your posts are full of spelling errors. Next time try to calm yourself down first before you make your next post. IT will help you greatly to reduce your spelling errors.</p>
              <p>Agitated replies are usually more prone to spelling errors. Or perhaps that's just the limit of your language command. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Yes, I believe people does give me their attention whenever I post. Else nobody would even have bothered to flame my post if my post aren't good or better than them.</p>
              <p>People flame for many reasons, some are personal, some are jealously, some are for the sake of arguing, some are for the sake of looking righteous (I know it doesn't make any sense for people to join in and gang up on one person in a flaming session, but that's what retarded people like yourself does and FAILED to realise that there is actually nothing righteous about it).</p>
              <p>But most importantly, it shows one thing. People are not ready for the Truth and they are not ready to accept the Truth.</p>
              <p>If you tell a stranger about your honest opinions on a certain issue, you are most likely not going to get a good response if that stranger is a shallow and narrow-minded individual.</p>
              <p>So people grew up absorbing the habit of exchanging opinions which they know the other person wouldn't mind hearing about. That might makes them into a really popular individual which nobody actually has any reason to HATE them.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, that individual might feel really popular but that is because nobody around that individual has any reason to hate him/her and that gives the individual the impression that he/she is well-liked among their peers.</p>
              <p>Of course this is a common but actually a wrong way of life. It's WRONG because that individual who thinks he/she is popular because nobody has a reason to hate him/her, will eventually realised that nobody has a reason to like him/her either. That's because the individual does not provide any real value to any of the friendships that he/she has made/formed.</p>
              <p>So now do you understand what you did were RETARDED and WRONG? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Ah, ignore the transsexual troll fuckwit. Her only purpose in this forum is to force the rest to listen to her nonsensical views about anything under the sun.

              <p>Pity he/her/it,this forum is just a medium for her to live out her far-fetched fantasy life and escape from her mundane lifestyle etching a living as a no-value transsexual. ignore he/her/it and he/her/it will eventually crawl back to whichever lorong she comes from. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> </p>

              <p><br>I would like to listen to your reasonings if you HAD ANY.</p>
              <p>But unfortunately, you have none except for your retarded thoughts and opinions.</p>
              <p>So of course I am not able to agree with you especially when I know your reasonings, thoughts and opinions are retarded and had only little entertaining values in it.</p>
              <p>I understand your frustrations when you realised that your opinions aren't good enough as compared to mine.</p>
              <p>But behaving in a troll-like manner and gathering up together with your other trolls (Trolls usually gathered in groups and are never alone as I have observed <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png">), will still NOT make you better than me in any way.</p>
              <p>And if you realised that is already your limit and you really cannot win it alone and you also cannot stand losing to me, then I would suggest you to go and die cos you will win me after you have died. Winning me ONLY in the race to DEATH.</p>
              <p>Would you like to win me? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Just leave my opinions alone if you are not able to provide a better one. There are some people in your lives that you cannot win even if you tried your best. You should be smart enough to realise that. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p><br>Don't you think you're too arrogant to speak on behalf of all sgforumers?</p>
              <p>Exactly which part of you is so big that you think you could represent all sgforumers?</p>
              <p>Is it your Ego or your penis?</p>
              <p>I think it must be your over-inflated Ego, cos people with exceptionally small penis tends to have an over-sized Ego to make-up for their manly-incompetence. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
