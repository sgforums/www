              <p>Poor parn,</p>
              <p>talk about knowing, or dont want to let others know, or expect others to know, or dont want to know others.</p>
              <p>Its a sign of weakness, cowardness, a kinda illusion about oneself and convinced that others are errm....not of their level.....(Yes, it looks like your typing do have multiple meanings to me.)</p>
              <p>But hey, at least this forumers knows that I am a 35 year old Singapore citizen, probably female, divorced, no kids, or no kids I have to bring up, no live born kids.</p>
              <p>Rides motorcycles, attend drift car events, dance social and latin and worked in legal, law enforcements and now kinda in a housekeeper, cook &amp; nanny role.  I think they know what kind of person I am.</p>
              <p>Oh....I forgot to mention......been there done that, seen toyboys, to rich people and their granduer to being there to witness man doing a cat.  Or a man that abuses his family and have police officers took off their shirts to challenge that man to a fair fight.</p>
              <p>Well, yes.......if thats not Singaporean enough, I will be happy for others to brighten my horizon with more Singaporen actuality.</p>

              <p>There is this female, who is one year my senior.</p>
              <p>That goes around marketing herself as a tutor, at a really cheap rate.</p>
              <p>She has a diploma in electronics or something from one of the Singapore poly, but does not want to work in the electronics mnc for the reason that she cannot stand the politics and bitchiness.</p>
              <p>Also, she is refusing to work, so she dont have to pay back her father, his cpf contribution to her education.</p>
              <p>Because, when her mother was sick, he did not help out.  And she was doing all the housework, looking after her mother and such.</p>
              <p>So she picked tuition or tutoring as we called it, to earn her own living and show her resentment against her family by means of not paying back.</p>
              <p>She is also single, with a strong demand that others around her behave morally.  However, those in the know, avoided her because of her pushy manners and inexperienced or attempts to pretend to be experienced.</p>
              <p>I remember one incident, which I was later told, that she has tried to suggest that she is older then a female, when actually she is younger.</p>
              <p>Reason to want to appear older, is because that female was married with two kids and contemplating about her divorce.  Where this possible affair issue involved a guy that she is also interested in.</p>
