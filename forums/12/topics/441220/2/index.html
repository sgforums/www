              <p>TS, with only O level, $1600 is already alot for ordinary jobs. The market rate nowadays is around $1000-$1200.</p>
              <p>There are exceptions. You can sign on as police or with army. there, $1600-$2000 is possible.</p>
              <p>Another option is to work as a croupier in the casinos. Basic probation pay is $1.8k. After probation $2k. They just require you to have a clean background and be good in math.</p>
              <p>But at the end of the day, you will not progress far in any career with just an O level. Thousands of diploma and uni grads are pouring out every year, and you will be leap-frogged over for promotion.</p>
              <p>If you want to continue raising your income, your only choices are:</p>
              <p>1) Upgrade yourself. Get a better paying job.</p>
              <p>2) Sales. Don't need qualification. Can sell, got motivation can alr.</p>
              <p>3) Start your own business. Hardest of all, with high start up cost, but could be financially satisfying if your business succeed.</p>

              <p>Thanks so much for ur kind feedback.. The thing about Singapore and its high cost of living.. If thinking about entrepreneurship u wld need a good start up which means u need quite a bit of money.. I am already having problems trying to make ends meet.. Sometimes I only left with a few dollars in my account until my next pay which mostly goes to my parents and my bills..</p>
              <p>Being a croupier not bad idea as I am quite comfortable with money as I handle quite a lot of money now anyway.. Haha! Who can recommend me in ah?? But the job prospects also not very high hor?? Like after that I will be stuck again back to square one.. I wonder is any other guys Ard that is havin e same problem as me??? Anybody?</p>

              <p>Don't be croupier seriously. It's job shifts timing is a mess, and you will be under a lot of stress. I want you to come back to this forum and make your life happier. You will get to see all sort of faces in life from the super rich to the super market auntie. It's very sinful job. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="icon_confused.gif"> </p>
              <p>At the bank, people will treat you with respect and treat you nicely. It's a comfortable job. But at the casino, it's very different. The gambling situation is so bad that you will be able to write a book after you've work at casino. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="icon_sad.gif"></p>
              <p>Very common lah. My bank account now only got $2.55, every day waiting for pay day. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"> You're comfortable with money because your job deals with people's hardearned money. When you go to casino, you are helping casino to eat up other's poor hardearned money.</p>
              <p>I don't wanna influence you or whatever, but I want you to consider what I've said carefully. Okie? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> promise me you will come back to this forum more often.</p>

              <p>Thanks so much for ur kind feedback.. The thing about Singapore
              and its high cost of living.. If thinking about entrepreneurship u
              wld need a good start up which means u need quite a bit of money..
              I am already having problems trying to make ends meet.. Sometimes I
              only left with a few dollars in my account until my next pay which
              mostly goes to my parents and my bills..</p>
              <p>Being a croupier not bad idea as I am quite comfortable with
              money as I handle quite a lot of money now anyway.. Haha! Who can
              recommend me in ah?? But the job prospects also not very high hor??
              Like after that I will be stuck again back to square one.. I wonder
              is any other guys Ard that is havin e same problem as me???
              Anybody?</p>

              <p>Darkness is right. Croupier is a simple job, but you need to be the right person for the job. There is very high temptation, when you are placed in charge of a gambling table, as you can see from the number of croupiers caught cheating while working.</p>
              <p>And if you do become a croupier, although you bring in more money, are you willing to transit to shift hours? are you willing to work every weekend? Are you willing to transit everyday to MBS or RWS, day or night, rain or shine, even when you have kids? Do you have a strong sense of justice? Can you bear to see people lose all their hard-earned money?</p>
              <p>If you do, you can be a croupier.</p>
              <p>And don't worry about job prospect. While you will never reach the top (the casinos are owned and managed by the angmohs or the Lim family), there are plenty of ranks you can be promoted to at the bottom to middle level.</p>
              <p>Not anyone can suka suka become a pit supervisor or casino floor manager. To become one, you need years of experience (at least 5 years) in the casino, starting out as a croupier. And the casino pays everyone a standard pay.</p>

              Ts, 
              u are lucky that you manage a job in a bank and not too poorly paid at that especially, comparatively u are an o level ... Like some mention here, u are simply idealizing and frankly, to me,  there are some things (hangups) unreconciled within you and u simply blaming work and what-not to justify ..., and of course, it is easy to change jobs, change homes, change ... but nothing doing, it will still surface.

              <p>No.. Not that I am lazy Or afraid of challenges..i mean working in bank it's not as easy as just deposit and withdrawals.. There are more things such as remittance.. Handling foreign currency, holding other stuff also. There are tons of paperwork involve also.. So far I am coping well... Just that I am exploring other options available for me.. </p>
              <p>To be honest I am just preparing myself for the worst as in now there may be retrenchment and all..</p>
              <p>I think I may consider taking a dip like what u guys suggest... Well hopefully things turn out better for me</p>
