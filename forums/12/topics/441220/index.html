              <p>Hello everybody, hope for some advice on what I should do with my life from here on. Currently, I am working as a bank teller earning approx $1600. I am 24 this year and my education lvl is pretty low, only an O level cert. I am not v.good at studying and don't intend to further my studies anymore.</p>
              <p>As we all know, working in a bank is really stressful.. moreover I am a guy and i feel that there is not really much prospect working as a bank teller..  I have been in this line for close to 8 mths.. previously only working in a call-centre... service industry.. I have been consistently trying to look for a better job elsewhere, but because of my low education, i am not given much choices as most jobs require at least a diploma or higher...</p>
              <p>I hope to at least earn 2k plus a month.. because i seen some of my other frens who are of same standard earning this amount.. they are in the sales line and their salary varies... but I am not a risk taker and I prefer to have a more stable income...</p>
              <p>Anybody can advice me on where the 'hot' job opportunities are... and maybe help me on this?</p>

              Life is like a game, you want to play to your advantage. The advice I always give to those people with no education is to be an entreprenuer... because this is the field you will have an advantage... WHY? Simply because while all the people spend their many years on paper qualifications and going into debts with student loans, you're gaining another advantage (debt free and have the time to slowly build up your business)... by the time they graduate, you already stable business... You want to play smart... you want to play against other people in a game where you have the advantage, and in entreprenuership, you have the advantage. There are reasons why people drop out of school to do business, like Bill Gates is the most famous example.
              
              If you're talking about risk, is it more risky to work for the rest of your life without a chance of retirement or is it more risky having a shot at being rich and a chance of retirement? Slowly think.
              
              The third thing is, I think highly of people who have a burning desire to succeed. Who never say die, who will do anything for the customer... And seriously, if you ask me, low education people due to their work hard or die situation are more likely to work damn hard for say $3k vs a PhD student who thinks "alamak, 3k i rather go get a job" attitude... but sometimes in business, it's from that 3k that leads to the next 3 million dollars.
              
              if you ask me, you are feeling hopeless because you chose to play the game where the others have the upper hand advantage... so you see no way of winning this game... 
              
              but whatever it is, no need to stress because why? because more than 1 billion people live on less than $1 per day... they are poorer than you. just understand there's more to life than money...

              yep but i had worked in a few jobs previously and then i came out to do my own stuff around 2007... back during the jobs i work 1 whole month to get like 2.5k, somemore very tiring... but then later money comes easy, that's when it's very very hard to go back to a job already (if you make 2k in 1 day then the physcology of working 1 month for 2k is against u)... but have to manage cash flow well because money come fast but money also go fast like for example need to buy goods 1 order can set you back 30k until 2 months later then you collect the money from client (and that's assuming they pay on time, some idiots delay and delay, we never deal with them anymore), then also need to pay staff, 1 staff 2k/month then 1 year its 24k just for 1 staff. so it's a new game that needs learning new skills not taught in school... that's why this new game becomes an even playing field even if you never go to school... what school teach you is for the mass market, like a production plant...
              
              i never say it's easy though... that's why need the burning desire to succeed... for a highly education person, when they failed, they will crave for the comfort of getting a monthly salary. that's why harder for them to be entreprenuers.
              
              personally, i think it's risker to know for almost certainly that monthly salary cannot allow you to retire (you have to take into account what if you genna illness and cannot work? if you're the boss you still have revenue coming in, but for monthly salary then it's trouble) but this is just my personal opinion. some people happy go lucky everyday go work for a salary that they are happy, then that's also bliss and happiness, i wouldn't change it for anything. but for TS who is complaining, then i think he needs to get out of the situation.

              <p>Life is like a game, you want to play to your advantage. The advice I always give to those people with no education is to be an entreprenuer… because this is the field you will have an advantage… <span>WHY</span>? Simply because while all the people spend their many years on paper qualifications and going into debts with student loans, you’re gaining another advantage (debt free and have the time to slowly build up your business)... by the time they graduate, you already stable business… You want to play smart… you want to play against other people in a game where you have the advantage, and in entreprenuership, you have the advantage. There are reasons why people drop out of school to do business, like Bill Gates is the most famous example.</p>
              <p>If you’re talking about risk, is it more risky to work for the rest of your life without a chance of retirement or is it more risky having a shot at being rich and a chance of retirement? Slowly think.</p>
              <p>The third thing is, I think highly of people who have a burning desire to succeed. Who never say die, who will do anything for the customer… And seriously, if you ask me, low education people due to their work hard or die situation are more likely to work damn hard for say $3k vs a PhD student who thinks “alamak, 3k i rather go get a job” attitude… but sometimes in business, it’s from that 3k that leads to the next 3 million dollars.</p>
              <p>if you ask me, you are feeling hopeless because you chose to play the game where the others have the upper hand advantage… so you see no way of winning this game…</p>
              <p>but whatever it is, no need to stress because why? because more than 1 billion people live on less than $1 per day… they are poorer than you. just understand there’s more to life than money…</p>

Like me in the IT industry, my skills are now very obsolete because so many new knowledge and technology replaces one another in a very fast pace. I say you can try with the Service industry like sellings stuffs, skills gained in this industry are very useful and can be brought over to another industry in the event you want to change job</p></div>

              <p><br>not a lot of people can walk the entrepreneur like u, i think it is because right now most people have to charek pagi makan petang charek petang makan malam, we cannot afford to think in the entrepreneur framework hastily or else kalau chiang kuda kasap charek untong modal resap.</p>
