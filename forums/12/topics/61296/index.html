            <div class='col-md body'>Whoa, tot i was the only poor guy, ok here's my story...<br>Since young, my father nv stays home, maybe like since i was in P2 liddat... And then, gradually, my other siblings stayed together... And yes, my father has gt 3 wives. first one passed away, leaving 3 children, 2nd was my mum, 3rd was another with a younger sis. Happily, we dun quarrel or wat, so its kinda Lucky, however, since young, i dun get the attention, and etc etc... my father just buy me things and in sch, i'm always seen as popular and friendly... but once home, i'm like so dead. Nw, i'm getting more &amp; more cold n heartless at times, for eg, tat time one of my uncle passed away, i was like no feeling, n my mum said told me off, saying i was like so cold-blooded n heartless... I dun feel much for anithing animore... except hope tat 1 fine day, someone nice n pretty (a gf) comes along and soften my heart... Dun really like my present situation, when i tok, i am very rude to my mum, i tried t change but, well, all along, there was no communication among us, so nw, its like so hard to communicate too... bless us all~~~   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  and dun worry, if u have lived until nw with this problem, means u r stong yeah? u'll find hope soon~</div>

I live in a very cold home too. In fact... things are even colder in my house cos my parents are divorced, and i'm only living with my mum. We're still learning how to solve our problems everyday. I hope you can find a solution to yours too! I do think, however, that moving out (aka running away) isn't a solution. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Except you seem to be alone which he what bothers you, alone from your parents, whereas I on the other hand, WANT TO GET AWAY from my Mother, we can't get along, my dad can't get along with her either, we both say she's freaky.<br><br>I have been reduced, because of my home relationships and other things, to the most cold state in my life. I used to be so excited at the thought of Christmas or Halloween, or watching tourist video clips of faraway destinations... now I am just indifferent, I guess this is what those vampires who lose their souls feel like heh.<br><br></div>
