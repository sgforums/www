            <div class='col-md body'>Lets see, when I was in Secondary School, when I saw my friends got themselves a girlfriend, I will feel really jealous and bitter inside, why couldn't it be me instead? Then there was a girl way back in Secondary, that I really really liked, but I never had the courage to do anything, only after we graduated, I started to SMS her, but she would never agree to go out. I even went to the point of waiting outside her house, and sending her threatening Emails. Ya, I feel pretty bad. It wasn't until her mother complained to my mother that I stopped, but if it wasn't for the law, I guess I would have raped her already. However, I still don't really understand how she got my mother's number.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Well, that was over 1 year ago, since then I deleted her and everybody close to her from my MSN, and I even stopped logging in to my Friendster. I tried to avoid everything about her. But... that is not the point of these topic.<br><br>I am 19 this year, going to N.S tomorrow. So I reflected on myself. I haven't got a girlfriend before, unless you count the girl way back in Kindergarten...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  But nowadays I don't seem to really care. In my Polytechnic Days, I am pretty sure that was 2 girls after me.<br><br>The first one I didn't like at all. She kept asking me to help her and stuff, and gave excuses to treat me or gave me kisses over MSN for helping her. But constantly ignored her, and she got a boyfriend now anyway.<br><br>As for the second one, well, just to say I didn't like her enough. It was during attachment period, when she claimed she was waiting for my friend in the toilet, but the truth is my friend left a long time ago. She was obviously waiting for me since everyone had already left.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>But putting those aside, I find that all of friends are constantly looking for new targets and stuff. While I don't seem to have any interest at all, I would rather, or in fact I already planned out that for the next 2 years, every weekend when I book out from camp, I would stay at home and build my model kits ( I have like a few dozens to finish building. ) Yep, I am a toy collector. I rather stay at home to admire my toys, or go out to buy new toys or just watch some anime. I seldom go out, except to buy toys or if there's a movie that interest me. I don't even like the company of friends.<br><br>Am I weird?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I sense abit of selfishness in your decisions.  You seem interested in using your time to develop yourself, your career, instead of "wasting" it on the opposite sex.  Am I right..?  That's all fine and dandy, but it's good to let yourself love once in a while.. you might miss Miss Right while you're working so hard to achieve your ideal life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

With who?<br><br>My Secondary friends only ask me out because I exist. Whenever I start a conversation with them on MSN, they will only reply if they feel like it. Well, I don't really know if they are actually infront of the PC, or maybe they are playing Dota. But I feel like they just can't be bothered to talk to me. And sometimes when we go out and one of us needs to contact another, they will ask me to call, and the other person won't pick up the phone. Then they ask another friend to call, and he picks it up. It can't all be coincidence. I can feel that they are not outcasting me, but they just don't take me seriously.<br><br>As for my Polytechnic friends, just say most of my classmates are not united enough, they prefer to go out with their Secondary friends. And if we do go out, they will most probably talk about Dota, which I don't understand a thing. The only time when I get to talk is when I am alone with only 1 other friend ( Any 1 of them ), but then I get the feeling I am just forcing the guy to listen to what I have to say, since there is nobody else to talk to.</div>
