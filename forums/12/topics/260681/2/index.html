That time, i also like a girl in my class and we become very gd friend till i confess to her. But then, i got rejected and so i begin to pester her by calling her. But i stopped after 3 more attempts. After that thingy, i have lose my faith in relationship and i think the same applies for u. Because we put in too much effort in it and yet we receive such a negative and tormenting reply. Hence, we become very skeptical to relationship issues. However, TS u should considered urself fortunate as u were once loved by others. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  I have lost faith in girls before but i have straightened my thoughts now.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Guilmon1987:</div><div class="quote_body">Lets see, when I was in Secondary School, when I saw my friends got themselves a girlfriend, I will feel really jealous and bitter inside, why couldn't it be me instead? Then there was a girl way back in Secondary, that I really really liked, but I never had the courage to do anything, only after we graduated, I started to SMS her, but she would never agree to go out. I even went to the point of waiting outside her house, and sending her threatening Emails. Ya, I feel pretty bad. It wasn't until her mother complained to my mother that I stopped, but if it wasn't for the law, I guess I would have raped her already. However, I still don't really understand how she got my mother's number.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Well, that was over 1 year ago, since then I deleted her and everybody close to her from my MSN, and I even stopped logging in to my Friendster. I tried to avoid everything about her. But... that is not the point of these topic.<br><br>I am 19 this year, going to N.S tomorrow. So I reflected on myself. I haven't got a girlfriend before, unless you count the girl way back in Kindergarten...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  But nowadays I don't seem to really care. In my Polytechnic Days, I am pretty sure that was 2 girls after me.<br><br>The first one I didn't like at all. She kept asking me to help her and stuff, and gave excuses to treat me or gave me kisses over MSN for helping her. But constantly ignored her, and she got a boyfriend now anyway.<br><br>As for the second one, well, just to say I didn't like her enough. It was during attachment period, when she claimed she was waiting for my friend in the toilet, but the truth is my friend left a long time ago. She was obviously waiting for me since everyone had already left.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>But putting those aside, I find that all of friends are constantly looking for new targets and stuff. While I don't seem to have any interest at all, I would rather, or in fact I already planned out that for the next 2 years, every weekend when I book out from camp, I would stay at home and build my model kits ( I have like a few dozens to finish building. ) Yep, I am a toy collector. I rather stay at home to admire my toys, or go out to buy new toys or just watch some anime. I seldom go out, except to buy toys or if there's a movie that interest me. I don't even like the company of friends.<br><br>Am I weird?<br><br></div></blockquote>if your borned in 1987, then im your evil twin.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fcuk the word "NORMAL". Everyone is just the way they should be. Just follow your heart and instincts. Remember there's a reason for everything. In the end...you will know why you have to be what you are in the past/present. This is explained in the movie 'SIGNS'. I think my advice to you would be....keep doing what you're doing and slowly change yourself/do what you think you must only when the desire is there. Your mind/heart will tell you when something is right or wrong. But if you really feel that you have a big problem..then see a counselor if you have to. Everyones PATH is DIFFERENT. DON'T COMPARE YOURSELF WITH OTHERS! Be YOURSELF.</div>
