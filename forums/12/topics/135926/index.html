I told him how I feel. He said he is only just looking, not thinking of them (to me, oogling them is bad, must lest the thinking of them!).

Emotions and feelings do not easily bloom from situations or problems.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> It is created. Yes, It is created from yourself.<br><br>You may really wish to go back to your former relationship which failed and conduct a review the reason it failed.<br><br>Your insecurities may not be from him(not solely from him)<br>It may be from your former relationship and your ideal values.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>

Even the 'Best Love' you could hold this lifetime could <strong>never </strong>give you a 100% security.<br><br>You two had just left your individual relationship shortly before coming together; let me reassure you that it would be impossible for him to completely sever his connection (heart, mind and soul) with his ex of four years in such short span of time. Your insecurity is not unfounded, but it may not be wise to step into it so quickly.<br><br>The more intense the flame burns, the faster it dies.<br><br>You are madly in love with him; and love made you have the desire to possess his personal three realms (Physical, Psychological and Psyche). To be afraid to lose your relationship is normal, however to be overly paranoid about it will actually cause a subconscious impact into the relationship, straining it.<br><br>Trust and your own security is like seesaw - the more trust input, you feel more insecured and this shouldn't be the case. It should be proportionate and not inverse.<br><br>P.S: Here's a question for you to consider: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>do you think that your love could be just companionship after an aftermath of a failed relationship?</strong></span> You speak naught of your previous relationship; I suppose you have already moved on.<br><br>But him?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe it's true the insecurities come from within me. Cos my ex slept with a girl. And I forgave him cos i loved him too much then. It seemed I was stupid enough to forgive him and continue to be with him. In the end, I found out that he had been 2 timing me for a yr. The feeling sux.<br><br>AS for him, he told me his ex no longer loved him...<br><br>Anyway, true that I will look if a handsome guy walks past, tho I dare to say my eyes would not follow wherever he goes. I know different people different characters and I cant expect my bf to have the attitudes as me.<br><br>Still...</div>
