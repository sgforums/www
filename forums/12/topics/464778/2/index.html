              <p><br>ya true, those highly skills-based jobs very concerned wif paper qualifications e.g. engineering, R&amp;D will need at least Bachs to move up the rungs, otherwise if you working in  jobs requiring more people skills then technical skills and knowledge, i think degree also not that imp.</p>

              <p><br>for people who lack paper qualifications, my suggestion is to start a business. It is a path where the more paper qualified a person is, the less likely they are to throw away their comfortable lifestyle for such risk.

              <p><strong>Mr Fong will receive the Technical Achievement Award as part of a three-man international team. The technique they developed allows for more life-like movements and subtle nuances in facial expressions.</strong> -- ST PHOTO: DESMOND WEE</p>
              <p><br><strong>By JANICE TAI</strong></p>
              <p>WHEN animator Nickson Fong becomes the first Singaporean to pick up an Academy Award next month, he can look back with pride to the moment that inspiration struck.</p>
              <p>   He had been working on visual effects for the movie Godzilla in 1998 in the wee hours of one morning when he took a seemingly uninteresting algorithm - or formula - that a recent college graduate used to bend cylinders and applied it to muscle joints and facial expressions.</p>
              <p>   The technique - dubbed Pose Space Deformation - allowed for more life-like movements and subtle nuances in facial expressions.</p>
              <p>   It was a game-changer in the film industry. Hollywood blockbusters like Spiderman, Avatar and The Lord Of The Rings all used it for their 3-D characters.</p>
              <p>   Fifteen years later, Mr Fong, 43, will receive the Technical Achievement Award as part of a three-man international team.</p>
              <p>   The certificate, to be presented at the historic Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles, did not come easy.</p>
              <p>   The first film that Mr Fong used the technique on was Stuart Little in 1999. He had to mimic human-like expressions in talking cats and come up with natural fur movements. "It was so new and companies tend not to trust new techniques, so we just sneaked it into the movie without them knowing," he said with a grin.</p>
              <p>   His pluck has helped him prove many naysayers wrong about him. He was a school dropout who flunked his exams every year.</p>
              <p>   "Your son is useless. If he can find a job in McDonald's earning $1 an hour, please find him a job," his principal at St Andrew's Secondary told his weeping mother.</p>
              <p>   Instead of hitting the books, he would spend after-school hours loitering in shops reading movie magazines.</p>
              <p>   On weekends he would be at the cinemas catching the latest action flick or animated film.</p>
              <p>   It helped that he had artistic talent. The only subject he excelled in was drawing. After winning many art prizes, he secured a spot in the master's degree programme at Savannah College of Art and Design in the United States after getting his diploma from the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts.</p>
              <p>   His thesis project for the course was a short film which found its way to a prestigious animation festival, the Siggraph 1996 Electronic Arts Theatre.</p>
              <p>   The work impressed heavyweight studio DreamWorks SKG. He was one of the first few animators it recruited for its first animation feature film, Shrek, which became a global hit for its illustrated realism and humour.</p>
              <p>   Mr Fong commanded a six-figure pay cheque per project and lived in a two-storey house with a three-car garage in California, but decided to return to Singapore after working on The Matrix movie series in 2004.</p>
              <p>   The father of two said: "I felt obligated as a Singaporean to come back and share my experience. I know I can do a lot by offering opportunities and much-needed training for the raw talent here."</p>
              <p>   Little did he know then that he would face many roadblocks here. The production firm he started in 2004 - Egg Story Creative Production - folded in 2010 after the economic downturn.</p>
              <p>   It had been working on a $50 million animation film called Kung Fu Gecko, initially tipped as a possible global hit, much like DreamWorks Animation's Kung Fu Panda. But it did not take off due to a lack of funds.</p>
              <p>   In 2007, Mr Fong opened Egg Story Digital Arts Academy to train Singaporean animators via a two-year diploma course. He sold it to a partner two years ago to concentrate on production work but it has since ceased operations.</p>
              <p>   His family lives in Taipei but he remains active here with another start-up, Egg Story Studios.</p>
              <p>   That is why he is keenly tracking the progress of animation brand names DigiPen Institute of Technology and Lucasfilm Singapore, which have chosen to set up shop here. "We have a growing animation scene here but it is still in its infancy and it remains to be seen if it will flourish," he said.</p>
              <p>   "We do have the talent but there is a need for resources such as funding, training and opportunities."</p>
              <p>   Mr Fong's Academy Award is not actually an Oscar, which is the name given to the famous statuette. Last year, there were eight recipients of scientific and technical awards represented by 28 people. One group won the certificate, six received a bronze tablet and one group won the Oscar.</p>

              clue about my future career and whatever course. I seem to be like
              a piece of wood drifting. Am I the only one without a clue of my
              life? I intend to attend a university but my parents would not be
              able to afford it after my studies. I really envy students who can
              afford it. I do not wish to be stuck in a diploma.</p>
              <p>As I were formerly from ITE, I feel a sense of insecurity in me.
              Other polytechnic students will be younger than me. It seem as
              though I am overaged and might not fit in well. What if I can't do
              well in my studies?</p>
              <p>By the time I ever enter a university, I would have been in my
              late twenties. Girls would be all around 19 - 21 and boys around
              20-22.</p>
              <p>And right now, I have problems such as low self confidence and I
              have not had a girlfriend since I was born. I worry everyday about
              my siblings and parents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really had enough. It feels so painful. Why am I the only one
              suffering in this world with poor studies, no direction, poor
              family and I even have to worry about my siblings about their
              education and my future.</p>

              <p>Hi RegretRain,</p>
              <p>"Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get."  Lost?  Uncertain?  Welcome to the club!  (NO, YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE.)  The idea is to explore, explore, explore!</p>
              <p>No money to pursue further studies?  Get out there and work for a few years and save up for it.  There are many "mature" students these days.  So what if you are a few years older?  No big deal!</p>
              <p>Don't know what kind of jobs you like?  Then take any job that you are qualified for... you won't know if you like it until you have tried it.</p>
              <p>Full of worries?  Worry is useless... if you have a problem, go do something about it right now; if there is nothing you can do, then what's the point of worrying?  Get it?</p>
              <p>No girlfriend?  Join activities and meet more people, the rest is up to fate. </p>
              <p>Good luck, my friend.</p>

              <p>Sadly, most of us Singaporeans have this mindset that is hard to 
              break, that of relentless study = great success. We just stare at 
              textbooks and at worksheets robotically and only do the least amount 
              necessary to get by.</p>
              <p>First thing to do is to develop a love for 
              gathering any kind of knowledge possible, since you have no idea what to
               do right now, rather than just taking the Zen way of go with the flow, 
              start by being a Jack of all Trades, read up on various occupations, 
              various pieces of information, various things. Only when you realise 
              that studying is more than just an obstacle to get past will you start 
              finding hope in this rigorous education system. This is especially 
              important in a polytechnic which is more hands-on and requires much 
              technical knowledge (unless you're taking something like mass comms)</p>
              <p>This advice is very standard, so let me give an example of the 'Singapore' mindset and how to break out of it.</p>
              <p>Singaporeans
               have this aversion to maths, thinking that what they're currently 
              learning and boring and wondering why they're forced to learn countless 
              amount of sums and theorems and why is it relevant to their lives. What a
               person must understand is two things, that knowledge is culminative, in
               that to get to the later parts you must learn the earlier parts 
              (addition - multiplication - calculus) and that besides the apparent 
              knowledge of what you're learning (memorizing the theorems and knowing 
              what calculus is) you're also gaining different sort of knowledges 
              (understanding how logical processes work, sorry if this is sounding 
              abit too chim). So most people don't realise that there is a lot of 
              complexity and beauty to maths after getting through the initial steps. 
              For example Fermat's Theorem and Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle are 
              beautiful in ways only mathematicians get since they've mastered the 
              knowledge. Also many philosophers also love maths since it helps them 
              think clearly, they see the processes in order, next to one another, 
              which gives them clarity of thought. For an example that relates more to
               real life, our computers are so fast due to algorithms that 
              mathematicians come up with to shorten the sofware processes. Not saying
               you should learn maths or find it enjoyable, but just saying that you 
              should start learning more and find out about the diversity of life. The
               problem with Singaporeans being that they live in this protected glass 
              ball of ignorance where life is only minimized to the things around 
              them.</p>
              <p>This isn't just for maths btw, it also applies to economics 
              (Adam Smith's Classical economic theories came before Neoclassical 
              economics which was created by Keynes, this is the things that we learn 
              in JC econs today but we don't know of its roots)</p>
              <p>Another quick 
              example is that of music. Singaporeans will force their children to 
              learn piano at a young age to be competitive or to try and make their 
              children into cultured citizens, children will grow up to hate piano 
              playing and music. What must be realized is that learning how to play 
              the piano can help one identify certain motifs in classical music and 
              help them understand the piece better. Those classical music pieces that
               seem to go haywire and have multiple random tunes incorporated in them 
              (Bela Bartok maybe, Shostakovich) are actually a result of years and 
              years of music theory and composers basing their work on other 
              composers. Most children will just learn to play music by memorization 
              and just scrape the huge iceberg that is the whole history of music out 
              there.</p>
              <p>If you're uncertain about life, you should also read up
               some humanities things, such as books and literature. Dabbling into 
              philosophy, sociology, psychology and the like can illuminate alot of 
              things about life and our society. Realise how Singapore is built on a 
              collection of Eastern Philosophies that started from Confucious and 
              Western Philosophies that started from Plato. Realise that many people 
              out there have so many intepretations of life itself, from religious 
              beliefs (Christians, Buddhist, Muslims etc.) to schools of thought 
              (Existentialists, Solipsists, Nihilists etc.). People have spent several
               hundred years creating theories on how people should live their life, 
              go look up their work some time.</p>
              <p>Also realise that chasing after 
              short-term pleasures will only send you further down into despair. Start
               thinking of things in terms of value, don't watch television shows just
               for entertainment, watch it for value as well. Example, Twilight is for
               escapism and entertainment, books like Sophie's World can aim to 
              entertain and tell a story as well as educate. Realise that if you were a
               very social person before, you may have to cut down on social 
              activities a lot. This is the small price to play in order to make 
              yourself into a better person. Some people will just tell you to live by
               how you choose, but if you don't have this mindset to improve, how are 
              you going to ever live a life without regret?</p>
              <p>All these are very 
              important, not just for coping with polytechnic university, but also for
               life in general. These are the places that require you to have good 
              social skills, independent study habits as well as the will to succeed. 
              There is much of life to be enjoyed, just because you have a small and 
              bleak worldview, don't let it be trampled. Even if you find yourself 
              facing more hardships later, you can get by if you have a general love 
              for life and all its evils and inconsistencies.</p>
              <p>I may be one small
               voice out of many on a vast internet board, but to whoever is 
              listening, who has the genuine will to improve, who is currently finding
               trouble in life, who only sees a few grey moving shapes in an immense 
              world of color and delight, who live a life of reckless abandon and only
               care about play without thinking of future consequences, take my advice
               to heart. There is too much in life that you'll give up if you either 
              decide to live in great ignorance or great depression.</p>
