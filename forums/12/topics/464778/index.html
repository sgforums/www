              <p>Hello, let me introduce myself first.</p>
              <p>I have graduated from ITE and I will be enrolling into a polytechnic soon. As I apply for the polytechnic, I have totally no clue about my future career and whatever course. I seem to be like a piece of wood drifting. Am I the only one without a clue of my life? I intend to attend a university but my parents would not be able to afford it after my studies. I really envy students who can afford it. I do not wish to be stuck in a diploma.</p>
              <p>As I were formerly from ITE, I feel a sense of insecurity in me. Other polytechnic students will be younger than me. It seem as though I am overaged and might not fit in well. What if I can't do well in my studies?</p>
              <p>By the time I ever enter a university, I would have been in my late twenties. Girls would be all around 19 - 21 and boys around 20-22.</p>
              <p>And right now, I have problems such as low self confidence and I have not had a girlfriend since I was born. I worry everyday about my siblings and parents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really had enough. It feels so painful. Why am I the only one suffering in this world with poor studies, no direction, poor family and I even have to worry about my siblings about their education and my future.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>You're in a mental trap created by the Singapore society, which is called "no degree you become rubbish collector" trap... this mentality was created by our grandparents, pass down to old fashion thinking parents, down to you... the truth is, you got brain, you willing to work hard, you can be the success you wanted. I don't need to tell you one of the richest man was a drug dealer, at one point, he's so rich and powerful, he almost control the entire country... his name was pablo escobar... not asking you to be a drug dealer obviously, but just pointing out to you that you don't need degree to be rich and powerful and successful.

              <p>So to speak, right now, the problem lies in your thinking. Are there people poorer than you? Yes! Are there people who never pass primary school education? Yes! So what?</p>

              <p>I can tell you that though there will not be many people like you, they do exist. I personally know a few people who ORD-ed from the Army at the age of 22-23 with only an ITE degree. They then went on to poly at the age of 23-24, followed by university at the age of 26-27.</p>
              <p>One of those guys, after graduating from poly, felt that he was not worthy enough for NUS. I simply told him that I expected to see him on campus the following semester as an undergraduate.</p>
              <p>Sure enough, I did. Since then, he has graduated with 2nd Upper Honours.</p>

              <p>I know not all will succeed even with a degree. However,  a degree seem to be the basic nowadays. I know skill are more important but some  jobs require at least a diploma or degree. I heard many stories from the older generation that without education, they cannot apply for a decent job. Not many people are born to be the top.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Right now, I'm stuck in my life with no direction. I failed my studies in the past and I have regretted it. I'm way older than ny peers. I feel dumb.</p>
              <p>I'm like a zombie without light in life. I have not gone for polytechnic studies but I have already felt like quitting. What if others get private diploma? They graduate faster, spend less money on living as they work earlier.</p>

              <p>In the end, it all depends on you. You can either whine away on these forums and do nothing, or go forth and do something useful with your life.</p>
