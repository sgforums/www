              <p>This question is very easy to answer.</p>
              <p>You go and flip through the Classified on jobs.</p>
              <p>Then you choose the job you see you like.</p>
              <p>Then you look at the requirement of that job.</p>
              <p>Then based on your current qualification, go look at what kind of job is available. Then you decide if you want those kind of job.</p>

              <p>just take a look at the amount of degree holder nowadays.</p>
              <p>no doubt taking a degree is impt in terms of it serving as a stepping stone for you in the workforce, its still mostly based on supply and demand of the job nature. not only tt some jobs don't really require a degree. take design for example.</p>
              <p>btw have you finished your poly days?</p>
              <p>if so i bet you wouldn't be saying all these. because the thought of venturing out into the workforce now feels like crap. studying is still better. the only responsibility you have is to study and score well.</p>
              <p>some dip. holders starting pay is about 1.8k. after going through NS your pay is about 200 more than those who didn't. so who the hell said the <strong>max</strong> pay you're gonna get as a dip holder is only 2k?</p>
              <p>if you are still studying for your dip, i suggest you do well and get into a U. do you and your parents proud.</p>

              <p><br>But many more non-degree holders also work under degree holders. You can't take such examples to say so. Usually, people use this as an excuse not to study. But little did they know the amount of dedication and hard work put in by this sucessful people. If you could not even get dedicated and work hard for a simple degree, how could you ever expect yourself to succeed as a boss?</p>
              <p>For every one of those bosses who succeed, many many more had failed. To be in such a position, you have to have the motivation, idea and luck to do so; it's not an easy job, and it entails much more risk than being an employee. The main difference would be, you can control the risks more as compared to being an employee</p>

              <p>A degree tells you how much you are interested in a subject. Unfortunately that's not the case here in Singapore and maybe the world over....</p>
              <p>But if you are good at something, you want recognitions and rewards. A degree is the verification, your experience is the credential, and testimonials are your distinctions.</p>
              <p>People dun owe you a living; you need to proof to others that you are worth the salt. Pragmatism aside, it's not even about survival. It's is about how you wish to express about yourself and your interest.</p>
              <p>Why should anyone trust you when you cannot even convince others that you are worth it?</p>

              There's no absoulute case, but having good cert give you more options like others already said.
              
              Most(but not all) jobs look at certs, but there are some jobs that prefer experience/skill than certs. So if you identified such job, spend 3years in that industry, gain the experience and learn the skill, you are prefered compared to someone who spend the 3years getting a cert.
              
              But take note that such case only applies to limited industry/trade postions, the main stream is still looking at certs.
              
              And like nehpyh said, you need to show/prove others that you are worth the salary. So even they dont look at certs, you still need to have the real skill, to impress them.

              <p>Okie... when you grow up you will understand lor....</p>
              <p>now hor... one signboard drop down ,  90% are degree holders.</p>
              <p>degree still not enough.. masters after that phd.</p>
              <p>then with experience. then you can see the figure ... hmmm like 100000 - 300000 per annum after 8-9 yrs of relevant exp provided u must work smart . not hard like a ox.  If you are a sg and you dun study then the FT will bring there <a href="mailto:!@##%24%%24">!@##$%$</a>  masters cert to get a job here .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>15 yrs ago... without a degree ... just with o levels ...u can get a job starting from 800 dollars ... then work all the way up till now.. if you are lucky you can reach the 100000 p.a and you will reach the age of 40 plus.. scare retrenchment will happen to you becos ... young degree holders being offered  40 k pa. will take over your job then you panic ...  faster start your evening class  to get your dip ... degree then master....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>okie ... people will say ... degree is bullshit after reading all this... correct ... those who say is bullshit must be the small portion of people are entrepreneurs who had started a business like charles and keith ... local enterprise.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is two-sided.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>one is my fren , whom I know from the nite class.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the other who is my fren's  father in law... with sec 4 qualifications.. came from a damn poor family, started  a company which made him a multi millionaire ..earn a lot of money but got cancer and passed away eventually at 50.. slogged all his life to build the business..</p>
