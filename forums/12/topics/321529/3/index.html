              <p>imo, having a Degree is not really necessary.. it very much depends on what field your into.</p>
              <p>But of course, a degree gives you assurance, it helps you to proof to others that your a degree holder.. but do you really have the skills? Or just a paper to show off? That's another story.</p>
              <p>And also, theres Experience. But if you have the skills, you dont have to worry much. It just takes time.......<br></p>
              <p>Have degree but no skills = Nothing<br>Have degree and have skills = Something<br>Have degree and have skills plus experience = <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>A degree is now a necessity, not a luxury item. You must have it not because with that you can be better than other but because without that you definitely be worse off than others. For every one who strikes rich / or successful without a degree, there is at least 10,000 who loses out because they do not have one and make ends meet by earning $1000 to $2000 a month. The chance for this non-degree holders are higher in 70s  and 80s. In this age where degree holders are driving taxi and doing loansharks, it is sucidal not to have one.

              <p>r u peddling something here?</p>
              <p>the same is true for grads. for every 10k grads out there, maybe a handful is only very successful (not necessarily rich). why bother with a degree if he/she is driving a taxi. loansharking is a profitable `business', so i don't blame that degree holder if he's got the business sorted out for him.<br>a degree is nothing if one doesn't make something out of it. for every 1 person wothout a degree that you think is `worse off' in meritocratic singapore, i can show you one non-grad who's not doing too badly.</p>
              <p>however, you do need a degree if you want to practice a specialized vocation, like law or medicine or architecture. for the rest, it is really debatable.</p>

              <p><br>More or less I agree with you. A degree will not make you rich and successful but only make you less poor at least which is my point too. To be rich and successful, you need many factors beside a degree which, in my opinion, luck is a major one. I am comparing apple to apple. e.g if you pick randomly a 25-year old man with honours degree and a 25-year old man without a degree in the street, I will bet $100 that the former earns more than the other. Of course, if the latter is a successful business owner / loanshark / professional footballer in EPL/international star, then I may lose. But what are the chances ?</p>
              <p>It is just like saying men run faster than women generally but if you are picking a professional female sprinter to run against an uncle like me, then needless to say, she will win.</p>
              <p>Who is the largest employer in Singapore ? Government. and paper is of paramount importance. Beside that, the private sector also pick degree holders even if they do not need them for the position. You are right that if you have a clear business plan in mind, you do not need a degree but how many people have a clear business plan in mind and the right execution strategies/funds to ride it out.</p>
              <p>I have always great respect with people who are successful without a degree which include my close relatives and friends. I think they are great despite some cannot even read legal business documents.</p>
              <p>However, for the ordinary folks in the street, the degree serves as an insurance for you to survive (don't even mention excel) in Singapore. Seriously, I doubt your 1 to 1 ratio. but no hard feeling, man.</p>
              <p>Cheers</p>

              <p>That is quite true. Basically, there are 2 kinds of non-local U grads. 1st is you are too good for them and choose Cambridge, Oxford, Harvard instead and the other is because you cannot get in so you choose alternatives. Not only HR, every hiring manager knows about this with some even outright reject those from Australia Uni.</p>
              <p>However, having said that, if you are lucky enough to get through the interview and land the job, it does not matter any more with regards to promotion, pay rise, appraisal etc.... It all voices down to work performance for some companies and how well you bootlick for others</p>
