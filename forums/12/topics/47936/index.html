Firstly: she has her own rights to keep things to herself.

(My reasoning and logic behind this is put bluntly into this statement: Who are you to her?')<br><br>II) Show that you are jealous doesn't mean that she has to react in a way to compromise your feelings.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>III) You know she is not your gf - then why act as if you are one?<br><br>Under psychological term Johari Window - there is this thingy called the Hidden Self - there is something about you that you don't realise is pissing and irritating her, which is ruining your chance to maintain good friendship with her or even possible romance.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Self reflect and read books on understanding woman - I am sure it will help alot.<br><br>Peace</div>

Life is about making choices that you know it will do you good and not listening to everyone's opinon and make a decision out from there. Seriously speaking you don't have to read my post - you can read posts that doesn't speak of the picture - however, its you who will sink deeper. If I have to be the bad guy to prick your dream and speak the truth to you - I will.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You know what's the whole problem between you and this girl? You want to chase - using good friend as a screen cover, feel she is friendly - no sense of security and when communicating with her, you are causing this rift distance between you and her UNCONSCIOUSLY. You don't realise it, neither do I, until when you paste your conversation with her onto this topic and when I read it, the whole picture is much clearer.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Private message ANY ladies, preferrably 18 years and above, in sgforum and paste this conversation to them. Ask them if they were her, will they get pissed and irritated - you answer will surface. (Key points that has to be mentioned: You are just her normal friend.)<br><br>Its has nothing to do with right or wrong - you are only 15 and your love journey is only the beginning. Years down the road and after a couple of relationships - come back and read this post. You will discover the reason why yourself suddenly. Enlightenment? I guess so.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: You will be fine. The world don't stop spinning because of her -learn to grip firmly onto your life and not let your life be gripped by others.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
