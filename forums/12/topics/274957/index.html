            <div class='col-md body'>Crush just like only.. infactuated... thoughts of just bonking or ravaging her..<br><br>while Love has all that... but u have more deeper feelings , u'll sacrifice , and some say commitment too.

            <div class='col-md body'>I found a very informative read on the internet:<br><br>Are you really in love? Or do you think that you are in love?There is a big difference between Love and infatuation.<br><br>Some people canÂ’t tell the difference, thinking they are in love but really it is a deep infatuation. Infatuation is instant desire - one set of glands calling to another.<br>Love is friendship that has caught fire. It takes root and grows, one day at a time.<br>Infatuation is marked by a feeling of insecurity. You are excited and eager, but not genuinely happy.<br><br>There are nagging doubts, unanswered questions, little bits and pieces about your beloved that you would just as soon not examine too closely. It might spoil the dream.<br>Love is the quiet understanding and mature acceptance of imperfection. It is real. It gives you strength and grows beyond you - to bolster your beloved.<br><br>You are warmed by their presence, even when they are away.<br>Miles do not separate you. You have so many wonderful little films in your head that you keep replaying.<br><br>But near or far, you know they are yours, and you can wait.<br>Infatuation says, Â“We must get married right away. I canÂ’t risk losing them.Â”<br>Love says, Â“Be patient. DonÂ’t panic. Plan your future with confidence.Â”<br>Infatuation has an element of sexual excitement. Whenever you are together, you hope it will<br>end in intimacy.<br><br>Love is not based on sex. It is the maturation of friendship, which makes sex so much sweeter. You must be friends before you can be lovers.<br>Infatuation lacks confidence. When theyÂ’re away, you wonder if theyÂ’re cheating. Sometimes, you check.<br><br>Love means trust. You are calm, secure and unthreatened. They feel your trust, and it makes them even more trustworthy.<br>Infatuation might lead you to do things you will regret, but love never steers you in the wrong direction.<br><br>Love is an upper. It makes you feel whole. It completes the circle. It fills the empty space in your heart.<br><br>Love is elevating. It lifts you up. It makes you look up. It makes you think up.<br><br>It makes you a better person than you were before. If you have love in your life, it can make up for a great many things you donÂ’t have.<br><br>If there is no love in your life, whatever else there is has a lot less meaning. The secret of our being is not only to live but to have something to live for.INFATUATIONInfatuation is a feeling; real love involves a commitment also. Infatuation is just love of emotion. Real love, though, is love of devotion.<br><br>Only the emotions are affected in infatuation, but in real love both the emotions and the will are involved. Next, a person Â“fall intoÂ” infatuation, but Â“grows intoÂ” real love.<br>Guys, have you ever seen a girl who was so beautiful that you thought youÂ’d faint?This is infatuation! It is based totally on physical attraction.<br>Often you donÂ’t know much in-depth about the person you so-called love. Thus, infatuation is mostly biological. Also remember, never tell a girl you love her, unless you are willing to marry her.<br><br>Then, infatuation is basically selfish where real love is basically selfless.Infatuation is more interested in satisfying yourself and the feeling than it is in the other person.<br>Real love is primarily interested in the other person. It seeks to give instead of get.. Love unselfishly seeks the highest good for the other person.<br>Lastly, infatuation is weakened by time and separation where real love is strengthened by time and separation.<br><br>This does not mean that there will be no pain in separation. On the contrary, there is great pain in separation ifyou are truly in love.LOVENow you know what is infatuation, we will go on to discuss about the details of a true love. Love is patient. The word translated Â“patientÂ” means to wait patiently for the fulfillment of expectations.<br><br>When you have difficulty dating this girl and she does not want to come out, if you truly love her, you will not complain and blame her, you must look at the situation from her point of view.<br>Maybe she is having some problems which prevented her from coming out. You must react to it with patience and understanding.<br><br>Next, have you ever met someone you liked so much that you wanted to push the relationship and make it progress faster?<br><br>Sure you have! Love, however, is willing to give a relationship time to grow at a natural pace.<br><br>It does not push but is willing to wait for the relationship to grow at a rate that is satisfactory to both parties.<br><br>Love is Kind Love seeks to encourage and build up others. It respects the feelings and emotions of others..<br><br>It finds its greatest satisfaction in making others happy.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Difference between Crush and Love?<br><br>Crush is not Love<br>Love is not Crush<br><br>Crush is the slang for infatuation. When the subject of your admiration or (desire/fantasy/dream) is gone, uncontactable, unreachable, unresponsive, bochap, you will feel like being crushed! Like the whole world has collapsed on you! That's exactly being crushed, rite?<br><br>Love is many a splendored thing. Love is not selfish, possesive, attached. Even when love is not reciprocated, responded, achnowledged, there is no crushing feeling. Because true love is not about wanting for oneself. It is about giving to the other. Better to have love and lost than to have none at all.<br><br></div>
