              <p><br>yeah i did... i asked her to promise me to stop taking drugs and stop smoking... but not able to be there 24/7 means i cannot monitor her lah... but very hard to change a person... my thinking is the only person who can change himself/herself is only themselves.</p>
              <p>the original forum was chit chat and original title was "god playing a joke on me lah" or something like that.</p>
              <p>no i dun want her because she is a bad influence to my life sia... nowadays i am those good boy pray god everyday type of person... trying to improve bit by bit.</p>

              <p>Anyway I don't think I want to fall for her. I just want to be her good friend (that explains why I never want to go into a sexual r/s because it will complicate matters).

But at the same time, you must take caution to make sure she does not take it the wrong way... or too hard. God knows what might happen. Also, don't show any indications of any kind that you "love" her. My advice is, spend some time, write a note or send her a long SMS. Tell her how you feel. Don't go over to her house anymore, as it will only make you feel awkward.</p></div>

              <p>We tend to prefer grass on the other side. Like why girls go for bad
