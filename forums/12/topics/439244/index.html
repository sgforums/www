              Hi Everyone,
              
              I am very very devastated now....I hope someone here can console or advise me.
              
              I lost my wallet yesterday, 6th Oct 2.50pm. Not only I have lost my identification card, but also our small co cash salary of est. S$900, plus various cards and anything else that may have been inside.
              
              This is a rare incident of someone losing the wallet in this manner, I think I am the only stupid person in the world will do this....it goes this way.
              
              We are doing a small entertainment business &amp; on 6th Oct, school is celebrating children day...me &amp; 2 of my colleagues woke up at 6am to run 3-4 primary school shows.
              
              After our last show at 2pm plus, we are all very tried mentally...while on the way back home in a small red colour Opel van, we stopped by an Esso petrol  station along upper Serangoon road &amp; Lim Ah Pin road.....a few hundred meter ahead is Serangoon JC.
              
              I went to buy drinks for my 2 colleagues &amp; my little pets, when I came back....I opened the van side door to replenish water for my pets, however my hand is full of things, so I left my wallet &amp; a mineral bottle on TOP of the van.
              
              When I closed the side door, I did something I will never forgive myself forever...I took the water bottle &amp; forget completely about the wallet. I went back to the front seat &amp; we drove off...with the wallet still on top of the van! :(
              
              P/S: Why we know?  after halfway along the journey, I realised I have left my wallet on top of the van...when we stop &amp; find is not there...we make a police report &amp; the police came with us back to the petrol station &amp; a check with the CCTV....it clearly seen we drove the van out to the main road of upper serangoon with the black wallet on top of the van.
              
              After the lost is confirmed...we went on foot near the entire stretch of road to the turn ...as well as driving the same route where we took 3 times...there are no sigh of the wallet...we have drove for 15mins before we realised the lost.
              
              Now my biggest concern is I am not sure which part of the road the wallet has dropped OR  is there any motorcycle/car driver seen the wallet on the road &amp; pick it up OR some road passer pick it up OR maybe the wallet has been hit by car &amp; flung into unknown location.
              
              I am devasted &amp; in a state of shock cos inside contains so much money plus my IC (afraid someone will use it for illegal activities)..I have also write to both the Chinese press hoping SHOULD any kind soul find it &amp; helps to return the wallet, we will reward  them with 1/3 of the cash in it.
              
              I am also trying my luck here if any driver have pass b this stretch of road around this time &amp; seen a black wallet on the road.....any help will be appreciated.
              
              Thanks for reading &amp; wishes everyone a great weekend.

              <p>Just forget about it.....</p>
              <p>I once lost $1000 dollars too.....</p>
              <p>I am not even sure how I dropped my wallet back then.....maybe I dropped it while I was walking.....</p>
              <p>My advice to you is to move on...</p>
              <p>Because the more you worry......it doesnt do any good....no benefit.......in fact you are harming yourself further.....so just minimize your harm and your lost by not worrying about it.....</p>
              <p>Lesson learnt from it is......never carry any valuables with you anymore.....</p>
              <p>After I lost my wallet and HP a few times, nowadays I carry only very little money in my wallet and I use an average HP...so that I dont have any emotional attachment to material items anymore.</p>
              <p>This way you can protect your psychology as well as your money.</p>

              I really appreciate all those who have given me advice, I really appreciate it very much.
              
              Frankly speaking, $ is not the main issue which I am worrying now...rather is my IC....why everyone tell me the same thing,." if you are unlucky, the 'thief' will use yr ic to loan $ from ah long :(
              
              I really panariod after hearing this from everyone I know, as well as reading tonns of similiar stories online.....it is true that Ah Long really don't look at IC.....if they do....then why there are so many silimar cases when u google online...this really make me worry, I know is unhealthy for me &amp; I try to control, but the fact is out there........ :(

              <p>Don't worry, if ah long come and knock on your door, tell them you want stingray don't want pig head. =S</p>
              <p>Ok seriously, chances of you getting it back is less than 1% but STILL, it's a chance. Just don't dwell on it and hope too much, instead, focus on what should be done. </p>

              <p>Dun worry lah, you think today ah long san very stupid ar??? after so many fake ic case, now they check very closely, more closely than immigration, then photostat, then if find out you are not the same person, they just smile, ask you to come back tomorrow, then they report to police, the next day, the person will be nabbed, and the ah long san will be commended with a police award, from there, he become less suspicious about his vice business, and do his ah long business quietly and peacefully</p>
