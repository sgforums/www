              <p>hi, im in EEE first yr in NTU. EEE wasnt my first choice. it was probably 3 or 4th. 1st and 2nd choice was computer science and computer eng.</p>
              <p>I came from poly doing Eng informatics. Well the course is basically 30% eng and 70% IT.</p>
              <p>So i got into NTU this year but not the course i actually wanted. I appealed for change of course but failed. Apparently, i have friends telling me EEE is so much difficult than computer science. And they were surprise why I got into EEE and not computer science. I would think that EEE got more spaces thats why.</p>
              <p>After starting lesson for 1 wk, i have to admit that this is not what i wanna study. i do not wanna do EEE at all.</p>
              <p>What would be the possiblity of changing course after semester 1/ year1?? should i continue with EEE or withdraw from this course??</p>

              <p>i know a few people who changed course or even uni from NTU. i think it's perfectly fine provided you can afford to do so.. that is money spent etc... with that being said, idealistically speaking, one should never be forced into a situation you are uncomfortable with.. but nowadays lots of grads don't usually go into their supposed line of industry.. like how you can find lots of eng grads in finance industry..</p>
              <p>so think carefully... good luck =)</p>

              <p>NTU has counsellors, go talk to them.</p>
              <p>If you haven't made up you mind, they could advise you.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I recommend, you stay in course and find out more in EEE. There are options within the NTU EEE course that allow you to focus more towards IT (Do look at the design and technical elective). Infact, you will be surprised that towards the end of the course, alot more people choose the Information Technology option for the Final Year Option compare to the others.</div>

              <p>Yep. It should still be possible to change your course of study after one semester there. I'm from NUS so I can't be 100% sure about how NTU works though. You can probably change your course after the first or second semesters, but the drawback is going to be that you'll have to study purely your core modules for the next 2 to 3 years (the core modules from your previous course of study will be considered under the 'external' requirements).</p>
              <p>Anyhow, since you have friends in there who tell you that CS is an easier course of study and it's something you prefer.. Why not? I do have a friend whose GPA increased by one full point after he switched courses to something he preferred.</p>

              <p>for career guidance, sometimes a little bit of understanding one's potentials helps.  one way would be to read the 8 character of the person and plan accordingly. for example this case at another website     <a href="http://fengshuiforward.com/forum/personal-requests/analysis-request-for-career-and-relationship/0/">http://fengshuiforward.com/forum/personal-requests/analysis-request-for-career-and-relationship/0/</a></p>
