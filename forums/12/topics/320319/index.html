              <p>Just curious, how many of you here think you have found your true calling? That is to say,</p>
              <p>1) you are doing the work that makes you leap out of bed every morning...</p>
              <p>2) you are  doing what you love and loving what you do</p>
              <p>3)  your work satifys a need deep within to express yourself, your talents, your values, your unique and precious gifts?</p>
              <p>I don't know if i'm worrying unduly. But i'm about to attain my passport of freedom i.e. 21 in about 5 months to come. And in 2 months to come, i'll be studying accountancy at a local u in 2 months. Even so, I aspire to be a banker, i believe that aspiration stems from the prestige and potential income that comes and not exactly from somewhere innated.</p>
              <p>In this few months, i've been seeing so many different people. Some feeling lost in their late 20s, early 30s... still searching for their reason of existence. They've changed their career paths so many times and think their work is just work and not their career. They feel dismotivated and dread the routine.</p>
              <p>And so, i just sat at the park alone just now for the past 2 hours, thinking of what i really want to do. Life is really so short and i guess like many of you, i don't really want to live life like a lost sheep till i hit the cradle. Feeling quite heavy so i thought i asked around here.</p>
              <p>Has anyone of you found your true calling? If so, what has guided you towards finding it?</p>

              <p><br>that notwithstanding, i still believe if you want to lead a fulfilled life, your goal in life should be unwavering. yes, the paths you take may change but ultimately the destination should be constant. isn't it so?</p>
              <p>i've been doing so many different things in my recent years. experienced couple of up and downs that ppl my age wouldn't have. but i'm still actively in search for answers.</p>

              <p>well i can't tell you what you want, but what i want is for the people ard me to be happy, to be healthy.. i want to make an impact to the ppl who matters to me.. my life is only as fulfilled as the that of the ppl close to me..</p>
              <p>even though i cant do much for the people ard me, my family, my girlfriend, my friends, i try to be there for them as much as possible..</p>
              <p>but if u want to talk abt happiness when it comes to work, i think u have to try to be committed i guess,  for me, when i was in the army, i did quite abit of stuff for my department and pushed for many things, policies and plans to happen so that we won't be screwed when audit comes..</p>
              <p>and ur still abt to go to uni nia.. dun be afraid to make a mess here and there, u cant possibly be right all the time.. and u noe most uni grads don't do the same job as their course.. it's ok to go thru the downs, to experience loss and bewilderment.. because eventually, time will tell u what ur true calling is..</p>

              <p>Im sure u hav read somethin abt Marslow Law?  It's abt different levels of needs / satisfactions of humans.  This is wat everybody whom u hav seen is doin now - searchin for their needs in order to fullfill their satisfaction.</p>
              <p>In fact, no matter wat we work as, we are always in the rat race.  Being an Investment Banker may b ur "inspiration" now, tat's a good thing - at least u hav an "inspiration".  But once u hav start workin, u wll experience a different situation from wat u imagine it to be.  Till then, will u still b as clear as u r with ur direction now? </p>
              <p>True calling is defined differently by every individual human - dependable on whether u hav accept wat u are havin now &amp; goin to be in future.  If not, we wll keep searchin til we hav found it.  I jus hope tat after u hav step into the workin world, ur focus in life wll remain as clear as u are now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="icon_cool.gif"></p>

              <p>thousandisland, i believe i'm quite aligned with what you are
              feeling now. Just turned 21 and waiting to get into a university in 2
              months. These questions have been drifting in my mind for a quite some
              time already, i myself have not found a clear direction.</p>
              <p>However,
              I believe the mission in life relates to how your existance in this
              world is valuable to the rest of our community. It is something that we
              slowly explore and discover, and gets more refined as we experience and
              grow. Bringing happiness to your family and friends is just but a way
              to satisfy emotional needs, it cannot constitue to your personal
              mission in life. Contribution to others and personal mission has its
              differences.</p>
              <p>Your personal mission has the capacity and potential
              to influence people at large, because contribution in lined with
              mission is supported by an endless stream of emotional energy that
              drives actions, and recharges itself as a consequence of your actions.
              Personal mission drives you towards success and emotional fulfilment.</p>
              <p>I
              also believe that working for another person will not get you closer to
              your mission. When you are working, you are providing value to the top
              management, your value and contribution would always be limited by how
              the system in the organisation work. The top management are the people
              who are the one in lined with their missions and bringing value to the
              community, not you. When you limit your freedom to serve, you limit
              tremendous amount of potential value you could bring to your community,
              and thus the community will not reward you back with the big paycheck.
              Your life will be dependent on the paycheck of your employer, and you
              will never be free.</p>
              <p>However in this society we live in, many will
              question and challenge the practicality of minding your own business.
              Many are heldback by the fear of uncertainty and rejection that comes
              along with serving the community at large. The prospect of not having a
              stable paycheck and facing rejection that comes along with it is real.
              But if you are truly keen on finding that path, you will find courage
              to break away from the main steam ideals, and become the few people in
              their lifetime to have found durable filfulment; people who can smile
              in their deathbed because they know they have fulfilled the reason for
              existance in this world.</p>
              <p>I'm personally from a low income family
              and have secured myself a double degree programme in NTU. However, i
              also recognise that getting myself a high paying job in the future will
              not drive me towards my mission.</p>
              <p>I believe, to find your
              mission out, you must first overcome your fears which dictates your
              future actions. Simply because a mission drafts actions as a
              consequence to serve, not as a consequence of fears.</p>

              <p>thousandisland, i believe i'm quite aligned with what you are feeling now. Just turned 21 and waiting to get into a university in 2 months. These questions have been drifting in my mind for a quite some time already, i myself have not found a clear direction.</p>

              <p>Very intriguing and insightful. That being said, I'm too like you searching for the mission of our lives.</p>
              <p> Especially agree with your 4th para on not working for others. That's why my parents always frown upon my desires not to commit to a 9-5 office work solely for the fat pay cheque. But to quell their "fears", i'm just going through the motion to get a bachelors and then forge my paths ahead.</p>
              <p>Interestingly, i have friends from both spectrums. One of them are contended with status quo for now and perhaps for dont know how many years to come. The other has friends who have lofty ambitions but are obviously not rooted to the ground.</p>
              <p>Take for e.g. one friend of mine who's in sunshine empire (and now, emmax). I don't want to bring in the whole debate on MLM but apparently he thinks his "comrades" in SE are the most ideal business partners he can find. Almost everytime i meet him, he will be sharing about his grandeur business plans. Well, he said he's seen James Phang in flesh and has faith in the emmax platform.</p>
              <p>Worse thing, he told me that university education is totally worthless and the only point he's studying is to pacify his parents. That being said, i need to qualify that although i haven't started my education in uni, i believe the rigorous training in terms of thinking and the exposure is a prep for my life ahead.</p>
              <p>To make things more interesting, he's also qt a seminar junkie going for national achiever's congress and an upcoming forex course. He told me after graduating from the forex course, he will receive a trader's cert. Said that will be equivalent to a MBA and that will grant him better chance into an investment bank. I can't help but feel skeptical about his claims.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, in the capacity of his friend, I'll still wish him all the best in whatever he does. If he falls and licks his wounds, i will fetch him some tissues. If he rises above the rest, i'll be happy for him deep down.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, for myself my fears driving my search - i don't want to be in either spectrum. I don't want to contend with a life I'm not interested in, considering we both are already in our quarter life crisises. Neither do i want to rush into believing i've foudn my first pot of gold and acting motivated. I like to believe true motivation comes innately.</p>
              <p>So till then, i guess we'll still be searching.</p>

              <p>Let your friend know it's not easy to be a trader. Speaking from personal experience. If not, everyone will be a forex trader by now.</p>
              <p>PS: A trader and an investment banker are totally unrelated.</p>
