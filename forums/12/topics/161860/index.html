            <div class='col-md body'>May I know of the requirements needed to take As as a private candidate? Must I pass at least 5 O-levels subjects or can I just enter? Is there any good schools to recommend?<br><br>Reason: I took Os last year yet didn't study hence scoring 27pts only. Thought would be better this year, but I was disappointed in the end. Ended up playing so much I took less than a week of studies to the examination hall. I know that my scores won't get me into jc, which is why i was thinking of thinking private As. Will be studying really hard, as I'll be cramming two years in one. I really don't want to waste anymore time. As I was from bmc academy, my impression of it isn't that good. So I was wondering if there are any better schools, and the requirements to take As.</div>

I don't think there's a shortcut to good results, and yes, I assume you are a guy, but it is not a waste of youth, The important thing here is getting a cert and entering into a Uni.<br><br>If you don't want 3 years, can take private diploma lor, only 2 years nia if i'm not wrong  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly speaking, juz choose a private course that u like and go to a private school. Dun waste your time in A levels when u're not doing well in ur 'O' level. Well As are nver easy and u've risk taking it.<br><br>Calculate it with ur probability formula or learn the new Risk Management to do it!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>But really, it's not worth a try, and like what someone up there says...
