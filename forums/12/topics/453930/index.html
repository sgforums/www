              Though I don't expect a quick reply at this hour, nevertheless I'll wait for the answer here.
              
              Here's my story, 
              I'm standing at the age of 26 years old this year, with most people around my age or younger has already settle down with a stable job or some even with a family. As for my situation, I don't have a savings nor a stable job. I stopped at 'N' level knowing that studies is not my type so I decided to serve ns.
              After ord, I found my interest and passion for acting. I joined Mediacorp as a part-time actor with those 1 or 2 lines in just 1 scene. And they only called you up for filming if you are suitable for the roles otherwise basically you are just doing nothing at home. I begin to inquiry about pursuing full time acting as I truly enjoy what I'm doing but unfortunately, I was decline as not many people can afford to pursue in this Industry even if they want to and I finally realize why mediacorp drama always showcase all the same actor/actress through many years of production.
              I withdraw and fall out from battle but I still continue to work for them as a part-timer and meanwhile I search for jobs.
              I worked in a warehouse knowing that I only have a 'N' level cert, could not find a good job and the salary is not very satisfying and also not my interest, for the seek of not wasting time at home, I endure.
              Over the years, I just worked and worked even though I don't like what I'm doing, resigned and look for jobs again. I'm just wasting my time and resources and which caused me a tremendous depression.

              <p>Well, find out what else are you still interested in other than acting and go forth from there.   If it is something that is practical and in demand I believe it will not be tough for you to pursue it.    If you are still keen on acting,  I wish someone from the entertainment line can offer you help, best is someone from overseas not Singapore.</p>
              <p>Do something about your depression, don't let it get worse to worst.    Depression can lead to death.    Leslie Cheung was in it and that took his life away, such a waste for a multi talented artiste.    He is very much missed by fans and every year  fans from all around the world gather to remember him on his death anniversary and birthday.</p>

              <p><br>rock, you are right... forget the qualifications if you feel you are not cut up for studies..</p>
              <p>unfortunately, our society place too much premium on qualifications, so those without usually gets left behind</p>
              <p>therefore focus on skills and interests that you think you have and work your way from there... the biggest hurdle will be the initial one where you need to convince your prospective employers that you have the skills to do the job even if you lack the qualifications</p>
              <p>good luck</p>

              good qualifications doesnt guarantee success.  but without one things get more difficult.
              
              nobody here can give you proper advice without knowing your strengths and weaknesses?  ask people who knows you, not people from the forum. 
              
              but since studying is not your cup of tea the only way out is to learn a trade.

              <p>Other than acting which you previously pursued, is there anything else you are passionate about?  Start by looking at your day to day hobby and interests. </p>
              <p>If you can't identify any area of interests, that's ok.  Is there anything that you don't mind doing, or any type of job that you don't mind? </p>
              <p>Actually, you need not be disheartened.  Even degree holders have difficulties getting a job at times. </p>
              <p>Since you are comfortable interacting with people, you can try doing sales or customer service.  There are many positions available in these two areas and many ppl, esp those with certain qualifications may not want to do such jobs.  For some reasons, many ppl detest doing sales and jobs that require meeting ppl.  These jobs often do not require high qualification.  You can always try going into the entry level of these jobs and slowly work your way to establish a career. </p>
              <p>Wish you all the best and hope you recover from depression soon.</p>
