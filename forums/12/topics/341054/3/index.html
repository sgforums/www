              <p><br> Don't you feel that you are too extreme? You should be ashamed of
              yourself, asking a girl this young to kill herself. Looking at her
              threads, isnt it obvious that TS is still quite young? It is
              very normal for someone to cry over a failed relationship,
              especially for a girl at her age.</p>
              <p>And the people in AA are not losers. Everyone has their own
              problems in life and some of them turn to AA to say out their
              worries and things troubling themselves. You having a perfectly
              fine and happy life, doesn't mean everyone is the same as you. If
              you don't like what you read, you can jolly well not do so and

              <p>You know, Kaurex, you seem like quite an intelligent man. See you have to understand that we don't need to be hitting each other with insults anymore...I mean, what we should do is sit down like distinguished, intelligent gentlemen and discuss our differences. You can bring some cognac out for me...and I'll bring some Rogaine out for you...but then again, considering that you're such a goofy jackass, I don't think that I could ever, EEEEEEEEEEEEEEVER let you off the hook that easy!</p>

              <p><br>Agreed.</p>
              <p>Learning to let go is the one of the hardest things to do but it is the only way that you would be able to get over him. Memories, regardless of sweet and sour, are very difficult to forget.</p>
              <p> Breakups are definitely heart-wrenching , and the emptiness that lingers on is ever so. Try to fill up this emptiness with other things, new and closer friendships, stronger ties with your family. The pain will slowly start to fade as time washes pass your wounds.</p>
              <p>Escaping and letting go are two very different things even though they may seem very similar. Only to truly let go would you be released from your pain. The first lesson to be learn in order to let go is acceptance of the fact that you would no longer be with him anymore.</p>
              <p><a href="/users/247755">TheAyatollahofRock&amp;Rolla</a> there's seriously no need for you to post something something not constructive and definitely very insulting in a thread that you don't like. It won't help anyone. You'll have my apologies for rebutting back at your comments in the first place as i'm in the wrong to rebutt even though you have posted such a reply. However, as i have said before, there's really no need for you to say all those things. Let's end the argument here because I really don't even see the point for us to be arguing.  </p>
