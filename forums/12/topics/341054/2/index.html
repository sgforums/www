              <p>You don't need to purposely get over someone.</p>
              <p>Its the mirror effect..</p>
              <p>The more you want to get rid of something, the more it clings onto you like superglue..</p>
              <p>Just try to carry on with your normal life as usual.</p>
              <p>Go out with friends, shopping, movies, games etc.</p>
              <p>Do it together as a group of ladies..</p>
              <p>Gossips etc..(only with those ladies that's good to you to date)</p>
              <p>Anyway if you wanna know if you've gotten over someone..</p>
              <p>than by then you will know it when you no longer feel anything for that person even if some news about that person happens to pass through your ears..</p>

              <p>you're still in sec school?</p>
              <p>Sadly, no one can ever teach you on how to forget a person or to get over him. It all depends on yourself. A break up is certainly hurtful. It may take a long time for you to get over this relationship depending on how deeply you loved him.</p>
              <p>Try to keep yourself occupied and leaving no time or space to think about him. Avoid things that will remind you of him at the moment. But it's really good that you're willing to open up as it help ease the emotional strain on yourself.</p>

              <p><br>Don't you feel that you are too extreme? You should be ashamed of yourself, asking a girl this young to kill herself. Looking at her threads, isnt it obvious that TS is still quite young? It is very normal for someone to cry over a failed relationship, especially for a girl at her age.</p>
              <p>And the people in AA are not losers. Everyone has their own problems in life and some of them turn to AA to say out their worries and things troubling themselves. You having a perfectly fine and happy life, doesn't mean everyone is the same as you. If you don't like what you read, you can jolly well not do so and close the window. Why bother posting a reply?</p>

              <p>There isn't any short-cut method to mend a broken heart. Everyone has to go through this period of heartache. Think of him day and night, cry yourself silly over him, think of your past memories, eventually you'll get over it.</p>
              <p>Would it help if i told you to keep yourself occupied so as not to think of him? How long can you keep it up? I know this would sound like crap but just let time heal all wounds. You might not get it now but you will, eventually.</p>
