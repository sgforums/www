            <div class='col-md body'>when we first met : I was very angry with him. Cos i was at the canoe course for fun but he was so serious, told me i was doing wrongly this and that and with such a 'black' face....<br><br>then the group had outings after the course. We had a canoe trip to, can't rem St John or Sister island, i was with no partners, so someone shouted to him to be my partner....he came running without the life jacket  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  made everyone laughed. but then i had no special feelings for him.<br><br>Outings in group continued. Got to know him more. He called me once to join him for another canoe overnite with the group at one of the island. I told him that i want to go not becouse of him and he must promise no to think i have to follow only him around  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>later, we had a few squash sessions with one of his friend. And he always offer to send me home on his 'lao po ka' bike.<br><br>my parents didn't like the idea that i took ride from him on his bike. So after our last game, i told him i would be going home by myself. He walked me all the way to the bus stop pushing his bike along. On the bus, i was at the upper deck.....i just suddenly had this funny feeling.....and i realised i had fallen for him..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div>

Cos i was at the canoe course for fun but he was so serious, told me i was doing wrongly this and that and with such a 'black' face....<br><br>then the group had outings after the course. We had a canoe trip to, can't rem St John or Sister island, i was with no partners, so someone shouted to him to be my partner....he came running without the life jacket  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  made everyone laughed. but then i had no special feelings for him.<br><br>Outings in group continued. Got to know him more. He called me once to join him for another canoe overnite with the group at one of the island. I told him that i want to go not becouse of him and he must promise no to think i have to follow only him around  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>later, we had a few squash sessions with one of his friend. And he always offer to send me home on his 'lao po ka' bike.<br><br>my parents didn't like the idea that i took ride from him on his bike. So after our last game, i told him i would be going home by myself. He walked me all the way to the bus stop pushing his bike along. On the bus, i was at the upper deck.....i just suddenly had this funny feeling.....and i realised i had fallen for him..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br></div></blockquote></div>
