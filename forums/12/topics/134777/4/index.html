At first glance... she's not much of a looker... but after tat "incident"... I suddenly found everything about her e.g. the things she did, her actions, her every movement, the way she laughs, wat type of clothes she mostly wears... are exaggerated. I find her a very natural person, especially the way she laughs, she goes all out to laugh loudly with all her heart, not a care in the world, no pretends, no "act cute", and tat is something tat pulls me to her.<br><br>Wat did I do?? For starters, I didn't do much. Just showed her a little more care than usual, being more generous to her. I didn't do anything bombastic so to avoid her being embarrassed by office gossips. But the response from her ain't tat good, maybe itz me. When the response ain't good, it hurts though.<br><br>As long as she still works in the company... damn... therez no monday blues!! I'm actually looking forward for weekends to end so I can get back to work and see her again. Everytime I see her smile/laugh, it really brightens up the moodiest of my days.<br><br>I've also pestered friends who are experienced in relationship to give me tips on wat to do, wat she might be thinking from the response she gave, wat I could've done to improve myself.<br><br>She's not working the company cos her contract ended. Itz been a few months now since she's not here, and more than a year since I've known her. Some friends said itz only a "crush" or "affection" and will be over soon. Till now, itz not "over soon". Itz still hurts now, I can only forget bout the pain by drowning myself in my work and divert my passion somewhere else. It simply came back by just a simple glance at her photo, or a mention of her name. Ouch.<br><br>I've recently deleted all the sms she sent to me for the past year which I've kept. I've found myself stupid and dangerously vulnerable to her bidding. But seems tat I'm not alone. Anyway, itz over, I dun wish to dwell in the past, just dun mention her name and dun let me see her again, and may time wash away every feeling that I have left for her.

            <div class='col-md body'>I know my current bf thru a mutual friend.<br><br>Both of us just broke off with our exes... And we were sorta keeping each other company, lending shoulders to cry and listening ears. After a very short while, we fell in love with each other. And we have been together till now...<br><br>we have been together for 4mths. Somehow I cant help thinking about his previous relationship. Cos he loved his ex alot, even proposed to her and she agreed. And they had been together for abt 4yrs! And he even cried when he talked about her (when we were just friends)... Sometime  I wonder why I worry so much. Sometime I am worried cos I love him alot and dont want to lose him...<br><br>Another thing is, he has wandering eyes and sometimes his eyes will follow wherever the girls go. According to some of my friends, I should just let him see the girls. I know I cant restrict him to keep his eyes on me, but why should he keeps his eyes on them wherever they go? I told him how I feel. He said he is only just looking, not thinking of them (to me, oogling them is bad, must lest the thinking of them!). And he also says he can only look and cannot touch them, so why should I mind so much? From then onwards, whenever I mention a beautiful person, he will say he dont dare to see lest I am jealous. Erm... So what does this mean?<br><br>Conclusion: Both of us are madly in love with each other. I am more vocal in my feelings, and he will say I am too sensitive or paranoid. I dont want to be seem as so, yet I cant control expressing my feelings... And I want to get rid of these insecurities and he is not helping... What should I do?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He is like this from the start. In the beginning, I told myself this is another side of him which I dont know, and that it might be coincidence. Afterall, we just got together. However, as time goes by, I realise I cant stand, so I told him abt it. And he said those remarks I mentioned about...<br><br>Can advise me on what I shld do?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have this good guy friend who constantly disturbed/quarrelled with me. Slowly slowly, we entered a shortlived relationship. Maybe we have been such great friends/quarrelling partners that it seemed awkward to go into the lovey dovey stuff. Soon, we broke up but we remained great friends since all we've done is hold hands. -laughs-<br><br>Is a relationship between sooper good friends impossible???  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i believe falling in love is a gradual thing .. the longer the togetherness , the deeper the love ..<br><br>haha .. mine was when i started noticing her in my cca ... then my junior was like commenting about her cuteness ..<br><br>during a perfomance , we were opposite each other in a row (guess what kind of cca) .. i think i sort of stared at her or something , glancing across while looking at the conductor ...<br><br>after the performance , everyone's going home or having dinner elsewhere ..<br>but strangely i decided to wait with her for her parents to pick her up and the rest is "a long story" ..<br><br>haha .. right now it's just memories ..</div>
