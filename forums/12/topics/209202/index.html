You want to have every ounce of hope right? Sad to say, all along she only treated you as a friend and now when she sensed that you wanted to chase her she is not used to it.<br><br>Your only best hope is to leave her alone and dun take it too personally. The key to girls is not to take them too personally. Just stay cool and be in control. Dun show that you are affected. The more you try to press for it, the worse it becomes.<br><br>Remember to say hi to her. That's all.</div>
