            <div class='col-md body'>People Involved(Disguised)[Everyone Involved Knows Each Other]:<br><br>Boy,<br><br>Girl(Boy's Gf),<br><br>D(Boy's Friend For 5 Years),<br><br>Z(Someone D Tells Everything To Cos We Can Trust Him),<br><br>K(Z's Ex Gf),<br><br>S(K's Good Galfren)<br><br>Situation Now: Me(Boy) just found out during my stay in the hospital after a lorry accident that D and Girl had something going on behind my back.Today I confronted D infront of Z and D admitted to hugging and kissing Girl. Things between him and me have been settled but now I'm still very angry and upset over this matter. Reason being; After 5 years of friendship D can actually betray me and make a move on my girl. To me the first rule in a friendship is that you should NEVER touch ur fren's stead even if you think he/she is making a move on you OR you intend to have a fling with him/her..(After the thing happened D claimed he just wanted to have a fling with my girl)<br><br>Story: I knew Girl slightly more then 2 months ago and we were interested in each other. We decided to try out going into a relationship for a month and see if we were suitable and if the relationship was stable. I became her boyfriend on the 13th Oct and soon after that things were going quite well until I got into an accident(21st Oct) causing me to suffer a fractured knee and wrist. During this period 21st Oct-30th Oct, the group had a bbq, and I found out after the bbq my girl and D went to watch the sunrise together. Shortly they hugged and kissed. I knew this the day after it happened and I've been thinking about it. D has also made a move on S before. There was this day after I was discharged from the hospital where K, S, D stayed at my house overnight. K and I slept on the mattress, S and D slept on my bed. After that night we found out that D had actually outraged S's modesty. I and Z knowing this happened confronted D and scolded him about it. We then proceeded to let this matter rest after a verbal agreement between S and D. After I knew what happened I kept thinking about what to do about D and my Girl. He being my friend should not even have took the advantage of my Girl even thou she did felt lonely during my 2 weeks stay in the hospital. Things between D and I have been settled and now I'm left with the decision to talk to my Girl about it or to keep quiet and leave this matter to rest. The reason being that she's been treating me really well after our 1mth anniversary and i really treasure her. Yet the fact that i know she accepted D's approach was something that was over the limit because when things between D and my girl happened, I was already in a relationship with her! I felt very angry and upset over this matter and i really do not know what is the next step because I do not want to lose my girl yet i want her to come clean with me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>I Hope You People Understand What I Am Saying And My English &gt;.&lt;<br>Thanks To Everyone Who Bothers To Read This And Give Me Advice!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wah beri confusing.. but i think you better not pin too much hope on your current r/s coz it looks like your girl is not very faithful to you. if she can do it once, she will do it again. i suggest you trash things out now rather then keeping quite(you'll never know when this issue might pop up during a quarrel in the future). tell her in a nice calm tone and tell her you are deeply hurt by her actions and ask her if she is serious with you. if she is not, then its time to move on</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wah.. It took me a while to understand and piece the whole picture together.. From where you mentioned.. The whole story is actually on D. Who both plays the devil and angel.. He is an opportunist and someone who takes advantage easily.. 1 advice.. Beware of him.. Keep your distance from him and try to keep ur girl away from him.<br><br>Next.. regarding you and your girl.. Although you know it is an up and down r/s.. SHould you not as a bf.. Do your best to make it keep going up instead of a rollercoaster one? If you 2 really love each other.. make it a point to make it happen a long term and lasting one.. instead of brooding over what has happened and be angry with her..<br><br>Whats the point of being so angry with her and D when things have been done and cannot be undone.. IF things have been "cooled" down between you and your girl and D, I think the more appropriate thing to do is concentrate on your r/s with your girl.. instead of fuming over D...<br><br>Yes.. they have betrayed you in one way or another.. But put it behind you.. Don because of that.. You are causing a destruction to your r/s.. Just make sure you look after her more carefully.. Learn from your mistakes. Good luck   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I decided to have a talk with my girl during our taxi ride from Westmall to Woodlands.. And I told her i knew about what happened and she hugged me immd. saying sorry.. After that we decided to go to some quiet place near Wdl Civic Centre to talk about it and it seems all fine right now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> .. She told me that D actually forced himself onto her, she told me her side of the story and there was one particular sentence she said that really touched me(I'm quite an emotional guy). She said, "I love you not because you love me or not because I sympathise you but I really feel happy being with you and I do love you." She did also mention she wanted to break up with me after the incident because she felt that she had let me down. I really feel relived now.. Reason being one problem taken off my heart and hopefully she is also carrying one less problem. Thanks to all those who bothered to read and understand my situation and giving me useful advices..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>So there was an 'Outrage of Modesty' <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>
