              <p>How u ask? Well, u can go around doing things, look for substitutes to distract or even deny what is 'true' in u (only u are privy to that) but it will not go away.</p>
              <p>Only when u undestand, accept and allow urself to be - there is a probablity that it may go away.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, it will surface or if denied - it is merely being repressed - it will eventually surface in another situation or with someone.</p>

              <p>Hi Rebecca,</p>
              <p>Why do you still meet up with him when you are trying your best to forget about him? This contradictory action certainly did not help you out at all. You need not submit yourself to your friends' requests - have them meet up with him themselves if they want to.</p>
              <p>If you are still going to see him day in and day out, it is unlikely that you will truly get over him any time soon.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>I said he was handsome because he was kept on being asked out by my friends.</p>
              <p>&amp; in poly he would be flirted around and he doesn't like to flirt.</p>
              <p>&amp; first love is something really serious, like its not just a fling.</p>
              <p>&amp; even if you are with someone else, and he comes back. It might confuse you cause.. he's your first love.</p>

              <p>Pardon me i am not trying to be curde that young women usually go for physical outlook to fall for a man.Mature lady go for a friendship before step into a relationship.Materialistic women go for any man who is rich inregardless of the man look or age (which i address them as <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Bitch</strong></span>).</p>
              <p>My advise to you is that you are still young and get a guy who start off with you as friend before you even step into a relationship with him.I have seem and known many guys during my school days that guys just wanna have fun and laid with girls whom thrown themselves to him.Beside that,guys are not that serious around your age for relationship.Relationship need $$$ to maintanence.Go for a man who has already has already step into the sociality to work and much older than you so that he is finanically stable and plan better for your future if u decide to marry him in the later of the years with him.Don't waste your youth especially lady whom has time limited for marriage age over a man who is not ready and serious with you.Enjoy your life out there now and have fun with lot of your friends now.</p>
