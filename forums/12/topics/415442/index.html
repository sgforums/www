              <p>I have a friend who is below 18 years old and is still studying. His parents are very poor and even though he works part time to support the family and also they receive financial assistant from the government, it is still not enough for his family.</p>
              <p>He often have to eat just 1 meal a day..</p>
              <p>Sometimes he can just eat maggie mee everyday for 1 whole week..</p>
              <p>My question is will he actually die of starvation with just 1 meal a day?</p>
              <p>I think I got once read a newspaper article about a guy who died from lack of nutrition because he eat maggie mee everyday for 2 weeks.</p>
              <p>My friend is experiencing almost the same situation as the guy..</p>

              <p><br>Nobody will die if they had 1 meal a day.</p>
              <p>But it is likely to die if they had 1 meal a week.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Dying of starvation is a very slow and painful process, because your body will need to literally eat you up from your insides.</p>

              <p>TS' friend is below 18, in the puberty growing phase. Eating too much low nutrition food will make him skinny, thin bone , and short height. And once this growing phase is over at his twenties. He will stay short, thin and skinny FOR HIS ENTIRE LIFE. </p>
              <p>Bodybuilder eat a lot of bread and eggs to keep them in big size, never maggie noodles. Do you think they can afford good meals 6 times a day!?</p>
