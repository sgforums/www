              <p>To the Bear :</p>
              <p>Not that both of us cannot come to an understanding &amp; compromise, in many other times or rather not during the "PMS" times, we have always been very understanding towards each other no matter about work, relationship &amp; etc.... And our relationship is definitely not to doomed, we have been happily together for 5yrs liao.....</p>
              <p>But now we are talking about when your partner has "PMS" and start behaving different &amp; being unreasonable, it is a "Must" for you to be understanding &amp; tolerate?? Bcoz your partner tells you that's "PMS" What do you say???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To XiiaooBoon :</p>
              <p>PMS = Premenstrual syndrome, some gals tends to behave differently from their usual self 1-2 weeks before their period. Some call this PMS, to me it just a lame excuse for them to behave unreasonably.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PMS being tired, sleepy, feels moody or lost concentration @ work or lost focus doing things is understandable to me. But throw tantrum, talk unreasonable crap and other similar act is NOT genuine PMS!!! But a lame excuse to me!</p>

So to be a nice boyfriend, we tolerate it, but then where is our pride??? And where are the principle in a realtionship??? I believe all nice boyfriends are willing to be understanding and tolerance towards their galfriend's PMS behaviour, provided their galfriend also understand that it is not their boyfriend's problem that they have the PMS and their boyfriend is not obliged to tolerate it, but rather their boyfriend is being nice to be understanding and try to tolerate it. And also the gals should instead be appreciative for their boyfriend's understanding &amp; tolerance, rather than taking it for granted and always use it as a "Reason" then it is as good as a "Lame Excuse" right???</p></div>

              <p>Thanks for your comment. I believe i am an understanding boyfriend and have always been a good one, which is why although this thing have been going on for the last 5 years and we are still happily together. But I only want to know how other guys and gals feel about this.</p>
              <p>I am a Gemini, i have mood swing too sometimes, but i don't behave or do unreasonable stuff and expect my galfriend to tolerate it and be understanding about my mood swing, if my mood swing cause my galfriend feel upset or in anyway affected her, i apologise to her for it and not using my star sign as a "Good" reason for my mood swing bcoz some geminis has mood swing problem. I am being understanding to apologise to my galfriend when i have mood swing and it affected her, coz i know i don't have any good reason that i feel she is obliged to tolerate it.</p>
              <p>This is what i am talking about when a gal has mood swing &amp;  PMS and starts to behave unreasonably, they knew it very well that it is cause by their mood swing &amp; PMS hence they should not feel &amp; think that PMS is a good reason to use for all their unreasonable behavior and expect their boyfriend to be understanding and tolerance. Then where is the gal's understanding??? That they knew they are having mood swing &amp; PMS and they behave unreasonably and dun feel sorry for their boyfriend when he has to tolerate it??? They dun put themselve into their boyfriend's shoe???</p>

              <p>To be honest, i dont mind the PMS reason, i just treat it as if the girl is sick &gt;_&gt;, which is pretty much true. what do you do when a person is sick? you either help them cope with the sickness or you stay away from them till they get better~</p>
              <p>personally, i feel that the girls should at least warn others when they have PMS, i mean, what is with the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sudden</span> mood swing &gt;_&gt;</p>

              <p>Ermmm.... I don't think so..... But now it's not about the gal pronounced PMS and then start their unreasonable behavior. It is when a gal start being unreasonable, eg. argue with her boyfren over something for no reason, and we she failed to reason things with you in the argument and knew that she's at fault or being unreasonable, she stop the argument and said "Too Bad! You chose a wrong day! Today is the 28th!" And when you ask why about the day 28th? She replied "Cause it's close to the PMS period!" ???</p>
              <p>So do you think she is under heavy stress at that point of time? Do you think she has a good reason to behave like that? And eventually said that because it's PMS after she failed to reason with you??? Now is this "purely" unreasonable or really PMS??? You get what i mean?</p>

              <p>To be honest, i dont mind the PMS reason, i just treat it as if

              <p>Totally agree.... If the gal at least warn / remind others for their PMS &amp; Sudden Mood Swing, and seek for their understanding &amp; tolerance. I think everyone will be  understanding and tolerance.... But don't abuse this reason "PMS" or "Mood Swing" and always behave unreasonably and use the reason "PMS" for their unreasonable behaviour.... Then this is purely unreasonable rather than truly PMS.... Right???</p>

              <p>To the Bear :</p>
              <p>Not that both of us cannot come to an understanding &amp;
                      compromise, in many other times or rather not during the "PMS"
                      times, we have always been very understanding towards each other no
                      matter about work, relationship &amp; etc.... And our relationship
                      is definitely not to doomed, we have been happily together for 5yrs
                      liao.....</p>
              <p>But now we are talking about when your partner has "PMS" and
                      start behaving different &amp; being unreasonable, it is a "Must"
                      for you to be understanding &amp; tolerate?? Bcoz your partner
                      tells you that's "PMS" What do you say???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To XiiaooBoon :</p>
              <p>PMS = Premenstrual syndrome, some gals tends to behave
                      differently from their usual self 1-2 weeks before their period.
                      Some call this PMS, to me it just a lame excuse for them to behave
                      unreasonably.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PMS being tired, sleepy, feels moody or lost concentration @
                      work or lost focus doing things is understandable to me. But throw
                      tantrum, talk unreasonable crap and other similar act is NOT
                      genuine PMS!!! But a lame excuse to me!</p>

              <p>Dude, you are right.</p>
              <p>While PMS affects women in varying degrees and days, it should not be used as a lame excuse to behave badly towards their love ones.</p>
              <p>During PMS, girls are simply not in any mood to squabble with their guy.</p>
              <p>So, if she is in PMS mood, just leave her in <strong>peace</strong>, as she deals with the hormonal changes.</p>
              <p>If you have any issues to bring up, do it AFTER her menstrual period.</p>
              <p>During her PMS, you need not be exceptionally nice to her, nor behave differently. You just need to be your usual loving self.</p>
