              <p>Anyways, I didn't elaborate enough about the girl that retained during sec 5.

              <p>Anyways, let's call the girl, Alice. There was one time this teacher (He's now a VP) that mocked me by 'praising' me, she brought me to the toilet, could tell she nearly cried and kept telling me how she wanted to quit school and all.

              <p>But anyways, I lost contact with her because I got soo depressed and trapped in my own world. I didn't realise anything unusual about it until I kept thinking of it and then I realised who were the true people.</p>
              <p>I struggled during these 2 years retaking my O's but failed then decide to enrol myself into ITE and got myself a final gpa average of 3.3 (3.086 first yr, 3.586 2nd yr)</p>

              <p>From what you have posted, it is obvious that you are very self centered and only care about yourself.</p>
              <p>You may have a psychological problem, but this does not mean that you can wallow in self pity.</p>
              <p>Your misery will only stop when you finally think for other people.</p>
              <p>You may think that everyone you've met are bad and horrible, but why should they treat you well? It is not an obligation even though it would be really nice if they did so.</p>
              <p>Let me ask you, have you even tried to be nice to them? Have you done something to make others happy? Do you think you've tried enough? Can you say that you have given of yourself?</p>

              <p>Hey littlemissbonkers,</p>
              <p>Hehe, it does sound a little narcissistic. But erms.....it did happened to me, no matter how ridiculous it sounds. I got stabbed badly by a friend who initially was left alone and lost all her hair when she got promoted to my class, I came over and comforted her but she was always so selfish and screamed and shouted at me all the time everytime I came near her. Alice was the better friend. Sadly, I can't search for her in facebook.</p>
              <p>But I honestly feel sad for the group of bullies right now as two of their so called 'friends' stabbed them on the back too.</p>
              <p>No, I admit that I treat others like dirt and they did not reciprocate it very well.</p>

              <p><br>okay this one agree, again to an extend. you see a lot of ITS gradutes, some their families rich. so they just staudy a bit and take over family's business. while now lots of entrepreneur are graduates. i don;t deny those with lower education actually made a boss out of themselves. but of all the stories of succeessm behind there are also a trail of failures, bankruptcy . those bossess that drink an party at your place, some are really rich ones but sometimes many others just can get by only and yo won;t know the debts they are in until you see the books. Neopotsim, yesy although sg famous for corruption minimal but the family and friend comes first in workplace even iff its MNC exist.</p>

              <p>But I honestly feel sad for the group of bullies right now as two of their so called 'friends' stabbed them on the back too.</p>
              <p>No, I admit that I treat others like dirt and they did not reciprocate it very well.</p>
              <p> To Hugh Hefner,</p>
              <p>Yeah...thanks I guess? I am always very very long winded.</p>

              <p><br>Back stabbing is common in the working place.</p>
              <p>Take it as a pinch of salt.</p>
              <p>Same as bad mouthing...also a common virus in the working place.</p>
              <p>Take it easy or life in the company will be like a working HELL.</p>

              <p><br>okay this one agree, again to an extend. you see a lot of ITS gradutes, some their families rich. so they just staudy a bit and take over family's business. while now lots of entrepreneur are graduates. i don;t deny those with lower education actually made a boss out of themselves. but of all the stories of succeessm behind there are also a trail of failures, bankruptcy . those bossess that drink an party at your place, some are really rich ones but sometimes many others just can get by only and yo won;t know the debts they are in until you see the books. Neopotsim, yesy although sg famous for corruption minimal but the family and friend comes first in workplace even iff its MNC exist.</p>

              <p>Now, the higher your education, the more you weight the risk factor in doing business, this led to higher educated people dare not to take risk, cos they calculated it, and forever they are mostly working class, for the lower grade, cos lack of risk knowledge, they dare to chiong, take failure as nothing to loose, cos if they give up, they also got nothing to loose, go back find a technician or operator job and life goes on, but they strive on and more importantly, do what they like and finally reach success.</p>

              <p>Those are not friends, they are acquaintances.</p>
              <p>You have to be clear about what being friends with someone is all about. Just because you've added them on FB and know what shit they've been up to doesn't make you guys friends.</p>
              <p>A friend is someone you can share your thoughts, feelings and experiences with. And will be there for you when you need help or when you need someone there.</p>
              <p>Being friends with someone would also mean letting that someone confide her/his issues/secrets/problems with you, being there for them when they need help and sharing their burdens.</p>
              <p>So when I said you need friends...I meant real friends. Not just people you know.</p>

              <p>Yeah I talked to one of my ex-classmates about what happened during
              my last year in secondary school (I have to face my long hidden fears
              that caused most of my anxiety problems)</p>
              <p>Anyways, I talked to him till 3am morning and he shouted at me
              saying it wasn't about my english grade (I got an A) that I was placed
              between the two team member of the political group in the front seat.
              Then after that he logged off.</p>
              <p>Today, he went online on msn. I thought long and hard on my bed,
              knowing that in the past I used to skip school, show attitude problems,
              got bullied and so on and so forth. The seating arrangement in the
              classroom wasn't a coincidence. It was a great political play in the
              classroom. I thought hard and long and I realised perhaps the half
              front row of the seats was for people who are in great danger of
              failing in their school (aka the daydreamers that need loads of help
              and involved in playing the 'political game') and the back seat was for
              people who are decent in their studies. (Needing the least help and are
              usually left alone)</p>
              <p>The teacher who previously yelled at me to go
              to ITE knew I had my struggles in the front middle seat and placed me
              together with Alice. She was patient and tried her best to help me but
              I was really, really disinterested in school. People of the political
              group (including one of my 'friend') tried to bully her but she was
              unfaltered. She was really the only true friend over there. I really
              want to find her and really wish her all the good luck in her life.</p>
              <p>So that guy went online on msn. And I said hi and continued from
              last night...saying I know. Perhaps that teacher wanted me to drop out
              of school. He kept quiet and went offline.</p>
              <p>I know you people are
              thinking...what the hell. Why bother since it's a long ago event. But
              it was an unforgettable event that caused me great depression,
              distrust, nightmares and enormous anxiety for two years and continous
              till now I got this F&amp;B job and realised that sometimes, you got
              look beyond the facade and not trust people too much based on their
              appearance or thinking you know them that well.</p>

              <p>There was one guy, who was made out to be a bad person (I feel bad for him) helped me secretly and even caused a huge trouble because of me. And then this Alice girl too, got bullied</p>
              <p>I was lucky to be assisted by them in the last year but I didn't even notice it until I went out to work and now I decide to give it a try and trying to find them back right now.</p>

              <p>When and if, you do manage to find them, and you find that they're not the same people as they were before den how?</p>
              <p>Hopefully you'll be able to move on after that.</p>
              <p>But anywayz, this is your decision and I hope you know that whatever decision you make from now on will affect how your life turns out. And I hope you'll be able to take personal responsibility for it.</p>
              <p>Good Luck</p>

              <p>I don't know. But at least I wish I could talk to them or something. Especially these two.</p>
              <p>The teacher probably wanted to teach me a lesson (because I had serious attitude problems but I was only a naive teenager that had no experience or friends. And plus I got bullied badly. But anyways, the bullies got what they deserved anyways..not that I care, but hopefully they change their attitude)</p>
              <p>The 2 years was hell for me. How I wish I could go back in time and reject the first middle seat given by that teacher. How I wish my 'N' level certificate at that point of time could enter into higher nitec. I was preparing to enter ITE but by 'miracle' I passed 'N' levels.</p>
              <p>But nvm...I already gotten my higher nitec and now i'm schooling but not very confident though....because i'm a bit lazy hehehe...not in a studying mode right now...</p>
