              <p>He does not need to take medicine. He is just a normal manager
              that uses people. Have you work before? Or are you your own
              boss??</p>
              <p>He is a two-faced person.(what's new and so is everyone here
              except for one full-timer) and the hiring manager I asked him and
              the hiring manager on how to calculate my pay and they both gave
              two very different calculations.</p>
              <p>Let's call the two-faced manager, manager A and another manager,
              which is the hiring manager B. (she is a nice manager and shows her
              true self) I went down to the outlet during morning and I asked the
              manager B about my discrapancies on my payslip and also PERFORMANCE
              PAY and she widened her eyes and named two of the previous ex-staff
              to ask and even told me to go manager A (which means I have dropped
              down as she hurriedly asked me to tender my resignation) Whoever
              goes to manager A, it means their performance are in danger or they
              asked too much unrelated things. And if manager A is always smiling
              or laughing with you, he is only mocking and even sometimes teaches
              you all the wrong things if you are working with him. It's best to
              see his angry expression and you know your doing things right.</p>
              <p>And because I dropped down to him, I actually lied to him
              (through the phone and he angrily say to give him 5 mins) about
              wanting to get performance pay and he actually HAPPILY tell me that
              he can recommend me if I wanted to. (So very lol-worthy as i'm only
              a part-timer and on my payslip, there's no such thing as I've
              worked a few months and my performance sucks as I am always not
              part of the team or else I didn't know what the hell is going on in
              this workplace) Also, he have told me to see him personally at the
              outlet but I didn't want to because I know once I see him, I am
              finished and he would ask me to work more days (which translate to
              saying I am still not improving)</p>
              <p>And then for that I tell him about what I feel going on in this
              workplace (teamwork) and he mumbled and got nervous and when I tell
              it to him, he started to yell and shouted at me saying I was
              incompetent and so on and so forth and I nearly cried on the
              phone.</p>
              <p>He told me to quickly resign to find a better job.</p>
              <p>I admitted that because of my unsociable traits and personality,
              it caused a breakdown on everyone. But I can't help it...even if I
              continue my medication (which only just to calm my nerves) I would
              also not fully understand social norms and the know-hows and people
              have been commented that I am impulsive,crazy and love to spout
              nonsense.</p>
              <p>I've actually told my stepmum about what happened in the
              workplace and she also noticed something amissed with me the past
              few days and even tell me if she could ask my dad that i could be
              warded into the hospital.</p>
              <p>But erms of course I got scared and said no and tell her i'm
              fine and she even asked me why I kept skipping school and she
              scolded me.</p>
              <p>Yeah...so even if I go anywhere, I still have to control
              myself...which is quite difficult.</p>

              <p>I do not have any social anxiety problem, but I was diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome when I was younger, which is a part of autism, so in a way, can say that we are not really on equal footing in social settings. With such a trait, you can only learn to overcome all odds on your own. No one out there will give in to you due to this disability of yours. </p>
              <p>Learn what is social norm by heart. You do not have to understand what is it, just ensure that you're displaying the correct habits. Know what is acceptable, when to talk, what to talk, and what sort of words can cause a negative impression on the other party. If you do not want to buck up, you will only be going in circles. </p>
              <p>Medication won't change who you are, it can only help you to a certain extent. Only you can help yourself if you want to. </p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I am a part-time student and right now, i'm trying my best to concentrate on my studies (dec is my exams) but I can't because something about my part-time job is bothering me.</p>
              <p>I worked at this F&amp;B place for a few months and when I first came to this job, I had just completed my exams and I had a lot of things on my mind regarding about results and the school.</p>
              <p>The first day I was 'scolded' by this china colleague but I chose to ignore him because I was very anti-social, anxious and afraid of people. I was literally trembling because I judged people by their appearance like I always do, so if they appear somewhat fierce or b*itchy/bastardy or confident, I would start to get really anxious and could not take in instructions properly. In short, I was inside my own world.</p>
              <p>Then there was this girl who was younger than me by a few years 'calmed' me down by saying nice things about me. I thought she was being friendly to me at first but subsequently, I started to realised something is wrong when I was stuck doing only a particular station inside the kitchen whereas her and another two young colleagues was moving ard a lot, from the counter to the kitchen. I admitted that I was rude to her too but that's because i didn't know what the hell is happening.</p>
              <p>I was always getting scolded and being called 'slow' because I was just doing what i was supposed to do, like doing my own work and I don't understand why they were picking on me when I was told it was supposed to be like this and I just did but they just kept picking or shouting at me. Of course, consumed with confusion, I shouted at one of this china colleague, let's call him A, who kept screaming at me and banging the counter outside when I was serving the out the food. The other china colleague B, was scolding and picking on me in whatever I do. The assistant manager, a filipino was also picking on me if she was ever on my shift. I swear the food I serve was what they told me to do.</p>
              <p>I was also getting insulted, especially by this china colleague called A whenever I ask questions. I admitted that sometimes I was too pushy. Ok fine. But there was one time, he stared at me right inside my eyes and I was staring back at him and I was thinking ' are you alright?' He was holding an empty paper sack and then he started to tremble vigorously, looked down and tore the paper into half and started mumbling about how he would steal the virginity of the girls by doing what he did. I was standing there shell-shocked, completely insulted by his actions. Obviously I didn't tell anyone.</p>
              <p>So a few months passed and I didn't dare talked to this guy...finally I was sent outside the dining area, did well and got up to the cashier the next day. Anyways I was stucked doing outside work for a while but subsequently, I started to do things outside what a normal part-timer should not do which I wld not divulge it here. This continued for quite a while and I even got irritated when someone is standing somewhere doing nothing but I realised that they were doing things right whereas I was abit too 'hardworking'.</p>
              <p>So this china guy A. He always looked calmed the next day despite what happened yesterday or whatever. But he was always trembling (literally) with anger in front of me, talked about how other people are stupid like he was going to spit venom on them or else he would purposely threw things on the floor and screamed and shouted at me (like he's going to beat me up) if I didn't pick it up or else he would do the wrong things and push everything to me. I once overheard him talking bad abt me, saying 'tamade, she's not a mei nu' And if someone who knew the dynamics of the workplace vented their anger on him, he would take it out on me by indirectly insulting my gender to other colleague. And anything not done by those people, I would have to take the shit (obviously) and sadly, the screaming..if ever i was working with him. He would bang doors, insult my gender and nationality if ever I asked a questions regarding about the workplace.</p>
              <p>In short, because I didn't know what happend and couldn't ask, I was just literally taking in the abuse quietly because I didn't know what was happening. And he even insulted me saying that everyone knows except you and even smirk telling me how on this particular shift how abt how this colleague work like a nu ren (girl) and how this other full-timer colleague doesn't seem to do anything at all. Then I asked him i'm pretty sure you talked bad abt me. He lied and said no and said I was sooo good with sarcasm of course and then I asked him abt something he started to insult my gender again.</p>
              <p>I went back home, exhausted from my shift and upset abt all the insults he have given me just now and in the past and locked myself up for two days in the room and lose 7kg in total. I was laughing like a mad dog in my room and I thought of suicide.</p>
              <p>This time I already knew how the dynamics of the workplace is going on by looking at my pay slip, I mean I am just a part-timer, why was I doing do many things on my own doing? But no one is telling me anything though there was some part-timers and this asst. manager giving me hints here and there. Then I finally caught on and did things 'rightly' on my 'last' day.(I told them i wanted to resign but i told them no the next day, that is my 'last shift')</p>
              <p>I was relieved but yet tramautised  at how these people treated me just because I didn't know the dynamics of the workplace. They insulted my gender, insulted me personally (calling me fat and constantly remind me by repeating it) , telling me that i'm soo good sarcastically, telling me that i'm childish, stupid, laugh at me and all sorts personal insults. And I took in all these abuse for a pay of $5 per hour and I then I realised there's no pay increase if the performance is good because i'm only a part-timer. Then why do I have to bother with the dynamics of the work place for????</p>
              <p>So I went crazy yesterday and called up all the colleagues to purposely ask for the details of my pay and obviously because i was soo consumed with anger i literally smelt like gas, I was pushing them to tell me and obviously if someone with a pushy attitude or whatever they don't like would tell me all the wrong things and some told me the right things and I stabbed the person with the wrong details in the back. I just insulted them by calling up the main manager in charge over there. Then he told me to look for him but I hung up soon after.</p>
              <p>Tell me, what should I do??? I nearly died because of the abuse taken here.</p>
              <p>Anyone who has report workplace harrassment to the police?</p>

              <p>He does not need to take medicine. He is just a normal manager that uses people. Have you work before? Or are you your own boss??</p>
              <p>He is a two-faced person.(what's new and so is everyone here except for one full-timer) and the hiring manager I asked him and the hiring manager on how to calculate my pay and they both gave two very different calculations.</p>
              <p>Let's call the two-faced manager, manager A and another manager, which is the hiring manager B. (she is a nice manager and shows her true self) I went down to the outlet during morning and I asked the manager B about my discrapancies on my payslip and also PERFORMANCE PAY and she widened her eyes and named two of the previous ex-staff to ask and even told me to go manager A (which means I have dropped down as she hurriedly asked me to tender my resignation) Whoever goes to manager A, it means their performance are in danger or they asked too much unrelated things. And if manager A is always smiling or laughing with you, he is only mocking and even sometimes teaches you all the wrong things if you are working with him. It's best to see his angry expression and you know your doing things right.</p>
              <p>And because I dropped down to him, I actually lied to him (through the phone and he angrily say to give him 5 mins) about wanting to get performance pay and he actually HAPPILY tell me that he can recommend me if I wanted to. (So very lol-worthy as i'm only a part-timer and on my payslip, there's no such thing as I've worked a few months and my performance sucks as I am always not part of the team or else I didn't know what the hell is going on in this workplace) Also, he have told me to see him personally at the outlet but I didn't want to because I know once I see him, I am finished and he would ask me to work more days (which translate to saying I am still not improving)</p>
              <p>And then for that I tell him about what I feel going on in this workplace (teamwork) and he mumbled and got nervous and when I tell it to him, he started to yell and shouted at me saying I was incompetent and so on and so forth and I nearly cried on the phone.</p>
              <p>He told me to quickly resign to find a better job.</p>
              <p>I admitted that because of my unsociable traits and personality, it caused a breakdown on everyone. But I can't help it...even if I continue my medication (which only just to calm my nerves) I would also not fully understand social norms and the know-hows and people have been commented that I am impulsive,crazy and love to spout nonsense.</p>
              <p>I've actually told my stepmum about what happened in the workplace and she also noticed something amissed with me the past few days and even tell me if she could ask my dad that i could be warded into the hospital.</p>
              <p>But erms of course I got scared and said no and tell her i'm fine and she even asked me why I kept skipping school and she scolded me.</p>
              <p>Yeah...so even if I go anywhere, I still have to control myself...which is quite difficult.</p>

              <p>I also realised that I shouldn't ask too much bias questions or show any unrelated emotions or else I realised that I would get tons of hell and mocking. This is like equilavent to being a robot. I don't have friends to vent on and I live with my parents and my stepmum is also undergoing depression from her previous workplace as she's currently at home playing on her laptop. She told me she's going to do business with one of her friend soon. She is a very outspoken, confident lady but too bad she too, have too much attitude problems, similar to my own mother who doesn't care about us. I honestly said I suffered cutting words from her everytime she came back from her millions of job. </p>
              <p> And my father is getting older and older each day, he's starting to look like an old man. He's the only one right now working (management level) and well, I admitted that I'm still taking money from him (erms...recently)</p>

              <p>Working life is sooo difficult for people like us. No wonder I feel like committing suicide.</p>

              <p>Haha true. But the interview process and the qualifications you have determine what type of job(s) you would hold.</p>
              <p>Hopefully next time I won't land in a job that require too much teamwork. Maybe 2 or 3 persons will do.</p>
              <p> The backstabbing process is too much for me to handle.</p>
              <p>I used to get stabbed by the back by a 'friend' in sec sch and an ex-classmate during our last year in sec sch. Plus other group of people. They were grouped together with a teacher. But then again, our class is rowdy so the teacher group selectively together with them and used me as a scapegoat because I'm always getting bullied during my past years in sec sch. (I remember this teacher first came into the class and then the first thing he do was to "randomly" select people to come sit in the front)</p>
              <p>It wasn't a random decision at all. It was pre-planned and I got the bullseye.</p>
              <p>The funny thing is that they used this good looking guy as a bait to look at me like as if he is falling in love with me and he would laugh at those trying to tell me that i'm wrong and so on and so forth. In short, he was trying to do me in. The people who tell me i'm wrong (saying that i'm always late, lazy, trying to tell me not to do this, for example that retained sec 5 girl) will get loads of crap from them.</p>
              <p>In short, it was a really puzzling political play in the class and many of those who wasn't involve in the group got jealous of me because this good looking guy was 'falling in love' with me. They would try to snatch the attention of the guy and I don't even care actually because the other guy was always trying to bully me too (probably in their own group too). The girls there thought that this good looking guy was a good guy and their jealousy was really lol-worthy as they tried to get near him and stalk him.</p>
              <p>In the end, this girl who I believe is unaware of the group political play 'forced' herself on him and tried to lure him away from me.</p>
              <p>I would say she indirectly helped me. And also, everytime I shouted at the right person who is trying to do me good or smile at one of their "team members" , they would smile at me like as if they are happy that I failed.</p>
              <p>She imitated his every move and well at the end of school year, she even dyed her hair golden brown (similar to him) but in the end, he already got a gf of his own.</p>
              <p>But sometimes I don't understand why they would choose me as a target since i'm so disinterested in school anyways. They could advice me to drop it or something or maybe go to ITE? (which one of my teacher had told me to, even though she's fierce, but she's a pretty kind-hearted teacher which I know at the end of my school years)</p>
              <p>It was during O levels and yes I failed and got depressed and stayed at home for 2 years.</p>
              <p> Oh btw, I got my Higher Nitec in Accounting and i'm now currently doing my CAT/ACCA.</p>
              <p>I am still thinking of whether to apply for poly.</p>

              <p>Haha true. But the interview process and the qualifications you have determine what type of job(s) you would hold.</p>

              <p>I used to get stabbed by the back by a 'friend' in sec sch and an ex-classmate during our last year in sec sch. Plus other group of people. They were grouped together with a teacher. But then again, our class is rowdy so the teacher group selectively together with them and used me as a scapegoat because I'm always getting bullied during my past years in sec sch. (I remember this teacher first came into the class and then the first thing he do was to "randomly" select people to come sit in the front)</p>
              <p>It wasn't a random decision at all. It was pre-planned and I got the bullseye.</p>
              <p>The funny thing is that they used this good looking guy as a bait to look at me like as if he is falling in love with me and he would laugh at those trying to tell me that i'm wrong and so on and so forth. In short, he was trying to do me in. The people who tell me i'm wrong (saying that i'm always late, lazy, trying to tell me not to do this, for example that retained sec 5 girl) will get loads of crap from them.</p>
              <p>In short, it was a really puzzling political play in the class and many of those who wasn't involve in the group got jealous of me because this good looking guy was 'falling in love' with me. They would try to snatch the attention of the guy and I don't even care actually because the other guy was always trying to bully me too (probably in their own group too). The girls there thought that this good looking guy was a good guy and their jealousy was really lol-worthy as they tried to get near him and stalk him.</p>
              <p>In the end, this girl who I believe is unaware of the group political play 'forced' herself on him and tried to lure him away from me.</p>
              <p>I would say she indirectly helped me. And also, everytime I shouted at the right person who is trying to do me good or smile at one of their "team members" , they would smile at me like as if they are happy that I failed.</p>
              <p>She imitated his every move and well at the end of school year, she even dyed her hair golden brown (similar to him) but in the end, he already got a gf of his own.</p>
              <p>But sometimes I don't understand why they would choose me as a target since i'm so disinterested in school anyways. They could advice me to drop it or something or maybe go to ITE? (which one of my teacher had told me to, even though she's fierce, but she's a pretty kind-hearted teacher which I know at the end of my school years)</p>
              <p>It was during O levels and yes I failed and got depressed and stayed at home for 2 years.</p>

              <p>At school I was diagnosed with Hyperactivity. So the doctor gave me drugs. Reason why I wasn't hyperactive was because I was too drowsy to cause any trouble. So when my father started seeing my grades drop because I couldn't pay attention at school as I will zzzzzzz in class, he decided to take me off the drugs. I have no choice but to use my own will power to stay on course.</p>

              <p>I agree with Dragg. Who is that strong to withstand the anxiety that is provoked naturally? I can't control my subconscious. I mean It occurs just like that!</p>
              <p>So how do I write like a girl?</p>
              <p>Anyways, I didn't elaborate enough about the girl that retained during sec 5. This kind-hearted teacher who had previously yelled at me to go to ITE placed me together with her instead of sitting in the middle with two of the 'team members' of the group political play. She knew what was going on and probably was doing this for my own good.</p>
              <p>Loads of people hated her but subsequently over the years, I realised that even though she kept picking me on my work and others but I also noticed that whenever i'm alone or got bullied, she would tell those people off or ask someone that is kind enough to take care of me.</p>
              <p>Anyways, let's call the girl, Alice. There was one time this teacher (He's now a VP) that mocked me by 'praising' me, she brought me to the toilet, could tell she nearly cried and kept telling me how she wanted to quit school and all. (She now probably graduated from poly and also had a boyfriend  btw)</p>
              <p>But anyways, I lost contact with her because I got soo depressed and trapped in my own world. I didn't realise anything unusual about it until I kept thinking of it and then I realised who were the true people.</p>
              <p>I struggled during these 2 years retaking my O's but failed then decide to enrol myself into ITE and got myself a final gpa average of 3.3 (3.086 first yr, 3.586 2nd yr)</p>
              <p>Now i'm doing my part-time studies and also, I have to partially thank this part-time F &amp; B job that made me open my eyes up to who is real ones and who is the fake ones.</p>
              <p>Oh yeah the so-called team members didn't do that well. A lot of them went to ITE anyways or else to private schools or else they are just holding their failed O levels cert or else having children out of the wedlock.</p>
              <p>Why do they have to do this since it's only school and not a job. Can't they just help me instead pushing me over? And does it actually benefit them? Nah.</p>

              <p><br>Aiya, failure is part of life mah, fail is actually the begining of success, there are lots of ITE peoples I met are bosses, my drinks supplier, my renovator, our contractor maintenance, etc etc are all ITE or O level only, but all are towkays.</p>
              <p>1. favoritism: sometime, it is not the qualification that get you to somewhere, if the boss favour you (especially those in private co), you can also become a director or CEO, work shake legs and people have to look upon you,  if not, even master degree also work as head or manager only.</p>
              <p>2. Neopotism: same group of people or relatives who tends to work and flavour only their own peoples (can be dialect group or races), tho singapore is already a developed country, it is sad to say that nepotism still very much cultured in our working life.</p>

              <p>Why are you not concern about making yourself looking better?</p>
              <p>Don't you know that the society favors upon girls who are good-looking?</p>
              <p>Make yourself pretty and attractive to the society and you can talk about a different form of abuse and harrassment.</p>
