              <p>I am a part-time student and right now, i'm trying my best to
              concentrate on my studies (dec is my exams) but I can't because
              something about my part-time job is bothering me.</p>
              <p>I worked at
              this F&amp;B place for a few months and when I first came to this job,
              I had just completed my exams and I had a lot of things on my mind
              regarding about results and the school.</p>
              <p>The first day I was
              'scolded' by this china colleague but I chose to ignore him because I
              was very anti-social, anxious and afraid of people. I was literally
              trembling because I judged people by their appearance like I always do,
              so if they appear somewhat fierce or b*itchy/bastardy or confident, I
              would start to get really anxious and could not take in instructions
              properly. In short, I was inside my own world.</p>
              <p>Then there was
              this girl who was younger than me by a few years 'calmed' me down by
              saying nice things about me. I thought she was being friendly to me at
              first but subsequently, I started to realised something is wrong when I
              was stuck doing only a particular station inside the kitchen whereas
              her and another two young colleagues was moving ard a lot, from the
              counter to the kitchen. I admitted that I was rude to her too but
              that's because i didn't know what the hell is happening.</p>
              <p>I was always getting scolded and being called 'slow' because I
              was just doing what i was supposed to do, like doing my own work and I
              don't understand why they were picking on me when I was told it was
              supposed to be like this and I just did but they just kept picking or
              shouting at me. Of course, consumed with confusion, I shouted at one of
              this china colleague, let's call him A, who kept screaming at me and
              banging the counter outside when I was serving the out the food. The
              other china colleague B, was scolding and picking on me in whatever I
              do. The assistant manager, a filipino was also picking on me if she was
              ever on my shift. I swear the food I serve was what they told me to do.</p>
              <p>I
              was also getting insulted, especially by this china colleague called A
              whenever I ask questions. I admitted that sometimes I was too pushy. Ok
              fine. But there was one time, he stared at me right inside my eyes and
              I was staring back at him and I was thinking ' are you alright?' He was
              holding an empty paper sack and then he started to tremble vigorously,
              looked down and tore the paper into half and started mumbling about how
              he would steal the virginity of the girls by doing what he did. I was
              standing there shell-shocked, completely insulted by his actions.
              Obviously I didn't tell anyone.</p>
              <p>So a few months passed and I
              didn't dare talked to this guy...finally I was sent outside the dining
              area, did well and got up to the cashier the next day. Anyways I was
              stucked doing outside work for a while but subsequently, I started to
              do things outside what a normal part-timer should not do which I wld
              not divulge it here. This continued for quite a while and I even got
              irritated when someone is standing somewhere doing nothing but I
              realised that they were doing things right whereas I was abit too
              'hardworking'.</p>
              <p>So this china guy A. He always looked calmed the
              next day despite what happened yesterday or whatever. But he was always
              trembling (literally) with anger in front of me, talked about how other
              people are stupid like he was going to spit venom on them or else he
              would purposely threw things on the floor and screamed and shouted at
              me (like he's going to beat me up) if I didn't pick it up or else he
              would do the wrong things and push everything to me. I once overheard
              him talking bad abt me, saying 'tamade, she's not a mei nu' And if
              someone who knew the dynamics of the workplace vented their anger on
              him, he would take it out on me by indirectly insulting my gender to
              other colleague. And anything not done by those people, I would have to
              take the shit (obviously) and sadly, the screaming..if ever i was
              working with him. He would bang doors, insult my gender and nationality
              if ever I asked a questions regarding about the workplace.</p>
              <p>In
              short, because I didn't know what happend and couldn't ask, I was just
              literally taking in the abuse quietly because I didn't know what was
              happening. And he even insulted me saying that everyone knows except
              you and even smirk telling me how on this particular shift how abt how
              this colleague work like a nu ren (girl) and how this other full-timer
              colleague doesn't seem to do anything at all. Then I asked him i'm
              pretty sure you talked bad abt me. He lied and said no and said I was
              sooo good with sarcasm of course and then I asked him abt something he
              started to insult my gender again.</p>
              <p>I went back home, exhausted
              from my shift and upset abt all the insults he have given me just now
              and in the past and locked myself up for two days in the room and lose
              7kg in total. I was laughing like a mad dog in my room and I thought of suicide.</p>
              <p>This
              time I already knew how the dynamics of the workplace is going on by
              looking at my pay slip, I mean I am just a part-timer, why was I doing
              do many things on my own doing? But no one is telling me anything
              though there was some part-timers and this asst. manager giving me
              hints here and there. Then I finally caught on and did things 'rightly'
              on my 'last' day.(I told them i wanted to resign but i told them no the
              next day, that is my 'last shift')</p>
              <p>I was relieved but yet
              tramautised  at how these people treated me just because I didn't know
              the dynamics of the workplace. They insulted my gender, insulted me
              personally (calling me fat and constantly remind me by repeating it) ,
              telling me that i'm soo good sarcastically, telling me that i'm
              childish, stupid, laugh at me and all sorts personal insults. And I
              took in all these abuse for a pay of $5 per hour and I then I realised
              there's no pay increase if the performance is good because i'm only a
              part-timer. Then why do I have to bother with the dynamics of the work
              place for????</p>
              <p>So I went crazy yesterday and called up all the colleagues to
              purposely ask for the details of my pay and obviously because i was soo
              consumed with anger i literally smelt like gas, I was pushing them to
              tell me and obviously if someone with a pushy attitude or whatever they
              don't like would tell me all the wrong things and some told me the
              right things and I stabbed the person with the wrong details in the
              back. I just insulted them by calling up the main manager in charge
              over there. Then he told me to look for him but I hung up soon after.</p>
              <p>Tell me, what should I do??? I nearly died because of the abuse taken here.</p>

              <p>1) Since u already resign, let it go lah, treat it as a bad experience working in the resturant.</p>
              <p>2) Concentrate on your exam (dec) and get good results.</p>
              <p>3) No point getting back on them if you already resign.</p>
              <p>4) You may distrub them if you want to, invite a few friends (those very daring type) and go there for lunch/dinner during peak hour. And ask for unresaonable/demand things and create a din on the china man. Hey, china man really fark up!</p>
              <p>5) Lastly, move on, you have lots of bright future ahead of you.</p>

              if thats the case you have to do something to 'correct' yourself.  you have to work to survive.  and to work you need to interact with people.  
              
              forget about whats happening at your current workplace and move on.  its only a part-time job.  dont borrow trouble.  you will have enough to handle when you join the workforce full-time.

              <p>I agreed with dragg. I apologise if this seem offensive, but you may want to consider seeing a psychiatrist. You may not realise it, but these incidents have likely did its numbers on you. </p>
              <p>Unlike what other people say, seeing a psychiatrist does not mean you are crazy, it just mean that you care about your own mental health. You are likely suffering from depression from what I can read here.</p>
              <p>Now that everything is in the past, just heck care about it and focus on your studies. Get good grades, go for higher studies, and get a good full-time job. And here, have some chocolates:</p>

              <p>It has been scientifically proven that these sweet treats can really help to uplift your mood. Just don't binge on them.</p>

              <p>hello xiaobun,</p>
              <p>(don't know your age, i'll list my pay here for you to compare)</p>
              <p>when i was 14-16, i worked part time at a fast food restaurant for $3.50/h (started with $2.50)</p>
              <p>after my Os, while waiting for poly, my pay at a restaurant was $5/h</p>
              <p>during poly, working banquets &amp; a waiter at pub/clubs was around $6-7.50, sometimes more with tips</p>
              <p>don't care too much about pr at workplace, just care about the money. if you find the pay acceptable: ignore everyone, do your job, get paid and go home a happy man. doesn't matter if you work more or less than the others, doesn't matter if you're best buds or sworn enemies with your colleagues, at the end of the day it doesn't affect your pay anyway, and you're just there for the money.</p>
              <p>(if the pay sucks, just quit and find another job. or hang around at home)</p>
              <p>for the abuse, just keep telling yourself you're there for the money, and such abuse will train your character when you venture out for a full time job in the future.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>My previous post was done before seeing this post of yours.</p>
              <p>I believe it is not that the forummers choose to ignore, it is just that there is nothing you can really do about it. If you choose to bring a case against them, they can stand up for each other and easily overturn what you have to say. More importantly, they can counter-sue you for defamation and your IMH records will definitely work against you. </p>
              <p>To put it bluntly, it is a sure-lose case. If you seek police for help, there is nothing that they could do as well, since you have no evidence or alibi, and they can easily be alibi for each other.</p>
              <p>That is why the best course of action is still to garbage your memories there and toss it into the bin, and focus on what you can do instead: work on your examinations. It is pointless to dwell on things which you cannot do anything about, though I sympathies with you for what you have gone through.</p>

              what do you think your manager would do to satisfy a part-timer?  this is the real world we are talking about.  there are injustices everywhere.  you have to learn to prioritise.  is it so important to äº‰ä¸€å�£æ°”?  tender and move on.  you have a long way to go in life.  it is important to stand up for yourself but only if it is really necessary.  you are a part-timer and those colleagues of yours are just 'passerbys' in your life.  once you quit they are out of it.

              <p>really depends on the environment. some environmentyou see teh people is real fuck up ones. ts mentioned this one is definitely very nad, in fact you gor waitering service everywhere is the same that;s why i say service line is not for TS. youcannotchange a person;s character and there is nothing wrong if TS is quieter type. although i will say some of TS actions may require some thought over. the problem is all those foreign workers. when you allow them tomultiply in numbers they take their strenght or new found authorithy and use it on locals. people with high EQ qillalso know that people character varies. you come from a ulu kumpong country jus because you have many similar bahliats that does/nt mean you can change the local's chareacter or attitude. work is still work and making friends or getting too coonfty with colleagues is not a compulsary acttion.</p>

              <p>Ts, no point going to complain to your manager about that china man. Move on and dont look back. Think what need to change on yourself, I mean, be more open, smile to pple, have small chat, say good morning and good nite...those small thing can help you to get alone well with your future colleagues.</p>
