              <p>I used to work in an office environment and I was allowed to be anti-social and they only monitor my work, that's all.The people here are civilised though sometimes I get into conflict with them but most of the time is ok. One of my lady colleague even asks me to sit close to her during a new year gathering dinner.</p>

              <p>Your personal experience here is very common. Maybe before anything, you could take a good look at your attitude first. You admitted yourself that you ignored them, you shouted back at them, you gave off attitudes and so on. Are all these traits of a co-worker desirable? </p>
              <p>It doesn't necessary need to be an eye for an eye. Some of us, are unfortunately, are less well-endowed, and thus would be subjected to verbal abuse (e.g. fat girl) by shallow people who just couldn't look beyond the good of inner beauty. However, if you were to think over, if they were to throw stones at you, and you, instead of doing the same, throw bread back at them instead, don't you think it would have resulted in a different experience? </p>
              <p>By taking a step back, its a form of self-defence, and definitely not a sign of weakness. You do not have to get back at them just to satisfy your ego. If you complain to your manager, are you aware of the repercussion that you would encounter in future? If you manage to clinch an interview for an office job, team work is very important, who would want to hire you if you're always giving a tit for a tat and learns even more negative stuff from your manager. Learn to forgive.</p>

              <p><br> "could not take in instructions properly. In short, I was inside my

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>I can only say, the world/reality is like this, and it will not change for you. People who are not "strong" enough will be booted out. This is true <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">everywhere.</span></strong></p>
              <p>Sure, you can complain to your manager and to the higher ups. But so what? History will repeat itself. Because the painful truth is that, "you are the problem". The problem is, you do not fit in. And you do not even put in the effort to try and fit in.</p>
              <p>People will always want to be with someone who is agreeable and easy to get along with. Society <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">will always</span></strong> treat people with better social skills and higher EQ, a ton better than those without these traits.</p>
              <p>So all I can advice you to do is to <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">try</span></strong> and improve on your people skills, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">evaluate</span></strong> yourself. Make improvements. I'm not asking you to do this so as to please others, but so that you can avoid future grief. Do it for yourself. Eventually you're the one who will benefit.</p>
              <p>And yes, you should not have to face such treatment, no matter how lacking in EQ you are. But unfortunately, life is not a bed of roses. There are plenty of assholes out there who will cause pain and agony to others for their own benefit. So all you can do is to prevent such things from happening again. Either by turning into a hermit or by becoming strong enough. Since I don't think it's that feasible to be the former, I guess you can only be the latter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS: I don't think AA is a place for ranting (whinehouse is what you want), it's more like a place where you can seek advice/opinions from others.</p>

              <p>He does not need to take medicine. He is just a normal manager that
                  uses people. Have you work before? Or are you your own boss??</p>
              <p>He is a two-faced person.(what's new and so is everyone here
                  except for one full-timer) and the hiring manager I asked him and the hiring manager on how to calculate my pay and they both gave two very
                  different calculations.</p>
              <p>Let's call the two-faced manager,
                  manager A and another manager, which is the hiring manager B. (she is a
                  nice manager and shows her true self) I went down to the outlet during
                  morning and I asked the manager B about my discrapancies on my payslip
                  and also PERFORMANCE PAY and she widened her eyes and named two of the
                  previous ex-staff to ask and even told me to go manager A (which means
                  I have dropped down as she hurriedly asked me to tender my resignation)
                  Whoever goes to manager A, it means their performance are in danger or
                  they asked too much unrelated things. And if manager A is always
                  smiling or laughing with you, he is only mocking and even sometimes
                  teaches you all the wrong things if you are working with him. It's best
                  to see his angry expression and you know your doing things right.</p>
              <p>And
                  because I dropped down to him, I actually lied to him (through the
                  phone and he angrily say to give him 5 mins) about wanting to get
                  performance pay and he
                  actually HAPPILY tell me that he can recommend me if I wanted to. (So
                  very lol-worthy as i'm only a part-timer and on my payslip, there's no
                  such thing as I've worked a few months and my performance sucks as I am
                  always not part of the team or else I didn't know what the hell is
                  going on in this workplace) Also, he have told me to see him personally
                  at the outlet but I didn't want to because I know once I see him, I am
                  finished and he would ask me to work more days (which translate to
                  saying I am still not improving)</p>
              <p>And
                  then for that I tell him about what I feel going on in this workplace
                  (teamwork) and he mumbled and got nervous and when I tell it to him, he
                  started to yell and shouted at me saying I was incompetent and so on
                  and so forth and I nearly cried on the phone.</p>
              <p>He told me to quickly resign to find a better job.</p>
              <p>I
                  admitted that because of my unsociable traits and personality, it
                  caused a breakdown on everyone. But I can't help it...even if I continue my medication (which only just to calm my nerves) I would also not fully understand social norms and the know-hows and people have been commented that I am impulsive,crazy and love to spout nonsense.</p>
              <p>I've actually told my stepmum about what happened in the workplace and she also noticed something amissed with me the past few days and even tell me if she could ask my dad that i could be warded into the hospital.</p>
              <p>But erms of course I got scared and said no and tell her i'm fine and she even asked me why I kept skipping school and she scolded me.</p>

              <p>My present manager also like yours. Uses pple and a weather man an 2 faces manager.</p>
              <p>How I survive so long? We have a organised team colleagues, that work together think and thin. We already know my manager attitude and behaviour. We tried to detour whenever he come. He tried not to talk to him too much. We will not let him disturb our life and control our life. We happy work in the company knowing that he is a seow dog every morning barking at us. We treat this a joke.</p>
