              <p>Have you guys had a "cards on the table" discussion about what you see that you're bringing into the relationship and what she sees she's bringing in?  It could be a matter of neither of you acknowledging each other's contribution because you're too stuck in your own perspectives.</p>
              <p>If both of you can't or simply don't want to continue putting in effort to make things work, then pull the plug.</p>

              <p>Whoever says a relationship is easy ?</p>
              <p><strong>Perhaps you are just not ready for the demands of having one.</strong></p>
              <p>Take a time out , but keep it short.</p>
              <p>Let her know you have intention of coming back within a stipulated time. Women don't like to be left in the lurch with no dateline.</p>
              <p>Have the courtesy to let her know your final decision. Just because you cannot handle her.. does not means other men cannot.</p>
              <p>Remember.. love waits for no one.. when a love wanes.. it heads straight to the departure terminal.</p>

              my 1st bf.  he went chasing after some gal because she is rich.
              
              2nd one.  he pissed me off when he tried to talk like he knows, when he is a freaking virgin giving excuses about how morally uprite he is.Since you want a virgin wife that will be like his mother, totally no contact with her friends and family.  He really should go fine one in the baby section of a hospital.
              
              3rd was the hubby, his g/f called to say she is pregnant.
              
              4th was another bf who tried to put his name into owning a car which he wont be financing himself. I was very angry when the salesperson tells me what he done, and that the salesperson thought it was okay without checking with me.
              
              5th was a bf who tells me about how another old girlfriend has been so bad.  I got worried that he will be telling about me to his newer g/f.  Besides, he has a finacee and he is sleeping around with other females. I just dont want to touch someone that is committed to someone else.

              <p>Boy... I have to assume you are a xiao didi who never tasted female flesh. Do you understand the difference between driving your own private car vs driving a rental car ? Both are vehicles that gets you from point A to point B.. why is it that people are willing to spend so much money to own one ?</p>
              <p>In this day and age.. it's the men who keeps talking about finding a woman who is low maintenance.</p>
              <p>You don't hear a woman seeking a low maintenance man.</p>
              <p>So ... perhaps you may want to do more self reflection before you start asking questions ?</p>

              <p>do you love her? i suggest you take some time to think abt this seriously before you mention the words "break up". is your gf really the cause of your stress and emotional drain?</p>
              <p>it does come across to me like you have already made up your mind, and are just waiting for her to piss you off again, so that you can say, "this is the last straw! let's break up!" sorry to be frank ah. i hope i'm wrong, of course.</p>
              <p>i think break up shld only be the last resort. after you break up with her, you may feel free and relieved. but that may only be for a short while. there will still be many loose ends. such as, is it going to be permanent?</p>
              <p>or do you really want a temporary break? are you going to go back to her again after you've reenergised yourself? you know that this is not a solution at all. the cycle will just start all over again if both of you don't communicate. fr what you've said, it sounds like you feel that she's demanding. but she's not really the abusive kind. if you still love her, you guys can still work it out without breaking up.</p>
              <p>i feel that some men tend to ignore problems in a relationship by ignoring them. however, you must be responsible also. just cos your girlfriend is the one raising the issues, doesn't make her the "disruptive" one. :/</p>
              <p>similarly, just because you don't say anything, doesn't make you blameless for the problems in your relationship now. both parties are equally responsible for making things work. happy couples who are serious abt staying together long term are committed to solve problems together. they won't ignore them.</p>
              <p>if you really love her, try to communicate with her. let her know how you feel... it's in the way you phrase it... perhaps you had used an accusatory tone in the past without realising it. you can say to her "i feel unappreciated in this relationship...." use the first person... that normally shld put your partner at ease and she might be more receptive to what you say.</p>
              <p>i think there is no point you waiting for the "last straw". if you don't work it out with her properly, surely that "last straw" will come very soon. because she wouldn't know how upset you are about this right?</p>
              <p>you have to ask yourself... are you just waiting for the inevitable? i.e. just waiting for the chance to break up with her? cos if you are, you better just tell her now. there is no right or wrong moment to break up. but it would unfair to her, if you wait for her to screw up first, and then use it as your excuse to drop the "bomb" on her.</p>

              <p>there are women who pay for their men, ever heard of the ones who went bankrupt for their BFs because the bf wants a car but couldn't afford it? no money to pay but don't dare to say only can cry in their friend's arms?</p>
              <p>some also live off gf's money and others make their gf prostitute themselves to maintain the guys.</p>
              <p>even though i understand what you're trying to say...... but this statement</p>
              <p>"what difference is there between a woman and a prostitute?" a bit wrong cos prostitute is a profession. unless you want to claim all women are prostitutes.</p>
              <p>which is quite wrong also because anyone who agrees with you means we think our mothers are all prostitutes.</p>
              <p>so while i disagree with you on that but you're entitled to your own view.</p>
