            <div class='col-md body'>hey... it does not matter what way you swing in life...as long as you know who you truely are... Well since you love that girl so much... why not make your move...the chance will not be there forever you know.<br>and so what if people calls you gay, it is not as if you want to have sexual intercourse with the other person or anything.<br><br>Just believe in yourself and do what you want to do.

            <div class='col-md body'>If you like the girl, go for her lah! If you don't try, how would you know wether your relationship with her is meant to be in the first place?<br><br>Um.. about the gay part. Heck what other people think about you. It's alrite to get attracted to both sexes (depending on what kind of attraction lar). If it's sexual attraction that you feel, them hrm.. kinda hard to say.<br>Hmm.. you said you used to be from an all boys skool? Well I used to be from an all girls skool. It seems to me that it's quite normal for students in these skools to haf crushes or liking for their fellow skool mates, but that doesn't make them anymore les or gay than normal people. Get wat I mean?<br><br>------------------<br>I'll be your friend for a lifetime. Against the wind and the rain of every season. Won't walk away from the hard times. I will be your friend!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Pooch .. wat do u mean that your friends call you a faggot..and u feel gay..<br><br>Is it becos you really like making love ot a guy or is it only becos u have  a more feminine side. There is alot of diffecrence you know. IE the difference between a trans and a bi-sexual.<br><br>Maybe you are more feminine and that is all ( that is no real homo tendercies) and the reason why that girl is so close to you is becos she treats you like a close girl friend get wat i mean?<br><br>------------------<br>+++++++++++++++++++++++<br>Guns don't kill People<br>People Kill People<br>+++++++++++++++++++++++</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My heart's been shattered to pieces. I've decided to stop pursuing this relationship. I doubt it'll ever last anyway, though the potential's there. It hurts to see that we're both drifting apart while she's getting closer to the other guy.<br>However, me and the girl are still on very good terms despite the fact that we've hardly been interacting lately. She has no idea about what's exactly going on. That I love her. Guess some things are better left unknown. Being close to her gives me a really bittersweet feeling. I don't know what to do now except for feeling fucked up deep inside.<br><br>[This message has been edited by Pooch (edited 13 July 2000).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why Not Let her know at least ? Do you want to attend the wedding ... as a groom ? or as a spectactor ? (from earlier msg)<br>Besides ... being confused about your sexuality is normal in our teenage years ... even at 20+ ... (heard from some counciliars) so what you should do is ... to Court her ! You have a chance ... don't be shy like me ... Go on and strive for your freedom !<br><br>------------------<br>Love is Full Of Difficulties and problems ... even if you like her, she might not like you and vice versa ... and even if you 2 like each other ... there are always problems ...
