This is what is most dangerous cause when guys want to suicide, they keep quiet, whereas for girls, they tell people, so friends/families would help them.<br><br>to the TS, i suggest you talk to someone. especially close friends or family. cause you don't want things to escalate and to be lonely in handling relationship problems like this. and if a boyfriend is the type who disrespects you, I suggest you look for someone new. also, hitting someone is always wrong, and by hitting him you are no different than he is. be someone stronger and do not succumb to rage or revenge. and as the saying goes: sticks and stones may break my bones, but not words.</div>

There are many remedy to consider before escalating something like a relationship issue to physical violence.
