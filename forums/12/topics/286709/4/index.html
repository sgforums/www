I'm not going to personally insult your upbringing or immediate family members, but:<br><br>I'm confused with your inconsistency to follow your argument throughout - jojobeach. Are you trying to redefine the word ''oppression''? Isn't oppression an abuse or cruel exercise of strength? And in the case of Myanmar - the general context is still the same as the one YOU were talking about:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jojobeach:</div><div class="quote_body">What I am trying to say here is, in the face of an abuser or bully, you don't back down quietly.<br><br>An abuser continues his bullying ways, always because he believes he can get away with it.</div></blockquote>Aren't you already implying that an abuser is someone who is in a position of the exercise of strength since he is someone who ABUSE? Unless you're saying that the abuser was never in the position of strength when he is bullying irregardless of how ridiculous that may be.

Is that your personal opinion or objective substantive? If substantive, can I say that you are just simply putting forth an assumption and generalisation of the entire female gender? Surely you're also saying that we are ALL like that?<br><br>Who is the public? Does friends/family members count? If not, how is this relevant to my aforesaid argument?

I shouldn't bring in Myanmar's regional politics into the discussion - but I just wanted to make my point clear. Myanmar oppressing, therefore also abusing their position of power.<br><br>The issue with Myanmar is overdue, yes I agree. And forever escalating into greater levels of violence, which is, in my opinion, a case of non-diplomatic and non-peaceful protests to an already violent regime. I respect your difference of opinion, but in my response to the debate, I advocate that violence does not end violence. It escalates it. I am forever concerned with the aftermath and the what-happens-next after the struggle to end violence by using violence.<br><br>As I said before, I personally feel the women is often the victim to both mental and physical abuse. This is because the man in a relationship is usually physically stronger, and therefore abusing his position of being capable to cause her harm. Why then violently act against him to escalate the situation further? Women are stronger because I also believe that women are more emotionally stable - less impulsive to resort to violent outburst and acting on impulse. This is why I always see that ANY abusive relationship where physical hurt is caused is wronged by the man. But if the women start doing the same I cannot understand how she is acting wisely or rightly.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by jojobeach:<br>[b]The thing is, a victim is in a vulnerable position, instead of helping her and encouraging her, and to give her strenght , many people, yes even friends and family included , puts her to the stake and stoned her. /b]</blockquote>I don't think friends or family will forsake her la. At least not always. But there are many other channels to consider that are not only effective, but has strong privacy laws intact: voluntary organisation, social services - at the most extreme - legal intervention. This are just a few of the many ways she could seek help.<br><br>And IF and only IF she cannot find help in any of these channels, and violence is the ONLY answer, the very least she could do is ask a male friend to confront the guy (in a non-violent way at first) because I feel if she takes things into her own hands its unlikely abuse will stop.</div>

But she also asked if it was the right thing to do so, and to my mind, its not. What if her boyfriend went ahead and pour hot water on her?
