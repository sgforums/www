If that was so, many of us would end up being locked up. The question to ask concerns both intent and potential to cause such act. You can't, for example, stab someone if you have no limbs. Was your boyfriend actually holding a cup of hot water? Or was he reasonably in a position to immediately acquire such cup as to present the victim with such expediency and threat as to apprehend the violence being carried out?</div>
