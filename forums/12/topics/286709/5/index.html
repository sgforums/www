            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jojobeach:</div><div class="quote_body">Michaeled,<br><br>You are doing selective reading.<br><br>I spoke to one too many victim of abuse.<br><br>No, if friends and family are such ideal outlet for those victims, then what is the use of institutionalized assistance for ? Victims are not orphans or social outcast ok ?<br><br>Yes, thank god you live in a cushy eggshell, most people don't.</div></blockquote>???<br><br>Which part of my reading was selective? I've been following the flow of the argument and I'm placing what you said into context to make it easier to see what you meant at the bigger picture - that is, that she could not find help because no one will, and she should stand up for herself using physical means. Above I was illustrating the oddity of your statement (although yours was a proof by contradiction, I ignored reductio ad absurdum), so what I was looking for was justification on why you thought there is no answer to whether violence is right or wrong (when you assert that in this case it was right) and thought that Petti should seek help from people (when family/friends wouldn't as you said) and seek assistance from institutions (when you assert society and the public always put her down). And I feel the answer to that is that the argument and our direction is evolving and assimilating into the totality of what both of us is trying to say.<br><br>Institutionalized assistance usually brings family members, friends or other people in to the picture to help as well. I know this because I spoke to people who approached social services before.<br><br>It's a cop-out to say that just because I have access to good friends or family who is willing to help me that other people will not be able to do so somehow. If that is really the case, I really feel for them, yet at the same time I ask if they really believe no one out there would be willing help. Heck, I'm a stranger to the TS or to any abused victims ever yet I am confident and more than happy to help them, and I'm sure many people are like me.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jojobeach:</div><div class="quote_body">You are assuming Petti acts on impulse.</div></blockquote>Then you aren't? What should be the suitable assumption here in regards to the facts given? You just said she acted and responded based on the danger at hand and thus her mind works quickly to respond to the threat (assuming it was an immediate one). Impulse is the transmission of signals that produces a response. To act on impulse is to act without thought in a purely instinctual manner, like you said:<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jojobeach:</div><div class="quote_body">She was acting on instinct. A self protective mechanism embedded in our nature.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jojobeach:</div><div class="quote_body"> I believe in such situation, people's mind would tend to have assessed the immediate risk factor and initiate the response based on the calculated outcome.<br>In time of danger, our minds works faster than you would believe.<br><br>If Petti's bf is holding a knife, you can bet your life on it, her response would be very different. </div></blockquote>So her slap was a well-thought out decision of hers?</div>

"<br><br>Scenario:  Did petti slap him because she felt upset and disappointed?  Then she is in the wrong.<br><br>Scenario:  Was boyfriend moving towards the kitchen to get hot water or other dangerous tools while making statement?  Then she was doing it in self-preservation, to preempt any harm from coming to her, and the slap is justified.   She should have done it to throw bf off, and she should have ran off after that.</div></blockquote>I agree.<br><br>In my earlier post I said that the question was whether she was in an immediate harm (to her knowledge)?<br><br>If it was something made in passing like.<br><br>''I'm gonna hit your head with a frying pan'' and there was not frying pan in his hands, slapping him would not be self-defense.<br><br>It would, however be deserving sometimes, if you are one rude individual (irregardless of the law of whether you are right or wrong)<br><br>I had a friend whos grandma use to tell him ''I'm going to hit your head until you know'' in hokkien and slapping her seemed absurd to me.</div>

Only, I'm chasing the self-doubt preventing her from getting help (which was advocated in the previous posts), not the self doubt that she has in her physical ability to stand up for herself. Self doubt in other ppl's help is doubt nonetheless.<br><br>I respect your opinion and I guess difference in views is what makes this 80 years more worthwhile - you get to meet all sorts of people who may or may not agree on certain things.</div>
