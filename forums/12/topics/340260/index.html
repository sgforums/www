              <p>Someone send me this...</p>
              <p>Subject: Do not use pad more than 3 hrs!!!!</p>
              <p>IF u ever wondered what were the ingredients that made popular brands so<br>'free! and light and carefree', well here's the bit:</p>
              <p>The material that makes the pad so paper THIN, is cellulose gel. Yap,<br>it's not even cotton!!!!!!</p>
              <p>DO NOT wear the same pad for more than 3 hours of a maximum!!! After<br>this duration, the genital area is prone to bacterial action and may<br>result in cervical cancer or other complications!</p>
              <p>If you are a woman and use pads, but especially if you use tampons, read<br>this and pass it on to your friends. For the men receiving this email,<br>please forward it to your friends, significant others, sisters, mothers,<br>daughters, etc.) Thanks!</p>
              <p>Check the labels of the sanitary pads or tampons that you are going to<br>buy the next time and see whether you spot any of the familiar signs<br>stated in this email.</p>
              <p>No w onder so many women in the world suffer from cervical cancer and<br>womb tumors. Have you heard that tampon makers include asbestos in<br>tampons? Why would they do this?</p>
              <p>Because asbestos makes you bleed more, if you bleed more, you're going<br>to need to use more. Why isn't this against the law since asbestos is so<br>dangerous? Because the powers that be, in all their wisdom (not), did<br>not consider tampons as being ingested, and, therefore, didn't consider<br>them illegal or dangerous.<br>This month's Essence magazine has small article about this and they<br>mention two manufacturers of a cotton tampon alternative. The companies<br>are: Organic Essentials @1-800) 765-6491 and Terra Femme @(800)755-0212.</p>
              <p>A woman getting her Ph.D. at University of Colorado at Boulder sent the<br>following: 'I am writing this because women are not being informed about<br>the dangers of something most of us use: tampons. I am taking a class<br>this month and I have been learning a lot about biology and women,<br>including much about feminine hygiene. Recently we have learned that<br>tampons are actually dangerous (for other reasons than TSS). I'll tell<br>you this - after learning about this in our class, most of the females<br>wound up feeling angry and upset with the tampon industry, and I for<br>one, am going to do something about it To start, I want to inform<br>everyone I can, and email is the fastest way that I know how</p>
              <p>HERE ! IS THE SCOOP:<br>Tampons contain two things that are potentially harmf ul: Rayon (for<br>absorbency), and dioxin (a chemical used in bleaching the products). The<br>tampon industry is convinced that we, as women, need bleached white<br>products in order to view the product as pure and clean. The problem<br>here is that the dioxin, which is produced in this bleaching process,<br>can lead to very harmful problems for a woman. Dioxin is potentially<br>carcinogenic cancer-associated)and is toxic to the immune and<br>reproductive syst ems. It has also been linked to endometriosis and<br>lower sperm counts for men. For both sexes, it breaks down the immune system.</p>
              <p>Last September, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported that<br>there really is no set 'acceptable' level of exposure to dioxin given<br>that it is cumulative and slow to disintegrate. The real danger comes<br>from repeated contact Karen Couppert 'Pulling the Plug on the Tampon<br>Industry'). I'd say using about 4-5 tampons a day, five days a month,<br>for 38 menstruating years is 'repeated contact', wouldn't y! ou? Rayon<br>contributes to the danger of tampons and dioxin because it is a highly<br>absorbent substance. Therefore, when fibers from the tampons are left<br>behind in the vagina (as usually occurs), it creates a breeding ground<br>for the dioxin. It also stays in a lot longer than it would with just<br>cotton tampons. This is also the reason why TSS (toxic shock syndrome)<br>occurs.</p>
              <p>WHAT ARE THE ALTERNATIVES?</p>
              <p>Using feminine hygiene products that aren't bleached and that are all<br>cotton. Other feminine hygiene products<br>(pads/napkins) contain dioxin as well, but they are not nearly as<br>dangerous since they are not in direct contact with the vagina. The<br>pads/napkins need to stop being bleached, but, obviously, tampons are<br>the most dangerous.</p>
              <p>So, what can you do if you can't give up using tampons? Use tampons that<br>are made from 100% cotton, and that are UNBLEACHED. Unfortunately, there<br>are very few compani! es that make these safe tampons. They are usually<br>only found in health food stores.</p>
              <p>Countries all over the world ( Sweden , Germany , British Columbia ,<br>etc.)<br>have demanded a switch to this safer tampon, while the U.S. has decided<br>to keep us in the dark about it. In 1989, activists in England mounted a<br>campaign against chlorine bleaching. Six weeks and 50,000 letters later,<br>the makers of sanitary products switched to oxygen bleaching (one of the<br>green methods available) (MS magazine, May/June 1995).</p>
              <p>WHAT TO DO NOW:<br>Tell people. Everyone. Inform them. We are being manipulated by this<br>industry and the government, let's do something about it! Please write<br>to the companies: Tampax(Tambrands), Playtex, O.B., Kotex. Call the 800<br>numbers listed on the boxes. Let them know that we demand a safe product<br>ALL COTTON UNBLEACHED TAMPONS.</p>
