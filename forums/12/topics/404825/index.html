              <p>I am a 24 year old girl in the office. I am a bit petit and a bit overweight but I have a lot of friends. Recently the company hired this 30 year old single guy to the office. He is nice and quiet person. Me and my lady friends want to get his attention but the ladies in the office want to help me to go after him. He is average looking but I am desperate. At first I try talking to him and he seem nice. I also invited him to join us to disco and to the pub to drink. He always decline my offer. Make me so angry. I try to be nice to him but he only give me one word answer. I think he is playing harder to get. How come I got so many friend girl and guy but this guy is so lukewarm to me?</p>
              <p>So, I get the co-worker around to gang up on him. We purposely boycott him to make him angry. When we go out lunch we purposely avoid him because we want to punish him for rejecting my invitation. I want to get closer to him but he always stay away. Why? Then when we see him come to the office, he greet us good morning, we purposely ignore him. Then we plan in such way, that when I come I purposely say good morning very loud and I behave very chirpy. All the co-worker greet me and we make a lot of joke so that he can hear us. This way, he will feel marginalised and we can force him to come to me. We also organise a lot of birthday cake function but we purposely don't want to call him so we celebrate among ourself. But until now, he still keep quiet and don't want to socialise with me. Why?</p>
              <p>I want to disturb him and give him chance to date me. Why he cannot see my good character? THe whole office support me and we got so many parties but still he show no reaction. I am so frustrated.</p>
              <p>Then I get a manager to cause trouble with him. I know he needed to work closely with that manager to get his work done. So I get the manager to purposely talk very sarcastic at him and delay his work and make him suffer. That day, he got into a big argument with the manager because the manager cause delay to his work and the manager spoke very rudely to him. Good, now he is agitated. So at the company canteen I purposely chose the time he always go to lunch alone (since we boycott him), and when he is there, I purposely sit there alone eating lunch to invite him to eat with me. But he still go to the other table. So frustrating. Why?</p>
              <p>What should I do to get his attention? He is trying to play harder to get or is he not interested? If he is not interested, I want face. I am losing face, I feel ashame at being rejected by this guy. I must win ! But he is so strong, he keep on showing no reaction. He is so invincible, I cannot get across to him. How now?</p>

              <p>He cannot refuse. Our society very look down on 30 year old unmarry guy. So many woman not marry. I am 24, my elder sister is 28, it is because of this kind of guy, we are not married.</p>
              <p>I have support from whole office, it is part of the game, he must give me attention. I am losing face. You are woman, you must understand my thinking and my pride. But he is so far withstand all our attack. Last time we also disturb another 32 year old guy freshly join. This guy very fun to disturb because he so easily phobia at us. When he try to avoid me, I get my co worker lady friend to boycott him and also disturb him. So even the marry woman join in and disturb him because he is so fun to disturb. Not even 9 month, he quit his job. So lousy cannot take pressure. I want his attention but he don't want to give, serve him right. I hear he still looking for job. Never hell hath stir woman anger or else this kind of unmarry man will pay.</p>
              <p>But this 30 year old guy so frustrating. We purposely go and hide his stationery and he so stupid stupid ask around for his stapler and his files but we smart smart ignore him. Then we purposely play game so all the co worker make me centre of attention. Everybody come to my table and talk to me and make it sound so fun. We laugh so loud because we want to make him jealous. But he still give no reaction. He still  give me no reaction.</p>

              <p><strong>He cannot refuse</strong>. Our<strong> society very look down on 30 year old

                                      28, <strong>it is because of this kind of guy, we are not married.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>I</strong><strong> have support from whole office, it is part of the game, he
                                      must give me attention. I am losing face</strong>. You are woman, you must
                                      understand my thinking and my pride. But<strong> he is so far withstand all
                                      our attack</strong>. Last time we also disturb another 32 year old guy
                                      freshly join. This guy very fun to disturb because he so easily
                                      phobia at us. When he try to avoid me, I get my co worker lady
                                      friend to boycott him and also disturb him. So even the marry woman
                                      join in and disturb him because he is so fun to disturb. Not even 9
                                      month, he quit his job. So lousy cannot take pressure. <strong>I want his
                                      attention but he don't want to give, serve him right</strong>. I hear he
                                      still looking for job. Never hell hath stir woman anger or else
                                      this kind of unmarry man will pay.</p>
              <p>But this 30 year old guy so frustrating. <strong>We purposely go and
                                      hide his stationery and he so stupid stupid ask around for his
                                      stapler and his files but we smart smart ignore him</strong>. Then we
                                      purposely play game so <strong>all the co worker make me centre of

                                      sound so fun. We laugh so loud because we want to make him jealous.
                                      But he still give no reaction. <strong>He still  give me no

              <p>And you're 24. Almost a decade older than me, but yet so immature. This world does not revolve around a fat bitch like you. What you're doing is retardedly retarded(i dont know what i mean). Just because everyone is "supporting" you doesn't mean you can push your luck and test shit on people. You'd never know when you offend the wrong guy. I hope you do though, then you'll learn a lesson and stop being such a whiny, desperate, crazy bitch on a public forum. And back off the man.
