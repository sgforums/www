So, it does help, say open doors but whether you make it at the workplace or in life is not dependent on a degree.  Many of the world's richest and most successful, do not have very high qualifications.  If that is the case, we can churn up successful people by making them go thru universities!<br>To me, a qualification does indicate that you make the effort (or struggle) to learn (whether by rote or otherwise), and you met the examiners' standard. But for many, they think that when they obtained the degree, the world owes them a job, or certain salary, etc.! That is the old school of thought.  With globalisation, it is talent and ability beyond mere possession of qualification. Who really cares what you studied or where you studied if you can prove beyond doubt that you can do the job.

That is the mentality of most graduates. As for me personally , it just kicks open doors for me. My best paper qualification was not my degree but my permanent residency visa by virtue of my degree.<br><br>So degrees to me are an investment ....there is really no point that I do a masters for the sake of paper chasing. I am investing in my future and the master is kicking the doors I need open in Australia to form a foundation for my pay off .<br><br>That is why I am not working in Singapore any more.
