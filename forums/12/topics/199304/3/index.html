            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i think it all depends on the individual...Some take longer to get over it, and some take faster...Being sad and crying out is perfectly normal...Tears are there for a reason, and men do cry...<br><br>I had been through this experience before and i swear i'll never want to experience it again. During that period, i just told my friends not to say anything, i told them, "just be there for me can liao.." And i really appreciate those who got me through the tough period...<br><br>My advice is, let time heal all sadness...Be glad that ur loved one had gone to a better place where there is no pain and hurt. And be happy that he can be up there blessing you and your family....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think its easier to deal with the death of a loved one if, and only if he/she dies in a slow gradual manner e.g due to old age or illness, where you have mental preparations for the death, or when you feel that its better for him/her to leave earlier than later (die due to illness and he/she is in agony).<br><br>If the death is a sudden one, its difficult to come to terms to it as you are not prepared for... In this case, most likely, you are gulity and in regrets that you did not spend enough time with him/her etc.<br><br>Time heals wound. It takes a shorter time to recover if its the former. It takes a longer time if its the latter.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Anyway spidee, perhaps it will help the healing process if you understand a little about the grief process. What I learned was the 7 stages of the grief process, which helps some people to cope with the death of loved ones.<br><br>Without much further ado, here is the shortened version of it.<br><br>There are seven recognized grief stages. An individual will experience each stage during their grief; however, it may not be in order and some stages may be visited more than once. The stages of grief are:<br><br>(1) Shock or Disbelief that the loss has occured.<br>(2) Denial is the stage in which the person refuses to accept the loss has occured.<br>(3) In the Bargaining stage, the person attempts to reconcile the loss by making deals with other people, sometimes also with Diety.<br>(4) Guilt is marked by statements of "if only I had done/been . . . ".<br>(5) Anger is a natural stage everyone must pass. Anger may be directed toward the loss, the person lost, or even Diety.<br>(6) Depression is a stage that comes and goes throughout the grief process. Resignation at the end of the depression indicates that the truth of the loss has been accepted and the person is ready to move on.<br>(7) Acceptance and Hope means that you understand your life will never be the same but it will go on with meaning and hope.<br><br>Allow yourself to talk about the loss, and encourage others to do so. Draw on relationships with friends and family. Perhaps you may consider joining or forming a support group. Lastly, you could develop ways or rituals to celebrate your loss (birthdays, anniversary, life celebrations, etc.).</div>
