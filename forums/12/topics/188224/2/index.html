Act happy.<br>Hai..not like i enjoy feeling this horrible..at the back of ur mind before u sleep u sure know behind every man is two women..the gf..and the other close gf..(not gf in that sense la), and sometimes..while the man is at work...close gf will try to push gf down like some silent gladiator comp..wah lau..i don't wanna compete with her lo..if she want then i let her do everything for him..like now. Let her do his birthday..i just stand there zho bo become extra lo. After all, my suggestion all no good...she say my painting skill no good...so i dont paint picture for him lo. She say my idea no good...so i let her take over lo. Next time she say i gf no good..i let her take over lo. Easy right?<br>What i hate is bo tai bo ji kanna tio gan by her. Its irritating.

Otherwise i will end up complaining abt it same old same old.<br><br>I think she and the ex gf of his get along veri well. But the ex because got si bei alot of suitors, so she can really bochup him and get him running after her. She also si bei chio, and the other girl never hesitate to remind me. U know what she say to me? "U not that pretty le..but i think he really love u la."<br>HOWEVER, she got do nice things for me. Like she buy me my little pony toy for christmas etc. She cares.

And she does nice things for me and him. BUT..she is attached. with this guy for 3 yrs.<br><br>What confuses me and irritates the bejeezers outta me is that he say she is irritating and that he dun wanna play with her whichis one thing, but act like she s super best friend, even get angry wit me. She is nice to me, buy me things, BUT suddenly whack one insult to me. So what is what now? Who is the bad person here? Issit me? Because it is si bei confusing.<br>I dont tell him these things so he will fall out with her sia. This is bull. Why i tell him is because 1) i regard him as my bf 2) Since she is gonna be a close friend, then how do i resolve this 3) If i counter and make her cry, thats it lo I will look like the cb who is petty or whatever but who wont become like that if kenna this ?<br><br>Im so sorry to hear abt ur case....Hai..pple very difficult to trust...i trust him...but these days...slowly bit by bit he stop telling me things..then say its my fault because i will get upset...this cycle is familiar to me but the solution is not...and to me..if they get together then get together la..dun need to sway here sway there...and i just wanna be happy again...but dunno why what she says has been affecting me alot.  just don't know why. Usually it will fall off my shoulders.</div>

I know maybe she is tactless but innocent, but i dun think i am willing to tahan this for the rest of my life. Also, i cannot be the only one trying to accommodate. There must be a balance. I also have my own things to do wat. He think army very shiong ah. Wait till he start living my life le. The only reason why I seem so free is because i drop everything to spend time with him when he book out, i am happy to.<br><br>Also, maybe i always no money not like her...cannot cook, cannot be capable and dunno what else...oh ya, never pass driving the first try..like him..which she also start one neverending story abt both of them passing first time...see, irritating right? whats the point of all this? why wanna poke poke me until i feel the finger? I dun get it. Say one thing, act another. Very sian 1/2.</div>
