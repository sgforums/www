            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by browniebaobao:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: indigo;">Maybe she's really out to break the two of u up.<br><br>But it's really not worth it to give up someone u love bcos of a B|tch like her.<br><br>Apparently ur bf is very biased liao.  I think u will also ask yourself, who is his gf?  Why is it that you totally have no say about what to do on his birthday etc.. how come a fren can talk about his private part.  Were they together before?  Or are they sex buddies?   It really makes you feel out of place ba.<br><br>Cannot blame you for feeling insecure or low self esteem, bcos your lover is siding a fren and not spare a thought for your feelings.  I agree with you, girls<br>are girls after all.  Need to feel appreciated or pampered sometimes.  </span></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  thanks...so the way i am feeling is actually quite justified lar..I knew i dun anyhow suka suka feel crappy for no reason one.<br><br>No haha dun think they were anything b4...but I mean see he nowthinks anything and everything will piss me off...which he become defensive...that one i can understand what made him feel this way because he thinks i anyhow say his friend...<br><br>But what i wanna say is that I am really okay one, if she fetch him from camp because lets face it..she got car and if she can she will go one...Im also super ok if they hang out...even if its the both of them onli i can go this far to say im ok...but if he reacts the way i describe to u in my posts, towards the feelings i have, i sure cannot trust them together one. I will sure feel something wat. He think i also very free can entertain all this issit? Think all this is freaking carnival for me? I wanna be happy with him le. last time they hang out so much when I in melbourne le. But he last time got show me he is dedicated to me one. His ex slap on the face dunno for what lan jiao also i cannot cry on his shoulder. Im not expecting him to do anything to her wat..just let me cry and be there then i will instant be so happy one.<br><br>Then this girl...lan lan got to hang out with her..can one. i can accept the friendship. But if she left side hao lian to me say all these things, he right side heck care me, of course what sort of positivity i got? He tell me dun be so pessimistic, in my mind i thinking...really ah. Pls put urself in my shoes le...so easy to say heck care bochup her all this, but u kanna face with this kind of thing ur confidence sure deteriorate like one kind of sand flow down ur fingers one.<br><br>He now thinks the whole fault lies with my lack of self esteem. but in the first place, i damn confident one.<br><br>U know, when i come back, i try to improve my chinese, try to listen more chinese songs, admit i got try to be like that girl liddat. End up, I become more stupid, like losing brain cells. what i say becomes more and more idiotic, no more the intelligent poet he once fell in love with. Or rather maybe i just being hao lian  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  but really lo...this sort of thing can shake a girl upside down one. I stay by his side for so long already damn good liao.<br><br>So...any guys who got read this thread..remember next time ur girl is feeling low..dun anyhow blame her...because girls dun anyhow feel like this one. Just be there for her, and u can be sure her response will be satisfying one. If u want the girl to be happi, u must make her happi too, cannot everytime anyhow say her and expect her to smile at u one. She also dun need the headache too.</div>

She said me and the other girl are more serious kind...and when she ask question in a cute cute way, we dunno how to respond. Then i asked her, got problem meh? She say.."errrr...no la..i mean what to do right..." then me and the other outcast girl thinking..wat the hell u trying to say. Make us out to be some kind of alien liddat. And everytime the girl is with me, she will b i t c h abt the other girls. Dunno whether she got liddat about me to the others when im not around. Siao man the gossip queen is her lo!!!!
