            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe its because I've been getting sadder and not as happy as I used to be. I understand, I guess....its hard for a guy to deal with a girlfriend who has issues with everything. Its not like I asked to be insulted by that girl, you know. I love my bf. She knows that. Yet she says things to me like "oh me and him like this song" or "me and him used to....etc etc". And I just found out she saw the picture of his..erm..u know. Along with the other guys. She told me not to tell anyone and giggled. Great.<br>Im usually very open minded...until I sense people begin to treat me like some kind of a pushover. Just because I relent all the time, doesn't mean things don't build up. But, if i screw her upside down, she will cry. Or my bf will take her side anyway because hey, their friendship goes such a long way back. She is so close to him she can't stop talking about him. I used to think it was beautiful, until it got to the point she seems like she's contesting with me to remain as important to him.<br>We're still together but I need balance...cant take in everything all the time and he just bochups one side and only criticises me but don't really do anything to help.</div>

I became very volatile. Cause and effect, in doing so, he becomes more conservative. Doesn't talk to me as much as he used to.<br>I understand if we're not ready, that's fine. But it was how it was put to me, just like giving me something to believe in then taking it away suddenly and I had to fake a smile to pretend it was all good.<br>I admit I've not been very kind to him by overloading him with the sorts of crap i get from her. In fact, I have absolutely no desire to hate anyone whatsoever, but if a person is being insulted and consistently being reminded by another girl that she knows absolutely bollocks about her boyfriend, or that she is, in summary, DIFFERENT and therefore in the "outcast" category, I frankly have no other place to run. My self-esteem plummets farther into the freaking depths of I have no idea where.<br><br>Now, my main concern is how I can become my happy carefree self again. I will not intend to put up with this treatment farther. He can call me oversensitive etc, whatever its up to him to be creative, but I know I have a darn good reason for feeling this way. And if I am being reasonable, I will find a way to put an end to this rubbish. Without crying myself to sleep again tonight.</div>
