            <div class='col-md body'>u gotta wake up liao la. dun because a relationship is long means that u must try all means even to the point of ill treating urself to maintain it. dun give a fuck seriously its not difficult to find another guy unless ur goddamn fugly. watever ur gonna feel after breaking up is just some insecurity from splitting up from a long time relationship and having a major overhaul of ur lifestyle. u lidat sit there tio kan tio kaobei i dun tink u will be happy right? dun let urself become someone with a major emotional baggage i tio before its really quite hard to get urself on the right track again.<br>anyway i suggest u cease the futile action of trying to talk sense to ur bf liao since its extremely obvious that he's too 'friend' with the girl. i believe the idea of talking nicely has actually been suggested by some other forumers and has briefly crossed ur mind but its not gonna work. reality check ==&gt; the relationship has reached a point where talking simply isnt going to solve the root of the problem.<br>now u can try to hang in there and maybe wait for the girl to fuck up or for ur bf to get sick of that slimy girl. or u can wake up and leave this relationship which is taking a toll on u. personally i'm not too optimistic for u on the former that kind of girl u noe how sticky they are and more. if u really go break up there's positives for u in any case: (1) hopefully, ur bf maybe, juz maybe, will wake up a bit and find out wat's wrong, in which case a proper talk might actually be appropriate under such circumstances. depending on how much he is distracted by the girl though. (2) u get urself out of a messed up relationship.<br>good luck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i noe its difficult to put down a relationship dat has been so long and dat u still love him.. but a relationship doesnt work if only one party is giving out, n e other party acting as though hes a toilet bowl, always in, nv out.. its a fact dat he doesnt treat u as well as dat girl-fren of his.. excuse me.. if dis is e case, u as his gf is only his gf by name.. so wads e point? dun let him drag u on.. he's not worthy of ur love.. im sure dat girl is already more dan juz a fren to him.. leave him and only den will he realise whos true to him, n whos e f*ckin hypocrite as time goes by.. im sure no one can act for more dan half of her life.. n by den, u will already find a better man, n for ur dear bf now, he would haf wasted half of his life wif a hypocrite if he ever chooses her once both of u r not together, which is likely e case.. dun mind me saying.. dat guy is a jerk.. n dat girl is a bitch.. dun waste ur life on them.. u can lead a better life..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

And she does nice things for me and him. BUT..she is attached. with this guy for 3 yrs.<br><br>What confuses me and irritates the bejeezers outta me is that he say she is irritating and that he dun wanna play with her whichis one thing, but act like she s super best friend, even get angry wit me. She is nice to me, buy me things, BUT suddenly whack one insult to me. So what is what now? Who is the bad person here? Issit me? Because it is si bei confusing.<br>I dont tell him these things so he will fall out with her sia. This is bull. Why i tell him is because 1) i regard him as my bf 2) Since she is gonna be a close friend, then how do i resolve this 3) If i counter and make her cry, thats it lo I will look like the cb who is petty or whatever but who wont become like that if kenna this ?<br><br>Im so sorry to hear abt ur case....Hai..pple very difficult to trust...i trust him...but these days...slowly bit by bit he stop telling me things..then say its my fault because i will get upset...this cycle is familiar to me but the solution is not...and to me..if they get together then get together la..dun need to sway here sway there...and i just wanna be happy again...but dunno why what she says has been affecting me alot.  just don't know why. Usually it will fall off my shoulders. </div></blockquote>I think there ain't no sure way to tell for now...<br><br>It could be that they really don't quite like you and see you like a thorn in the eye... More unhappy with the fact that you're actually his gf... Trying to make things difficult for you so as to rid of you... At the same time trying to act 'kind'...?<br><br>It however can also be that it's just their character and nature... Somehow maybe just quite different from yours... Your bf... His friends... I don't have much doubt that he kinda 'enjoy' their company in 1 way or another as friends... Otherwise they won't be together... The 'minus' thing about this is that somehow there is a tendency for his mentality to be naturally closer to theirs... Or to be influenced by them in certain ways...<br><br>As for between you and your bf... I'll suggest you just try to keep things cool with him for now... Personally I feel that it's better for the engagement to be called off as there really isn't enough stability in the relationship to withstand the external factors revolving around it... If you know that your complaints are irritating him, try to cut down on that or minus it off totally from them... As much as I would like to see that as a form of communication bridge between you and him when done correctly.. I just don't see how it would help if it is to break things down totally before any much of other appropriate 'communication' can be reached..?<br><br>Alternatively, you can try to voice out whatever you wish to say to him to a friend instead...?<br><br>At this point, I think it's more important for everybody to keep their cool.. And yup.. Perhaps like you've mentioned... To watch the 'entertainment' but not to overreact to them...<br><br>Just to add... It is quite 'strange' (ok, not really that...) for a couple to be engaged because he often feel very happy when he's with you.... In a relationship, it's really not just about being happy together... Imagine if you're both married to each other.. What happens when you're not 'happy together'?</div>

And who wants to get caught in this crossfire? I can suck it up and suppress it like I always do and probably get old faster, or somebody whom she listens to and takes seriously can just tell her right in the face. I dont really feel sorry for her if she cries because in the first place, you're gonna get what you give. And the irony is, she now tells me she hates his ex because that chio bu used to play with HER bf, and that made her uncomfortable. What a sick twist.</div>
