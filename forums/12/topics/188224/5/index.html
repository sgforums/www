            <div class='col-md body'>*sigh* Its very hard isn't it? People expect you to change, and ironically they can't wait very long for that to happen. Change isn't just snapshots of you in your messed up state, some background music, bits of you trying hard and disciplining yourself, and in the next few minutes, film you completely changed. Just like a movie. Real change takes time.<br><br>My bf nags me alot but not moderately. I am not sure if I'm being a fool, but hell, who isnt when it comes to love and trust and all that sht. Just my luck to believe in love so much I'd freaking do absolutely anything to make the man smile. Yes, I am sort of freaking ugly. That girl tells me all the time until I really look damn ugly now. Funny nose, funny eyes, funny smile, fat fingers, tummy..bleah. She makes it all seem like sucha crime. What the hell is wrong with girls nowadays man. I mean girls like her, those act cute types. Don't they realize how freaking fake it is, and how annoying it is, and how NOT infectous and NOT cute are their usually dumb statements.<br><br>I mean, she even THINKS that my bf has ridden an ostrich and a rhino. Ostrich, i don't blame her for believing because its possible. A Rhino?? Damn. She gotta be really dumb. Either that or she knows that its impossible but thinks its cute to be dumb.

You've got choice and you've got choices... But you just ain't thinking straight... You just reminds me of a devoted religious follower.. Believing too strongly in FAITH and drowning within your own thoughts...<br><br>Understand that love is not just about keeping someone... Sometimes it's also about the courage to let go.... Pls learn to protect yourself and walk out of it bravely while you still can today....<br><br>From the way you've described yourself, it's just difficult to let go of a gf who is all that sacrificing... And keeping you also means that he has nothing to lose at all....<br><br>Hereby hope to remind you... STRONG LOVE and FAITH only works if you're practising the RIGHT 'religion'... If you're in a WRONG one, you're just condemning yourself....<br><br>Anything just give me a call or sms me....?</div>

I would imagine the latter scenerio to be much more dangerous and harmful for yourself... If you think you can't handle a break up now, can you imagine what would happen by then? And an extra word of caution.. You should know your own situation much better than I do... Sometimes painful as it may be, it's just meaningless to strive away from the inevitable..<br><br>Like you've said, you were once a VERY HAPPY GIRL... I've seen many 'used to be happy' people before... They're now constantly trying to find back their own self but to vain... Don't wander too far off to the point of no return...<br><br>Whatever 'bad' that had been said about your bf have mainly came through your own mouth (posts)... Though on the other hand you've always been reassuring yourself.. Saying that it's ok... Just see how things go.. etc. It's really not that ok because no progress is really being made... Current situation would only easily suffocates you as time goes by, and it's quite unlikely that you're gonna be getting any 'assistance' to change your situation unless you've decided to change it yourself...<br><br>You can't totally free yourself from the current 'trap' unless you're detached from your bf... And like you've said, you USED to be SO HAPPY together... Why the changes now...? Now that he's behaving differently... And he no longer see you as the person you used to be... It's just like 2 total strangers trying to live behind the fairy tale of 2 people from the past.... FAITH ALONE is ONLY get you THIS FAR. If nothing else is pushing the situation on for the BETTER, FAITH can only push you a little further up before you bump yourself into the WALLS.<br><br>As much as I hate to mention this, but may I remind you of KIM? How she's being treated and how else now has changed? From the point of an outsider, EVEN YOU can EASILY SEE.... SERIOUSLY, my MAIN CONCERN is that you might end up the foot steps of her... SOMETIMES some things just happen TOO FAST and BEFORE you know it, ALL would be DRIVING you ALMOST INSTANTLY without much room for proper considerations and thoughts... GIVE yourself more 'SPACE' and CUSHION from matters...<br><br>Take a step back and learn to humbly let go of something then EVERYTHING... To LOST MORE of YOURSELF when it's too late...<br><br>MAY YOUR FATHER BE WITH YOU.....</div>

There are two distinctive power struggles: between a girlfriend and a gal friend AND that of a boyfriend and his friends. This heavy power struggle has robbed you (the Lioness) of your divine authority that is bestowed onto you - the position of a girlfriend in a status and rights.<br><br>When a Leo is denied of his/her rights, the Lion/Lioness becomes aggressive and vindictive. But chances are (especially when Mars is not strong), the big cat's howl is worst than its bite. You may look terrifying, but beneath that exterior is a wounded cat.<br><br>This wound represents your ego and you have also lost much of your previous radiance because you can't seemed to receive the kind and form of affection you deeply craved. You don't make tremendous demands and that all you need is for him to gently stroke your mane and cuddle into your embrace.<br><br>The big cat needs to feel love and affection from his partner, before he/she could give a wide smile, reciprocate the same euphoric affection and become a happy lion once again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Have you ever thought of the fact that your bf's ex-gf could have actually hated her like the way you did?

I would imagine the latter scenerio to be much more dangerous and harmful for yourself... If you think you can't handle a break up now, can you imagine what would happen by then? And an extra word of caution.. You should know your own situation much better than I do... Sometimes painful as it may be, it's just meaningless to strive away from the inevitable..<br><br>Like you've said, you were once a VERY HAPPY GIRL... I've seen many 'used to be happy' people before... They're now constantly trying to find back their own self but to vain... Don't wander too far off to the point of no return...<br><br>Whatever 'bad' that had been said about your bf have mainly came through your own mouth (posts)... Though on the other hand you've always been reassuring yourself.. Saying that it's ok... Just see how things go.. etc. It's really not that ok because no progress is really being made... Current situation would only easily suffocates you as time goes by, and it's quite unlikely that you're gonna be getting any 'assistance' to change your situation unless you've decided to change it yourself...<br><br>You can't totally free yourself from the current 'trap' unless you're detached from your bf... And like you've said, you USED to be SO HAPPY together... Why the changes now...? Now that he's behaving differently... And he no longer see you as the person you used to be... It's just like 2 total strangers trying to live behind the fairy tale of 2 people from the past.... FAITH ALONE is ONLY get you THIS FAR. If nothing else is pushing the situation on for the BETTER, FAITH can only push you a little further up before you bump yourself into the WALLS.<br><br>As much as I hate to mention this, but may I remind you of KIM? How she's being treated and how else now has changed? From the point of an outsider, EVEN YOU can EASILY SEE.... SERIOUSLY, my MAIN CONCERN is that you might end up the foot steps of her... SOMETIMES some things just happen TOO FAST and BEFORE you know it, ALL would be DRIVING you ALMOST INSTANTLY without much room for proper considerations and thoughts... GIVE yourself more 'SPACE' and CUSHION from matters...<br><br>Take a step back and learn to humbly let go of something then EVERYTHING...
