              <p>My marriage has been a sad one.Hubby and I dun talk much. Was kind of an arranged marriage.We cannot divorce. We stayed married on as we have 2 small kids. Lately, I met my ex and we had a walk &amp; talk. He is getting married .I felt happy for him and at the same time, I could not help thinking of those times we had loved each other deeply.I feel so envious and at the same time, I kind of miss his love for me. We did not marry then as he was 3 years younger and was not well-off enough.My family wanted me to be with my hubby then.</p>
              <p>It is so sad to be in a loveless marriage. I wish I can die.</p>

              <p>U r not alone as many marriages that even started well, can end in divorce. Is best if you hv close pple to talk to and don't bottle things up. At least your children next time will repay you for being such a great mama,something to smile about.</p>
