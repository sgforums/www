              <p>Hi Simple Annie</p>
              <p>I cannot comment about your marriage life as my is not a successful one either. However, as an adult, I think we shall be responsible for our life. You had make a choice and I think you shall learn to live with it.</p>
              <p>I know that there are many things in life we cannot choose, but we can always choose to face what we have positively or face what we lost miserably. :)</p>

              <p>If you're gonna just whine and not do anything to improve your situation then you better expect criticism. </p>
              <p>And they are right, no one forced you to get married to someone you didn't love. You may say that you were coerced or "forced" etc etc, but the truth is, you didn't have the guts to stand up for yourself.</p>

              <p><br>Yeah, whine like Miss Bonker, screaming wif the straight jacket in the IMH cell.</p>
              <p>It is good thing she married bcause she got her kids. Woman feel very secure when they have kids to give them continuity. Don't follow example of Miss Bonker Boh Sia, still virgin, berate every guy wif a dick, it is jeolous of, until end up like grannie on the rocking chair wif false teeth.</p>
              <p>So Simply Annie is only facing a phase in life, soon Simple Annie will see how cute her kids are, and appreciate what she has. Not like Miss Bonkers always in the IMH mental patient cell, screaming like mad lady suffering from depression of loneliness.</p>

              <p><br>yo, no doubt the human brain is one of the best creation in the world or probably the universe, but then, the problem with human, unlike CPU and Angel, it cannot delete and with no rubbish bin to throw off unwanted memory. So, by and large, people tends to go back and think of their sweet young time.</p>
              <p>Let me go check with God and ask if he can programme a system to let human erase or completely delete their unwanted memories.</p>
