Seems like i have lost touch with this world.<br><br>But remember this, no matter what a girl do or how she loves a guy who was her ex or present steady, she cannot loose her virginity before marriage. No matter how tempting a situation might be, no matter how modern this city is!<br><br>Remember how our parents used to teach us, our forefathers and their father's father? Remember our customary traditions? What have we become? Well, unless you are not Chinese.<br><br>I understand that Mark must love this gf of his very much, else he will not even bother to post his problem here and seek advice. Mark would have rejected his gf straight. But from most of the postings from the guys here, you ppl are indirectly encouraging such acceptance. You know what will happen if every girl in this world feel that guys do not bother much about their chaste? Gals will start losing it just to maintain a relationship or to gain trust from their beloved bf! This is wrong!<br><br>Forumers here listen up, face the truth. If the same thing happen to you and if you are in Mark's shoes, would you do the same? So great, unselfish and generous? Think again.</div></blockquote>hi Gogo i understand how u feel abt this issue cos i share the same opinion about chasity as you.. it is really sad that our chinese culture has been washed away by the westernization that is happening here in singapore.. for the girls out there pls dont be foolish and give up ur chasity because of a moment's hormonal rage that wil wash ur mind.. u all must be careful as the decision u make at that point of time that will need a long and tough time to heal if its a wrong decision.. jus like wat happen to my gf.. im lucky cos our foundation of our love is strong enough to hold me back from the urge to leave.. which i will regret for i will not be able to find someone who will love me as much as her.. girls pls be responsibe to urself ur family and future husband.. u might think it is too conservative for a modern time society but take a step back and look at it.. is it a babaric behaviour if we humans (not only chinese) are polygamus.. i cant say that i've got over it 100% but trust me i dont deserve this.. on the other hand i apologise to all u there who had been hurt by us guys ; u all dont deserve this..<br>i therefore conclude that if we are responsible for our family our spouses and most importantly ourselves we can save alot of unneeded hurt of feelings and disappoinments .. for the guys out there who cheating girls of their feelings and chasity i've got something for u guys... GO FUCK URSELVES SHAME on YOU..<br>(sorry for my language.. i dont have enuff vocabulary to express my feelings)</div>
