Have you ever in your entire lifetime watched/surfed porn or masturbated or looked at another girl with lust? If you have, would you believe if i told you your heart have commited 'adultery' against her as well? the difference is that you would not leave permanent tell-tale 'scars' on your body like maybe a broken hymen or something. Dare you confess to her? She did. Respect that. Good luck to you, man.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
