Too tired and sick to post.. Mind not working well too.. THink about it.. If virginity is really that important to you... then dun be in this relation...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Ask yourself this one question: How many ladies in the world are virgin?? Well i guess (from my view) Most of the women are not virgin... So if you happen to meet all your gf and have lost their virginity.. Are you goin to dump them all one by one.. and live your life as a bachelor.. Until one day you finally found one who is a virgin.. but not someone you love..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You can overcome this fear you had in you! Face it or forever you live with it.. Is neither good or bad... But when you know you found someone who you really love and really wan to spend your life with.. but found out she isn't a virgin.. And you are jus gonna give up your happiness jus like tat?? and let it pass thru your life... I hope you won't regret if it really do happen!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Well.. since she already told you about it.. Its up to you to decide whether you can take it or give up.. If you really love.. you wont mind all her past.. but to live with her.. together with you.. and go towards your future and life ahead...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Take careZzz and Cheers!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Unfortunately, that thing hor once done can't be undone. If i were in m@rk's shoes, i would constantly reassure her to have confidence that i would never allow her past (whatever it is) to haunt our present or future. If she can abandon her past, i can accept her altogether and live with all external repercussions. Cheers.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
