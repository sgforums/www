            <div class='col-md body'>I see the pain of everyone who has posted here. Some have relationship problems, losing loved ones or the love of someone. Other have financial problems, like myself who lost so much <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=27105" rel="nofollow">(read here)</a>.<br><br>I felt like the end of the world, just like <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=28576" rel="nofollow">cereal killer</a> and his case with his ex-wife and daughter. I felt that life had little meaning. Everyone was telling that it was just money that I lost and not a limb or a life.<br><br>I find that very true. We all have something to be thankful for each day that we are alive. One thing we must not become is the walking dead. That is when we just carry on living and have not the slightest hope for tomorrow.<br><br><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=27940" rel="nofollow">AsTr0GiRL</a> has been wondering how to let go for so long now. She will go through life each and every day and start each day fresh. One day, things will turn out for the best and this could be a blessing in disguise. We just need to keep believing in ourselves for a better tomorrow.<br><br>Similarly for <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=28413" rel="nofollow">annoyed</a>, I agree that 6 years is a long time to be in a relationship that has yet to lead to marriage plans, but it is still only 6 years compared to perhaps the many, many more years of life that awaits each and everyone of us.<br><br>Wake up with a new day, and go "GOSH" for each start of a new day. You have many things going for you that you might not realize.<br><br>I lost a lot of money (or at least it seems quite a big sum to me), but I am thankful for the loved ones who are still with me. Those who are need not necessarily have helped me financially, but they were there for me. And I am thankful for that.<br><br>I still have my health. I still have food on the table and roof over my head. I am clothed properly and do have to sleep on the streets. I have a job to go to in the morning and students who want me to teach them by evening. My girlfriend, thought angry as she was with my losses, is there for me.<br><br>I am going to try and forge for the future. I have dreams and goals, and plans in the making of how I will achieve them.<br><br>Who knows what I'll be doing tomorrow. I believe every experience, no matter how severe and painful it may seem at the time that it happens, has a bigger purpose behind it.<br><br>Live life with a purpose and let your purpose drive you.<br><br>Feel free to email me and we can share views on life.<br><br>My warmest regards to the readers,<br>Colin Teo</div>

We might feel that the someone we are with is the one for the rest of our lives even though there is a lot of heart pain involved.<br><br>Then you have to evaluate if the situation is worth the pain. Love without the pain is not love at all. We would be selfish to just expect that everything would be plain smooth sailing when it comes to a relationship.<br><br>I thought the same way as you too. I never thought that anything could go wrong until it did. Then it felt as though it was too late. I made a big mistake financially and now both parties are upset at the loss. I blame myself for the loss and she is upset that I loss so much. It has been an unhappy topic for the both of us.<br><br>And so through this experience, it is a test for the both of us whether we can see each other through this problem or not. True that it is a problem that could have been avoided, but now that it has happened, we can only make the best of it and respond to it.<br><br>Life has its share of problems for everyone. Some loss loved ones, some loss out in love, some loss money and others loss more like health.<br><br>Be grateful and appreciate what you have. I have learned a hard lesson in life. But I am glad that I am still here and alive, facing the challenges of tomorrow.<br><br>Regards, Colin Teo</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>People accessing to this forum pours their problems so freely because it is virtual space. Behind every smile face, there is a misery and painful story in our other side. By common sense and constant reinforcement from people, everyone knows that we have to be thankful for all the things - giving and given. But in real reality, this fact is always pushed away because people don't want to give up the security and comfortability that they are holding on. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Trying not to blink for 1 minute and a minute passed, you will feel how fortunate to be able to blink.<br><br>Who will be constantly grateful for such small matters of life? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>People have to remember the good things that have taken place, cherish and move on. You have to be contented with things that you have already received, even if one day something would to happen, move on and don't come to a standstill to hinder your advancement.<br><br>People who suffered losses finanicially - Finance is a cycle, people get rich and poor over the period of your life - apart from the lucky few. Spend what you have. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>People who lost love - you are happy with him/her once, so when both of you walk your own path, it shows that the lesson to be learn from him/her is over. You have to search for higher learning - apart from the few who never learns. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>People who family problems - Family problems are something others can't do a thing about and it only shows one thing: Greater powers wants you to learn from it. Everything happens for a reasons: Gods wants to tell you that 'Hey, such problems are happening in your family, now you know, so next time when you are a parent yourself, never let your children experience such life again because you have already gone through. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>People who other problems: If you shield the canyon from the wind, you will never see the beauty of their craving. So never compare, because the values and experience you learn, those 'better' than you won't know.<br><br>The 'rich' have imported lantern to light their garden...<br>The 'poor' have the stars at night... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>
