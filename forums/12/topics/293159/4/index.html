Go talk to a counsellor. You don't have to tell your mom that you went to see a counsellor if you really don't want to.<br><br>Life is a long and exciting journey. Its just that sometimes you get blinded by certain events and you seem to lose sight of the long term picture. Take a break and try looking at everything from a different perspective, mayb you will gain some new insights. Do something that you really want. For me i went backpacking. Take a semester off from school if its neccessary. Don't lose sight of your goals and dreams <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>TO ALL FORUMMERS: Everyone goes through a down point somewhere in their life. What people need during these times are the support of one another to pull each other through. So unless you think you are the perfect human who will never encounter such setbacks in your life, keep your criticisms to yourself. Try putting yourself in other people's shoes once in a while.</div></blockquote> Hi Sepiroth, I agree with yoghurt that talking to a counsellor would perhaps help you to understand more about your needs and concerns. If you are still a student, you may wish to approach your form teacher and ask him/her to refer you to a school counsellor. If you wish for privacy, you can also consider seeking counsellors from nearby student or family care centres.<br><br>People who are suicidal, for whatever reasons, big or trivial, find it hard to manage their expectations. Expectations towards society and family, and expectations imposed by society and family, real or perceived.<br><br>I have been taking medication for depression for more than half a year. I also have been depressed since my school days. And I'm in my late 20s now.<br><br>Talking to a counsellor/psychiatrist is nothing shameful nor does it suggest you are weak or useless, especially if you are a guy. Guys are expected to be strong in any society throughout the world and this is not something females can understand. It is not their fault and neither is it yours.<br><br>You alone bear the responsibility to help yourself. As fellow 'sufferer', I'm relieved to read that you are very willing to help yourself instead of just taking the easy way out.<br><br>Your life is your own and it's precious, no matter how you view it or who will value it.<br><br>Take care, Sepiroth.  ^_^<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You think YOURS is bad ar..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Like that if u are me u already commit suicide at 14 yrs old.<br><br>U havent even graduate yet. Havent even know what is out there. Havent even sit down and think for yourself and those around you. Havent even stand on the cross-roads to be in persuit of your own happiness knowing that ur actions is an act of selfishness to others especially ur parents OR tied down by the obligations for ur family members , ur parents and ur siblings. Thats assuming u have siblings and u want a better life for ur parents. Or tied down because non of ur family members are able to and u have the ability to make changes for the better for everyone but at the cost of ur own dreams n future. To be with the love of your life or pursue what you have dreamed of doing at the other side. Which trust me.. u WILL stand upon the crossroad. And if u are feeling the fear now .. then u might as well kill urself to save urself the trouble and the stress in the future.<br><br>Even until today i am still faced with all these problems. From parents , family members , people around me , obligations , dreams, conscience. No matter how hard i try i cannot find a WIN WIN solution. its NEAR impossible. Something has to be sacrificed. The external forces at work that are influencing ur decisions. The uncertain future of the choice u will have to make sooner or later. The opportunities on both scale are limitless.  On what is right and wrong when there is no wrong but only rights and the wrong will be the decision u make and the sacrifices u will have to make. Will u shoulder that burden or let others shoulder it for you and the consequences of ur actions.<br><br>U talk about how u have exhausted all options. I dont think u have even tried much options,  maybe because u are unable to come up with any solution to try hence u give up. So the solution for u , a quick way up. Suicide.<br><br>You will NEVER achieve greatness. All great people have battered not just what nature has thrown at them but how the hand of fate has put them against near impossible situations , emotional hardship and stress. But they all have 1 thing in common. NEVER SAY DIE. N thats why they are able to BE where they are today. Ur situation is chump change compared to any of them.<br><br>U talk as if ur mum is a psycho. Unreasonable to the point where u either kill urself or u kill her.  If THAT is really the case , u better kill her and plan the ultimate murder to save urself. OR you can suck it in like  man , graduate and show her what u are capable off. Because as i can see it , u are only all talk n dreams. While u cant even produce results. N u can say that she doesnt give u a chance to produce results ... trust me... if u want to , u can. Hell unless u are too dumb to manipulate ur school time to do the things u want.<br><br>When u talk about ur potentials , its just another pathetic excuse at where u are at now. U are only totally curbed off ur potential when u are a graduate proffesional in aeronautical engineering but forced to make donuts in a donut factory , in china or hell.. some ulu place somewhere on this planet. Even there  u may be able to make something out of it using ur skill. But what have u got now ? So what is ur ...'potential' .<br><br>I have decided to post today because every advice given by people here are responded by excuses and negative attitude. You cannot be reckless in your behaviour and cannot allow emotions to affect ur judgement because u will be clouded and no longer having a sound mind.<br><br>I have to stop here now. Or else u will sien to read the long post and become more pek chek n later really kill urself.<br><br>I was thinking of pumping u full of drugs n b|tch slapping u. But u are lucky u are not a close friend of mine.<br><br></div>
