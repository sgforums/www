            <div class='col-md body'>I agree that suicide is never an option. I have been suffering from depression for quite some time, but I never knew that I was. Singapore is quite old fashioned in the way that we have to learn to get through the hard times... bite the bullet and go on.<br><br>I really empathize with everyone that posted their problems, and would like to think that I am able to help or worse case... at least am able to lend a listening ear.<br><br>What I did was firstly go to a polyclinic to see a GP. Then got a referral to a hospital of my choice. Note that this course would take a noticably longer time, as hospitals are fully booked usually. But this will enable you to get a subsidised rate. In the meantime you might be prescribed some stuff to tide you over.<br><br>Pls seek help if you are feeling suicidal! If you don't know what to do, pls don't hesitate to talk to me!</div>

My problem of the limitation of freedom is so big that I feel I have lost a mere sense of mutual respect from everyone around me. I am beginning to feel that life continuing on like this has no purpose.</blockquote>then find a purpose in life.<br><br>first, u need to dump your girlfriend who isn't a real girlfriend.<br>ask yourself if she's giving you more sadness or happiness. gf = give happiness, not sadness.<br><br>for your family, can't be help. life is unfair, so get over it.<br><br><blockquote>Does it give her a permanent high to see me being submissive? I want to stand up to my parents yet they make things difficult.</blockquote>if your parents are nasty, then it's their business.<br>can't be helped. stay away from them, and away from people who are wet blankets and keep pouring cold water on ye'.<br><br><blockquote>I feel suicidal because I cannot continue being oppressed by my mother. My girlfriend has so many things to see to, she neglected me. Trust me, if I told her how I feel, I would get a 'What is it again now' type of look and she would tell me she is too busy.</blockquote>for one, u're too naggy, obessive and clingy that it freaks her out.<br>i wonder why she didn't dump you.<br>she's a good girl, considering the current standard of SG girls.<br><br><blockquote>I feel that whatever I do cannot be achieved because my potential is stunted by these 2 women of my life. I am truely troubled. Even if I break up with my girlfriend, my mother will always be my mother. Suicide has been my last option yet I have exhausted other options My mother will dismiss everything as a family affair if I seek professional help. I am helpless. I do not want to wash the dirty linen in public too.</blockquote>leave them alone.<br>women = trouble regardless of who they're.<br>ever since i distance myself from all females except my mom and goddess, i've been a lot happier.</div>
