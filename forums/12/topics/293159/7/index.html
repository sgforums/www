            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by sEphIrOth:<br><strong>As of my previous posts, I talked to everyone about my situation but no one wants to realise my position. [b]I am posting this in all seriousness about my feelings as I am helpless and I wish to seek help here as the first option</strong><br><br>My family fails to listen to me and my girlfriend does not want to listen to my problem as she says she has work problems. My problem of the limitation of freedom is so big that I feel I have lost a mere sense of mutual respect from everyone around me. I am beginning to feel that life continuing on like this has no purpose.<br><br>I have evaluated my thoughts. I talked and discussed matters only to be rebuked by my mother like this 'Anything you say, you will think it is right so I have no comments because you only think of yourself.' I am compromising yet she wants to be right. I have thought of a plan rationally but she holds her ground. I am helpless. Does it give her a permanent high to see me being submissive? I want to stand up to my parents yet they make things difficult.<br><br>I feel that my parents curb my potential. I have always thought about a compromising plan so we both could be happy, if not, least unhappy. However, everytime I try to be tactful, my plea gets thrown out even without the slightest concern.<br><br>I feel suicidal because I cannot continue being oppressed by my mother. My girlfriend has so many things to see to, she neglected me. Trust me, if I told her how I feel, I would get a 'What is it again now' type of look and she would tell me she is too busy.<br><br>I feel that whatever I do cannot be achieved because my potential is stunted by these 2 women of my life. I am truely troubled. Even if I break up with my girlfriend, my mother will always be my mother. <strong>Suicide has been my last option yet I have exhausted other options</strong> My mother will dismiss everything as a family affair if I seek professional help. I am helpless. I do not want to wash the dirty linen in public too.<br><br>I am mentally tired and I do not wish to continue yet it breaks my heart to end everything. Thinking back, I have nothing.[/b]</blockquote>How REALLY BAD is your parent (mother) that is so damnable that you find it hard to breathe? What is she restricting you from? Do you think you have a CASE here for the police to solve? What is LIMITATION of FREEDOM?? I think you really have a lot of problems in yourself that you have overlooked and/or ignored right? Be HONEST!!<br><br>And your g/f being the most understanding and supportive one in your life has turn a deaf ear to your problems bcos of WORK? Is it really bcos of WORK that she is unable to hear you out?<br><br>As much as you have said about not wanting to AIR the dirty linen here, I do not think you have anything that is so unmentionable here if it were to lead you to suicide.<br><br>You seem to say so much about your mother's misdeeds on you but my logic is this "FOR EVERY CAUSE - THERE IS ALWAYS A REASON" So, I think perhaps you should really examine yourself here as to what really caused your mother to be like this TOWARDS you. Out of curiosity, how did you get your banged up KNEE? I do not believe that this storm arose without being stirred. For the basic of parental love is that they will never "prey" on their own and certainly will not put their own in harm's way.<br><br>You even complain of going out on holidays with your family....preferring to be with friends rather&gt;&gt;!!! Hey, you really have some kinda thinking??!! Let me ask you a question, who do you think will be going to the grave first under normal living conditions? Your mother or you? How much time do you think she has here on mother earth? Do you think that she bore you out to pressurize and undermine you? Boy that must be really expensive compare it to ABORTING you and put you in a JAR? What's your idea on the subject of filial piety?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"></div>
