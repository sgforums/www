            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sEphIrOth:</div><div class="quote_body">about my gf, quite true. i will not brood too much about her.<br><br>Secretly? it is hard to secretly find a job. i can talk to my dad, he is very understanding but i feel that my mother is the head of the family and it is hard for my father to make decisions. my mother is stingy as to the amount of money she gives me. my dad understands and he is willing to give me what i need. i do not ask for much, not having things most teens have. i am simple and dress simply. i eat simple dishes. all i ask for is something special once in a blue moon and the request gets rejected.<br><br>they think that bringing me holidays would make me happy. in fact i feel obliged to go holidays with them. it is what makes them happy not me,. i have to follow them around and it is a chore as compared to when i go out with my frens, and i spend lesser.</div></blockquote>What can I say?<br><br>You have no choice. You live under her roof. She feeds you. Without her, you will have to solve the problem of finding shelter and food. Don't be mistaken, I am not asking for you to sell your soul to anyone, but what I am about to suggest may startle you and others.<br><br>From a strategic standpoint, you are like a small country with limited resources, relying on the goodwill of your neighbour which controls all the resources for them not to attack you and swallow you up. What do you do?<br><br>I am not the type who will end my arguments with "she's afterall your mother" statements. You know you want out. Here's how.<br><br>1st, you can't die. You die, you can't get out. Since you already have entertained the thoughts of suicide, let me tell you the good news: you are in no hurry for anything, including killing yourself. Since you are in no hurry, then you should have no worries. Since you have no worries, I suggest you think of a plan to coolly execute to get yourself out of your predicament.<br><br>You need connections. Not just any connections. I won't suggest anyone here, including myself. You got to sell yourself to powerful people in your circle or community, and stand out among others. You will discover that these people will ultimately share their secrets of success with you in riddles.<br><br>Everymorning when you wake up, take 3 deep breaths, have a cup of strong coffee, and tell yourself today's not the day to die. Go on and plan your day according to how you want to achieve your longterm goal, FREEDOM. Make no mistake, if a mother intends to trap you now, she will trap you forever, and when she passes on, everything will be too late, your life is already ruined. Don't let mothers do that to you. It is your duty to your ancestors.<br><br>Having gf troubles? Dump her. I don't think you are in the right frame of mind to fix any relationship problems of this nature. I'm not saying she's totally at fault, I'm just saying that the road to success is lonely, and a good partner is waiting for you at the destination.<br><br>And yes, seeing a psychiatrist can be very expensive. My suggestion, ENDORPHINE. You don't need to buy it. Just go for a run, and run until you feel like throwing up. Feels great after that.<br><br>Mum tells you to obey her? Say yes to everything. What you do behind her back, she may or may not know, depends on your skill. WHo's manipulating who now? You have control.<br><br>Ok, that's all I have to tell you for now. You may or may not agree to what I have said, you call the shots, its your life, not mine. I have already taken the necessary steps to correct mine, and I am glad I took it. No one will blame you for being an infilial son, but everyone will ask you why you are stupid enough to ruin your own life.</div>

Even if u think what i said is undesirable, i will still scold this word again. Why bothers to keep a gf who don't care for u?
