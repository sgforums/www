            <div class='col-md body'>hey dude. i suggest that you get some professional help asap. in your current situation, you probably feel like the entire world's against you and that is dam fked up, i know i've been through that. it's not your fault, its not what you'vre been wired up to think like. its just that you've been through so much that you can't take it any longer.<br><br>take things easy man. get some personal time out and think things through. if it so happens that your negative thoughts manifest particularly during those times, then instead go get a job and make yourself as busy as possible. in fact you play sports right? thats good. play it as hard as you can, so you dont have any energy left to dwell upon the negativity.<br><br>whats important now is that you understand your situation is not dire, and that lift yourself out from the depression. take care   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Sepiroth, if you find life life too unbearable mayb you should seek some professional help. Go talk to a counsellor. You don't have to tell your mom that you went to see a counsellor if you really don't want to.<br><br>Life is a long and exciting journey. Its just that sometimes you get blinded by certain events and you seem to lose sight of the long term picture. Take a break and try looking at everything from a different perspective, mayb you will gain some new insights. Do something that you really want. For me i went backpacking. Take a semester off from school if its neccessary. Don't lose sight of your goals and dreams <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>TO ALL FORUMMERS: Everyone goes through a down point somewhere in their life. What people need during these times are the support of one another to pull each other through. So unless you think you are the perfect human who will never encounter such setbacks in your life, keep your criticisms to yourself. Try putting yourself in other people's shoes once in a while.</div>

[b]I am posting this in all seriousness about my feelings as I am helpless and I wish to seek help here as the first option</strong><br><br>My family fails to listen to me and my girlfriend does not want to listen to my problem as she says she has work problems. My problem of the limitation of freedom is so big that I feel I have lost a mere sense of mutual respect from everyone around me. I am beginning to feel that life continuing on like this has no purpose.<br><br>I have evaluated my thoughts. I talked and discussed matters only to be rebuked by my mother like this 'Anything you say, you will think it is right so I have no comments because you only think of yourself.' I am compromising yet she wants to be right. I have thought of a plan rationally but she holds her ground. I am helpless. Does it give her a permanent high to see me being submissive? I want to stand up to my parents yet they make things difficult.<br><br>I feel that my parents curb my potential. I have always thought about a compromising plan so we both could be happy, if not, least unhappy. However, everytime I try to be tactful, my plea gets thrown out even without the slightest concern.<br><br>I feel suicidal because I cannot continue being oppressed by my mother. My girlfriend has so many things to see to, she neglected me. Trust me, if I told her how I feel, I would get a 'What is it again now' type of look and she would tell me she is too busy.<br><br>I feel that whatever I do cannot be achieved because my potential is stunted by these 2 women of my life. I am truely troubled. Even if I break up with my girlfriend, my mother will always be my mother. <strong>Suicide has been my last option yet I have exhausted other options</strong> My mother will dismiss everything as a family affair if I seek professional help. I am helpless. I do not want to wash the dirty linen in public too.<br><br>I am mentally tired and I do not wish to continue yet it breaks my heart to end everything. Thinking back, I have nothing.[/b]</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Hmmm....<br><br>If need be, kindly revert to me your following:<br><br>1) Birth Date (birthday)<br>2) Birth Time (time you were born as of birth cert)<br>3) Birth Place (if Singapore, jus tell me Singapore will do.
