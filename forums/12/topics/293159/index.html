            <div class='col-md body'>As of my previous posts, I talked to everyone about my situation but no one wants to realise my position. <strong>I am posting this in all seriousness about my feelings as I am helpless and I wish to seek help here as the first option</strong><br><br>My family fails to listen to me and my girlfriend does not want to listen to my problem as she says she has work problems. My problem of the limitation of freedom is so big that I feel I have lost a mere sense of mutual respect from everyone around me. I am beginning to feel that life continuing on like this has no purpose.<br><br>I have evaluated my thoughts. I talked and discussed matters only to be rebuked by my mother like this 'Anything you say, you will think it is right so I have no comments because you only think of yourself.' I am compromising yet she wants to be right. I have thought of a plan rationally but she holds her ground. I am helpless. Does it give her a permanent high to see me being submissive? I want to stand up to my parents yet they make things difficult.<br><br>I feel that my parents curb my potential. I have always thought about a compromising plan so we both could be happy, if not, least unhappy. However, everytime I try to be tactful, my plea gets thrown out even without the slightest concern.<br><br>I feel suicidal because I cannot continue being oppressed by my mother. My girlfriend has so many things to see to, she neglected me. Trust me, if I told her how I feel, I would get a 'What is it again now' type of look and she would tell me she is too busy.<br><br>I feel that whatever I do cannot be achieved because my potential is stunted by these 2 women of my life. I am truely troubled. Even if I break up with my girlfriend, my mother will always be my mother. <strong>Suicide has been my last option yet I have exhausted other options</strong> My mother will dismiss everything as a family affair if I seek professional help. I am helpless. I do not want to wash the dirty linen in public too.<br><br>I am mentally tired and I do not wish to continue yet it breaks my heart to end everything. Thinking back, I have nothing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why don't u seek professional couseling about your problems. If i am your girlfriend and i have to put up with your problems every now and then, i could also go crazy. Girlfriend is also human. She also expects you to be a good bf who share joy and not excessive problems. ( Assuming that u have been telling her your problems every now and then.. have u ? )<br><br>I remember that you have posted a thread that you have quite a good life and you should be more open-minded with it. You think your life is shiit, there are people whose life is even more shiitter!!! Please don't get self-centre with your own problems. Everyone is facing their problems in this imperfect world.<br>so ok cheer up yah. You are not the only one who suffers.<br><br>Your mum is your mum but she is also doing things for your own good. Maybe her ways of doing things isn't ideal but at least she meant well.<br><br>I'm sure she loves you too. Even though your girlfriend neglects you, she also loves you. Now please learn to love yourself more yeah. By loving yourself and accepting your flaws unconditionally, you are more able to find the inner strength/positive happiness to make the changes internally and externally. Btw I don't mean happily blind yourself to your flaws... love your flaws is to also look at them squarely and do something about it but you don't feel aversion for it. There is a difference.<br><br>You can't do anything about your life now does not mean you can't do anythings in the future. Maybe it is not the rigjt time to try too hard since the situation don't allows. Stay hopeful and wait for the right opportunity to make the changes.<br><br>With Love,<br>isis<br></div>
