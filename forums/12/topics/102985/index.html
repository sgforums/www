            <div class='col-md body'>So its hard for a guy n a gal to be jus truly really frens. ( some cases )<br><br>1)If u wanna catch up with him, meet him out n ask him to get his gf along... i think she will be jealouse. ( unless she is open minded kind )<br><br>2)If u ask him to get his gf approval first b4 meeting u out, his gf will get jealouse too. ( unless she is open minded kind n trust his bf )<br><br>So wat do u think? any way? secret way? thru msn chat, mobile chat?    But tat = making him cheat on his gf. ( if he lies to her when she ask him )<br><br>Afterall, if u wanna meet him up n jus purely wanna catch things up with ur ex, nothing else... go for it. Not asking u to be selfish to not thinking bout his gf feelings. But ur conscience is clear, so why afraid? RITE?<br><br>i've got a gal fren, her boyfren damned possessive don let her talk to guys n etc etc. Despite tat, she still calls me n chat n we meet out once every few months. Cos we are pure frens... Nothing else</div>

Lack of insecurity.. Of cos.. i know its rather hard for a girl not to get jealous.. this is what women best at! Well.. even i do have such feellings.. but on the other hand you think about it.. if you hold him too tight that he cant breathe soon.. he will burst out.. and cannot take it.. possessiveness take place..<br><br>i dunno how will his gf think about it.. but if both of you are jus goin out for dinner.. or soemthing.. its perfectly ok.. there's no need to seek permission from gf.. he's not a kid.. The most.. he let her know.. if she really really mind.. then ask her join along. if you don't mind.. if this really happens... i guess the gf jus wwanna take a good look at what her bf is goin out with..<br><br>Well.. after all you jus wanna go out.. and nothing else..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
