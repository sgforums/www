            <div class='col-md body'>What will you advice when you are caught in my situation below.<br><br>I am at a crossroad. I know my strength and that is business. If I were to follow this path, I will excel truthly but at the expense of my moral obligation to help others since I was a kid.<br><br>Next is my interest. Ironically, my interest happen to be my weakness. I am always poor in my language since school days. If I were to pursue this choice, eventually my career will end up stagnant. But I will hold an honorable job and also fullfilling my helping desire.<br><br>The different between the two beside strength and interest(weakness), also encompasses money differences. As you guys know, money makes the world goes round despite how hard I dislike this fact.<br><br>Also, I will like to bring you to my earlier trend on <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=150748" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=150748</a>(Weasley family). If I opt to follow the 2nd option, I will indeed lose a lot of things that money can be bought. But if girl like "Mrs Weasley" do exist and is there for me, I wouldn't mind. All I am worried is that after following this option, I might end up with nothing even at the expense of starting a family.<br><br>Lastly, do note that I am no longer young. Choice one prove to be a wiser between the two as it carry on my path forward which I felt I am destinate for. Choice two, however will means back trekking but I don't mind this hardship.<br><br>Face with the two which will you choose?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think, if it's possible, u should combine the 2.<br><br>Meaning, u still work and take a career choice with the most prospects, and at the same time still help others.<br><br>Well, if u choose 1 and discard the other, I believe u will be in a dilemma, like now. Right now even the thought is making u in a dilemma. I think when u discard one of them, it's a sacrifice for u. If u can minimize the sacrifice, that is better for u. So combine them.</div>
