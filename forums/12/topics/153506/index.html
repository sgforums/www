            <div class='col-md body'>since you have tried salvaging the relationship n it didnt work, i suggest its time for u to give up.. no point hanging onto when the relationship is on the rocks already.. plus u have lost ur feelings from him.. i understand it has become a habit for both of u to be around together like lao fu qi and its hard to end everything just so abruptly.. so i guess u set aside some time and give urself n him some space (and time) to sort ur thoughts, eg. whether u guyz see a future together, or what went wrong over time that distanced both of u.... well if u two decide to separated one day, u must stay strong and start spending more time with ur friends and family members.. and lastly, of course keep ur options open. you'll never know when you may come across someone u that will sweep u off ur feet again.<br><br>so.. think long term, girl.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> gd luck in whtever decision u make.</div>

Look at a happy old couple... do you think there's spark? do you think they love each other? the key is to find the spark. to make the effort to keep your love alive.<br><br>it is up to the two of you to bring back the sparks, go do things you have never done, travel together, hike, camp, go fly kite, explore the jungle.. find new things to do... take up dance lessons together... these are some things you can do to try bring the sparks back.<br><br>you have to try to get him to put in the effort too. it takes 2 hands to clap...<br><br>that being said, If you are CERTAIN that you no longer love him (don't mistake this with being bored of your current lifestyle, because there's no more sparks), then you'll have to rethink the relationship. If you really have no more feelings with him you'll have to stop wasting his time and make a clean break.<br><br>I know it is hard. I was in your exact position 2-3 yrs ago. I made the decision to break off. I kept telling myself, it is better this way then to wait and wait and on the day of marriage, realise I've made a mistake and leave him at the alter... so I chose to break his heart now rather than later. mind you it was difficult and heart-breaking seeing a person you once loved in so much pain. but I had to do it. if not I know it would have been worse.<br><br>But before you make any rash decision, make sure of your feelings. do not regret your actions, there's no turning back!!!<br></div>

I<br><br>think you two should have a good talk about what do you all want from this relationship. Understand how he think and feel before making a harsh decision. Alot of peole will reach this state of dull and lack of spark when a realtionship goes on more than 3 years. I think relationship really need a lot of hardwork man, working hard together to create sparkles.<br><br>if nobody wanna make effort anymore, its no point~ There no relationship at all, just 2 human walking together feeling bored~ passionate and excitment feelings about each other doesnt last but love will. thats why I can still see some granny and ah gong holding hands still walking together. if theres no love for each other anymore.. if he is not the one for you~ then you gotta let go le. drag for too long also waste time and energy.</div>

Stop having expectations about what a guy should do &amp; what a girl should do.  Why be so calculating in a relationship?  A relationship is about 2 parties, so just look at matters with both parties in mind, Not just Your Your Your &amp; My My My.<br><br>2. If you really feel that there's No point in talking about it &amp; salvaging the relationship, then end it.  We can only advise you what we think is right, but it's ultimately YOUR choice.<br><br>3. Honestly, I would rather spare my bf the problem &amp; let him know what I want rather than he buying the wrong thing.  Please note: guys are NOT telepathic, they can't reach into your dreams &amp; know exactly what you want!  I thought there wasn't anything wrong with him wanting to pay for what YOU want...  It's safer, rather than he trying his darnedest to buy something for you &amp; you sulking because it's Not what you wanted.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sand85:</div><div class="quote_body">hey pple...thanx for ur time n advices...this is reali long... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>We broke n patched a few times, but its mostly becuz i begged him not to go.

Very useless i noe. I tink im the most useless girl ever. I cant seem to let go. Im always the one hanging on. i nv had the courage to reali leave him. I also had this tinking..5yrs liao..so long liao..break very wasted. But den, i dun wan the rest of the yrs to continue like dat.<br><br>i have been thinking thru many a times throughout our relationship.<br><br>Frens have been telling me that he is not good enuf for me frm the day i started out with him. But we still managed to walk this long path together. I can really sae he is my true love. i have nv loved anyone as much as i loved him..but sometimes when u noe the feeling ain't there anymore, its realli hard to continue.<br><br>He doesnt take the initiative to contact me. if doesnt treat me as nice as before. He puts his frens above everything else. He is insensitive and nv bother to find out whats wrong or humour me when im down. He juz leaves me alone to sulk. He always ask me how come i always noe what he is tinking...but he duno what im tinking. Even when comes to buying presents for me, he ask me to choose myself, he pay $! Tell me lorx, who wun sian?No surprises at all. Reason for doing so, he duno what i like. After so long, he can tell me dat. If he reali take notice to wat i say, it wun be hard to find out what i like at all. Our topics oso totally different. Im the more dreamy and emotional type who likes to talk about our relationship while he is the practical type who talks about nth but money..studies..etc.<br><br>Which ger dun wanna feel and be loved?<br><br>I used to tink i cannot live without him and its still the case now, but when its time to let go, you have to right?<br><br>Imagine u have to be the one taking initiatives, planning surprises etc. Im the girl leh, it shld be the guy's job doing all dis kinda stuff. im reali tired. Even if does bother to come humour me..gives me promises, within 3 days, he is back to his same old self.<br><br>I tot to myself, its been 5yrs and we r already like dat...i reali cannot imagine myself leading dis kind of life when we get married. Its scary.<br><br>Yes, i noe 5yrs is a long time. we noe each other inside out already and its reali hard to start afresh with someone else becuz u have to noe n understand the person from scratch once more. But seriously, u wun be staying with him becuz of love. but out of habit. I want the feeling of being in love as well. Ive lost touch of that feeling already. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>We dun hold hands when we go out, we dun behave like couples. The feeling now is dat we are more like very good frens.<br><br>i believe in fate. If we r reali meant to be together, no matter how far or how long, we will still end up together.

Somehow expected you to give this sort of answer...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Refer back to your 1st post... I know your decision probably won't bother you much because you feel that this is the only right thing to do... Just that at this point where you have to look into your bf of 5 years in the eyes and tell him "let's end it...".... This part.. A little tricky even for someone like you...?<br><br>'Courage' is not a question here as you've already know what has to be done for yourself... Courage or no courage, the problem would still have to be mentioned and pop up.... In his eyes, it probably won't make much of a difference if 'courage' is there for you or not....?<br><br>I know you probably don't believe in this but nonetheless... What's his star sign?</div>
