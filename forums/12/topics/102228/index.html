One of them (call him 'A') knows that his brother loves the same girl (call the other one 'B').... 'A' tried to match them up... But only to realise that the girl is actually only interested in himself... He felt very upset over things... After much of our persuadings, he finally started to date the girl... They're HAPPY together, and STILL is together now...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> They wanted us to keep things a secret... We did... But somehow the 'brother' B managed to find out about it all... In the end he just gave them his blessings...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
