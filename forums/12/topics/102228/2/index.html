But then, I found out that the local pple loves to backstab their own kind of pple especially to those innocent ones not once but many times as and when they feel unhappy about something, but for the expats they are much more understanding pple well hey I'm not siding Expats but this is true.  I love to say "Hi's" to pple early in the morning to make them feel good rather than bacstabbing them, well if you do this often you feel good too, always think positive  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>
