            <div class='col-md body'>There's nothing much you can do to stop that guy from doing so. You can't possibly send someone to beat him up, can you? What you can do now is to have a good talk with your girlfriend, and tell her how you feel about this situation, and that "uninvited" intrusion makes you feel nervous and irritated, not to mention insecurity. If she loves you and respects you, I'm sure both of you can work out a solution to deter that guy.<br><br>What I perceive is that that guy must be a sweet talker, and he somehow managed to get your girlfriend's attention even though she claimed to be "irritated". Beware of this person. A good heart to heart talk is definately a must, and this can be a test for the love between you and her.<br><br>If she understands how you feel, by all means she will ignore that man's pursuit, even to the extent of changing mobile number. On your side, you must have the confidence in this relationship even though you are feeling uneasy. Never be shaken. Jealousy sometimes in a relationship is healthy, but don't extend to the point of being childish and immatured.<br><br>Good luck.<br><br></div>

Join your gf in discussing about the problem the guy might have? I think your gf is just generally being helpful... Instead of bothering about how the guys might try to sianZ your gf (which most probably won't help things much), why don't join your gf in helping the guys with their 'problems'..? At least in such a way you can know what is going on between them without being intrusive and also participate in whatever your gf hopes to remedy?<br><br>HOWEVER, if your gf finds your action intrusive or a hindrance to her freedom, perhaps you would like to let her handle the situation herself? In this case, it could be that your gf's a flirt BUT also can be that she is someone who wants FREEDOM or you to have TRUST in her behavior.... THIS is up to YOU to judge....</div>
