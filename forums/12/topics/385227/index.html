              <p>You deserve it for treating her like an object which you can dump so easily. And this comes from a man, not a woman who you may think side with other women.</p>

              <p>Hi shattered09,</p>
              <p>I will not say that you are right or wrong, but it was your own choice to end your relationship with her back then. It is too late to look back now, I will suggest that you try to shift your focus to other things in your life, such as your favourite hobbies and activities, and also your studies/work. If you do not attempt to move on now, and keep trying to think about the past instead, the pain will only keep increasing.</p>
              <p>You should also try talking to a friend who will listen to you, it will make you feel better. However, please do not attempt to get another girl as your girlfriend just for the sake of numbing your pain - Having another half whom you truly love will help in healing your wound, but having another half just for the sake of filling the emptiness in you will not.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p><br>What makes you think you deserves to be comforted or consoled?</p>
              <p>Did you even think about her pain when you left her?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Go kill yourself if you cannot bear if the pain, or live through your pain like a man and remember this pain and have fear of this pain so that you will live to become a better man in your future.</p>

              <p>If u really say u loved her as much as u did u would leave her alone or be her guardian angel standby her when she needs it.</p>
