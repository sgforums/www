            <div class='col-md body'>I think if you really love your current gf, you wouldn't be asking yourself this question.<br><br>The fact that you are in doubt about whether you are in love with her or not, shows that maybe your feelings for her have faded or maybe it is no longer there anymore.<br><br>You are enthralled with "her" because "she" is not your official gf yet, so you see her as a mystery, and we as human being, tend to want something that is not ours yet. But once "she" is already yours, you might start to take her for granted, just as what happened between you and your current gf.<br><br>I think that you are afraid of letting your gf go not because you love her, but more like you are afraid of the consequences. You mentioned it yourself that you hate the pain that might occur because of the break up, and maybe you are also afraid of the loneliness that might follow. You are afraid because "she" might just suddenly leave you for another guy since "she" is not your official girl yet, and at that time, if you leave your gf, you will have no one to fall on.<br><br>So all in all, your reason for keeping this r/s is not borne out of love, but rather from a selfish intention. If you still have any heart left, set your gf free and save her from future torment just because of your fear of being left alone.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>okay, after reading the 2 pages of post whereby ppl are here posting just wanna give u a tight slap on your face, i beg to differ...<br><br>well, we cannot take sides...but just by having a balanced point of view for you here...Mr Confused..<br><br>Firstly, ignore those useless slapping post that you have read previously...they didnt have the similar experience so they wouldn't know how it feels...a bit miserable as a matter of fact...<br><br>judging from your case,<br><br>1 - you have a gf that you are attracted (not physically); well i do agree, not all relationships evolves from physical attraction. Sometimes it could be a cute thing that she did, or perphas caring, needs protection that one you see that gal, you wanna protect her... that's what i think of you as in your shoes<br><br>2 - the 'gal' that you like - you feel good with her..able to communicate better (if comparing between her and your gf back then)<br><br>although i agree to some post in page one which are quite sensible, you may wanna take into consideration that you have to be faithful.<br><br>the reason whereby the 'gal' don't accept you is because she isn't ready...for she feels good being with you, but not at that time to be ready to be ur stead..maybe she feels that she ignore you for that day when u sms her saying you had just broke off with her..this isn't something good to share with...but nonetheless, some days after that sms, she still willing to chat and go out with you...means that she is fine with being with you (maybe be a fren for that time only)<br><br>should you wanna take things a step further, take things slowly...do it at the right time...when its rather romantic time together..then say it, dun pop the question when the feeling aren't right..<br><br>------------<br><br>After so much of reading...here is my advice for you...choose the gal which u can communicate...should you wanna get your gf to be ur future wife to be...if you have noticed in the newspapers....lots of divorce often happens when there is a communication break-down...and a lack of trust....if the 'gal' have this 2, i suggest you go for that gal...its better to cut things short and simple...don't drag this too long...its not good for the three of you at all...short term pain for the break is better compared to when your relationship is at least a yr or 2 den break...that feeling is much worse...<br><br>After so much...i hope you can find the answer to your question that you have posted here...<br><br>choose wisely..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by speedemon:</div><div class="quote_body">I'm with my gf (I knew from camp) for 5 months plus(at the point of time), and one very fine day we to the IDP open house and I happened to bump onto "her", She was my campmate and of course my gf know her too. So that night I called her to ask her why she was there, what course she's going to take when she is going to Australia etc.. Basically to sum it up is to know howÂ’s she doing. So we find each other able to communicate well and so quite often I'll call her to chit chat without my gf knowing and in no time my feelings for her grew. One fine day when we're about to end the conversation. I was telling her that me as a friend can only know her at the most 70% the rest is only accessible by the boyfriend, So she said:" Do you want the access??" Well I said Â“I already have a girl friend already so I cannot have the access.Â” Perhaps this conversation was the catalyst that made us grew closer. But anyway I called her to ask her if she has any other meaning behind the above said conversation. She said no. Perhaps she's shy or what I donÂ’t know... Anyway so occasionally we still do chat on the phone. And what happened after this I canÂ’t really remember. All I remember was that I didnÂ’t treat my gf well and I care for the other party more.<br><br>And so on the day of my birthday, I called "her" in the morning to ask her if she is free to go out with me later in the day (Cos my gf working), "She" accepted the date. I was so happy that IÂ’m finally able to date "her" out. Then later in the day my gf called to tell me that she's free to celebrate my birthday with me. I stumbled and think , my once in a blue moon chance of dating "her" out spoilt by my gf. No way IÂ’m going to let that happened. So I cook up some excuse to ask her to rest at home (cos she sick take MC). So that night I had a very happy time with "her". She got me a very small cake (previous night I got stuffed with cake) and I was very touched by her little action. I dun believe that sheÂ’ll make the effort on her normal friends. Then on Saturday I told my gf I wanted a breakup because I kept looking for "her" no point in us continuing on. My gf was devasted , a guy that she loved a lot did this to her, willing to spend his birthday with another gal instead of own gf. Seeing her so sad, my heart very soft :-( Then the next day I was very sad and unhappy that she breakup with me. In the morning, I messaged "her" that I just broke up with my gf, as usual "she" did not reply me. So I spend the day feeling very sad. When I was home at night, I couldn't stand the time without my gf around. So I called my gf to tell her that I wanted to take back all that IÂ’ve said. And promised her that I would forget Â“herÂ” and not look for Â“herÂ” again. She did allow me to be her boyfriend once again, but she wanted me to re-chase her. I said thatÂ’s its not possible for such things to happen because weÂ’ll never go back to the honeymoon period. The 1st week of patching up was terrible. We quarrel the re-chase, she mention something about my attitude, maturity and etc. But the following week was a lot easier, thatÂ’s when I finally made her drop the idea of the re-chase. Then she went out of country for holiday, I pondered if I should go look for Â“herÂ” again as her birthday was approaching. Finally I decided to ask Â“herÂ” out on Â“herÂ” birthday, Â“sheÂ” then di di da ly for a few days before confirming with me.<br><br>I was hoping that Friday came faster and faster so that I can see Â“herÂ”, so I brought Â“herÂ” present and decided on where to go and stuff. Just then I wondered, if the girl that IÂ’m celebrating for is my own gf, would I have done so much for her? I knew wouldnÂ’t. So Friday came and brought Â“herÂ” out for birthday and after which Â“sheÂ” was very happy and contented with what IÂ’ve come up for Â“herÂ”. During our chat at the seaside Â“sheÂ” did once mention that Â“sheÂ” did not reply my messages because Â“sheÂ” wanted me to concentrate on my gf. At the same time Â“sheÂ” said "she" wasnÂ’t ready for a relationship, I was thinking that "her" ex must have hurt her deeply for Â“herÂ” to feel this way. The next day I was thinking of Â“herÂ” to whole day, if only our Christmas eve could be spend together. In the end, my gf came back and we celebrate the eve together. I did treat her nicely she was happy with me that night and on the Christmas card she wrote some very heart melting things that I feel that I should just forget about Â“herÂ”. Then i thought; do I love my gf or its just LIKE thats why i'm with my gf?<br><br>I feel that somehow I need to make a choice for myself, I admit that IÂ’m very afraid of breaking up with my current gf even though I found someone that suits me. I hate the pain thatÂ’s involved but guess it all part and parcel of a relationship. What goes up must come down. Or perhaps my gf is the one except that IÂ’m blinded other factors. IÂ’m not physically attracted to her, so I presumed that IÂ’m not having crushes.<br><br>I love/like my gf for she is an caring person and someone that dote on me alot. But she lack the matureirty and we have different thinking. My gf is quite possisvie in the sense that she's like me to be with her often. But she's losen up a little these days.

To begin with, you had already two-timed her, whether you like it or not. You went out with another girl behind her back and lied to her. As you can see, the relationship between the two of you is already very badly strained.<br><br>No way on earth can you have a proper relationship with the other girl, either. She's forever going to live under the spectre of being a third party in your relationship with your gf. Your relationship with her is already strained now... it'll get a whole lot worse if you do get attached with her.<br><br>My advice? Drop them both. No way on earth you're going to have a proper relationship with either of them. Better inflict a bit of pain now to spare all three of you the misery later on.<br><br>Truth be told, I would like to give you a tight slap to the face for making the rest of us guys look bad. At the same time, though, I'd like to express my hope that this debacle has hopefully made you a wiser person. When you play around with the feelings of others, it's going to come back and hurt you as well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by speedemon:</div><div class="quote_body">I'm with my gf (I knew from camp) for 5 months plus(at the point of time), and one very fine day we to the IDP open house and I happened to bump onto "her", She was my campmate and of course my gf know her too. So that night I called her to ask her why she was there, what course she's going to take when she is going to Australia etc.. Basically to sum it up is to know howÂ’s she doing. So we find each other able to communicate well and so quite often I'll call her to chit chat without my gf knowing and in no time my feelings for her grew. One fine day when we're about to end the conversation. I was telling her that me as a friend can only know her at the most 70% the rest is only accessible by the boyfriend, So she said:" Do you want the access??" Well I said Â“I already have a girl friend already so I cannot have the access.Â” Perhaps this conversation was the catalyst that made us grew closer. But anyway I called her to ask her if she has any other meaning behind the above said conversation. She said no. Perhaps she's shy or what I donÂ’t know... Anyway so occasionally we still do chat on the phone. And what happened after this I canÂ’t really remember. All I remember was that I didnÂ’t treat my gf well and I care for the other party more.<br><br>And so on the day of my birthday, I called "her" in the morning to ask her if she is free to go out with me later in the day (Cos my gf working), "She" accepted the date. I was so happy that IÂ’m finally able to date "her" out. Then later in the day my gf called to tell me that she's free to celebrate my birthday with me. I stumbled and think , my once in a blue moon chance of dating "her" out spoilt by my gf. No way IÂ’m going to let that happened. So I cook up some excuse to ask her to rest at home (cos she sick take MC). So that night I had a very happy time with "her". She got me a very small cake (previous night I got stuffed with cake) and I was very touched by her little action. I dun believe that sheÂ’ll make the effort on her normal friends. Then on Saturday I told my gf I wanted a breakup because I kept looking for "her" no point in us continuing on. My gf was devasted , a guy that she loved a lot did this to her, willing to spend his birthday with another gal instead of own gf. Seeing her so sad, my heart very soft :-( Then the next day I was very sad and unhappy that she breakup with me. In the morning, I messaged "her" that I just broke up with my gf, as usual "she" did not reply me. So I spend the day feeling very sad. When I was home at night, I couldn't stand the time without my gf around. So I called my gf to tell her that I wanted to take back all that IÂ’ve said. And promised her that I would forget Â“herÂ” and not look for Â“herÂ” again. She did allow me to be her boyfriend once again, but she wanted me to re-chase her. I said thatÂ’s its not possible for such things to happen because weÂ’ll never go back to the honeymoon period. The 1st week of patching up was terrible. We quarrel the re-chase, she mention something about my attitude, maturity and etc. But the following week was a lot easier, thatÂ’s when I finally made her drop the idea of the re-chase. Then she went out of country for holiday, I pondered if I should go look for Â“herÂ” again as her birthday was approaching. Finally I decided to ask Â“herÂ” out on Â“herÂ” birthday, Â“sheÂ” then di di da ly for a few days before confirming with me.<br><br>I was hoping that Friday came faster and faster so that I can see Â“herÂ”, so I brought Â“herÂ” present and decided on where to go and stuff. Just then I wondered, if the girl that IÂ’m celebrating for is my own gf, would I have done so much for her? I knew wouldnÂ’t. So Friday came and brought Â“herÂ” out for birthday and after which Â“sheÂ” was very happy and contented with what IÂ’ve come up for Â“herÂ”. During our chat at the seaside Â“sheÂ” did once mention that Â“sheÂ” did not reply my messages because Â“sheÂ” wanted me to concentrate on my gf. At the same time Â“sheÂ” said "she" wasnÂ’t ready for a relationship, I was thinking that "her" ex must have hurt her deeply for Â“herÂ” to feel this way. The next day I was thinking of Â“herÂ” to whole day, if only our Christmas eve could be spend together. In the end, my gf came back and we celebrate the eve together. I did treat her nicely she was happy with me that night and on the Christmas card she wrote some very heart melting things that I feel that I should just forget about Â“herÂ”. Then i thought; do I love my gf or its just LIKE thats why i'm with my gf?<br><br>I feel that somehow I need to make a choice for myself, I admit that IÂ’m very afraid of breaking up with my current gf even though I found someone that suits me. I hate the pain thatÂ’s involved but guess it all part and parcel of a relationship. What goes up must come down. Or perhaps my gf is the one except that IÂ’m blinded other factors. IÂ’m not physically attracted to her, so I presumed that IÂ’m not having crushes.<br><br>I love/like my gf for she is an caring person and someone that dote on me alot. But she lack the matureirty and we have different thinking. My gf is quite possisvie in the sense that she's like me to be with her often. But she's losen up a little these days.
