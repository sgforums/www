            <div class='col-md body'>I'm with my gf (I knew from camp) for 5 months plus(at the point of time), and one very fine day we to the IDP open house and I happened to bump onto "her", She was my campmate and of course my gf know her too. So that night I called her to ask her why she was there, what course she's going to take when she is going to Australia etc.. Basically to sum it up is to know howÂ’s she doing. So we find each other able to communicate well and so quite often I'll call her to chit chat without my gf knowing and in no time my feelings for her grew. One fine day when we're about to end the conversation. I was telling her that me as a friend can only know her at the most 70% the rest is only accessible by the boyfriend, So she said:" Do you want the access??" Well I said Â“I already have a girl friend already so I cannot have the access.Â” Perhaps this conversation was the catalyst that made us grew closer. But anyway I called her to ask her if she has any other meaning behind the above said conversation. She said no. Perhaps she's shy or what I donÂ’t know... Anyway so occasionally we still do chat on the phone. And what happened after this I canÂ’t really remember. All I remember was that I didnÂ’t treat my gf well and I care for the other party more.<br><br>And so on the day of my birthday, I called "her" in the morning to ask her if she is free to go out with me later in the day (Cos my gf working), "She" accepted the date. I was so happy that IÂ’m finally able to date "her" out. Then later in the day my gf called to tell me that she's free to celebrate my birthday with me. I stumbled and think , my once in a blue moon chance of dating "her" out spoilt by my gf. No way IÂ’m going to let that happened. So I cook up some excuse to ask her to rest at home (cos she sick take MC). So that night I had a very happy time with "her". She got me a very small cake (previous night I got stuffed with cake) and I was very touched by her little action. I dun believe that sheÂ’ll make the effort on her normal friends. Then on Saturday I told my gf I wanted a breakup because I kept looking for "her" no point in us continuing on. My gf was devasted , a guy that she loved a lot did this to her, willing to spend his birthday with another gal instead of own gf. Seeing her so sad, my heart very soft :-( Then the next day I was very sad and unhappy that she breakup with me. In the morning, I messaged "her" that I just broke up with my gf, as usual "she" did not reply me. So I spend the day feeling very sad. When I was home at night, I couldn't stand the time without my gf around. So I called my gf to tell her that I wanted to take back all that IÂ’ve said. And promised her that I would forget Â“herÂ” and not look for Â“herÂ” again. She did allow me to be her boyfriend once again, but she wanted me to re-chase her. I said thatÂ’s its not possible for such things to happen because weÂ’ll never go back to the honeymoon period. The 1st week of patching up was terrible. We quarrel the re-chase, she mention something about my attitude, maturity and etc. But the following week was a lot easier, thatÂ’s when I finally made her drop the idea of the re-chase. Then she went out of country for holiday, I pondered if I should go look for Â“herÂ” again as her birthday was approaching. Finally I decided to ask Â“herÂ” out on Â“herÂ” birthday, Â“sheÂ” then di di da ly for a few days before confirming with me.<br><br>I was hoping that Friday came faster and faster so that I can see Â“herÂ”, so I brought Â“herÂ” present and decided on where to go and stuff. Just then I wondered, if the girl that IÂ’m celebrating for is my own gf, would I have done so much for her? I knew wouldnÂ’t. So Friday came and brought Â“herÂ” out for birthday and after which Â“sheÂ” was very happy and contented with what IÂ’ve come up for Â“herÂ”. During our chat at the seaside Â“sheÂ” did once mention that Â“sheÂ” did not reply my messages because Â“sheÂ” wanted me to concentrate on my gf. At the same time Â“sheÂ” said "she" wasnÂ’t ready for a relationship, I was thinking that "her" ex must have hurt her deeply for Â“herÂ” to feel this way. The next day I was thinking of Â“herÂ” to whole day, if only our Christmas eve could be spend together. In the end, my gf came back and we celebrate the eve together. I did treat her nicely she was happy with me that night and on the Christmas card she wrote some very heart melting things that I feel that I should just forget about Â“herÂ”. Then i thought; do I love my gf or its just LIKE thats why i'm with my gf?<br><br>I feel that somehow I need to make a choice for myself, I admit that IÂ’m very afraid of breaking up with my current gf even though I found someone that suits me. I hate the pain thatÂ’s involved but guess it all part and parcel of a relationship. What goes up must come down. Or perhaps my gf is the one except that IÂ’m blinded other factors. IÂ’m not physically attracted to her, so I presumed that IÂ’m not having crushes.<br><br>I love/like my gf for she is an caring person and someone that dote on me alot. But she lack the matureirty and we have different thinking. My gf is quite possisvie in the sense that she's like me to be with her often. But she's losen up a little these days. [/code]</div>

[/code]</div></blockquote>You are the type of guys whom lots of people hate. Sorry to say this I feel like giving you a big slap on the face. You got a nice gf and you still try to find someone behind her back.<br><br>I really wonder why the hell your gf ever love you so much for what. She put in so much effort to love you and the very person whom she trusted is the very person whom betray her.<br><br>She had never done anything wrong to you and your actions really make me puke at you. YOu are the kind that makes girls hate us guys.<br><br>How can you even dare to say that you love your gf when you are seeing someone else and even try to say that she is not mature enough, while you are the very person who is playing with 2 girls now.<br><br>Your gf  has given you a chance, used it well if not you will lose 2 girls. You want to know why the other girl did not answer your sms? Is becos she dare not belive that you can be a good bf. How can you be a good bf when you are going out with another girl?<br><br>You are lucky to have a forgiving gf but be warn play this 2 timing game again she will leave you for sure.</div>

IÂ’m not physically attracted to her, so I presumed that IÂ’m not having crushes.<br><br>I love/like my gf for she is an caring person and someone that dote on me alot. But she lack the matureirty and we have different thinking. My gf is quite possisvie in the sense that she's like me to be with her often. But she's losen up a little these days. [/code]</div></blockquote>Who told you that crush has to be physical attraction?<br><br>Understand that no one's perfect... The decision is yours...<br><br>Then of course.. Often than not...

            <div class='col-md body'>So let's meet up some day to beat him up <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by speedemon:</div><div class="quote_body">When I was home at night, I couldn't stand the time without my gf around. So I called my gf to tell her that I wanted to take back all that IÂ’ve said.<br><br>Then she went out of country for holiday, I pondered if I should go look for Â“herÂ” again as her birthday was approaching.<br></div></blockquote>Just a question: How old are you? Personally, what I see from you is that you cannot stand being alone. You want to have the feeling of "loving someone" and "being loved". How do you know that "she" is the one? Because you <span style="font-style: italic;">feel</span> it? Then what made you choose your gf the first place? Then what happens if you <span style="font-style: italic;">feel</span> it on another person after you are with "her"?<br><br>Although I don't agree to the way you handle things, but I have to say this:<br>A relationship is not just about responsibilities, it's also about the way you feel towards each other.<br>You're responsible to your gf but the feeling is a bit messed up <span style="font-style: italic;">(people will say that you are very sad)</span><br>You feel something towards "her" but not responsible for anything yet <span style="font-style: italic;">people will just say that you're trying to be a flirt/playboy/harbour)</span><br><br>Whatever you choose, it's <strong>your</strong> responsibility. And please... BE A MAN! Not good to keep dragging things.</div>
