(At 11 october 2002 in Aunt Agony).<br><br>Ok. here's your case study - five years worth of relationship. (Never break/patch before? Cause if got break, technically, its less than 5 years), will definitely somehow retain this relationship, not always due to the effect of love, rather the pain of losing a relationship of 5 years. This does not equate to love, rather, Its the natural human nature of 'so long already, can't bear to.'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><blockquote>'we have been together for more than 5 years... by right, it shld have been quite stable' -</blockquote> By left? Logically speaking, it could be, but in reality, such model ain't applicable to love context.<br><br>The thing about the breach of trust is that once it happened, its stays, regardless of length of time. When your bf is out with another girl, your immediate automatic thoughts would be 'cheating on me.' Although its unhealthy for the relationship to spring such way of thinking, I understand its difficult not to, considering the hurt you went through. However, trust is all or nothing. Either you give, or your don't. Under the theory of a Breach of Trust - anything more than the first chance is redundant.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Advice?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You have a right to know what's going, base on the account of being his gf. (Maybe not the past, but definitely issues relating to the present, threatening the existence of this relationship).<br><br>Don't trash things out badly and kept supporting your points with the incident that happened in the past. Seriously, this is the last thing you should do. Cause if you do, you are telling him that you never bury that hatchet since that day, which indirect question yourself on the reason 'then, why did you still continue the relationship?'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I say speak to him about this issue - at a good tone. Don't Interrogate him and make a hasty conclusion. Allowing him to explain himself and watch carefully, regarding his body language and his content. He will probably defend himself and dismiss it as you being too overly suspicious. Accept what he claims to say and mark it down into your memory. Leave a gentle reminder that the existence of this relationship lies within his behaviour and his 'way of hanging around with girls.'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>'It's not always neccessary for the need of concrete prove to end this relationship.'<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> He said he will change (previous time), give him the benefit of the doubt. But once its obvious that he is cheating on you the second time, think no further - no more chance.<br><br><blockquote>i have been faithful for these years...rejected advances from other guys...but yet these are what i get back...</blockquote>   You did your duty as a gf, do not condemn yourself for being tootpid or similiar. Being a faithful good gf will benefit you long term, throughout your life, rather than one that is not. There are people who will treasure this aspect of you - don't think that is foolish. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
