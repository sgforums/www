If that is so, can I conclude again that ur relationship with him has not reach the stable level? If the answers to the above qns are NO, then it may mean he n the ger r really juz frens.

Decide what your actions are after knowing the truth abt your bf and this gal. I think best if let your friend confront the gal directly.<br><br>Else, if you can't tahan him going astray a second time, I guess its time to let go. Somtimes it is not worth it, even to find out the truth. If he had changed after learning his first mistake, such situation should not have occured.
