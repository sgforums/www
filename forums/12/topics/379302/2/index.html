              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">onto the serious end, i think that the moment you replied the girl saying "why leh?" you already made yourself sound "slightly" like a stalker, what you should have said is "i click on every1's post, if you dont like it, its not my problem" xD</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">abt vincent and itchyArmpit situation. i feel that the girls you guys mention actually have a feeling of annoyance/weirdness that a person who they had dont meet very often keeps on sms'ing/chats with her.</p>
              <p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding: 0px;">my opinion is that young girls or guys, no matter which sex, tend to think too much about small matters, making it seem worst than it actually is, for example vincent's situation of the girl who thinks that vincent is stalking her, but actually your just treating her like any other friend of yours.</p>

              <p>You click on the "Like" button on every of your friend's post, but what she sees from her profile is that "Dammit, this guy likes every single post of mine, is he trying to stalk me?".</p>

              <p>as a girl myself, i would safely say that what you did to your friends in FB by "LIKING" whatever they posted, is annoying. your close friends might not mention anything to you.</p>

              <p>Because it shows insincererity and annoyance.</p>
              <p>It's as if you aren't sincere with "liking" their posts, afterall, you're "liking" everyone's posts, you don't truely "like" a post.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, i don't really see that as a stalk, but as mentioned before by another forumer, charlize, it may be a case when it was "i broke up with him" and you happen to "like" it unknowingly, you can't expect her not flare up. I mean, do you?</p>
              <p>On the other hand, you may not have known her very well, if you were doing that to your very and very good friends, i don't really think they would mind. You said you met her on this sim sports activity and added her, so as we can all see, both of you isn't so close to each other.</p>
              <p>I think TS, yourself, has to mature a bit and spare thoughts for others before doing stuffs even though it may be out of jokes, or even, "just for fun".</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just get her cell no and SMS her an apology, i'm sure she will forgive you. It's just a small misunderstanding.</p>

Go back to your friendster where you can just submit testimonials like "Hi! u beri chio. can intro?" And get rejected discreetly. It'll save you some dignity.</p>
