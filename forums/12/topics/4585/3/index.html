Sometime God really let us to go in a deep trouble for these 3 reason :<br>1. So you can lean on Him, if you never have problem, you will lean on yourself, won't you ?<br>2. So you can appreciate Him when He help you out from your problem. Then you will give thanks more, and you won't say : "I overcome this because of my strength, ability, skill, etc."<br>3. To improve your characters : be more patient, be more graceful, more endurable, independent, etc.<br><br>Giving thanks is not depend on situation or problem. Giving thanks is an ACT. Even you are in a deep problem, you can still decide if you want to Give thanks or grumble.<br><br>When you are in deep problem, then you scream, frustate, cry ... well, all people do that...<br>But, if you give thanks instead of grumbling... you are different than most of people ...<br><br>You can still give thanks even though your heart is sad (giving thanks won't simply make you happy), but it will help you to face your problem (by giving your *more* faith). And, sure ... God will be more gracious for people who knows to give thank even when in bad situation, He will not wait to help you out ...<br><br>God bless you folks ...<br><br>PS: I won't try to make any people here to have christian religion, everybody have their own *religion*.

Most people are *more likely* has 10-50% kiasu-ness (hope not 100% kiasu), and they try to be somebody, or at least be *better person* as the time goes on.</strong><br>Personally... I think to be a 'somebody' won't really be necessary... Afterall, everybody dies one day... But at least being a 'better person'.... Depending on how you define it that is...? Might still be something worth working on.... Provided that you know where you're going of course...? And provided that your 'ultimate direction' is right...?<br>Hmm.... I sense an 'interesting discussion' going on... And if all you want is to talk to someone, I would by all means oblige to it...<span style="font-style: italic;"> ~smile~</span> But if you're just trying to 'lead me somewhere' through 'small talks' I think you still have much to learn...?<br><br><strong><br>One thing about "Devil born on 1976 on cursed star", why ? Why it was cursed star ?Why "devil" rather than "angel" (sorry, with all respect, I am not try to make *problem* with nickname, just curious) ...<br>I mean, people (bad or good) don't like to have "devil-thing" related to their live. Not arguable, many people keep trying to hide their weakness.</strong><br>Because just like the many others out there who wished they've lived a longer life... A better life...? Asking why can't they choose....? This 'Devil' also asked this question.... Why can't he choose? Not to be born...? For as soon as his 'childhood happy dreams' were over.... He started to question... Why is he born into this life... To endure... The PAIN and the 'SUFFERING'.... So as to experience...? To grow STRONGER..? So that he can help the others who have once 'hurt him'...? Why this ordinary him? Why not someone else....? That is because he never realised.... He was the 'chosen Devil'.... To be born under that 'Cursed Star'.... But now he's slowly learning.... Learning to understand why HE is the CHOSEN ONE....?<br>'Devils' are also a form of 'Angels'.... They're just 'fallen angels'.... And is GOD is really mercy and forgiveness.... GOD would still love 'Devils' equally as to his 'angels'.... <span style="font-style: italic;">"Angels can stray, Devils can flock... In the mist of clouded darkness, who would have thought that which land is dark? And which side is NOT?"</span><br>If it is just about 'hiding from the dark side of you'.... It definitely won't make you much LESS of an Evil person...? And it's usually not what you see that is dangerous... It's what you 'don't see' which can STRIKE YOU... REAL HARD..... Rather than not giving recognition to yourself.... Why don't you just try to understand it because you decide to 'condemn it'...?<br><br><strong><br>Experience of live construct one's character...</strong><br>But it is ALSO how you CHOOSE to REACT which decides what that EXPERIENCE gonna MEAN to you....? You can't just blame everything or LEAVEs EVERYTHING to NATURE....? And IF you really MUST... Then CONSIDER THIS... You're inevitably ALSO part of NATURE....?<br><br><strong><br>May I know, what is inside you / what do you think about yourself (a real devil perhaps)? (pls don't answer my question, if you feel get offended, simply forget it)....<br><br>c u ...</strong><br>Inside me is just a HUMAN... A VERY ORDINARY human... CHOSEN for an EXTRAORDINARY LIFE... For reason(s) I believe I have not fully comprehense...? I've got a CHOICE... To go on with my 'destiny' and BE A DEVIL..... The other CHOICE I believe is DIE.... Not that I would choose to die... But LAUGH if you must, I believe I've already EXHAUSTED my life-span... And if not for the sake that I'm a 'Devil'.... I won't even be down here typing to you... I also choose to go on because... I'm interested to know what it's like to be a Devil...? (A REAL COMPLETED ONE?) There're just so many things I FEEL... I NEED to set RIGHT.... And being a 'Devil' perhaps provides an answer to MANY of my QUESTIONs.....<br><br></blockquote>------------------<br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....
