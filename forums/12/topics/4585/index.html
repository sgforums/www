Just let it out and lists all that you think life is unfair.<br><br>It's no use for me trying to convince that life's OK, or "Oh everything is fine and dandy".  No, you have to convince yourself that whatever happens its up to you, to make Lemonade when you have a Lemon.<br><br>To believe in yourself and remember that Life is not always unfair.  Just that when we are enjoying life at it's fullest we never think that "Hey! Life is good to me."<br><br>Used to be that when I missed my lift, then my MRT train and then my bus to work and drinking down HOT coffee was unlucky for 2 days in a row but its in how I handle it.  "Groan that I'm so suai!" or instead appreciate the pretty girl who takes takes the later train/bus, enjoying the scenery, etc etc. That's a person's choice and its applicable in many things.

It's like whenever we are sure and happy that we've moved on in our life, we find that we are being "slammed" back into square one. It is very frustrating and almost always forced me to feel like giving up and wallowing in self-pity. But always bear in mind, you owe yourself, if not for your families or your friends a life. No one can make you happier if you refuse to let yourself feel that way. No one and nothing controls you. YOU are in sole control of your OWN life. Nothing can bring you down, if you refused to.<br><br>Easier said than done, that I know because I am still trying to fight against the Â“devilsÂ”. But who is to determine if you will be able to succeed in overcoming the barrier Â– yourself, if you donÂ’t give it a try? You will forever remain in square one if you donÂ’t try to move on from the unhappy episode, right.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>*** <span style="font-style: italic;">Nothing Lasts Forever</span> ***</div>
