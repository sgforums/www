Stop dwelling on the question on "Why life is so unfair",rather,you should start thinking how to make your life better!<br><br>Everyone only lives once. Nobody noes whats gona happen the nxt minute,so y not treasure every minute of our prcious life and make full use of it?<br><br>Your life is in your hand. Its you who is going to determine how ur life is going to be. No matter how much pple tell you abt hw to go abt planning for your life, the final decision still lies in ur hands. Yes, u may said dat u need support frm pple,frm frens,but think abt it again,r u living for them or r u living for urself??<br><br>Dun be so frustrated,it wont do any help. Forget abt the unfairness that has happen either to you or to others around you. As long as you dun add pain to others,its good enuff.

I realize that every sorrows that I put into the black box, it fall down through the hole.<br><br>Then I asked God, "Where are all the sorrows I have in the black box ?"<br><br>He replied : "They are with me..."<br><br>I asked God again : "Why you give me two boxes, one which is white and the other which is black ?"<br><br>He replied : "My son, the white box I gave so you may count and remember every grace and mercy I have given to you.
