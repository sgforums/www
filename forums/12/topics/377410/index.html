              <p><br>Sounds like you have really bad encounters with old people.   Some are irritating the younger generations, this I don't deny.   Good eg is some old folks taking advantage that they are old so they have the right to jump queue.     When this happen, I will not hesitate to get them to queue up.    Unless they are so sickly and cannot stand for long then I don't mind them jump queue.</p>
              <p>On the whole, most old people are doing fine.</p>
