              <p>Fantagf, get out of Aunt Agony Forums.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I don't mind if you want to copy my attitude/style in postings because you're my fan. But you need an opinion strong enough to convince others that you're not a trouble-maker.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, you're still of no value to this forum or to anyone else.</p>
              <p>Do you really want to be useless like this all your life?</p>

              <p>You are agitated, so you trying to divert attention that you are agitated.</p>
              <p>Don't need to take it out on me when you don't have the attractiveness, good character, EQ, kindness, to attract men.  You can go ask who wants to marry you here to gauge how much the guys here like you.</p>
              <p>I don't need to subject myself to your approval, nobody subject themselves to your approval to live their life.    Stupidity, bad character is all you have, you have nothing to offer men to allow them to decide to buy you 30k diamond ring.</p>
              <p>ha ha haha ha!    chao charbor!    You are overrating yourself when you are just an empty vessel making the most noise here in sgforums.</p>

              <p>Hmm~</p>
              <p>I kinda reminicise when i saw the title.</p>
              <p>I liked this gal since preU1.. told her i like her a few times, its already at the fifth year.. THis year i when i saw her, i told her i still like her.. But i guess it is time to move on.</p>
              <p>True love can wait, however, moves and hints that a guy still likes the girl should be constantly given to them to chase away any insecurities she might have..</p>
              <p>it takes two hands to clap. If either one of them do not play their part, the balance becomes unbalanced, and the relationship would probably experience cracks and scars.</p>
              <p>Huzane.. That guy probably is indecisive about his choice. Perhaps you two were very close and hence he won't know how much he can or can't live without you. I would suggest you two take a break from one another and socialise around a bit more.</p>
              <p>Distance will only keep on increasing the emotional load. If he really likes you, and you really prefer him. The destined time will approach. If not. As harsh it could be, move on.</p>
              <p>Whichever path or decision you choose, i respect it and wish you all the best!</p>
