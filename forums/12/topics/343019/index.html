              <p>I am not sure about the titled above. Just through my observations, i think guys tend to think that if a girl loves/likes him, she will wait for him until he is ready to make a move.</p>
              <p>And girls on the other hand, would not wait and just be,"if you are not making a move, I shall move on.". Do you think this statement is true or is it just me? Coz I dont like to wait for guys who is afraid to make a move, no matter how much I like them.</p>

              <p><br>that's what I am implying. If i wait for him, then I am his true love. If not, then I am NOT his true love. My main point is(assuming that you are a guy), do you expect the girl to wait for you if she is your true love.</p>
              <p>Lets say if the guy doesnt make his move with any lady at all. And the lady moves on, then there wont any true love for the guy at all.</p>
              <p>I understand that true love must be nurtured. But some idiots out there still believe if they wait long enough w/o doing anything, their true love will just come knocking on their door.</p>

              <p>The idiots need to know that they need to DO something.. anything..</p>
              <p>Maybe they just believe that whoever comes a'knokin on the door is the true love lo.</p>
              <p>Which i think its just dumb. but it has some truth in it. But then, if u rich.. she knock on ur door becuase of ur $$$ n not ur love how ler right ?</p>
              <p>Anyways i know what u mean . Thats why its,  hard. Cause some ppl say , why love someone when that person doesnt love her/him at all, then might as well be with someone that loves him/her  but she/he doesnt necesary love him/her back . see the delimma here ?</p>

              <p>actually i think that is quite true.... its hard to find couples that like each other at first...so sometimes they find some1 that like them, and see if they can develop relationship from it...</p>

              <p>A gal will only wait for the guy... ONLY if she has no one else better to go to.</p>
              <p>Typically.. good girls who has no problem finding decent guys ... don't bother waiting.</p>
              <p>The ones who usually do wait.. have very small social circle... or they are not very attractive to begin with.. so less options.</p>
              <p>Guys who are successful and satisfied in their relationship usually grab the girls they want, because they know the good ones don't stay available for very long.</p>
              <p>Guys who make their gal wait.. usually ends up getting the left overs.</p>
