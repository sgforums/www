In real society working environment, it won't be too far from there... No matter if they're sh|tty or LOUSY... No one's perfect.

But I think your supervisor mean even without the material(s) in, you can be doing PLANNINGs... Do BACKGROUND RESEARCH (paper studies) and get REFERENCES from PAST STUDIES... And personally, I think he / she is quite RIGHT. For when your material(s) come in and your project is actually RUNNING. You probably won't have extra time to concentrate too much of the above. You'll probably only have time to 'fine-tune' to the paper materials and do a little bit of 'touching up' on whatever information you might be missing...<br><br>And YES.. If you're talking about CELL CULTURES..? They'll need to be monitored PERIODICALLY... As you've mentioned that they're the MAIN SUBJECT of your project?
