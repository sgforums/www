            <div class='col-md body'>Need some advice.<br><br>Have some relationship problems with my dad. Sometimes he never notices the things I did, and keeps on saying what I did not do, and never asks why. Even when I say the reason (valid reasons, like busy, or truly forget) he rarely listens.<br><br>never admits wrong and sometimes can be a showoff. I know I shouldn't say this but... hai. If I say something back, like give the reason why I did not do something he always say I love to quarrel with people. Wth...<br><br>Also..... when I'm feeling down, I tell him "no mood" he'll say something like "the buddha does not have emotions" or "emotions is up to you to decide your emotion". This hurts me even more. Or say I tell him I failed my test. He would say "why u always sleep late huh? later u fail and fail again. see you failed maths" instead of saying something nice.<br><br>can't remember when's the last time he said sorry to me or said words of encouragement. hai.</div>

I thought he wasn't interested in what I am saying and subsequently I just tell my mum whatever happenings there are in my life.<br><br>Last year, he got a stroke. As he lied in bed and told me that he may now need to depend on me and my sis to take care of him for the rest of his life, my heart broke.<br><br>He was always the silent type, but I know he shed tears over his stroke.<br><br>It was around this time I started to know him better.<br><br>I took the effort to talk to him more, know him better. And I realise that he actually really doted on me.<br><br>The man who I thought don't know me is actually the man who knows me better than anyone else.He's better now and can walk on his own without assistance.<br><br>True, mothers may be the ones that most people are close to, but do remember that our dads love us just as much. Just that he may not show it always.<br><br>It took a stroke for me to realise that. I now treasure my dad a lot.<br><br>And u guys should too. Dads may be the ones who scold or pick fault with u, but do remember to treasure him. Don't wait until he's gone before u regret.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>maybe he's just feeling like a failure.<br><br>how old is he? does he have things that he was dreaming of ? maybe he looked up and see rich people with mercs, nice condo, overseas holiday... then he look down and he sees him stuck in HDB, can't afford own transport or holiday, and the son who he really hope can be the turning point... failed math.<br><br>he's just not happy with his life, and you are the victim cos you are always around him. he's grumpy not because he hates you, it's just a way to let it out... he needs to let it go otherwise it will be a killer sickness if he tries to swallow it. unfortunately, when he needs to be grumpy, you are always around.<br><br>now, if this is the case.. how you think you should face it? should you just don't bother? should you encourage him? should you fight him back?<br><br>your call...<br><br></div>
