It's not about the dream that makes you think this way. It's not because you think of her so much that you dream of it. Go think about this, why do you want to know if it's because you think of her too much that you dream about her.<br><br>If it's never in your own thoughts, it'll never occur to you to think that the dreamt meant anything.<br><br>Like Feow said, it's just a dream. But it's not a dream anymore if you have to ask this kind of question. I dream everyday. For years, I dream of tall buildings. I dream of alot of things, does that mean anything? I dont' even bother to find out if it meant anything unless I want it to mean something. Is that what you are seeking for?<br><br>Now you know the answers to your own question?</div>

Dreams are random, senseless, mindless. Like what laosu said, if you haven't got that thinking somewhere in the vast realm of your mind, that dream would be.. nothing. You THINK you don't like her, yet you have to repeatedly tell yourself you don't like her. My opinion is probably the same as many. You unconciously fell in love with her.</div>
