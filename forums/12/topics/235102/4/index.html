Once I invited 2 female friends to stay in my house and I offered to bring them around HK. So it's the same case of "1 guy + 2 girls". I feel fine about it and my 2 friends feel fine too. (They were glad that they saved money on accomodation by staying in my HK home.) At the end of the day, it's just a matter of trust and a matter of economics. I<span style="color: red;">f that guy has no money, no Cantonese knowledge, no sense of direction, etc... , then you better ask your gf to "take care of herself"...  </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>I 200% agree.<br>TS, I really suggest you think it back.<br>If your gf really loves you, why does she want to endanger herself in such a situation? She may trust the guy but does the guy deserves trust when he has to get someone else to sponsor the trip first? Why is he so insistant to go? If he cannot pay this amount upfront, then this amount of money will be quite a big sum to him. Why must he insist of spending this amount of money unless it's so important to him. Really as someone earlier said 'very suspicious'.<br>Why not postpone it and save more money? Then together you two can go alone together and have a real time together as a real 'couple'? If she insists, then let her go and also let the relationship go together. Just be friends.</div>
