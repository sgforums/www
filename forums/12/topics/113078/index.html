I tried to stay committed to the church and group...but by doing that.. it pleases the group yet makes me unhappy..<br><br>I should be happy and look forward going for cell groups and gathering..but i dun.  I guess this is not so much of dating a non christian... i am fine with my bf...and he told me to keep an open mind about things. He never desude me to leave... he just wans me to be happy.  The church mates may think they are just being concern..but in my point of view... they are giving me stress and pressure.<br>some of my frens ever encounter this b4 ... some  of course couldn;'t stand it and broke up eventually. Dun wish to see that happen to me... breaking up coz of something like this. So.. in order to save my sanity hahaha..i kinda have decided to just MIA.  I tried to take a break once..and gues wat.. one of the cell group leaders had a long 'chat' with me. Aiyo.. being very soft hearted..i stayed on. This time round..i dun see the need to pre inform anyone... I am just gonna MIA.  i know its silly... but.. why make myself unhappy rite?<br>i just hope my good fren whos in the same group as me understands this..and not see it as a form of forsaking God. I am not forsaking God.. other churches out there maybe better for me.<br><br>thanks for reading my rant <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> </div></blockquote>I support you sister!<br><br>In our world, there are people who seems to care alot about you, but all they want is a familira sense of conformity.

Its some of the people who practice it who make it complicated.<br><br>No idea about the hats in church.  Maybe its just out of respect that you don't have any headgear...or maybe its so that the person behind you can see the front.  haha.  What did your church members say?<br><br>Take it easy huh?  Not mixing around with religious people doesn't make you less religious, so you don't have to feel bad leaving the group.  Its actually how good your heart is, which makes you closer to whoever you're praying to.<br><br>I gave up my religion too, years and years ago.  Just kinda figured that Saturday night was for partying and Sunday mornings were for waking up late.  Never made it to church on time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
