If he's still mad, it is pretty obvious that he's using you like a pair of gloves.<br><br>Have you met his friends and family? Do you think he cares about you, e.g. showing concern when you're ill, giving encouragement when you're down in the dumps and sharing his happiness with you? Has he done anything that suggests that he loves you -- even sending you home after every date is considered a nice gesture, writing you letters, showing interest in other aspects of you other than your body, etc.?<br><br>These are some questions you have to ask yourself and answer honestly. I suspect he does not really care about you, or more precisely, he cares for you to the extent that it makes you give in to his sexual advances.<br><br>How much older is he, and how did you get to know him? What sort of person is he? Is he kind to others and does he treat his family well?</div>
