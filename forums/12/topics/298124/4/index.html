Think one of u is right, I may have underestimated the amount of freedom lost after marriage. </div></blockquote>There are cases of course for any reason you can think of people has done it.<br><br>Its natural to become aclimatize when a person is exposed to an items too much. For example we identify Colgate as toothpaste worldwide because we see their adverts everyday. We hear about all the negative things everyday, our brain pick it up over and over and just like computer, this frequently accessed item will be kept in the cache<br><br>Its important to be aware of this. Its even more important to know what You want in this relationship and what you can give to help it grow.<br><br>Well... as long as CNY, she's willing to visit your relatives. Keep it simple, short and don't have too much expectations. People say the wrong things and it can easily cause flare ups.

The kind of freedom that single people take for granted is what I've had, until I got married. I didn't realise I miss it so much until I chit chat with my friend. He said it is because of freedom that he does not want to settle down.<br><br>Before marriage, I was debt-free, happy and free. After marriage, I was not that happy, got cc debt and totally unfree. There's no third party whatsoever. I just want to ask, DOES ANYONE OF U KNOW ANYONE WHO ENDED A MARRIAGE FOR FREEDOM?<br><br>I talk to my wife about freedom and she replied, "Well, you can consider divorce. Once we divorce, you can have all the freedom in the world." Dead-end talk.<br><br>Anyway, I am considering her offer. Meantime, I just want to know how everybody thinks about it. Lastly, we have no kids. So, any thoughts? Freedom or marriage?</div></blockquote>This talk about wanting freedom just shows how ready you are for marriage in the first place.<br><br>Did your wife do you wrong? Are there cracks in your marriage? Are there communication breakdowns between you and your wife? Or is it that you resent the fact that you no longer have a "life", that you have to pay for a family now, and that you seemingly can no longer do whatever you want?<br><br>You are selfish. You want to be responsible only to yourself, and you sure as hell do not care about your wife at all. I doubt u even love her. You are just not ready for marriage life, and yet u went into it, and now u talk about  mounting debts, wanting freedom etc.<br><br>Take my advice, just divorce. Your wife deserves better.</div>
