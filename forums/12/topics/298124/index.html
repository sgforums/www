Lastly, we have no kids. So, any thoughts? Freedom or marriage?</div></blockquote>This is so typical...the answer is a sad YES. But it's so toopid....please allow to share...<br><br>1. Why do you get married in the first place? For sex? Status? New experience? Remember the oaths that you took??? More importantly, do you recall why you LOVE your wife and decided to marry her, to take care of her, etc...??<br><br>Life is full of challenges, learn how to solve it and not escape from it. You have been sucked into the black hole of boring Singapore because you (and your wife) are boring.<br><br>And because of this, I'm guessing that your married life is boring and uneventful and you just wish to chill out elsewhere, check out new excitements....but the fact is, whatever you do, it'll be boring after awhile because you are boring....booze with the old frenz, drinking the same brand of booze...yada yada....<br><br>Look, the fact is that your 'cool' unmarried friend naturally has a differently lifestyle as you because he is who he is and you are not him. Grass is greener there but if you stop whining about your married life, he'll start to envy you instead!!!!!<br><br>2. You have debts because of your choice and lifestyle. To me, that has nothing to do with marriage or freedom. Draw up a joint saving account that covers all living expenditures/saving/medical and any excess is your own to spend or save.<br><br>Everyone has financial issues in one way or another and I guess it's all about our capitalistic world so nothing to do with marriage or freedom.<br><br>Want more financial freedom? Work harder and earn more! Or simply be cash rich and downgrade.<br><br>Bro FG, you will come whole circle even if you get divorced now, a few years later met some interesting lady, decided to try to settle down again because you are wiser. but consider all the lost opportunities?<br><br>I'm married but i still maintain my social circles with mixed gender and I mean 1-1 and vice versa for her. If your marriage means you cannot go out with gals, then you need to speak to your wife and that's a separate trust issues here.<br><br>If you are not getting a financial balance here, speak to her and sort out your crap.<br><br>If you are not getting enough sex, find out why? Pain, mess, tired, style pattern, etc...learn to match each other....<br><br>Human is all about balance. Take 10 steps back and look at your life. Which are the parts that are skewed, and balance it. Whether to divorce or not is not longer an issue here.<br><br>( Care to share with us your age, how long you have dated and married, etc...?)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frustrated_guy<br><br>Your problem with wife has been dragged on for so long.  You are both clear on what the issues are .  Just that there is no effective resolution to date.  And the reason behind that?   Incompetence?  Lack of resolution?  Both too stubborn to back down?  Pride?   Refusal to seek external help?  Immaturity?<br><br>The crux of the matter is not that your marriage has problems - fact is every marriage has problems.  The crux is that both of you are simply unable to sit down and work things out, due to whatever reason.  This is a failure on BOTH your parts.<br><br>There are only 3 options really.  Work at it, or run from it.   Or just be miserable putting up with status quo.<br><br>IMO save yourself the trouble and make 2008 resolution to get a divorce.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>honestly, the cc debt is not due to lack of freedom etc. just like what they said, to sum it up, choice, lifestyle, finance management etc. try to refrain from actually owning a cc if u have spending probs. cc debt is a problem that occurs to many people, and also when they're unmarried.<br><br>let me assure you, you have someone who loves you very much, regardless of the senseless things she does. otherwise, she wouldn't have married you. even if she doesn't say that, trust me, take it from someone of her gender. do u have a problem understanding her? women are kinda hard to decode, like when she "offers" divorce as an option, highly unlikely she means it. she could've been really angry, and says things she doesn't mean to say, maybe just to see your reaction. those are the possiblities, and yes, she is hurting inside.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>about the stuff like her controlling you, trust is the issue. go talk to her, tell her about how you feel gently, make sure she doesn't flare up and refuse to hear you out. also, point out your own mistakes and apologise. then it's her turn. assure her that you love her, but u gotta mean it =p. and ask her the same.<br><br>give and take. compromise.</div>
