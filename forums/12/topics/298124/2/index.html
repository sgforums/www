            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Frustrated,<br><br>You have been sounding very sour since the previous thread dude, just not sour enough to drop the minefield (your marriage) completely.<br><br>I think your first big mistake was asking her to marry you Â– because you tied the knot with a person you are fighting over freedom rights with. To top it off, youÂ’re going to live together for the rest of your life, imagine that. Why are you in a commitment with a person who apparently, has more problems than you do?<br><br>But now itÂ’s too late because youÂ’re knee deep in the grave and there are always going to be problems so the question is, how deep are these problems and how often do they come up. If she is the wife to go ape sh*t each time you flip the toilet bowl, are you sure you can live with it?<br><br>Sounds like there are some pervasive problems and now youÂ’re wondering whether you should jump ship or weather the storm. When she repeatedly suggested divorce, what were your usual replies? Was she looking for you to tell her you only want to be with her? Is she that insecure?<br><br>When she was being unreasonable and siding with whichever branch of the psycho family you guys have, did you give her a lecture and convey your side of the story? Were you man enough to tell her off? You need to be man enough if you want to keep a hot but crazy wife by your side.<br><br>Screw the marriage counseling. But before ending the marriage, what I would do if I were you is go rent an apartment, live apart, unleash the dragon, bask in your freedom but continue to date Miss Nutter (your wife).<br><br>Because you guys have to start all over again.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Fustrated_Guy<br><br>I really duno wat is wrong between u &amp; ur wife.  Ur problem with ur wife has been draggin for far too long.<br><br>From your point of view, I see tat she is always not happy with whatever u do, which is somehow fustrating even for an outsider like me.  And I think there isnt a way to know wat's HER point of view here...<br><br>There are indeed pple out there who ended their marriage for their so-called freedom.  But lemme ask u, wat made u decided to get married in the 1st place?  Surely u dun need to know <span style="font-style: italic;">only now</span> tat freedom as a single is different when married.<br><br>If im in ur shoes, i wld consider gettin a <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">separation 1st</span></strong> if tat is wat the other party wants.  It may hurt both party, but since none of u (or onli one of u) is interested to make an effort to make it work, time to go separate ways &amp; not prolong the pain &amp; unhappiness.<br><br>But of cos, if there is still hope in ur marriage, dun give up!</div>
