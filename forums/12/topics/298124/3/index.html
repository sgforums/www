Tell her how u feel, and when u tell her, do not be afraid of argument or give girl chance or cannot bear to make her cry thingy. U must be firm and decisive in order to send the right message over<br><br>3) Leave her. Divorce and get a new lease of life.<br><br>I believe in private space in relationship. We can still go out with female friends, play video games like no tomorrow, went out with friends to drink and visit our relative whenever we like it. Likewise she can do the same thing. If she want to hinder u, if I am u, I will be angry about it and talk/argue over it but I will not back down on it.

            <div class='col-md body'>TS,<br><br>Obviously, you feel tired at trying to play the role your wife wants you to play, and it is natural to want freedom back. It's almost like a teenager wanting to go and hang around with his friends, not so much for the activity, but for the simple reason his parent is forbidding him to do so, and that he needs to want to taste freedom.<br><br>But you're in a marriage, and both parties need to work hard at making the marriage work.<br><br>If she's not working hard, it gives you the excuse not to work hard too. But is that the way to go?<br><br>You said you spent all your time with her.. perhaps, it's only quantity time, not quality time. Spending the whole day walking around with her in shopping malls, or staying at home watching TV, with a grumpy and suppressed resentful look, is not quality time.<br><br>Obviously your wife has a problem with regards to freedom and healthy space, but the issue is not to be solved by fighting for your own freedom. Try to understand why she's doing it, and with gentle affirmation, try to work things out...<br><br>Why don't you two try counselling? She may refuse to do it, but you can start first, and then perhaps she can join later..<br><br>The way I see it, you have stopped working at the marriage, and have started getting back at her. No wife wants her hubby to go Geylang, btw, as far as I know.<br><br>Focus on the reason behind her anger, and not on what she says. It's content-free, all her words...<br><br>I also recommend consulting a fengshui expert for improving your home harmony.<br><br>Counselling before divorce, I think, is the best path for any married couple about to split.<br><br>Hope that helps.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My experience tells me, once a woman starts to get posessive and wants to control every movement of the husband, SHE WILL NEVER STOP AGAIN. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>You can forget about communicating to her that you are very stifled. You can forget about hoping she will change. They are like that because they are suspicious. Once they are suspicious of you, it just never go away. No one is wrong, they are just like that.<br><br>You, and not just you but everyone, should know that marriage will change your life. You are not just responsible for yourself but for your spouse too. No one should expect your life to be the same as when you are single after you are married. Things will change, priorities will change, expectations will change. Be like me, dun get married if you are prepared to give up what you have now. But once you get married and not happy, either you divorce or just live with the consequences cos you chose this way in the first place.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To be honest, I just want to learn if anybody did it for the sake of freedom. Actually, I didn't really want to talk much about my wife 'cause this time it is about myself. Come to think of it, I felt rather selfish asking the question. But if not for my wife who kept popping the divorce word, it would never really got inside my head...<br><br>As for CNY, something miraculous happen. My wife actually managed to think things through and agreed to visit my relatives. Unbelievably, a potential disaster was averted.<br><br>Thank you all for the comment, whether positive or negative. Think one of u is right, I may have underestimated the amount of freedom lost after marriage.</div>

To go out and party all night and not call back and let the other person worry is not being responsible.<br><br>No wife like the husband to call other women. Its just that the trust to let him go and meet his female and male friends. However, if that trust is not built up or it was eroded away, then there will be trouble.  It applies to both parties.<br><br>CNY - can opt to go overseas and don't see all relatives.  Otherwise negotiate and assign certain days to certain relatives and keep to the predefined hours.<br><br>Be principaled and be fair. If there is a decision to be made, make it together and explain clearly why the choice. Not some condescending or patronizing words. No one likes that.<br><br>You can only ask people to be fair and reasonable. But you cannot change anyone but yourself.<br><br>TS don't even establish basic management of the r/s...  As All Forum people kep asking, didn't you already see her pattern during dating. Now married, these pattern become an issue?<br><br>My MIL compare herself to the MIL on TV who torture the DIL and declare herself the best MIL.

And for your bf, hes a jerk to being disloyal with his wife.. i dont know how sad is your bf story or watever, but i seriously object r/s of some1 who is married and playing around behind their lover's back.. Thats just so irresponsible for a guy to do that..<br><br>I really cant understand gals..I hope the guy will treat u the same when u both got married and see how it felt when he leaves u for other women.. he can do it to his wife.. im sure he can do it to you too. God bless you. Its your life and path that u want it this way, dont regret if this happens to you one day if you married him. People seems to not learn unless they experience it themself</div>
