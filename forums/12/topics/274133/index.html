            <div class='col-md body'>I felt like that at one time. Now i am just looking at the light at the end of the tunnel. Not the oncoming train.. but the light..<br><br>U have to make opportunities yourself. Look around i am sure there are ways. U just need to move your brain of yours a bit.  Everyone is looking for the BIG BREAK.. but whether u can grab it when it comes or see it is another thing.<br><br>The big break u are talking about..sometimes wont come until later. Just like talent if u are spotted... BANG ! u are on.. but if not , u just gotta MAKE urself seen.  Its like that one.. u gotta show what u got man... ppl notice , then its another thing.<br><br>Anyways i think SG , if u are in SG , the market very stable and the good ppl stays there and if u are not as good u stay where u are. So a stable market just means less opportunity. Harder.. u gotta be damn good or else u gonna stay there for a long long time. Unless u pioneer something new.</div>
