Tats y u seeking a good advise in here or mayb a good oppurtunity.<br><br>A good start, my fren..<br><br>.. and dont say yourself worthless or no value.. bcuz the reason of what you are now, is all bcuz of yourself.. blaming yourself will be a terrible attack to your confidence.. i thk you know how much confidence you have rite now..<br>The more you attack yourself , the more its goin to hurt..<br><br>Mindset first,, then attitude... and dont even think of resting till u really get wat you want.. cuz if you always delay , like i used to do.. it will take months, then years.. trust me.. i did that.

At a certain point in our life, everything is clear and every things seem possible. We are not afraid to dream and to yearn for everything that we would like to see happen in their life. But as time passess, a mysterious force being to convince us that it will be impossible to realize our dream. What is this force? It is a force that appears to be negative but in actually fact shows you to realize your dream. why? cos it prepares your spirit and your will. It drives you to look for more.<br><br>So my friend, any plans of reaching there dreams of yours?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, I am not sure what you really want.  Seems like you wanted something big from the way you discribe.  What break you referring to?  To different people it means different thing.  There are many people out there who don't even get any break at all and living till their old age, like my father.  What has he achieved? nothing, after his retirement, he went into what he loved doing so, run a sport business with  his retirment funds.  Guess what, one of his partner chicken out and he got all his captial stuck in Thailand plant.. then lost every thing.  Imagine at his age... Now he is just happy selling free lance on his own, where one of his former partner is offerring good commissions because of his contacts.  He still needs to eat in his old age,<br><br>My brother, in his early 40s, got his diploma, Advance diploma, then borrow $$ went UK study and came back (late 20s then).  What happen now, initially could not even get a job during the best time of SG, because he was too fussy... always complain being taken advantage of, low pay because his friend are getting higher, only few yrs experience but thought he was well to command better pay, work on several jobs for weeks if not months, looking for his so call ideal job, good pay, interesting work, etc... never come.  After some 15 yrs, now ended up being a tution teacher.. whatever he is teaching, I don't know.  Pay, I don't know too, but obviously not very high either according to my father. slightly higher than his last job as an raw engineer.  Worse, my father has to even take care of house work and his makan too... what a shame? He doesn't contribute to the family at all.... waiting for my father to feed him when he is home.<br><br>I had seen the mess in his room.. to me its not fit for human... so smelly too.  So what has he achieved?  He seems rather promising initially when he completed his Polytechnic and was working and I had enjoy talking to him as we were from the similar industry.  But now, pathetic...<br><br>Not many people will get the break.  I got mine few times, but only managed to catch one and ended up with a scholarship, but then upon my return, what happen?  Its totally opposite of what I expected and what I was doing then, I must agreed I had a very promising career, not that I asked for, I was never ambitious type, but my work brought me fame, lifted my porfolio... but the tide has changed, I even got head hunted but my bond tied me down.  The company was willing to pay, but not my bond.  Even before I left for study, I almost got my break had it not for being psycho by my boss into signing the bond for study.   All these comes to nothing after I came back, with the financial crisis in full swing and my work was leading me no where.  All I can say, I lost all I gain and I am just like any ordinary folks, can be disposed off for whatever they want me to do.  I have excepted it as I no long has any bullet up my sleeves that I can command any value, quiting.. my industry has moved on and many has relocated in China... where am I now..... I can't even get the same package as I am now, and given my pay, there's no way I can get any job less in adminstration, but who dare employ me without the relevant experience to command workers?<br><br>Be patient and contented with what you have, for many may not even be where you are.  Not trying to console you, but its reality.  If your break really comes, be it, my so call break came in my mid 30s (my scholarship), but only gave me fasle hope as I return after my study... what BREAK? only think I gain is a piece of "toilet" paper which comes with a slightly better pay than before... job satisfaction? interesting work? Something I find rather stressful to cope initially which I didn't even realised... only much later.... learning to except that life for me....<br><br>You say break, I have always been agressive, knowlegdgable in my field and practical orientated, hands on person when I work, but no one ever gave me any break, even my idle classmate got better break than I do.... and he admited its a waste of my talent... . just your luck....<br><br></div>

Important is u must have the things u need(e.g knowledge), so when opprtunity comes, success will just come in ur way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi TS,<br>perhaps you can spend some more time reading books and about ego.<br><br>Its about understanding what is human ego and also learn methods to improve your situations. you also got to understand that things are not always within our control. someone may be successful and earn alot but they still can die. like leslie chun the actor.<br>Therefore, even if u did not manage to be successful in career, you still should have a positive self esteem. However, you just do what you can to excel and earn more money. If u manage to do it, that is good but remain humble. If you did not, be contend and be patient in trying on.<br><br>good luck to your future endeavors.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Are u gonna just whine and forever be a loser or what ?<br><br>If not you better do something about it.<br><br>People expect much from you ,expect u to be something and u too expect yourself to be someone and doing something. Hell that is what most peoples expectation from another person , especially relatives and family.<br><br>Now that u noticed u got a suck @ss life , ego problems , pessimistic views... and those are OBVIOUSLY drowning yourself in it ,denying yourself the opportunities, maybe try being optimistic , change of attitude and mindset.<br><br>You cant expect to be a doctor if u dont study medicine . Cant expect to sit at the position when u did not sweat for it , carry ppls balls or whatever u do to be up there .<br><br>To me , the big breaks are opportunities seized at the right moment and the right time. U able to take advantage of that situation! It is always around, whether or not u see it , or even have the requirements and the skill and knowledge to seize it. They comes in all forms. And your attitude the outcome. Prove your worth when there is opportunity for you to shine more then others. So while u are unable to grasp them now , u have to increase your worth , increase your knowledge , experience and if u want it.. u gotta go out there and do whatever it is to grab it.Sometimes opportunities are there , but i just aint got what it takes to do grab on to it.<br><br>Opportunities that i managed to get and people say why and how , they couldve gotten it . but its too late.. i was able to see it and make use of it , while they were stupid enough to allow me to take it. Simple. I am up here now and they are down there forever feeling that i grabbed that piece of pie.. when they themselves shouldve realised that it was thier own fault n inability to see it.<br><br>Seriously.. i dont see why u guys cannot just go out and grab what is yours. U just gotta do whatever it takes. All those ppl out there.. who are stupid enough are just stepping stones to my greatness.<br><br>There are so many things i want to do and can do , but there are many things i want but i cant get them because of lack of knowledge and requirements. But i am only 1 person with 2 hands and a brain.So unless u meet the minimum requirements , u aint gonna get it. Unless its given to u free and dropped on your lap.<br><br></div>
