            <div class='col-md body'>IMO I felt that couples should not break up so easily. Yes there may be differences and challenging situations i.e. quarrels, tiffs, misunderstandings and etc. But as mature adults I felt that one should not break up unless you really want to.<br><br>A lot of times I find that values like faithfulness, commitment, loyalty and patience are in short supply. Being attached already means that both parties are stepping forward towards a more serious r/s which will culminate to marriage. And I find that couples should exercise more tact and values that are healthy towards a long term r/s.<br><br>If we cannot be serious during this stage I think it will be harder during marriage. Don't forget romance isn't stopping upon marriage. In fact it is just the opposite, it is the beginning indeed.
