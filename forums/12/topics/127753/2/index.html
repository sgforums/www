People may not forgive you but in order to let go, you must forgive yourself and move on.<br><br>I know it's hard to forgive yourself but it really all boils down to whether you really want to let go or just continue to be miserable. Because if you don't let go, it doesn't mean your ex will forgive you. Since it's apparent that she won't, just go easy on yourself. Everybody makes mistakes. You deserve her hostility towards yourself but just try to pick yourself up, forget about the past, go easy on yourself for now and make sure not to make the same mistake again.<br><br>Good luck</div>

I don't have and never will eat my words, not in the past, not in the present and definitely not in the future. You never being through (or maybe you are a double timer too) it, you'll never understand it. Try being the receiving end, see how you handle it.<br><br>I initiated a breakup in the past because the gal was double timing on me. She said she loved me more when I found out about it. But I let her go because there's no point holding on to something which is not rightfully yours anymore. Guess how long it took me to overcome it? Almost a year. From that time onwards, I despised all those double timers because they betrayed the trust of their love ones.<br><br>For the threadstarter, I don't see any remorse in him. He's not really apologetic of what he have done. That's why he deserved what he is in now. By speaking out for him, I believe you're into casual relationships too. Hope you're not gonna end up like the threadstarter.<br><br>For your info, this is my 8th year with my gal and still going strong. I still love her very much as in the beginning and it never strike me to find another one. I believe if you treat a gal right, she will reciprocate it. So, what do you have to be proud of?
