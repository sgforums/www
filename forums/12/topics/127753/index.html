You still love her and can't let go?  I don't know about that.  From my own perspective, either you have to be the one who breaks up or "forbidden fruit taste sweeter".  Hence, I don't know if it's about love because love is built...and over a period of time.  Then it progresses to "gan ching" which is deeper than "ai ching" which is usually passion.<br><br>You may have no choice but to let go and move on.  Hopefully you will learn something from this experience.<br><br>All the very best.</div>

You make that gal feel more insecure in future relationship. You make the next bf of her to pick up the pieces and patch it back. You left a scar in her heart because of your irresponsible actions. No gals should deserve all these things.<br><br>I wish all the best to your ex-gf and all the worst to you. You may hear this a million times but I just have to say it loud, YOU GOD DAMNED DESERVED ALL THIS AGONY BECAUSE YOU ARE THE CREATOR OF THIS MESS.<br><br>I really pity that gal and glad that she overcame her sorrows. And you? Still want to get her back and hurt her again?<br><br>LOSER! PHUI! I just hate double timers. They are scums and lowlifes. PHUI!<br><br>For your info, I'm a guy speaking from my own personal views and I do not represent anyone or party. If you feel offended by my posting, apology is not given, I meant to do that.</div>
