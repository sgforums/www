            <div class='col-md body'>When you are infected with HIV, your immune system begins to produce antibodies to fight off the infection. However, it can take anywhere from three weeks to three months before your body produces enough antibodies to be detected on a test. In some cases it may even take as much as six months before any antibodies are present.<br><br>therefore, it is usually recommended that you wait until three months after a possible exposure before being tested. alternatively, you can be tested three weeks after possible exposure and, if you receive a negative result the first time, test again three months later.<br><br>The following <strong>may</strong> be warning signs of infection with HIV:<br><br>* rapid weight loss<br>* dry cough<br>* recurring fever or profuse night sweats<br>* profound and unexplained fatigue<br>* swollen lymph glands in the armpits, groin, or neck<br>* diarrhea that lasts for more than a week<br>* white spots or unusual blemishes on the tongue, in the mouth, or in the throat<br>* pneumonia<br>* red, brown, pink, or purplish blotches on or under the skin or inside the mouth, nose, or eyelids<br>* memory loss, depression, and other neurological disorders<br><br>However, no one should assume they are infected if they have any of these symptoms. Each of these symptoms can be related to other illnesses. Again, the only way to determine whether you are infected is to be tested for HIV infection.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bro, I know how is it like to be in that kinda situation. I been there b4 and trust me I wouldn't wanna even go back there. The farking people here are giving useless info and cursing you kena aids all these. Forget abt these farkers they don't know anything about AIDS. These are the idiots who only laugh at people and act gentleman say eeekkk...go geylang kena aids very good ah. Bro, don't listen to these bastards. You've not commited a crime.<br><br>If you did use a condom, the risk of infection is highly unlikely cuz the pores on the condom is so small that HIV virus cannot even get through it. In school, my teacher show us video tapes and say condom not much protection one all these and even say HIV virus is so small that it can pass through the pores of the condom. It's BULL. I know right now, you still feel like crazy every min and second but when you go for a HIV test at the 12th week and got your negative results, you got say thank god I will never go there again. Which I strongly belive that your results will be negative. 12th week test is the longest one can wait for any HIV antibody to show up in the results. Normally if a guy who fark a prositude with AIDS without condom 1 time, the risk of getting is still very very low lower than one could imagine. But I won't challenge you to fight against the odds. Right now, you must be looking around the whole internet for answers to your questions. Go to here instead my bro, you will find your answers here. I won't even wish you good luck on your test because I know you are negative but I wish you good luck in whatever you do in future. Going for a HIV test is just to put your mind at ease that's all. Hope it helps <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br><a href="http://www.thebody.com/Forums/AIDS/SafeSex/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebody.com/Forums/AIDS/SafeSex/index.html</a></div>
