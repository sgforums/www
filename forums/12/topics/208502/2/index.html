He did nothing wrong visiting hookers as long as he knows how to use a condom and protect himself. It a trade and when there is demand, there will be supply. Who says he deserve it? Did he do anything against the law? He just went to visit a hooker and now he regrets it and by posting here, he is looking for some place whereby he can ease his mind and stop thinking of the whole incident. So rathcycle, if you do not know anything, I suggest you talk lesser cuz the more you try to defend yourself, the more stupid you will be.<br><br>TS bro, go to the forum there and talk to the doctors there cuz most people inside here will only say you desrve it lah all this.</div>

I was in your shoes...twice.  And worse, they were pickups at Jakarta bars!  And much much worse - I did not use any protection!!!<br><br>After the first exposure, I waited a few months before going for a full health screening including HIV tests.

And when the counsellor said "negative", I almost choked.  I almost felt like a new man, a resurrection of my future.<br><br>Why am I saying all these?  I hope it makes you feel better - the chances of getting it is actually not very great, yet don't get me wrong - IT IS DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE RISK!  The months of waiting, and the moments in the clinic waiting for the result, will forever be a reminder to me not to be so stupid again.<br><br>Based on what you said, you should be fine unless you have wounds or ulcers in your mouth, or anywhere you might have used to contact her fluids.
