But my best bet at this point would be at most to let her know that your feeling's a little above just normal friendships (if you wanna hint and 'express' yourself)... If she truly is already 'feeling' for you at this point.. She should be able to 'pick up' rather sensitively... But do note that just like any other ordinary 'confession'.. If she's an 'extreme' person, there's no denying that you might just 'turn the whole boat over'.... At least this method would allows you to regulate the 'signal' you're trying to send across...<br><br>Personally, I'm not very favourable of your likely approaches... Reasons being that she's attached; you've pretty much no concrete ground on what she might or might not be feeling for you; you're confused over your own thoughts and possible acts...<br><br>An aftermath calculates that even if she's having problem with her bf, it's probably not a wise approach to just step in... Showing affections is still relatively okay.. Direct 'walk in' intervention is not... How long have she been with her bf? How have their relationship been all along...?<br><br>And on a more 'social' level... DO NOTE that you'll have to face the 'burden' of stepping in with an attached girl (failure or success alike) among common friends... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>kor ah.... my advice is, dun say anything yet. think of what she will feel if you said anything. if she also has "feelings' for you, she will feel torn between you and her bf. she might even sink into guilt for her "emotional betrayal". if she didnt have feeligs for you, it just makes things awkward, and what will she think of you, telling a girl you like her when you knew perfectly she is attached.<br><br>it's a lose-lose situation in my opinion.<br><br>just continue to be there for her. you may choose to still like her despite the odds, or look around for other fishes. but whatever it is, i will always advice against disturbing the equilibrium of someone else's r/s..<br><br>good luck kor.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>erhmm I think since shes attached ,better not tell her about it loh. As you said she having some problems with her current bf, then I think telling her will also add in another problem to her. And it wouldnt be a great idea cause indirectly may become a third party.<br><br>Unless you can be really sure you are a much better person than her current one. and you think she may like you also, will be happier with you.<br><br>Its still better to wait for her to detach first then tell her loh.</div>
