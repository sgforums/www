After 2 months, you have high interest level or attraction for her and want to explore the possibilities above anything else.<br><br>I despise the fact that people always throw in terms like Â“Real LoveÂ” or Â“True LoveÂ” to give them an excuse for not doing anything constructive at the beginning of a courtship:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â“If you really love her (yes you heard me correctly. True love after knowing her for just 2 months), you should let her go so that you will not hurt herÂ”</span><br><br><strong>Translation : That kind of speech is for drama queens who think too highly of himself. As if the end of a 2 month old friendship is going to hurt both parties so much that she is going to commit suicide over it.</strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â“If you really love her (againÂ…true love after knowing her for 2 months), you donÂ’t seek to possess herÂ”  </span><br><br><strong>Translation : Saying something like that when you have known her for only 2 months makes you a package dealÂ…hypocrite (who hides his masculinity) + Drama queen who is in self denial; I have no balls to approach but I can convince myself that IÂ’m some love god who knows what true love isÂ…others donÂ’tÂ…so I still win!</strong><br><br>DonÂ’t fall into the trap of being a drama queen.<br>DonÂ’t drag true love into the picture when you are talking about a 2 month old relationship.<br>Just be true to what you want at this point.<br></div>
