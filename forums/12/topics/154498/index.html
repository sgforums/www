I just hope that u understand the fact that even she had problems with her bf does not mean that she will be with you.<br><br>Girls who love their boyfriend alot sometimes quarrel with their bf but that does not mean that it will end. Instead it only shows that she love him more cos she care for her boyfriend and willing to fight hard to countinue the relatioship, its only when girls totally ignore their bf then the real problem starts.<br><br></div>
