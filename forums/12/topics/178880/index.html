            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I'm almost afraid to divulge this to anyone. This is the first time I've ever talked about it in detail. One time I started to tell a girl friend about it, but when I saw her reaction I decided to not follow through. When I was growing up I had vague memories of seeing my motherÂ’s furry pussy when I was very young in the shower with her. I also barely remember lying on top of her on the bed between her spread legs and feeling her warm pussy against me. I had a memory of her pushing me down until my penis was against and inside her pussy. Sometimes as an adult when I was half asleep, like just before I fell asleep or when I woke up in the morning I found myself with and erection thinking about my mother gently sucking on my penis. I could not explain my faint memories. And I couldnÂ’t explain why I always got so aroused when I thought of it that I ended up masturbating and having good orgasms. I need to say this, my mother was an Adventist and a very, very normal and loving woman. She was a very good mother and a good friend. When I was 38 and she was 65, we were having sort of a heart to heart conversation about my impending divorce. She was very supportive and compassionate. Suddenly I decided to confront her about my memories. I told her there was something very personal I wanted to ask her. I could tell by her response that she felt uneasy. I was sitting in a chair and she was putting new bedding on the bed in the spare bedroom. I told her I had some sexual memories. She looked at me with a guilty look and asked me what kind of memories. What is so weird is, as I started to ask her, I felt my penis getting aroused. This was so crazy I thought. I started to ask her more questions when my mom sat on the bed and said, "You donÂ’t have to ask any more. I know what you are going to ask. Honey, I just wanted to make you happy, to make you feel good." I was shocked. It was true. My mother had sex with me when I was a baby. By now my penis was very hard and I was afraid to stand up because she might see it in my pants. Then she shocked me even more when she said, "Honey I know this divorce is very hard on you, if there is anything I can do to make you feel better, just ask." I was so confused. Was she telling me she would lay down and let me put my penis inside her pussy? Was she telling me she would suck my penis like she did when I was very young? Oh my God I was so freaked out. My penis was visibly hard and I think she knew it. Suddenly I said, "Mom, I do need to feel better." I couldnÂ’t believe I said it. She got up and locked the bedroom door, then went and layed on the bed. She pulled up her gown and motioned for me to come to the bed. When I stood up she saw my hard penis poking inside my pants. I could not believe this was happening but I needed to cum so bad. She unzipped my pants and began rubbing my penis. She motioned for me to lay on top of her. She spread her legs and my hard penis easily went inside her wet, warm pussy. It felt so good. I felt like this is where I was supposed to be, inside my mothers loving pussy. She gently pumped against me and soon my penis was cumming inside her. It was the best orgasm I can ever remember. After it was over I felt so guilty I could hardly bare it. My mom when to the bathroom. The next day when I left she said, "Honey anytime you need to feel better, come and visit and I'll take good care of you." It was so weird. I did enjoy her loving pussy a few more times, then I got remarried. My mom passed away about 10 years later. I have no regrets. I loved her and I miss her. I know this sounds sick, but, my sense was that she was just trying to make her son feel good.<br><br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you say she cares for you, but i think if a mother really loved her son, she would never, ever do something like that to him. its child abuse and thats why you're feeling all weird about it. maybe you should get some professional help.<br><br></div>
