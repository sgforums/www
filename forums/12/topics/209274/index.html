(some guys actually feel pain inside during quarrels but want to put on a brave front)<br><br>2. the quarrel is too overbearing till the guy cannot take it (ie the words said are too hurtful)<br><br>3. the guy pictures an eventual breakup due to the quarrel and his imagination runs wild, leading to a depressed state<br><br></div>
