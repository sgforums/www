Sometime, they talk bad about my other friends, so what makes you think they won't talk bad about about you. Plus, you will never know what are they thinking about even when their laughing with you.<br><br>After all its a dog eat dog world, you snooze you lose and that what I have been taught from young by my parents.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

And err...have u too?<br><br>Yes, to a certain extent friends, backstab each other and yet are still friends. Is like u complain about your family member, but u still love them?<br><br>But to think you are still studying, when u start working it just gets worst. It sort of become do something for an agenda type of mentality lor. Coz most times, u may be so tired from work, u rather not talk.</div>
