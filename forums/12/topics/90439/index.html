They are shallow. let them be.. that girl isn't worthy of you.. that so-called good friend will jus be a friend.. Don't want to declare to the world they are together,,, cos they know that you like the girl.. scared that you might get hurt when you know about it.. but then again.. when you so happen to see them holding hands together.. wouldn't it be more hurtful than honestly telly ou the truth..<br><br>"Bu yao bei zhe liang xin shou xia hua" If in the first place the friend told you that he also likes the girl then it would be a fair competition.. at lest you knwo about it.. whether the girl choses who i'm sure you give your beat wishes to them.. And if they ever tell you about their r/s.. however you know that they are friends that can be trusted and to be honest with you.. and who knows.. you guys maybe really good friends afterall..<br><br>Well, friends come and go.. next time open your eyes big big.. and see! hehehhe <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

My guess is you probably took too much time to go after her at your own pace. Another reason is probably the girl herself is actually interested in your friend and the both of them are mutually attracted to each other. Good friends and girl-that-you-like simply don't mix, and friendship and love are both entirely different things. Say if you like this girl and your best friend is also interested in her, will you give her up just because your best friend openly declared his interest in her to you? The answer is no, because you fight for your own happiness and so does your best friend. And if you really like the girl, wouldn't you feel much better/assure if she hooks up with your best friend rather than other strangers whose character credibility is a huge question mark?<br><br>You are probably feeling more sour from the fact that you didn't win her heart rather than the ''betrayal'' which comes from your friend. And your friend is actually not even close to you...so he has no obligations in whatever way to step aside and open up a freeway for you to go after the girl that he might  also be interested in.<br><br>If you find somebody that you really like in the future, make haste because you don't get this kind of feelings often and once you missed her, you will never know when you might meet another girl that you really like again.<br><br>Good luck.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
