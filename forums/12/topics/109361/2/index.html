Or after she gets well you could treat her to ice-cream. Most girls would like it. Say something like "4 days sick, must be eating lots of sad food, here, i treat you some sweet food to make you happy."<br><br>If she's very sick then don't ask to meet her outside. Ask if you can go her house to see her a bit. (Depends on how good your relationship with her is...). Just don't do anything out of what you would ordinarily do. Being sweet is one thing, too sweet is another...<br><br>That line ar..? Likes you as a lover, not as a didi. Else you confess, get rejected, relationship strained. Horrible feeling. You don't want to go through it, really.<br><br>I'm not asking you to have these qualities in one day. Heck, i achieved it through several years, and still haven't got all of it yet. Take some time. You're still young after all.<br><br>Post Secondary life will change and mature you. Be patient.~<br><br>P.S (Porridge/Congee is standard food for very sick people.
