              I joined this Company owned by the Indonesians as Director at it most fragile state.  I turned the Company round from their monthly sale into daily sale.  Within, three months, what they took one month to achive, I did it on daily basis.  Of course the turn around of the economy helped too.
              
              I worked so hard that I somehow neglected my family and both me and my wife went into depression.  My friend had asked that I leave the Company earlier as the stress level is just too much for me and also that the Company do not support me as much as they are supposed to but I insisted in staying as I know I can do more but alas, I decided that I should resign as it is affecting my family life quite badly.  Finally, last month I resigned but the damn Company do not want to pay me my salary and even the loan I gave to the Company when it need cash.
              
              They also owed the contractor and is late on payment for almost everything.  Too bad for the Company, ever since I left, they are back to square one.  The sale is back to the day before I joined them.  They still do not understand that it is the way they work and now, they are pushing all blame at me.
              
              I just needed some place to air my grivances as my wife do not want to have anything to do this Company as it had almost break our family up.

              <p>I do not know a lot of things and am very sympathetic towards your situation, but I have a few things to share.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, we need to do some researching before we join a company but even if we done our homework, I don't think we ever be able to find the perfect job. There are several red lights before you accept a job:</p>
              <p>1. What is the cashflow like? If you worked your first month and your first pay is delayed more than a week after that, it is not good sign, you should leave.</p>
              <p>2. Do you have access to the profit &amp; loss statement, can you see whether the company has been making money for the last 3 years?</p>
              <p>3. Bonus and increment, make sure the company is a doing well pays consistent bonus and increment. Even if its small, at least the company is looking after welfare of its employees.</p>
              <p>4. How is the job like? Is it a poison chalice? Why did your last predecessor left? Make sure it is a job you like and it is not mission impossible job. Make sure you can handle all the shiit pass down from your predecessor.</p>
              <p>5. Working hours. Make sure there is a balance. Before interview, make sure you tell your interviewer what you looking for.</p>
              <p>6. Relationship with boss, direct superior? During interview make sure you ask questions and find out what kind of person your superior is. This is the only chance to find out if your direct superior is good fit with yours. Or ask anybody you know that works for this company.</p>
              <p>7. What is the culture of the company? During interview, through newspapers, ask friend who formerly work there or currently work there and find out what is the culture. Is the culture a good fit to your working style?</p>
              <p>8. Location, location and location. Find out that it is not too far from where you live, accessible and not one with dreaded future postings to places you don't want to go like Sudan.</p>
              <p>9. Salary rate. Like bonus and increment, make sure the company offers you what you want. If you take up the job out of desperation, chances are, you will feel disatisfied and you have difficulty in catching up with your expenses</p>
              <p>10. Relationship with co-workers. If you are an open social person, this is not a problem.</p>

              Ya, what you say is very true and I did consider that.  Pay was ok and always in time ... towards the end, my staff pay is still on time except mine is late..  Sale improve and as I mention, it can be better .. but I hold back as we were not able to cater to further increase sales.  There are times we have to reject cargoe and that is no good ..  
              
              I have no problem with direct boss or subordinate .. in fact we are like a family ...  very happy working together and they are willing to stay back without me asking ...  but  ..
              
              The problem is, in Batam, they have to do the second leg of the business which where the major problem arises ..  They cannot meet customer demand and it lead into claims ...  Then they blame me for getting customer that is difficult and causes so much problem for them ...

              <p>These sort of things and pattern are very very common in a 3rd world country. The people are stupid and poor and they probably deserve it. They cannot look far and they just want to cheat money everyday. No use working so hard for the stupid company. Show em the Singapore style. Send lawyer's letter to em. They think this place is as low class as indo huh wake up man. This is Singapore one of the richest country in south east asia.</p>

              If MOM can help, I don't have any problem.  The trouble is, I do not fall into the Employment Act and these blood suckers knew ..  they went down there a few times, therefore, they don't want to pay me.  In all good faith I worked hard.  The result is sad. I swear I won't be working for these people any more.

              <p>I do not know a lot of things and am very sympathetic towards
              your situation, but I have a few things to share.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, we need to do some researching before we join a
              company but even if we done our homework, I don't think we ever be
              able to find the perfect job. There are several red lights before
              you accept a job:</p>
              <p>1. What is the cashflow like? If you worked your first month and
              your first pay is delayed more than a week after that, it is not
              good sign, you should leave.</p>
              <p>2. Do you have access to the profit &amp; loss statement, can
              you see whether the company has been making money for the last 3
              years?</p>
              <p>3. Bonus and increment, make sure the company is a doing well
              pays consistent bonus and increment. Even if its small, at least
              the company is looking after welfare of its employees.</p>
              <p>4. How is the job like? Is it a poison chalice? Why did your
              last predecessor left? Make sure it is a job you like and it is not
              mission impossible job. Make sure you can handle all the shiit pass
              down from your predecessor.</p>
              <p>5. Working hours. Make sure there is a balance. Before
              interview, make sure you tell your interviewer what you looking
              for.</p>
              <p>6. Relationship with boss, direct superior? During interview
              make sure you ask questions and find out what kind of person your
              superior is. This is the only chance to find out if your direct
              superior is good fit with yours. Or ask anybody you know that works
              for this company.</p>
              <p>7. What is the culture of the company? During interview, through
              newspapers, ask friend who formerly work there or currently work
              there and find out what is the culture. Is the culture a good fit
              to your working style?</p>
              <p>8. Location, location and location. Find out that it is not too
              far from where you live, accessible and not one with dreaded future
              postings to places you don't want to go like Sudan.</p>
              <p>9. Salary rate. Like bonus and increment, make sure the company
              offers you what you want. If you take up the job out of
              desperation, chances are, you will feel disatisfied and you have
              difficulty in catching up with your expenses</p>
              <p>10. Relationship with co-workers. If you are an open social
              person, this is not a problem.</p>

              Ya, that the feeling ...  I am also feeling angry that I was being made used of.  Since I had build up a base of customers, they are trying to kick me out and take over my hard work.  But as it is, the moment I left, most if not all of my customer leaves too.  I had not even tell them anything except I was leaving.
              
              I am now asked to help out in another company that deal directly with these Indonesian.  My answer was a straight "NO " ...  once bitten . . ..  ..
