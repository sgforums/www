            <div class='col-md body'>This is a meaningful article of an interview by NTUC Lifestyle writer Ambiga Raju.<br>Let all young girls read and learn from other's mistakes:<br><br><strong>1. Childhood</strong><br><br>I was raised till the age of six by my grandmother and thatÂ’s when my pleasant memories of childhood end. At around seven, my parents took me back to their home because I had to start school. Father had a Â“zhi charÂ” hawker stall and could do with an extra pair of hands.<br><br>I remember serving customers, washing plates and wiping tables after school almost everyday from then on. If I went home earlier, it was to make dinner for my younger siblings. Father was always pushing me to do more for the family. I didnÂ’t have time to play.<br><br>What hurt me more was that nobody in my house talked to me very much. My father and mother were also closer to my younger brother and sister whom they had raised themselves.<br><br>Twice during my primary school years, I ran away from home to my grandmotherÂ’s. My father whacked me when I did it the second time. The stool he used to hit my back caused me great pain, but I kept quiet out of fear. He took me to the stall and shouted at me to continue working. I didnÂ’t dare to tell him then that my spine continued hurting very badly for days. Till today, my spine is not straight and still hurts occasionally.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>2. My First Mistake</strong><br><br>When I was in Sec 2, I met a Malaysian worker who used to frequent our stall. We became friends because he was the first one who showed any interest in me. I sneaked out and met him after school. He was good to me and bought me things. The first time he hugged me, I cried. I felt safe in his arms and didnÂ’t want to let go.<br><br>When he first asked me to have sex, I couldnÂ’t say Â“noÂ”. I didnÂ’t really know what it was about but when he described it to me, I thought it couldnÂ’t be a bad thing to do since he wanted it so much. We went to the flat he shared with his uncle when no one was at home and had sex. That was my first time and there were a few more occasions.<br><br>Six months later, I realized that I had missed my period. I told him about it and he took me to a clinic. I was pregnant.<br><br>Totally terrified at the thought of what my parents would say, I just wanted to erase everything and go back to my old life. My first choice was to abort. I had seen enough movies and that was what people did.<br><br>He tried to talk me out of it and even suggested marriage. In the end, he gave in when he realized that he would get into trouble for making an under-aged girl pregnant and went with me to a hospital to abort the fetus in my ninth week of pregnancy.  After that, he bought me lunch and we never saw each other again.<br><br>The physical trauma of abortion is something I have very little memory of. They had me sedated and I woke up and everything was over, except for a numbing pain in my private parts. But, I remember little things like his uncle paying for the abortion after giving me a dirty look.  I cannot get over those things. It was as if the whole thing was my fault and my fault alone.</div>

They were just happy that I was at the stall.<br><br>ItÂ’s been 15 years since but memories of that day when I aborted my baby have never left me completely.

I always made sure that I did and that was how I avoided getting pregnant again.  When I met the man I eventually married, I was only 19.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>4. Young Mother</strong><br><br>I never really understood what I did until the day I gave birth to my daughter at the age of 21.  When the nurse handed me my baby, my thoughts immediately went to the one I had killed.  That child would have been seven.  Now, sometimes, I look at children and think, my child would have been about this age.  I never talk about it but I pray for forgiveness.<br><br>About two years ago, my husband started having an affair. At first, he tried to hide it from me. Later, he didnÂ’t bother. He brought his mistress home and expected me to make space in our bedroom for her. When I protested, he hit me and that became a habit.  And what was more painful was that he would scold me for being an indecent woman because I had had an abortion years ago.<br><br>I couldnÂ’t take it any more and decided one to just pack up and take my daughter to my fatherÂ’s house.  Though my father nagged me and still scolds me left, right and centre for not keeping my marriage intact, he has given me space under his roof.  I was very sad and confused for a long time, but now I am more clear-headed. My husband has even come to my workplace to verbally abuse me with bad language in front of my colleagues. I just want to forget everything and start a new life.<br><br>I am so sick of people calling me names for what I did when I was 14. If I had known any better, if I had had some guidance, I am sure I would have said Â“noÂ”. I was just too naÃ¯ve then.<br><br>A friend has found me a job in a new place and I want to start life afresh here. My daughter is my responsibility and I cannot be sad for too long. She is upset at my fatherÂ’s nagging. But, I want to finalise the divorce, save some money and buy a small flat for us. Right now we only have each other.<br><br>When she is old enough I will tell her what happened to me. I want her to know about contraception and how she can make sure what happened to me does not happen to her. I donÂ’t think I want to control her sex life. I donÂ’t think I have the right to.<br><br>But, I donÂ’t want her to have a baby when she is not ready for it and I donÂ’t want her to go through the painful process of abortion. When I say abortion is painful, I donÂ’t just mean what doctors do to the body. What it does to a womanÂ’s life is 10 times more painful.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh... I once talked to a 17-year old girl who freely admits that she lost her virginity at age 15 and simply refused to believe that I am still a virgin at age 22. She said that she had lost count of the number of times she has had sex with her boyfriend.<br><br>I asked her, 'What if you get pregnant? What are you going to do?'<br><br>Her reply? 'Abort lah! Just get rid of that thing!'<br><br>I dunno about you guys, but to me, abortion is one step below infanticide. Even then, that 'one step' exists only because I believe that there are some extreme cases where abortion may be permissible (the mother's life is in danger if she carries to term, etc). Even then, I am by no means an authority in this matter, and I may be wrong.<br><br>I am not (and don't intend to) impose my views upon others, but 'that thing' in the girl's womb is ultimately a life. A child. HER child. I don't think she realises how serious the entire issue of abortion is.<br></div>
