Understand that looking good for guys and looking good for girls are different. As long as you don't go and think of putting on make-up or comestics, it's still normal.

Claiming a small penile size and a equally smaller men's dress size is nothing more then a way for your mind to attribute and justify the current confusion of your sexual orientation. In fact, I would even dare say that theres in fact nothing outwardly abnormal with your bodily figure.<br><br>I would advise you to find a practicing shrink immediately and seek professional assistance. This will help you solve the issues at hand with regards to your sexuality and will help boost your self-confidence and esteem in order to pursue meaningful relationships in the future.</div>

Nothing wrong with being metro-sexual and enjoying grooming and shopping. But wearing sequins and donning bling blings will definitely give others the wrong impression. If your idea of sporty is royal purple super short tights and flaming red baby tees, then you need a change of wardrobe.<br><br>It's ok if you don't enjoy soccer or wrestling like the regular joes. Plenty of straight Singaporean men out there who dislike soccer. But since you are straight, you need start looking like you're straight. Sad to say, we live in a largely traditional society. Women usually prefer manly guys, the same way men fall for femininity.<br><br>Spotted some guys who shape their eyebrows, wear make up and heeled black boots with shorts before, you can't blame me for thinking they are gay, women trapped in men's bodies or happily on their way to transsexuality.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
