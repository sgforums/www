"You can have millions of accomplishments, but one single mistake can make people remember you for life in the negative way."<br><br>All you need to do is to stop behaving like in the past. Be patient, and people will eventually see that you have changed for the better. Its very easy to be noticed that u have changed, esp when people spot opportunities for you to dish out all your atrocities, but you didn't. For once, people may think that you simply missed your chance in doing that. For multiple times, people may think that you are starting to change. With behavior that is more acceptable by others, people will also start to see you in a different light. Its difficult to change others perception on you. Even though you dearly wanted tht to happen, but you have no rights to that. Its up to others to decide. So jus be what you think you want to be. Forget about going on better terms or getting the gal as your gf for the time being. Let her notice your change naturally.<br><br>Good luck.</div>

No way on earth is any girl going to accept your past antics. Most girls, anyway.<br><br>The best idea is to just let it be. Let your actions speak the truth that you've indeed changed.
