Right now it sounds like you're just getting dragged along.. and you might be unwittingly be adding to her stress if she constantly has to worry about you.<br><br>Give her more space.  Work out the best plan to stay together.. <strong>be sincere, but don't make her feel obligated by sounding desperate or pleading when you talk to her.</strong>  Don't pressurize her to meet up or call you/take your calls during the exam periods.. Max u should do is SMS once or twice to wish her luck before an exam, etc.. but if u're not sure what's acceptable, ask her.   Give yourselves a deadline for assessing the relationship (an after exam date).<br><br>It can happen, but it depends on how you both handle it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  gd luck.</div>
