If you're doing that, it's the own risk you'll have to take. If she can get hold of the right information it's your own responsibility to do so too. When in doubt, always source for more than 1 information source.<br><br>About your doubts in her... It's your rights. You might or might not be right in your 'guessing', it's up to you...</div>
