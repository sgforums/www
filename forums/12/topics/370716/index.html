              <p>This is a serious case of failed time planning.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If people at the top U's can survive their even more stress studies with even more complication such as living alone at other countries, AND still can manage, why can't you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Social life is zero? Surely you must have some friends taking the same subject combi and is from the same school as you, if they can hang out and still manage their studies, surely they are doing something right and you're not.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>If you want the results, you must work hard for it. There is no other way out.</p>
              <p>I can assure you quite a number of students who did very well studied until as late as 1am in the morning, and still have to wake up at 5am the next day to head to school.</p>
              <p>The most important thing is time management - how you manage your time.</p>
              <p>If you are playing computer/video games for more than an hour a day <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>or</strong></span> watching television for the same amount of time, then I strongly suggest you cut down on all these.</p>
              <p>Many youngsters think it is "correct" to spend this amount of time on gaming and enjoyment, just because everyone else is also doing so, but it is actually supposed to be nothing more than a form of relaxation and enjoyment <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>in your spare time</strong></span>.</p>
              <p>There is also the fact that if you play/watch too much of these stuffs which excite your brain, you will have a harder time in putting your mind and body to rest afterwards.</p>
              <p>Putting these aside, are you having difficulties with your homework and studies? If you are, you could always seek your teachers for help and/or form a study group with your classmates. This way, you will learn easier, rather than to crack your brain for an hour for a single question.</p>

              <p><br>What the HECK!? Why you are so stress over such a small matter?</p>
              <p>[feel like being evil today]</p>
              <p>I dont understand why you are so stress over such as simple O level certification process. Have you not learnt anything since Sec 3. Or have you been sleeping since Sec 3. If you do your sec 3 well, for the O level you are already 75% completed. That is 75% of the O level cert is from Sec 3 work. It is already an A1 if you get 75 marks. What more do you want? </p>
              <p>Sec 4 is only the remaining 25% of the O level syllabus. Plus the revision NOW.</p>
              <p>Last time, when I was taking my O level, I only study during studied hours, that is during school hours. Never go for remedial, Cannot be bothered about it . After school hours, is my own time, basketball, computer games, my CCA. And I never studied my O level during Sat and Sun (Already reading/studying for A level year 2 now at your time), now. And in fact during August, Sept, Oct. I already let go and not studying anymore.  I have already completed looking through the O level syallbus since sec 2 and only left the memorizing. I aimed at that time is to top the school. Yours is only passing O level so why you are so stress and complaining about this small little things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Art &lt;-- this is something that really take up a lot of time. This subject was offered to me as an EXTRA EXTRA subject it is lucky that I did not take up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>If you have been lazy and sleeping through your Sec 3 and Sec 4 (sem 1) then it is high time you wake up and see which assessment book you have not finished doing. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>PLAN YOUR TIME WELL. </strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong><strong><br></strong><strong>STUDY THOSE YOU HAVE MISSED OUT. DO NOT GO OVER AND OVER ON THINGS YOU ARLEADY KNOW. DONT WASTE TIME.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>DO WHAT EVER ASSESSMENT BOOK YOU CAN FIND. ONCE YOU GET THE CORRECT ANSWER. YOU ALREADY MASTERED THE CONCEPT. </strong></p>
              <p><strong>DO NOT MEMORIZE. UNDERSTAND THROUGHLY GAINED ENLIGHTENMENT ON THE CONCEPTS.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>GO BEYOND THE O LEVEL SYALLBUS TO KEEP YOU TO UNDERSTAND. </strong>something when things are over simplified it is very hard to understand, because there are missing facts or illogical.</p>
              <p><strong>GO THROUGH THE O LEVEL Syallbus and tick the items you know and missed.</strong></p>
