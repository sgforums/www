            <div class='col-md body'>I think your moves to try and show your care and concern for her, has intimidated her... You mean you did all that in the last four days? No wonder she feels weird about you...<br><br>I am not trying to make you feel bad over yourself for overdoing matters... I know how much you love her, but somehow... you should try to step back a little, as you may have intruded into some area of her life and she is not really liking that intrusion of yours.<br><br>My suggestion to you now, is to apologize to her... if you were stalking her around school, apologize! If you were making her feel uneasy by popping out at times she wishes to be with her friends or to be alone, apologize! Most importantly now, is to make it up to her and be her friend again... Let's not talk about any love relationship for now, okay? Almost 90% of all relationships being established in Secondary School students usually resort in break-ups, because both party are just not ready yet... wait til your hormones become a little more stable when you reach adulthood before you consider having a girlfriend...<br><br>Have to correct you at one point... when you said that you remained single for her, because you love her... does not seem very appropriate. For your information, please do not copy that cliche from some romantic stories you see on television... the only time someone says that when it comes to real life (not reel life) is when a middle-aged man comes to his childhood beloved and says this line to her... It does not apply to your case!<br><br>Face it, you are still a schoolboy, in your Secondary School... you are very young! What made you think that you sacrificed a part of your life - just waiting for her? Oh come on! You have a whole life out there waiting for you! Who knows? You may even meet someone more special than Edlyn in future when you are out in the workforce?<br><br>You are beginning to feel very desperate about this issue, please learn to control the emotions of yours from over-raging... This infatuation is becoming more and more like an obsession... Just my word of caution: As a student, do not let this obsession cost you your exam results! You are probably in your stage of puberty, it is NORMAL for you to feel this way... Your hormones are now raging, as you start to change from a boy to a man... Take your sexuality education lessons seriously and learn from it!<br><br>I know that it is very sad to give up on your first love just like that! Believe me, I was in the same shoes as you before... We seem a lot in common, I did as such for my first love once in my Secondary School years but too bad she did not appreciated it. Dear brother, do not feel depressed or saddened by such a situation. Your care and concern for her, is really admirable for your age... Take it in good heart, even if she rejects you... and please do not do anything foolish or let it not affect your studies.<br><br>It is a process in life that you will need to go through... so take it easy...<br><br>NOTE: FOR NOW, PLEASE REFRAIN FROM HEARING ALL LOVE SONGS, BREAK-UP SONGS... THEY WILL MAKE YOU FEEL WORSE UNTIL YOU COME TO YOUR SENSES... I nearly took my life when I cried day and night on that same love song I heard everyday after the day she rejected me. Please avoid! Please follow this piece of advice!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Do not feel too sad alright? Message me to "My Mailbox" if you need any additional help from me or if you still don't quite understand the difference between love and raging hormones... See you! Just be ordinary friends for now... Okay, brother? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
