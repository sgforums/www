The "Let-the-world-know-I-like-her" thing u are doing is really something only actors will do in drama serials. In real life, often it doesn't work, especially if u are a sec school student.<br><br>Have u asked urself why she is scared of you? It could have been ur actions came out of the blue. She probably don't know that u have a crush on her, and think its weird that a "stranger" is doing all these for her. Besides, at the age u are in, I doubt she really knows whats a crush anyway.<br><br>Just continue to be friends with her. Talk to her like u would with other guy friends(of course lah, don't add vulgarities). Know her better before u decide if she's really the gal u like and chase her. Unlike other forumers, I wouldn't advise u to concentrate on ur studies, because I believe u are mature enough to know that studies are for ur future, regardless of what age u are in now.</div>
