She is giving the message that she does not want u to continue to pursue her and would prefer u to back off. So u should just act cool, as if nothing has happened.

While youÂ’re doing this, you are just displaying the negative side of you..<br><br>You are just so selfish. thinking about you yourself and not protecting the identity of the other person. at least have the decency of respecting other people's privacy alright?<br><br>it's so in-considerate..<br><br>although you say u love her. to me. thatÂ’s only 1-sided...<br><br>and that's puppy love. which you will get over very soon..<br><br>when you post gal's name online. you are not showing people respect. for this very reason...you don't even know what you should and should not do. and to think you still can ask what girls think of your story if they will be touched..<br><br>u can love her no problem. but don't expect the other half to love you. because it's something which can't be FORCED..<br><br>you can't beg a person to come to you. <span style="color: red;">love isn't charity.</span>.<br><br>don't pin too much expectations. the higher you wish. the lower you will fall should u meet with objections..<br><br>u have better go speak to someone who have more experience in BGR or perhaps some adults...because if you continue this way in doing what you in when it comes to BGR, I will not rule out the possibility of you hurting other gals when you're much older..<br><br>Now you already did something wrong. Correct on your mistake. DonÂ’t hurt other gals around you...<br><br>Note: When I say Hurt; it doesn't only applies to physically, but only mentally, visually and verbally..<br><br></div>
