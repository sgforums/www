Don't talk about love this love that - ai qin bu nen dang fan chi, true love needs wisdom - many people lacks, but through experience, they gain it. If you talking about experience here and learning of lessons - if you still go back to him, you have zero right to say say 'ITS so HARD to TRUST guys because the first law in love is....<br><br>'Its you who chooses your partner not your partner chooses you.'<br><br>If you doesn't want - he can't do anything regardless what he did and since you never learn your lessons - he knows your weakness and exploit it, you are always going around a cycle. Don't think about 'I love him alot' kind of thingy because thats your weakness - think about 'I believe that I can find someone eventually that will treasure me instead of using me as a security after having fun with other woman' <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You said you don't know when is the truth, when is not - you are feeling insecured and there is little trust in this relation, which just further warn you that you should'nt stick with his guy - and you NEVER heed. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Is love in its purest form is actually very simple - but in reality this is far from truth. By itself before it gets break down into its purest form - it is hell of a complicated. People with love wisdom will see through many love scheme people uses regardless whether it happens on others, or on yourself. Always heed what your womanly INSTINCT tells you and don't overly reply on your emotions because woman's emotions is untrustable. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>In love - its is survival of the fittess - those with wisdom will survive, those without will go through learning cycle that they never learn.

You are happy because at the point of time when he is trying to patch you up - definitely he will re-woo you again - he will be like the good old last time guy (the beginning stage), this brings back happy moments, you will feel happy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I am not the one that go through this, but there is one thing for sure - feelings is only one part of the pictures (because it is always the feelings that retains you), but ultimately, are you delay the inevitable? Or because you let yourself fall back into history (your bf KNOWS this point about you thats why he always repeat his act)? Nobody says feelings is easy to let go - its not - but willingness to try to release yourself from this chains of depression is the first step. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Think about this - if he really did repent, why not be the first time you both patch? Why not the second? And why not the third? If he is really treasuring this relation - what problems would be so major that you both have to go on separate ways? Most problems are solvable if BOTH parties wants to - not saying that you are not doing anything - perhaps you are doing everything, but it needs two the clap. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>This relation already lacks the *must-have* - trust. Even if you were to go back to him for the fourth time, fifth, etc, would be still the be same? No... (you know it deep inside). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I think I expressed wrongly - every relation is a venture (like doing something you never did before). You have to understand yourself very well, what you actually want, and stuff, before committing because with a strong foundation in mental principles - problems are just more like a breezing wind. This wisdom and the woman's inner voice is like a page messenger - it brings message, warning, etc to you, who will eventually make the decision. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I could see you have been listening to your emotions all these while - its not right nor wrong (correct), but if it is message is effective, you wouldn't be posting it your problems here because you would be much happier now. I am gald to hear that you never take relationship for granted, which seemed to me that this past relation hasn't bring you down - instead it builds you up. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>You have already made a decision yourself - to be friends. My post is not to make decision for you - you have already done it, but all I am doing is to let you know things from another point of view. All this while you have been listening to pure feelings - try for a moment to look at my words and see if it makes any point. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>One warning is that when you both remain as friends, be weary and cautious about it - because you will never be sure of yourself whether you just really wanna remain as friend, or it's another beginning steps of your cycle agan. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Prays</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>star princess,<br><br>I hate to admit this but had to that there are really some guys out there who are just not worth you to wait or give chance to. Because they knew once they had enough fun for now outside with others gals, they can easily come back to you because they know they had the ability to sweet talk you into doing it. Been hurts once is more than enough. Try to protect yourself from people like him. I had a friend gal friend who are in the same stituation like you and she just don't seem to be able to get out of it. I even remember reading a story of a gal in your stituation and she eventually end up killing herself. So it is not worth. Those guys only love themselves more anyone else if not they will know that they need to be considerate about others feeling before doing anything thats hurts.<br><br>BrenBren</div>
