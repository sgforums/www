            <div class='col-md body'>Words...<br>It's good to say things out... But words is not a best way to convey <strong>feelings</strong>.<br><br>Ok, both of you have taken the first to tell each other your problems. That's really good. But does that help to cure the problem?<br><br>I feel, it doesn't help at all. It doesn't.<br><br>Find a close friend between you both. Someone you both can trust. Talk to him/her and convey the how you feel to each other.<br><br>It's not both of your love has died down. It's both have met a barrier. A barrier that can be overcome through communication and compromise.<br><br><strong>Feel to love.</strong><br><br>Please cherish what you both have now... How many people in this world hate and regret themselves for not cherishing...<br><br>There are no right or wrong in a relationship.<br><br>To independent girl : It seems that you are the "right" in this problem. I have no comments to say for you. I feel about what i read. I don't really understand how both of you are feeling.<br><br>To biskiti82 : Don't say you don't have a life. I feel you choose not to have a life. You can continue to do what you normally do for independent girl. Life is miserable? It's your attitude towards life. <strong>Change it.</strong><br><br>Biskiti82, be happy towards life. Have a  <strong>Positive Attitude</strong>. We are your friends, you can ask us to come out, have a chat, kopi, watch movie or whatever. <strong>You are not alone</strong>.<br><br>I think if i did not see wrongly, nike has this commercial : Impossible is a small word used by small men.........<br><br><strong>Nothing is impossible, it just whether you want to do it or not.</strong><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi biskiti82,<br>i think u have abt the same problem as mine.(see my topic: overseas relationship) we expect our partnerto spend time with us whenever posssible. but for my case is a bit further. we are married.<br>i've realised my mistake after i came to uk. i had to learn how to "let go" i guess i "control" my wife much more than u. so i think both of u can still work things out. do not jump into conclusion. if need to know anything.. ask. not demand! trust me.. if both of u still have love for each other. work things out; peacefully. dun be like me.. regreting here alone in uk. imagine what would u do if u were far away too. helpless right? so learn to "let go" now..i see relationship as flying a kite. occasionally letting go to let it fly higher.. happier. both party will enjoy the relationship.<br>it's good that both of u realised this before it's too late. like for my case. weeping alone without anyone to lean on..<br>never live to regret. do what u think is good for both.<br>best of luck. wish u both happiness.</div>
