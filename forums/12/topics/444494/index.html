              its not really a big "problem" compared to what others are facing, but I would just like to get some sensible advice from other forumers
              
              I hang out with my bunch of friends and there's this guy, a mutual friend of ours. and it just happens that 2 of us share a common interest in something that is quite obscure and not well known in SG.
              
              somehow that started a "you two should get together" thing. it was just a joke my friends started. i dont know how it spread but a few days later someone actually walked up to me to ask me about it. (I just changed the topic and quickly ran off. haha. )
              
              *Any suggestions on how I shld reply to other such questions in the future?
              
              Â I think one of the worst thing to do is to lead the other party on. at the same time it would be presumptuous to "reject" the situation.. because the guy is probably not interested. and besides who am i to turn other ppl down?
              
              but, as what many ppl have said before, im still schooling and studies are definitely on the top of my priorities, especially since I'm not doing very well :/ sighs.
              
              *also, some advice on how I shld act/conduct myself would be good too.Â 
              
              I would really like to stay friends, without giving anyone the wrong impressions.Â 
              
              thanks for bearing with me and reading this long thing :D

              <p>when someone tease you on it - just put it clearly - "One person into this is bad enough, if two person together = cannot,  will end up fighting " say this out loudly to everyone to everyone each time. Then they will get the picture.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">What does "it" refers to? as in u and the other guy get together?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">U shld have ur own stand and opinion... If u do not wish to consider, then simply respond by "We're just friends" or something like tat...</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #0000ff;">If u are considering then give an open ended answer like "maybe, see how" etc...</span></p>
