              <p>You are the Master of your own destiny. Your future is based on what you plan today.</p>
              <p>You don't even need a job to earn enough money in this age. I simply do not believe in paper qualification as most people tend to think that with high qualification, you will definately will have higher income.</p>
              <p>This is the information age, not the industrial age. Money is a form of an idea, a value attribute over a physical item.</p>
              <p>Why torture yourself by going to school to get higher paper qualification? I truly understand that knowledge and education are important. But it simply does not equate to high stable income jobs. When you have a job, you are selling your soul in terms of time to the company and bosses you work for.</p>
              <p>Probably, you won't get my meaning here. I can advise and suggest you to think differently and have different kind of mindset and context than those majority of people do.</p>

              <p>you should force on your studies. You can try to sign up for a school who help drop outs or people who failed their O levels. One example of this is chec. I have about 5 friends in this school. My friends used to be really playful in secondary school, smoking, skipping class and cheating in exams. It's not that their bad kids, it's because they wanna have fun (:</p>
              <p>Maybe by signing up for this school, it can help you obtain an O level cert, because if you think about it, singapore only emphasizes on certs. Yes, they may claim they wanna be a sporting hub, artistcally inclinded..... but it all boils down to education one way or another. I feel you should carry on studying (:</p>
              <p>As for the job part, just be more careful and less nervous. Try to get along with your workmates and bosses. Also, if there is nothing to do, ask your boss if he needs something to be done. Showing initiative is a sure way to go! All the best!</p>

When I probe him, he told me that I was slow in reaction &amp; It seems we always have some kind of miscommunication with him! I swear I was at the best behaviour in this job! This job, I swear, he didn't even know my chronic odd habits yet...but I guess my minor retardedness gave it away...</p>
