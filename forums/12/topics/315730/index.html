              <p>I think you should just get enrolled into ITE, learn some skills and work. It's better that way. btw how bad was your Os results? no offence..</p>
              <p>it's no use crying now.. it's more important you find what you like and get trained in it. once you got a skill, at least you'll be confident enough to handle anything to do with it.</p>

              <p>no lah, when you first go out to work, it's like that one......first time mah, sure get lots of scolding and crap.</p>
              <p>i was pretty much like you previously 2 - 3 years ago and quit tons of jobs less than 1 week of working. BBB can testify to that.</p>
              <p>once you get the hang of it, then it will be much smoother cos' u know how the game is played. i got a shock for myself also.....work very different from school.</p>
              <p>best is to get a data-entry job if you can.</p>
              <p>simple one....mainly just enter data and do routine chores.....can also find some temp contract work while you study......i suggest find those light simple mundane jobs so you won't be tired when you study.</p>
              <p>and u must make effort to groom yourself and look yourself, don't be afraid to ask questions if you've doubts.</p>
              <p>try to avoid retail jobs....these jobs are really not for humans. find an office job, because that's the kinda thing you'll be doing when u graduate, right?</p>
              <p>can also go find job agent.</p>

              <p>Based on your above posting, i think you have a decent intelligence. Well i think  you are not stupid, maybe your actions and attitude wasn't well-received. Everyone did some stupid things more than once in a life time. Reflect and learn so that you can become a better person. Meanwhile, find out what you are cut out for, work on your strength. Have you thought of retaking your o'level or take up some courses that will make you employable ?</p>

              <p>oei brother.</p>
              <p>the traditional mindset for singaporeans would mean getting a nice job at an office, but since you never did got through O' Lvls, maybe ur just not cut out for it, THAT DEFINATELY DOESN'T MEAN UR STUPID!!! look at it that ur just special as compared to other people.</p>
              <p>what is ur financial situation in your family now? do u need to urgently support ur parents? if not...take some time off, learn a skill. ask urself what do u like besides an office job. do u like music? wana be a small time musician? or do u like arts? u can go into an art school and see whether ur more suited for it. or are u good at fixing things, look into the engineering sector and see where ur talents lie.</p>
              <p>what matters is...DON'T EVER GIVE UP! life is not a walk in a park, especially so in singapore. find a field that ur interested in and where you can excel in it.</p>
