              <p>When I was fresh out of my failed O levels yr, I tried my hands
              in retail &amp; was booted out the next day because the people over
              there thought I was too nervous, quiet &amp; ugly.</p>
              <p>When I was 19, my friend introduced me a job at an office &amp;
              well, the boss didn't like me at all, so he made me sit in a lousy
              desk &amp; kept verbally abusing me everytime I did something wrong
              &amp; kept emphasizing it. I endured for some time &amp; decided to
              job hop.</p>
              <p>3 mths before this day, I found a good job at a japanese coy but
              I got forced resign because I was behaving badly &amp; I made a
              huge mistake in my work.</p>
              <p>After that, I found another job &amp; it didn't turn out well
              too...the manager actually put up an ad by the third day I came to
              work &amp; a few days later, I found out that he is looking for
              replacement for my position. When I probe him, he told me that I
              was slow in reaction &amp; It seems we always have some kind of
              miscommunication with him! I swear I was at the best behaviour in
              this job! This job, I swear, he didn't even know my chronic odd
              habits yet...but I guess my minor retardedness gave it away...</p>
              <p>Now? I am jobless &amp; looking for a job, but it's not so easy
              as many ppl just dun like me at first sight. I only have a failed
              O's cert with me right now..I've been trying for O's for like 3 yrs
              &amp; I can't seem to study properly...</p>
              <p>What SHould I do??? I can't believe it...I always thought I've
              change..but I realised that perhaps I am born stupid?</p>

              <p>You sound exactly like a friend of mine. Hey you've just got to find out what you're really good at and work very hard at it. When you're sure, you'll gain confidence at work. In time things become easier.</p>
