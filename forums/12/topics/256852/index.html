            <div class='col-md body'>Just writing in here hoping to feel better after pouring it out.<br><br>A little less than 2 years ago, I chanced upon Mr G through a shared project at work. Though there were no sparks and we hardly made conversation initially, one encounter probably initiated what carried on and happened the next 2 years. Things began rather strangely, I've never looked upon him as someone who might be my type. He is older and the sort who communicated more with mandarin and dialect, I am younger, and what you would call, the "ang moh type."<br><br>I was going through a difficult period of my life back then, having to cope with family and financial difficulties plus looking after my then bed ridden father who was passing from terminal cancer. That was when I started going out with Mr G.<br><br>I have no clear idea why I enjoyed going out with him, it was probably the annonymity of being with a person who didn't understand me or was very far apart from the realities of life that were hanging over me... I considered our dates momentary escapism. For a few hours each time, I left everything behind and went around a Mr G I didn't care for. He didn't care for me. And I found myself lured to this company. It was easy. There were no heavy discussions about life and problems, just conversation about the simpler things and some laughter.<br><br>A month or so later, we slept together. A few months later, my father passed. And Mr G left for work overseas. I have no idea really what things meant back then but I assumed it was over. My problems were over. And Mr G was gone. And so the affair ended.<br><br>Between the 3 months we dated and slept together, the relationship between us was a push and pull. I suppose. Initially, I'd been nicer. Sometimes asking him out for a movie but he didn't sound interested so I assumed we are hanging around each other for the sex. Soon afterwards he began calling me in the after noons, sometimes everyday, sometimes making a meal, sometimes wishing I stayed over and sometimes wanting to go out the same day even after we parted. Then he left. But found me a job with him overseas. I chose not to join him. And left traveling by myself. I didn't know why he wanted me to join him back then. The cynical side of me imagined he wanted a free bed partner and he wanted my company due to the loneliness overseas. When he called me during my backpacking days and asked why I couldn't seem to share the adventurous things I did with him, the better part of me believed he had feelings. Nothing happened in the end. He came back to Singapore. And so did I. And we carried on. We borrow our company; an occasional visit or drink. Momentarily leaving the realities of our separate lives behind and simply laughing about unimportant things.<br><br>We carried on behaving like friends in public. Other times intimate in private. Things were complicated because we ran in the similar public circles. Even after a year of sleeping with each other repeatedly every week, he was nervous, sometimes shy when we are out together. In private, he drank a lot. We bumped into each other at work and were formally introduced as colleagues. The irony of being asked if we knew each other before hand at the office when a few days before the introduction we'd been fucking each other's brains out was a little too dramatic for me to handle. Not knowing how to behave around him at work, I threw in the towel and left before the project began.<br><br>I left traveling again. The new year passed. I had no idea exactly what I was running from. I probably liked Mr G a plenty but had no idea how to reconciliate my liking with all that has happened. The same thing happened. He was alright, sometimes offering to pick me up or send me off, other times calling and saying he misses me. I came back. We started again. After a year of being strangers, he suddenly held my hand one time. I had no idea what that meant but he was quiet when he did it and so was I. We did nothing but slept with each other. Often nothing was being said since I told him he doesn't have to feel obliged to make conversation after sex if he didnt want to.<br><br>Because nothing was being said, I rarely knew what Mr G feels most of the time. Only recently after I came back from a last trip, he was often quieter but doting. Many times holding me very tightly throughout the night until I fell asleep. Other times he would sleep away on a couch, quiet, by himself old music humming in the background.<br><br>I realise at times that Mr G, is ultimately a loner at his best, solo from the view he loves. His private, desolate appeal was probably what kept me going back. Or perhaps it was the night, and a city in deep slumber that rustles a certain lonely quality, elusive and hollow, that brought me back to the same circle again and again. Sleeplessness from working erratic hours and probably loneliness. The need for closeness. Physical intimacy. I have no idea.<br><br>I don't know if he has anyone else in another country or if we were nothing. The pleasures of having experienced whatever encounter we had, was always deterred by spontaneous dates with others. When I would drive out into the same kind of night, with another someone, in search of filling the void left behind by Mr G whenever he wasn't around. I am beyond wanting relationships. Or the fun filled conventions of being in one. It tires me. It is exhausting. I have seen friends going through disappointments and anguish all for nothing in the end. And I do not want to go through it again. I have nothing to offer in a relationship neither do I know how to behave in one.<br><br>I don't know why I do it if Mr G meant anything at all. I'm not expecting him to consider anything serious with me because I am probably not worth his time. The last time we were out, he took my phone and saw the messages from my previous date. He didn't say anything. If he called and I was out with friends, he would coolly tell me to go keep my friend company. But continue sending me messages till I was home. He never asked me out on Valentines. Just wishing me happy valentines day the day before and sends me messages asking if I was home on Valentines.<br><br>Today he is back overseas. There wasn't difficult leaving and he'd given me the news after he arrived over there though I knew he was making a trip for work.<br><br>A few weeks before, I'd asked him what this was all about. He told me we are more than close and he wanted to mean something to me. But couldn't ask me for more because I do not want a relationship. He'd said the same thing a year ago, that he didn't want a relationship. (That is man speak for not wanting a relationship with me. I understand.)<br><br>And he asked why I never seemed to call him. That he wanted surprises. He was right about that. I never once called him or initiated contact throughout the time we spent together. Even if I were to cancel on him last minute, he had no temper. Just wishing me goodnight and to enjoy my evening, have my fun. It felt like I meant nothing to him because he was so unaffected. Afterwards he said there was nothing he could do because he isn't the type of person to keep pestering me if I didn't want to go out.<br><br>So now he is away. And I have no idea what would happen next. Probably a looming knowing this has finally ended. The last time we met, for the first time in my entire life, I'd been left alone on the bed while he slept on his couch. Afterwards ignoring me when I said goodbye. I'm not blaming anybody much less him. For a woman who has closed his doors repeatedly, I probably deserved it.<br><br>We will probably come and go in each otherÂ’s lives without warning. These intermittent encounters will continue leaving me with a hint of longing until the day I stop seeing him.<br><br>Just wondering what any of you would've done if you were in my shoes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in my humble opinion, Mr G is taking the passive approach towards love. he himself must be quite uncertain of how u feel towards him too, thus the on and off pulling effect.<br><br>if u truly love him and believe he would be the one sharing your goals and ambitions, u should confess to him and stop waiting for him in agony, thinking abt wad he'll do next. even if u face rejection, u shld be glad that u can finally pull ur horses and stop seeing him.</div>

Miss G to Mr G and me to you? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) is important to what do I want. Can I make a relationship out of this 'on and off' case? Where does she stand in my heart? Mere sex partner? Or potential mate? What do I see in her? Should I get to her? Or I wait and see what happens? Maybe another person comes into the frame?<br><br>I will make an effort to give both of us a chance to see if this relationship could blossom. Of course I will ask for her view on this. An open discussion can help me garner some points to note. Like why is she so 'solo' or independant to me? What is her lifestyle like considering she goes overseas alot? What are the attributes that attracted me to her, if any? Would she consider a relationship with me if possible?<br><br>I noticed that you cannot seem to let him go or consider any other relationship until he is totally gone from your life. You have some attraction towards him and likewise. Which is all the more I am reinforcing my stand in 'thrashing' it out with the person, in your shoes.<br><br>I hope through my 'analogy' (if there is any...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  ), you can see some points worth considering. You are a strong and rather independant woman, so I believe whatever you have decided would probably mean the best in both of yours and his interests.<br><br>Beers! (Its a counter to the usual phrase 'cheers')<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

IÂ’ve been thinking a lot about your post today.<br><br>I feel that to a certain extent, you chose the easiest way out by running away from the problem. ItÂ’s ok to take the most convenient way out but when he calls again, he will probably leave you as confused as ever.<br><br>Â“Does he have someone else in another country?Â”<br><br>Â“Why does he keep leaving and coming back?Â”<br><br>Â“He comes back when he wants sex, he leaves when he feels IÂ’m not good enough for him?Â”<br><br>I donÂ’t want to sound gay but I think I understand him from the emotional aspect.<br><br>G is a cautious and serious person by nature. He doesnÂ’t have a lot of real friends around him. Like what you said, he is more like a loner.<br><br>But at the end of the day, he desperately needs to find a balance somewhere.<br><br>Then he met you.<br><br>You who can make him forget the commitments he impose on himself and simply indulge in a carefree lifestyle.<br><br>He looked at the exciting adventures you experienced every time you travel.<br><br>He asked himself, Â“Why canÂ’t I be like her?!Â”<br><br>You are complete opposite of him.<br><br>You are the perfect balance for him.<br><br>That is why he kept leaving and coming backÂ…he needs you but he donÂ’t believe he can live in your world.<br><br>Your attraction to him works on the same principle.<br><br>His aloofness and seriousness attracts youÂ…and repels you.<br><br>At the end of the day, Cupid played a cruel game that left both him and you confused and bewildered and unsure whether to proceed.<br><br>ItÂ’s not all doom and gloom. If both of you are willing to teach and be receptive of what the other party can offer.<br><br>In each other, you will see reflections of what you like to improve on in your lives.<br><br>You can teach him how to kick up his heels and live for the moment<br><br>He can offer some stability that you eventually will like.<br><br>I think you should take a breather right now and clear your thoughts. DonÂ’t make a rash decision when you are feeling confused.<br><br>But at the end of the day, donÂ’t escape. Make a choice and be truly happy with it.<br><br>Goodbye.<br></div>
