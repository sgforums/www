            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jackdaniels:</div><div class="quote_body">Just writing in here hoping to feel better after pouring it out.<br><br>A little less than 2 years ago, I chanced upon Mr G through a shared project at work. Though there were no sparks and we hardly made conversation initially, one encounter probably initiated what carried on and happened the next 2 years. Things began rather strangely, I've never looked upon him as someone who might be my type. He is older and the sort who communicated more with mandarin and dialect, I am younger, and what you would call, the "ang moh type." (Edited... too long)<br><br>We carried on behaving like friends in public. Other times intimate in private. Things were complicated because we ran in the similar public circles. Even after a year of sleeping with each other repeatedly every week, he was nervous, sometimes shy when we are out together. In private, he drank a lot. We bumped into each other at work and were formally introduced as colleagues. The irony of being asked if we knew each other before hand at the office when a few days before the introduction we'd been fucking each other's brains out was a little too dramatic for me to handle. Not knowing how to behave around him at work, I threw in the towel and left before the project began.<br><br>I left traveling again. The new year passed. I had no idea exactly what I was running from. I probably liked Mr G a plenty but had no idea how to reconciliate my liking with all that has happened. The same thing happened. He was alright, sometimes offering to pick me up or send me off, other times calling and saying he misses me. I came back. We started again. After a year of being strangers, he suddenly held my hand one time. I had no idea what that meant but he was quiet when he did it and so was I. We did nothing but slept with each other. Often nothing was being said since I told him he doesn't have to feel obliged to make conversation after sex if he didnt want to.<br><br>Because nothing was being said, I rarely knew what Mr G feels most of the time. Only recently after I came back from a last trip, he was often quieter but doting. Many times holding me very tightly throughout the night until I fell asleep. Other times he would sleep away on a couch, quiet, by himself old music humming in the background.<br><br>I realise at times that Mr G, is ultimately a loner at his best, solo from the view he loves. His private, desolate appeal was probably what kept me going back. Or perhaps it was the night, and a city in deep slumber that rustles a certain lonely quality, elusive and hollow, that brought me back to the same circle again and again. Sleeplessness from working erratic hours and probably loneliness. The need for closeness. Physical intimacy. I have no idea.<br><br>I don't know if he has anyone else in another country or if we were nothing. The pleasures of having experienced whatever encounter we had, was always deterred by spontaneous dates with others. When I would drive out into the same kind of night, with another someone, in search of filling the void left behind by Mr G whenever he wasn't around. I am beyond wanting relationships. Or the fun filled conventions of being in one. It tires me. It is exhausting. I have seen friends going through disappointments and anguish all for nothing in the end. And I do not want to go through it again. I have nothing to offer in a relationship neither do I know how to behave in one.<br><br>I don't know why I do it if Mr G meant anything at all. I'm not expecting him to consider anything serious with me because I am probably not worth his time. The last time we were out, he took my phone and saw the messages from my previous date. He didn't say anything. If he called and I was out with friends, he would coolly tell me to go keep my friend company. But continue sending me messages till I was home. He never asked me out on Valentines. Just wishing me happy valentines day the day before and sends me messages asking if I was home on Valentines.<br><br>Today he is back overseas. There wasn't difficult leaving and he'd given me the news after he arrived over there though I knew he was making a trip for work.<br><br>A few weeks before, I'd asked him what this was all about. He told me we are more than close and he wanted to mean something to me. But couldn't ask me for more because I do not want a relationship. He'd said the same thing a year ago, that he didn't want a relationship. (That is man speak for not wanting a relationship with me. I understand.)<br><br>And he asked why I never seemed to call him. That he wanted surprises. He was right about that. I never once called him or initiated contact throughout the time we spent together. Even if I were to cancel on him last minute, he had no temper. Just wishing me goodnight and to enjoy my evening, have my fun. It felt like I meant nothing to him because he was so unaffected. Afterwards he said there was nothing he could do because he isn't the type of person to keep pestering me if I didn't want to go out.<br><br>So now he is away. And I have no idea what would happen next. Probably a looming knowing this has finally ended. The last time we met, for the first time in my entire life, I'd been left alone on the bed while he slept on his couch. Afterwards ignoring me when I said goodbye. I'm not blaming anybody much less him. For a woman who has closed his doors repeatedly, I probably deserved it.<br><br>We will probably come and go in each otherÂ’s lives without warning. These intermittent encounters will continue leaving me with a hint of longing until the day I stop seeing him.<br><br>Just wondering what any of you would've done if you were in my shoes. </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You wondered how illogical this situation has evolved into as you gazed through every aspect of this perplexing equation, trying to resolve it with your own means. Then you realised that there seemed to be several ways of 'solving' your quagmire and you took a couple of different approaches, but eventually, no matter how different those working steps you tried time and again, it brings you back to square one - same answer.<br><br>Therefore, the real question: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Is there something wrong with the working steps? Or does the issue lies with the equation</strong></span>?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Two people, though shrouded by similar fear of commitment, would still have their own inner needs. This need is real and like an unstable molecule, it will seek another molecule to bond and achieve stability. A relationship is still a possible option even if sex is introduced before a relationship (likely, you probably might actually have a couple of short-term flings born out of such context), but there's this subconscious aversion to commitment as a whole. Somehow, it's seemed better to remain aloof and to keep a considerable emotional distance as the both of you 'unanimously and tacitly agreed' on this a classic sex-buddy relationship.<br><br>I agree with CuriousOrange as he may begin to view you more than a sex buddy, but imho, like yourself, he finds it arduous to abnegate current status quo and introduce the dreaded 'commitment thingy'. Because I bet he knows that once he brings this relationship to the next level, he will risk losing everything. Possibly even the sex buddy relationship.<br><br>Why would anyone encumber themselves with additional responsibilites while enjoying the same rewards? Crudely put - he could milk all the sex he needs from you without actually having to 'pay the price' of maintaining a relationship. Therefore, it makes no economical sense to execute such decision.<br><br>Perhaps, it could be same for you too?<br><br>Spiritually barren and yearning for deeper companionship, but unwilling to sacrifice individualism and selfishness - running in circles with context like 'More than just friends - of course we are - but never a relationship.' There's too much travelling (a Sagittarius's love) and running away... too many avenues for escapist and avoidance behaviour. As such, one would seek for instant gratification when the need arises and vanished before the bill comes - the root of void remains.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>This love model fails before it even started and to continue with a failed model is like having to work out the question with a wrong equation.</strong></span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was watching TV when he suddenly blurted the inevitable statement: Â“ItÂ’s not that I do not want a relationship. Just that right now I want to focus on my career.Â” The confession could be linked to a conversation a few minutes earlier. He asked me to move in with him. I told him it isnÂ’t a viable option for me because I barely have time to wash my own dishes, much less make myself useful around his place. Now we all know when somebody tells you that, it isnÂ’t the case of him or her not wanting a relationship. It just means they donÂ’t want a relationship with YOU.<br><br>I didnÂ’t ask for a relationship neither did I hint of wanting one. All I did was watch TV. And thatÂ’s exactly what I should go back doing. Everything else is too much trouble.<br><br>If you believe astrology is more than myth, at times I see more of a Sagittarian in Mr G and the Capricorn in myself. He claims to prefer seeing the world, as for me, seeing too much may not be a good thing. Because I do it alone I come back different each time. Even when you have a story to tell, no one would understand because they werenÂ’t there.<br><br>I go around like a pauper and do overland instead of airplanes. The romanticism of such an act moves people but it stops right there. Few carry the notion further. If you would like to, IÂ’m sure you can do it too. Only material pursuits get in the way. Most people choose cars, clubs and chicks over spending on travel.<br><br>I believe Mr G does view me more than just a sex buddy. He reminded me not to use that term because we were never there. It makes him uncomfortable. ItÂ’s natural for feelings to develop after a period of time.<br><br>But what really matters now is he left without saying good bye.<br><br>And what happened with Mr G last week stank. For the first time in a long time I was left alone on the bed. For the first time at all I was ignored when I said goodbye. I couldÂ’ve yelled, screamed, thrown a hissy fit but that would bring me nowhere. Frankly, it didnÂ’t feel good as a female. I feel used. Mr G probably thinks I am very loose. Easily discarded before re using again. But am I in a position to blame him?<br><br>Was Mr G relieved that the midnight f&amp;%k was gone or was he hollow from being alone again? For someone like me, itÂ’s usually easy getting answers but he has a sombre air about him. So much so I knew better to shut up and leave than push him further. Suddenly I tittered on the high wire of morphing into the exact replica of twenty some things I discarded before. Monster nightmares who didnÂ’t know how to take no for an answer and didnÂ’t understand the rules of one night games. I do not wish to become that way.<br><br>Even as I think about this, whether he is in Singapore or overseas remains a question. All he could tell me today was take good care of myself. What I didnÂ’t understand was, why he needed to do it. Why he had to initiate contact at all. Why not just leave it as it is and not bother me again. Was he feeling sympathetic? Did he think he was being kind? Was he thinking of staying connected so we can go through the same routine if he ever comes back? If I meant nothing why couldnÂ’t we just screw each other and let it be? Why did he have to bring me out on dates, hold my hand, laugh a lot and simply being? Am I reading too much into things? Is this a biological curse? For time immemorial I have all the questions and barely any answers.<br><br>At the end of it all, I am left feeling that the world isnÂ’t nice. Nobody cares if you get stiffed or if your feelings get bruised. Mr G left and I wouldÂ’ve done the same. Beyond telling me to take care there is nothing he can offer. I cannot even perform a satisfying shout out, woman to man, for fear of having it come back at me one day in this line of work. If they say the loving is a battlefield and he went away wounded, then I am left dead.<br><br>I think he wants to play with me. Wants to give me false hope. Wants to see how much IÂ’ll grovel. It's probably wiser not to play this game. Saying goes itÂ’s one thing if you donÂ’t know what to do, but if you know what to do and donÂ’t do it, then youÂ’re double-dumb.<br><br>No use rationalising this.<br>No point in longing for whatÂ’s been left behind.<br>Perhaps I received return for whatever I brought to it.<br><br>Always keep back ups because there will always be another. Always.</div>

Suddenly I tittered on the high wire of morphing into the exact replica of twenty some things I discarded before. Monster nightmares who didnÂ’t know how to take no for an answer and didnÂ’t understand the rules of one night games. I do not wish to become that way.<br><br>Even as I think about this, whether he is in Singapore or overseas remains a question. All he could tell me today was take good care of myself. What I didnÂ’t understand was, why he needed to do it. Why he had to initiate contact at all. Why not just leave it as it is and not bother me again. Was he feeling sympathetic? Did he think he was being kind? Was he thinking of staying connected so we can go through the same routine if he ever comes back? If I meant nothing why couldnÂ’t we just screw each other and let it be? Why did he have to bring me out on dates, hold my hand, laugh a lot and simply being? Am I reading too much into things? Is this a biological curse? For time immemorial I have all the questions and barely any answers.<br><br>At the end of it all, I am left feeling that the world isnÂ’t nice. Nobody cares if you get stiffed or if your feelings get bruised. Mr G left and I wouldÂ’ve done the same. Beyond telling me to take care there is nothing he can offer. I cannot even perform a satisfying shout out, woman to man, for fear of having it come back at me one day in this line of work. If they say the loving is a battlefield and he went away wounded, then I am left dead.<br><br>I think he wants to play with me. Wants to give me false hope. Wants to see how much IÂ’ll grovel. It's probably wiser not to play this game. Saying goes itÂ’s one thing if you donÂ’t know what to do, but if you know what to do and donÂ’t do it, then youÂ’re double-dumb.<br><br>No use rationalising this.<br>No point in longing for whatÂ’s been left behind.<br>Perhaps I received return for whatever I brought to it.<br><br>Always keep back ups because there will always be another. Always. </div></blockquote>Seems like is you who do not want to change anything not Mr G.<br>Why blame him when you should be asking the question yourself?</div>

Beyond those well-articulated words, you painted a phantasmal outlook that has failed to take on substance and conjure a Â‘formÂ’ (a relationship). It remains as hollow as you first uncovered, akin to a maw of blackness, constantly mutating and evolving from some macabre shade of darkness.
