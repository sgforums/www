Age matters in this 'logic'<br>People react to circumstances at different age phrases.<br><br>In these times, rarely were there any huge dramas about cheating and flirting situations from either gender.(At least in my point of view)<br>Each genders have their fair share of dark ugly acts in the closet.<br>To each it's own, to handle and solve when found out.<br><br>Why reaction from Guys are so much different from Girls?<br>There's many answers to it.

            <div class='col-md body'>well, i do understand your frustration in this issue, but may i beg to differ that not all guys do claim that its not their fault to flirt around. Its definately wrong to flirt regardless of what gender you are, but it depends on age group like what MÂ©+square said. My frenz has this mentality that you only live once, n you are only young once, so what waste your youth?? Its a selfish opinion from our pt of view but one has to be selfish to the best of his own interests.  I may be wrong if i say this, but i think perhaps when the person has grown more mature and older, he would eventually get sick n tired of flirting and wants to settle down with his gf. I think people tend to make use of their youth to flirt when they are young. Well, i firmly believe in what comes around goes around. But that doesn't mean your partner wun flirt if you don't. I'm such a victim too but i have since moved on and accepted this fact....</div>

When guys flirt with other girls, they get abused by their gfs as well. So i guess maybe u have over-generalized? It's just plain misfortune to have such a demanding bf who insists on his 'right' to cheat yet at the same time would withhold such 'right' from his gf.<br><br>i'm sure there will be guys who have the same complaint as u lor, those who have gfs who are aggressive, possessive yet flirtateous.<br></div>

Men tends to have a higher 'explorative' nature and especially in sexual gratifications... This is all in the hormones... A more minority of the girls can face such a problem too...
