Looks like you've got the idea of how attraction works, men_@_arms!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </div></blockquote>Really? i doubt it. Attraction is like being in the cold war, u gotta treat the other party nicely but not too nice, and u gotta treat them like dirt once in a while, that is what keeps it going. Kinda like tug of war every now and then. And as a guy u've gotta possess the manly qualities as i have mentioned above and in my seminars.<br><br>But if wat u say is genuine. Then i am glad to have got the idea of attraction at 19, when i see many other men at over 25 still haven got it and are still NICE guys.<br><br>Its ok to be nice, but what is important is not to give the perception of being nice, know wad i mean? i am genuinely nice, we all are, but  there is no such thing as truth.. only perception<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by FeowFeow:</div><div class="quote_body">SEMINAR???????????????????????????<br><br>Do u haf delusions of grandeur??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Unless ur seminar involves 1 talker &amp; 1 listener, &amp; both r the same person? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>*gigglez*<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br></div></blockquote>yup. Coz 1 important item of being attractive to girls is to be full of yourself.<br><br>I am genuinely not full of myself because i suffer from an inferiority complex due to shit in the past.<br><br>But if i want pussy, i gotta be MANLy and attractive and JERKY, so i gotta put up this front of being all ful of myself and all that shit.

Rephrase, do nice guys get it as good and RANDY with girls as much as the jerks do?<br><br>Ok. Yes and No.<br><br>Short run;<br><br>in the early years of female adult-hood, i.e. 15-27 years of age, the female organism undergoes a certain "rite of passage", whereby she is attracted to the attractive guy.<br><br>Such guys make the short-run female feel better about herself in front of her girl-friends, such guys can show the female a better time than the "nerdy dorky guai" guys. Such guys give the female A GREAT TIME. She may occasionaly switch such guys, depending on how JERKY they are and dump her for other girls that are dying to be in the arms of such jerks in their respective short run modes.<br><br>So yeah, the more attractive kind of guys tend to be jerks because it is easier for them to attract girls by simply.. being jerks most of the time, *wink* well.. at least they let their jerk sides show AFTER they ghet the girl dat is..<br><br>This is thanks to American media shows, heavy-metal subculture and other forms of media that emphasize "COOL and HIPNESS" etc etc<br><br>Long run:<br><br>The shortcoming of the attractive guy, is that in the long run, his short run days of smoking, drinking, DRIVING at high speeds etc cost him lots of $, he runs the risk of dying in accidents, becoming a drug addict or getting his liver **** up. Most of the time, attractive guys bounce off from one girl to another until he retires.<br><br>But in the long run, the female usually has had at least 3 or 4 jerks in her "short run" period, she would be pissed off with men in general and may even consider becoming a lesbian. Her long run mode has kicked in, whereby she is more attracted to financial stability, decent gentlemanly-guys who are not sterile yet who can help raise children fruitfully and properly etc. Thus the attractive guy becomes unattractive compared to the formerly unattractive nerdy guy.<br><br>Unattractive nerdy guys, in the long run, usually have better paying jobs, more stability and can even enhance their attractiveness with cybernetic enhancements which they can easily pay for with their $.<br><br>SO it ALL DEPENDS WHAT KIND OF GUY U ARE NOW? AND WHAT KIND OF GUY U WILL BE! AND WHEN UR LONG RUN PERIOD KICKS IN!!<br><br>MUHAHAHA!!<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
