If now got a few million drop into your lap, imagine the difference it can make. Everything in life has a price. And when you put it down to simple maths, getting love without money is difficult.Plus love cannot get you money. You got tons of cash, you can get love. I'm not saying immediately but you got money to "nuture" it yet. Love needs to be nutured too.<br><br>Being a nice poor guy doesn't cut it unless you like fairy tales. Heard the saying that a  jerk with money can have more than one women in their life. Maybe cause they thought the jerk got everything they want, character can slowly change.

            <div class='col-md body'>I suggest if you really want to get out of your sad bachelor lifestyle...start getting some books on romance/dating. Alternatively, do some reading at those websites that offer romance/dating/relationships/women tips. You'll begin to understand why you're still single, and all the assholes are getting the girls. Believe me, there're a great help.<br><br>But all in all, it doesn't help if you just sit on your ass and read. You have to get out there and start interacting with women if you wanna score with them.<br><br>Hope that helps  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

On the contrary they are, u just gotta know how to press her buttons to make her think u are a GOOD guy!<br><br>-----------------<br>Definitions of terms:<br><br>Things that attract girls:<br><br>1. the attractive guy (see Men_@_arms 18 ways to be a man-guide-manual 1st edition)<br>2. Money<br>3. Power<br>4. Looks; muscular chest, firm thighs, hips, buttocks, big biceps, veiny arms/hands. Clear face, rebonded gelled hair, preferably japanese looking etc etc.<br>5.

Can also be defined as period of time of relationship which has become SOUR AND SUCKY.<br><br>Attractive guyattractive guy in the short run)<br>"hot, tall (probably blonde), muscular, vehicle-driving, wake-boarding, soccer-kicking (or some other brute sport), gell-smearing, no-contacts-required, well-dressed (i.e. hottest casual trends), rap-shouting, music-playing, cursing, brash, confident, pompous, insulting/joking/cocky, cigarrette smoking (some only), drinking, regularly-dumping-girlfriending, clubbing etc etc" TYPE of guy.<br><br>Unattractive guy: (less attractive guy in the short run)<br>The more abundant (in sg at least) "Nice guys", nerdy (some), chivalrous, kind, polite, soft-spoken, less-brash, study-freaks kinda guys take a backseat in the short run.<br><br>------------<br>Well ok do nice guys finish last?? Rephrase, do nice guys get it as good and RANDY with girls as much as the jerks do?<br><br>Ok. Yes and No.<br><br>Short run;<br><br>in the early years of female adult-hood, i.e. 15-27 years of age, the female organism undergoes a certain "rite of passage", whereby she is attracted to the attractive guy.<br><br>Such guys make the short-run female feel better about herself in front of her girl-friends, such guys can show the female a better time than the "nerdy dorky guai" guys. Such guys give the female A GREAT TIME. She may occasionaly switch such guys, depending on how JERKY they are and dump her for other girls that are dying to be in the arms of such jerks in their respective short run modes.<br><br>So yeah, the more attractive kind of guys tend to be jerks because it is easier for them to attract girls by simply.. being jerks most of the time, *wink* well.. at least they let their jerk sides show AFTER they ghet the girl dat is..<br><br>This is thanks to American media shows, heavy-metal subculture and other forms of media that emphasize "COOL and HIPNESS" etc etc<br><br>Long run:<br><br>The shortcoming of the attractive guy, is that in the long run, his short run days of smoking, drinking, DRIVING at high speeds etc cost him lots of $, he runs the risk of dying in accidents, becoming a drug addict or getting his liver **** up. Most of the time, attractive guys bounce off from one girl to another until he retires.<br><br>But in the long run, the female usually has had at least 3 or 4 jerks in her "short run" period, she would be pissed off with men in general and may even consider becoming a lesbian. Her long run mode has kicked in, whereby she is more attracted to financial stability, decent gentlemanly-guys who are not sterile yet who can help raise children fruitfully and properly etc. Thus the attractive guy becomes unattractive compared to the formerly unattractive nerdy guy.<br><br>Unattractive nerdy guys, in the long run, usually have better paying jobs, more stability and can even enhance their attractiveness with cybernetic enhancements which they can easily pay for with their $.<br><br>SO it ALL DEPENDS WHAT KIND OF GUY U ARE NOW? AND WHAT KIND OF GUY U WILL BE! AND WHEN UR LONG RUN PERIOD KICKS IN!!<br><br>MUHAHAHA!!<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
