            <div class='col-md body'>As i have stressed so many times to guys during my seminars, attraction is not a choice girls make, it just happens. And the girls say they are not like machines that we can switch on. On the contrary they are, u just gotta know how to press her buttons to make her think u are a GOOD guy!<br><br>-----------------<br>Definitions of terms:<br><br>Things that attract girls:<br><br>1. the attractive guy (see Men_@_arms 18 ways to be a man-guide-manual 1st edition)<br>2. Money<br>3. Power<br>4. Looks; muscular chest, firm thighs, hips, buttocks, big biceps, veiny arms/hands. Clear face, rebonded gelled hair, preferably japanese looking etc etc.<br>5. Some kind of vehicle (e.g. car, motorbike, humvee, tank etc etc)<br><br>Short run; time period within the 1st 20-30 years of female lifespan. Can also be defined as period of time in a relationship which is FABULOUS before the relationship becomes sour.<br><br>Long run: Time period after 30 years of female lifespan. Can also be defined as period of time of relationship which has become SOUR AND SUCKY.<br><br>Attractive guyattractive guy in the short run)<br>"hot, tall (probably blonde), muscular, vehicle-driving, wake-boarding, soccer-kicking (or some other brute sport), gell-smearing, no-contacts-required, well-dressed (i.e. hottest casual trends), rap-shouting, music-playing, cursing, brash, confident, pompous, insulting/joking/cocky, cigarrette smoking (some only), drinking, regularly-dumping-girlfriending, clubbing etc etc" TYPE of guy.<br><br>Unattractive guy: (less attractive guy in the short run)<br>The more abundant (in sg at least) "Nice guys", nerdy (some), chivalrous, kind, polite, soft-spoken, less-brash, study-freaks kinda guys take a backseat in the short run.<br><br>------------<br>Well ok do nice guys finish last?? Rephrase, do nice guys get it as good and RANDY with girls as much as the jerks do?<br><br>Ok. Yes and No.<br><br>Short run;<br><br>in the early years of female adult-hood, i.e. 15-27 years of age, the female organism undergoes a certain "rite of passage", whereby she is attracted to the attractive guy.<br><br>Such guys make the short-run female feel better about herself in front of her girl-friends, such guys can show the female a better time than the "nerdy dorky guai" guys. Such guys give the female A GREAT TIME. She may occasionaly switch such guys, depending on how JERKY they are and dump her for other girls that are dying to be in the arms of such jerks in their respective short run modes.<br><br>So yeah, the more attractive kind of guys tend to be jerks because it is easier for them to attract girls by simply.. being jerks most of the time, *wink* well.. at least they let their jerk sides show AFTER they ghet the girl dat is..<br><br>This is thanks to American media shows, heavy-metal subculture and other forms of media that emphasize "COOL and HIPNESS" etc etc<br><br>Long run:<br><br>The shortcoming of the attractive guy, is that in the long run, his short run days of smoking, drinking, DRIVING at high speeds etc cost him lots of $, he runs the risk of dying in accidents, becoming a drug addict or getting his liver **** up. Most of the time, attractive guys bounce off from one girl to another until he retires.<br><br>But in the long run, the female usually has had at least 3 or 4 jerks in her "short run" period, she would be pissed off with men in general and may even consider becoming a lesbian. Her long run mode has kicked in, whereby she is more attracted to financial stability, decent gentlemanly-guys who are not sterile yet who can help raise children fruitfully and properly etc. Thus the attractive guy becomes unattractive compared to the formerly unattractive nerdy guy.<br><br>Unattractive nerdy guys, in the long run, usually have better paying jobs, more stability and can even enhance their attractiveness with cybernetic enhancements which they can easily pay for with their $.<br><br>SO it ALL DEPENDS WHAT KIND OF GUY U ARE NOW? AND WHAT KIND OF GUY U WILL BE! AND WHEN UR LONG RUN PERIOD KICKS IN!!<br><br>MUHAHAHA!!<br><br></div>

This world is seriously warped... Can't the girls see that they are the cause of this... 'jerk-dom' ??<br><br>The world has changed... so much so that gentlemen don't get the girls now. Is that not the case?<br><br>Please feel free to comment, just save the flaming  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>Heard of the song Desperado? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">"You only want the things you can't get.."</span><br><br>Somemore... woman are not much of a risk taken when it comes to a relationship issue.  They are not so certain if this guy is right for her and if there is a better guy coming along.. etc..  In addition, they can get hurt if they accept the wrong guy.<br><br>Hence, man are by natural, gotta work the extra miles to win her heart.  Those that were taken, are in some way, approved and certified 'OKAY.' by their wife or partners.<br><br>Those whom were gay, well, that's an assumption that if these gays are man, then they will be 100% perfect.  However, points to note, if they were man, they will not get these particular ladies attention since these ladies will still regards, gays can be good man.  Ironic, isn't it.<br><br>As for those who are dead, well, they simply haven't get to know them better.  If these dead good man happens to return to these women as a ghost, then.. they will be classified as 'Jerks' for scaring the hell out of them.<br><br>In short, if you happened to like such a girl, and wants to win their heart real bad... You have to be either married, be a gay.. or go kill yourself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
