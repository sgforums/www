Hard being sandwiched in between. I think being his senior, you should at least try your best to help him out as a friend (unless he is just a worker and his life or death doesn't concern you). Maybe he could take 2 weeks no pay leave to sort out his feelings. If all else fails, talk to your boss see what he says. But judging from the way businesses are run (for profit), I think your boss would most likely asked him to leave. And corporation blame workers for no sense of loyalty to the company, I wonder why.</div>

(of couse you as a colleague &amp; superior of his) can offer him some advice..or even go the extra mile of advising him that breaking up with a gal doesn't means the end of the world..<br><br>4) Use some reverse actions: Ask the reason why he broke up with his ex, upon knowing the reason than speak to him that it is his ex-gf's loss to break up with him in the first place (if that's really the case, coz if it's the guy, the reaction shouldn't be so huge) praise him and say that he should get back on his feet, and show the ex-gf that he deserves a better gf.<br><br>Encourage him to work harder and out-perform his own best performance so as to win back the ex-gf, but when the ex comes back..kick her aside..although that's evil...but it's considered sweet revenge from the colleague of yours..<br><br>5) Solve his problem first, before introducing another lady to him, coz a immediate replacement of another female fren will just be a stand-in/subsitute which will not have the sparkle nor attraction..<br><br>Perhaps just pull him out to go out with you all and the other ladies as well as a group dinner etc...at least let him know that there are others who care for him..thus he shouldn't disappoint you all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can understand how your subordinate has felt, and I hope my story can help him to realise and see another side of things.<br><br>I was working very hard for my present company for the past 1.5 years and it seems like I have gained a certain level of recognition and appreciation. I am single all that time and because my present job is a career switch for me, it drove me to work very hard. However, fate has it that I have to meet someone whom I lost contact for 12 years (first love). I thought I can settle down with that person but news about her impending wedding has caused me to be sunk into a mini crisis.<br><br>That time, I would think to myself, what for study so hard and upgrade myself constantly on a part-time basis only to find that I cannot settle down with someone I love. I wasnt myself for 3-4 months. Even though I was physically at work, my mind wasnt concentrating and I rated myself very poorly on my job performance. Although my superiors did not say, some of my colleagues were speculating I was looking for a better job offer elsewhere.<br><br>In the end, when the time comes, I tendered my resignation even though I received news that I will be promoted to the next level. Sounds crazy but it is the truth....probably because of the hard work during these 1.5 years. I tendered is because I do not wish to accept (as I feel I do not deserve) the promotion and at the same time, feel guilty that I have in a way let the company down.<br><br>To your subordinate, if you know his problem, have a talk to him. Tell him that if he is to lose his job, his ex will not care or even pity him. You ask him is it worth it? I can understand that if his whole life and happiness is to bank on his ex, he will be devastated and to him, work and life is meaningless because of this incident.<br><br>Maybe he has the intention to marry her but she refuse. Whatever it is, his family is also concern about him. Imagine he is like this at work, how about when he is at home?? Assess his current situation, if you know that his ex meant so much to him, you more or less should do what is necessary......to ask him to leave......as this kind of situation will drag until he wakes up finally to realise that his current depression has caused so much hurt to his surrounding people who cared most about him.</div>
