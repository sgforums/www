            <div class='col-md body'>I got a colleague  ( my subordinate ) who have broken up with his girlfriend.  Cannot take it and lost all concentration to work what so ever.  I was very worried about his well being, so I gave him time to recover.  However, as much as I want to help him, he have to help himself.  Till today, almost two months leow, his work did not improve and worst still, he is on mc so frenquent, I now cannot explain how I can still let him behave like this to his superior.  His superior is thinking I am sideing him too much now and even argued with me on this attitude on many occasions.  I think I have to be fair to the company and would like to do some drastic.  But for a man just fallen out of love, any setback will be harder for him to accept right?  Guys, what should I do ?</div>

But then, I divert all my energy to work to forget that relationship..  hmmmmmmm ....   I write in here because he had also joined this forum.  I hope he can read for himself your comments too ..  I think I will do what you say - talk to him again. thanks .</div>

Are they all wrong ? Or are they all right ?  It's all depend on individual, situation and I supposed the outcome.  If nothing harm comes out of it, then it would deem to be ok..  supposed if the same thing but undesire consequences like , that guys decided to end his life after being fired, can we say it is the girl friend fault that causes it or I who fire him.  Or that it is really no one else fault except for himself who made that decision..   I am in a dilemma.  25 years ago, I broke with a girl I truely loves.  We did not communicated well and understood each other.  We departed, but for these 25 years I had never forgotten her and think of her everyday.  I suffered in silence.  Life goes on and only recently we met and we pour out.  It turn out for the last 25 years, she is also still loving me.  We are meeting everyday althought we are both married with someone else.  Now the question again, am I right or wrong now to meet her ?<br><br>Looking back, I understand my staff broken relationship.  Zeny understand too. Like Zeny, I don't think I had disrupted my work back then .  So in this case, I cannot be a better judge.  Hence, I am writing in to seek opionion.  It does look like most is in favor of removing him ...</div>
