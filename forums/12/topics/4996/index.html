            <div class='col-md body'>-- the following was written by me to all my friends last thursday... it really happened to me, and it sort of woke me up from some dreamland that if you take much pre-caution, you just can't be too careful... Hope you guys will be enlightened...<br><br>You guys ever thought about your life?? about what you will miss if you're not around - as in you're no longer living?? Ever thought who will miss you?? Ever<br>thought who are the people who will continue to acknowledge your existence in this world?? Ever thought of who you will wish you could see just before you close your eyes for the very last time?? Is your life a day in which you have lived by with some people who you consider them as friends, just because you hang out with them??<br><br>Well, I think no matter how old you are, you ought to know who you will want to see for a last time and treat that person or people well... He/she could have been the very person who have been spanking you since<br>you know what is good and bad. For all you know, this is the very person who have taught you the most important lessons in life.<br><br>This is something that happened to me less than 6 hours ago. I was crossing the road and a car just hit me. I'm not injured though, as it was at a very very slow speed and the car hit my leg, but it's just a<br>push, and I jumped off the bike, and had it land under the car, which sort of shocked the driver. I was not in the wrong too, I was crossing the road legally. However, it left me thinking what will happen if<br>something had happened to me...<br><br>People who knows me will know that I do a lot of reflection. Thinking about my actions and words, whether if they are good or bad, or have hurt someone... I used to recall the days when my dear parents who use to beat me and scold me.. those were always like every day. I think my dear brothers can justify that. For all the things that have done, I<br>still respect my dear ol' papa and mama at home, and I do love them for all that they have done for my dear brothers and I. Even my dear brothers, I know we have been through a lot. We used to play together, and had our fights together, but in the end we still basically can't be seperated from each other for in us, there's each other.<br><br>However on this day, I realized that even when you miss the people that you love and know you will be with them for your whole life... but the thing is you never know when your life will come to an end. Mine could have ended today... Even for all the precaution that you take... I did wait for the white man to come out before I cross the road.. but sometimes, things just happen to you. If I had been involved in a major<br>accident, I doubt I would even have this chance to realize the life is so delicate. You might not even have the chance to tell your last wishes or even to see you loved ones the last time.<br><br>I only want to say, when you still can cherish your own life and your loved ones, even they may be the ones who have hurt you emotionally or physically, just forget the grudges, and love them and cherish them<br>again, for you may not even have the chance to do it.<br><br>Last thing, Pa, Ma, Kor, Jun, I love you...<br><br>Lotz of love...<br>&amp; *hugg|z*...<br>Ly<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)

            <div class='col-md body'>I tot so too.. I was wondering why you still say fellow officers.. ahahha~ no more warrant card = no more responsibility and can don't care about the whole organization liaoz... furthermore mi over here is just a nobody, so I guess I really give up all the power and authority... I do missed the days though... esp when I used to have that protective, problem-giving "mother" of mine - Peggy!!!! ahhaha~ Dunno whether you're ard or not at that time.. I think so lahz..<br><br>Over here seldom play CS liaoz... in fact really play very very little games... coz firstly no personal computer for me, if want to play have to use my roommate's and usually he's always in the room. Moreover, I also dunno why, I actually did more than 12 hours of studying a day over here. I really read through all the texts that was taught in class.. ahhaha~ I have never done that before esp since JC days.<br><br>Anyway how are you and everyone back there??? Will be coming back on the 23rd of Dec, and leaving on somewhere ard the 20th of Jan. Kind of short, but what to do got to make plans to buy milk powder for the future mahz.. haiz... so have to put in more effort now, then at least still can provide Fernleaf brand one.. hahahah~ Dunno why someone say that brand better.. can't remember.. ehhehe~<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by *Sad_Soul*:</div><div class="quote_body">Me ORD loh... but no job all thanks to the current ecomonic crisis...*sob sob*<br><br>My email is maillee@starhub.net.sg... no virus pls... and one day we have a gathering to have a makan session with nivek and gang... plus some counterstrike session to c whether u improve ur skills in america...</div></blockquote>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, thanx for your support and understanding... I really wish that you and your family will live happily together... I know how hard it is for family to maintain their cool, as all are still different individuals, but it's through this differentness that people get to know each other, and hence making us loving each other for who we are... and that's what you call a united whole... and that's a family... that was, and is my family...<br><br>Sometimes we can't really say that people just think about their bfs and gfs, esp for youngsters.. As for a teenager, having a gf or a bf is a new thing, thus you're more attracted to it. For instance, when a kid has a new toy, he will play with it more often than the old ones he had right??? people will grow up.. it's just a phase in life...<br><br>Me too, I used to think that way too, when I was a teenager, and I used to think that my parents who kept on scolding me everyday then did not understand me... It took me several years to realise their care and love for me before I begin to love them back again... I realise a lot in the recent years... but I'm still learning to be a better man, for my family and for the person(s) who are going to depend on me. Even in my psych class essays that I'm taking in my uni, I wrote most of my essays on my family. In fact, this recent accident, had even made me know more about myself and to know what is love and what is being love...<br><br>Sometimes, this sort of things, you need to learn it the hard way to appreciate it better... Like I said even for myself, I loved a parents lotz already, but that day, I found out I still have more to learn...<br><br>Anyway, doubt you guys will believe this, since then, I began to have less interest in r/s, or the girl that I'm interested in. For anything that happens to me, what will she do?? will she know about my accident even?? will she empathize with me then?? All I know is that after sometime, she will grow out of it if she's my gf, and be with another guy.. I would be long forgotten in her life. If I just admire her, it's even worse... doubt she will even know about it if no one tells her... even if she knows, she's at most just weeping for a friend. I asked myself why do I have to go through such an extent of getting her attention then, if she's just to treat me like a friend on my death bed?? Doubt it's worth it, rather give more to my family, and closer friends who are more caring and concern about me...<br><br>Bless you and your family with happiness and warmth... =)<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Prodigy:</div><div class="quote_body"> i totally agree with u bear...<br>i too love my dad and mom...<br>even though we quarrelled and argued<br>my bro too   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>i was hospitalized once...and my family will never fail to come immediately after work to see me..<br>(hospitalized in NEW CHANGI HOS. and i live in bukit panjang   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> )<br><br>and speaking of love...<br>i jus dont get it...<br>the minute the word 'love' is spoken,<br>some ppl ( or kids ? ) will tink ONLY and ONLY their boyfriends and girlfriends<br>didnt they ever thought about family love???<br>they really should read your post and get it drilled into their skull<br><br></div></blockquote>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)

            <div class='col-md body'>PRACTICALLY nobody can ESCAPE DEATH in this world... If you DIE in an ACCIDENT (or suddenly), it'll probably be just a NORMAL DAY for you.... Yes, no doubt you have NO CHANCE to see WHOEVER you wanna see for the last moment, and say whatever you wanna say for the last min... But I guess this would in a way REDUCE the PAIN and ATTACHMENT you'll give to them? Is it BETTER to have people think of you and miss you MORE after you're GONE? Would it even make a DIFFERENCE when you're already GONE...? Some people die of GRIEF... GRIEF of others' DEATH... Some just SUFFER from it....<br><br>If you're SUFFERING a SLOW DEATH like an ILLNESS... Chances are people can SEE you and you can SEE them...? Then again MAYBE NOT? And would you like what you see IF the UGLY side of people starts to show...? CARING side of them which would ONLY lead to further DISPUTES over YOUR CONDITION.... Is that bed you're lying on COMFORTABLE?<br><br>Perhaps BEING A DEVIL makes things EASIER....? When people die you get DETACHED MORE READILY... And when you die people won't be much BOTHERED by it... I wish NOBODY would be SAD for me the day I die? For I guess that's the ONLY NATURAL THING to happen to be LIVING in this world.... UNLESS I wish to be 'eternity'? Which probably MIGHT NOT make much of a DIFFERENCE anyway? See how?<br>DEATH would most probably be considered as a BLISSED day for me CONTRADICTARY to the fact that I view my birthday as a CURSED ONE....<br>About things I wanna tell the people around me when I die.... I guess whatever I wanna say and whatever I wanna do I have been doing all along... The KEY is to be YOURSELF... You must probably won't die which day you're really gonna die anyway? So like they ALWAYS say... "Live each day like the LAST day of your life..." Death is also a DAY of your life... Without it, a life would NOT be COMPLETED....<br><br>------------------<br>In LIGHT I shall FEAR NOT. FOR what I AM is CUT so DEEP inside of ME.<br>I LIVE my FLESH and SOUL ONLY to BLEED for the OTHERS.<br>FEAR ME NOT. FOR I AM YOUR 'MASTER'. GIVE YOU STRENGTH. FOR YOU ARE MY 'ENEMY'.<br>DEVIL PHRASE I<br><br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....  DEVIL PHRASE II<br><br>In DREAMS you CAN NEVER DIE.....<br>For YOUR LIFE is about the EXISTENCE of....<br>Your Happiness.... Your Sadness... Your Pain.... Your Pleasure....<br>Like a painted sky, when it rains... All CEASE to BE...    DEVIL PHRASE IV<br><br>When Law &amp; Rules are there,<br>they are NOT about JUSTICE.<br>While reality &amp; dreams are there,<br>they are NOT about SURVIVAL..<br><br>And Life &amp; Death NOT about LIVING...<br>Good &amp; Evil NOT about definitions....<br><br>IF truly there is EVIL, it is NOT just one of its kind......<br><br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>
