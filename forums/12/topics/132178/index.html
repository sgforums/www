            <div class='col-md body'>you are right in saying there is discrimination. besides gender, race is also an issue in this multi-cultural everybody-so-gracious model country. you can slap another's back and say, hey no such thing, but you have got to see the dust under the carpet. however, the best chance to get jobs today is via networking and temp jobs are usually aplenty at those employment agencies. again, if the HR person is a female (usually) and if there is a choice between 2 candidates (male &amp; female), all things being equal, there is a likelihood of her giving the better/easier job or that with better pay to her own gender.  this is not some unsubstantiated hogwash, but quality academic journals (again, not your regular mickey mouse tabloids) has shown this to be the case everywhere. that being said, other factors may also affect such decisions. also, with the female proportion higher than males in this tiny red dot, no wonder males are really hard up finding jobs in some sectors like the service industry or they just go about accepting the undesirable ones. on the other hand, if rigourous statistics are able to show  that most high level positions are taken up by males,  it could be be the stereotypes that one associate with a certain position. again, are you at fault to think that males are aggressive and females are submissive? While you cannot put the blame entirely on the educational policy or fanatical groups like aware,  one must also be prepared for the day where this issue rear its ugly head. So, just acknowledge that we as a whole have taken too many things for granted. for example, even as societygets more liberal and women empowerment grows in strenght, few can accept the wisecrack of a do-i-know-u lady scholar who chooses to think that men who went thru ns becomes a big whiner (just wondering what the mindef pr dept have got to do to reverse this perception?) eventually, all these issues are counterproductive since humans need both male/female to survive and one cannot simply be blasted out from a rock. such 'divide' may just be a convenient tactic to stray one from major policies that need attention. so, rather than based someone on the gender, race, height  or body fat, ex-durg addict/convicts, educate everybody especially hirers/employers on these issues. one is not trying to stir shit in the bucket so to speak,  but if you maintain polite silence, nothing is going to progress.</div>
