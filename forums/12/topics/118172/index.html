            <div class='col-md body'>hi aunt agony n every1 else here, i'm here seeking advice on wad i shld in my situation, please read my story.<br><br>i'm turning 15 dis year, n the beginning of this story was last year just slightly 1 week before school closed, when i began liking a girl frm the neighbour class. it was hard to explain how much i liked her...i'm sure it wasn't love at first sight, and i myself until todae can't realli find the explaination to it. it was the first time i liked someone else..well, u can sae tt it is quite "late" time to fall in love since pple already starting in primary school.<br><br>i knew a friend in my class, well he was quite a good friend of some close friends i have in my class. then once in the hall there was this competition or like giveaway presents for pple when they go out to answer a question, i did n gort this watch, it was supposingly limited edition. not knowing wad to do with it, i asked my friend, to pass it to her, since he knows many people from that class as he goes in to flirt occasionally. well, it was rejected and the next day, i realize that many people was trying to search who was the person who gave the watch. soon it was revealed.<br><br>then the situation progressed till the last day of school, it was still unclear to the people of that class whether i realli like her anot since the present given could be a joke. it was the last day n i was feeling really nervous since after that it would be theholidays and i don't get to see her anymore. so i went in bravely into the class and confessed to her. of course, since it was after exams there were no teachers...i didn't really get rejected, just an awfully long string of silence. it was painful, trust mi, n so i left, feeling anxious and relived at the same time. the worlds ultimate oxymoron.<br><br>during the holidays, i chatted up with her friends over MSN n found out that she had blocked mi when i tried to add her. my dream was like shattered at that moment but i din wanted to give up. so i continued chatting with her friends, knowing more about her..and everything just went normally till this year's valentine's day.<br><br>i realized she liked the manga "inu yasha", so i bought a VCD set for her from comics connection. it was considered like quite pricey for a valentine day's gift and all her friends told mi that she would reject it. i gave it to her, which was rejected and her fren beside her took it for her. currently it's with another of her friend, who is only lending it and will return to her after she has watched it.<br><br>the only problem i have here is i don't want to give up. her friend says that she's scared of me since when i confessed she was only at the end of her sec 1 year, which probably freaked her out, she says she doesnt' like me. well, i don't expect her to like me back in anyway but is there anyway i can be friends with her AT LEAST? even after her friends and even my friends convinced her she stil doesn't  want to unblock me? does she need time to sort things out? or why is she avoiding me? it feels very painful to thing of this statemate situation.<br><br>thanks for reading my problem, constructive comments will be appreciated.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you're 15? hmmm<br><br>My advice: get over here. You're still young, maybe you'll fall for another along the way.<br><br>Reason? Simple, she has more than 1 reason to reject you, and if you persist, you'll end up as Robert Toh. (carrot-head/cai tao) Her friends will utilise you just because they knew you wanted their favour because of her. And soon you will go on different ways after school.<br><br>It's going to kill you when your important exams come along the way. You'll worry that she'll not talk to you, or keep in contact when you all leave school etc.<br><br>So, my advice is get over it.<br><br>And you're still entitled to another option: Ignore my advice and choose what you want. I tabled an advice, it's up to you to accept.</div>

Maybe to her, she think it still too young to tok about love, she jus wan to concentrate on studies, why dont you treat her as normal fren now , maybe find a excuse to tok abt studies or discuss homework, as least .. she dont have the impression that you onli go for love.</div>
