You are a guy and thats it just like guys like us.<br><br>Why do you find it embarassing? It must be because somehow you feel that such feelings just doesnt feel right or good.<br><br>If you are willing, you may seek help. Seeking help does not mean you are sick in the mind, it just means you need a direction. I have contacts, PM me if you need them.<br><br>This issue is touchy and my stand is that homosexuality is wrong but homosexuals are not.  I treat homosexuals the same way i treat a heterosexual but I certainly do not think that engaging in homosexuality lifestyle is right. But then, its your ball to play.  But maybe you would like to seek some advice before you make that decision to 'go along with your feelings."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually I don't really understand where you define the problem. If you're happy being gay then be gay.. in terms of psychologically, homosexuality is no longer defined as a problem, but and it's a new area of research. This is because of the fact that homosexuality is both factors of nature and nurture, therefore we can't really do much to change it, since it involves our genetics. =) In fact, I see gays and lesbians as a different culture, just like Chinese, Malay, and Indians, it' just adds color to the society. So please stop thinking you're weird or different.<br><br>Back to your problem, I would say that it works the same way as it would for a girl. First, you need to know if the guy is attracted to you or not, I mean if not it will prove to be a one way r/s in the end. Well, to know this I think it works the same as how would one get to know a girl is she is interested or not.. Got to find out yourself.<br><br>However, at the age of 16, you may still be unstable of your sexual identity and preference with all the hormones churning without control, so it will take sometime for the subconscious confusion in your mind to settle... =)</div>
