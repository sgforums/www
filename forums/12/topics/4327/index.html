            <div class='col-md body'>Well, mainly they come under MCDS (former MCD... but there are others who are under runned privately...<br><br>If u really want u can look under the MCDS website.... Or let's say if u know the site like Children's Cancer Foundation, u can look for them, they have a website.. Have a fren who volunteered for that foundation...<br><br>And if feel something for the handicap u can look at <a href="http://www.wecanweekend.com/." rel="nofollow">http://www.wecanweekend.com/.</a>  Have a fren volunteering there as well..<br><br>To help teens who have gone astray, can join teens challenge... but they are kind of slow in replying.. tried to ask for application form too me 3 mths to get it.<br><br>For elderly sorry I dunno.. but can check out MCDS website.<br><br>Looking to play wif children, can pick Children's society. Tried that too, but was rejected, becoz they said there was no project then....<br><br>Me lehz... me volunteered for a family centre for the single parents in AMK... It's called HELPFSC. For my case, coz I prefer to play wif kids than to communicate wif the elderly or the handicap. Coz I scared me not that good in dialect and that kind of stuff or touched on a sensitive topic... And of coz becoz I love kids.. he ehee..<br><br>Usually than not, u have go to the entend of sending an email to ask for an application form... and of coz there are certain things to qualify for some work that needs a higher degree of maturity.<br><br>A word of caution... Dun just sign up just becoz u think that u have the time, coz u need the commitment also. u actually change the lives of pple thus u really muz be enthusiastic abt it.<br><br>Well hope this post helps thoug it's very long I suppose hee hee.. so sorryz...<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

Which ministry or organisation do they come under? What's the qualification for the job?<br><br>Would be glad if some1 can ans these qns, thanks a million in advance!<br><br>Regards<br><br></div></blockquote>Dear Atti,<br><br>In Singapore, to be a trained social worker there is actually a subject under social work in NUS arts fac(for those who are interested to be a social worker). Basically being a social worker is not just being a counsellor so simple and doesnt mean that the person will recprociate what you are doing for them. It takes alot of patience,care &amp; concern for the client.(We called them our clients) Besides human relationship is complicated.<br><br>Moreover, you can be a social worker in different areas eg: children(Singapore Children Society), adolescents (Orphanage, Singapore Boys'/Girls' Home), elderlys (Old folks home), hospitals (to provide financial aids for those who are needy), policies setter (eg: CDCs) blah~ blah~<br><br>Learn about of theories before you can really go and work as social worker... :-)<br><br>Dont worry, if you are unable to go into NUS to study social work. There are alot of university overseas which offer pyschology course and social work courses as well...<br><br>Good luck to those who are interested!<br><br></div>

When i got to noe abt it.. it was too late to register for the course already.. But I should be doing it next year if nothing goes wrong.. for those who r interested n not able to go thru the university to get the degree, perhaps u would like to go to this website to find out more...  <a href="http://www.counsel.com.sg" rel="nofollow">http://www.counsel.com.sg</a><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>LÃ®fÃ« hÂªÂ§ ÃŸÃ«Ã« gÂ®Ã«Âªt hÂªvÃ®g Ã¼ ÂªÂ®Ã¸Ã¼Ã� Â§Ã¸ LÃ«t'Â§ Ã«jÃ¸Â¥ \^/hÃ®LÃ« \^/Ã« Â§tÃ®LL Â©ÂªÂ¡Â¡Â¡Â¡</div>
