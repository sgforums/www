              <p>my 1st thread...</p>
              <p>recently my fren happened to access her daughter's email inbox. the daughter is a teenager. my fren is worried because she found the correspondences btw the daughter and another stranger very mushy..</p>
              <p>she questioned the daughter. the daughter then said she did it for fun and she dunno the other party at all personally and have nvr seen the face of the other party...my fren is shocked. but the daughter promised that the 'fun' would only stop at those writings and she'll be careful.</p>
              <p>my fren is still worried and she cant understand y must her daughter "flirt" with somebody she never seen or knew at all.. Is this abnormal and something to be worried abt? anyway. the daughter is shy and withdrawn. she's not very attractive and keeps to herself most of the time. my fren and myself suspect tat the daughter might have substituted real life boy-girl relationship for this kind of virtual one. Is this healthy? Should it be stopped?</p>
              <p>Worst thing is we dun even know the identity of the other person. What if the other person is a wolf and sex maniac in disguise?</p>

              <p><br>What is the difference when your friend have already raped his daughter email's inbox compared to the guy who is raping your friend's daughter email's outbox?</p>
              <p>Ask your friend to spend more time with his daughter by bringing her for activities such as skating, wushu, taichi, kendo, piano, violin, sky diving, cooking classes.</p>
              <p>Chatting with strangers isn't a bad thing to do compared to running away with strangers and getting herself raped by strangers.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Have a talk to the daughter seems good. Not regarding of invading of her email box of course. Explain to her the dangers of the internet. And be wise and smart while using it.</p>

              <p>my 1st thread...</p>
              <p>recently my fren happened to access her daughter's email inbox.
                  the daughter is a teenager. my fren is worried because
                  she found the correspondences btw the daughter
                  and another stranger very mushy..</p>
              <p>she questioned the daughter. the daughter then said she did it
                  for fun and she dunno the other party at all personally and have
                  nvr seen the face of the other party...my fren is shocked. but
                  the daughter promised that the 'fun' would only stop at those
                  writings and she'll be careful.</p>
              <p>my fren is still worried and she cant understand y must her
                  daughter "flirt" with somebody she never seen or knew at all.. Is
                  this abnormal and something to be worried abt? anyway. the daughter
                  is shy and withdrawn. she's not very attractive and keeps to
                  herself most of the time. my fren and myself suspect tat
                  the daughter might have substituted real life
                  boy-girl relationship for this kind of virtual one. Is this
                  healthy? Should it be stopped?</p>

              <p>Your friend has no respect for his girl. Sad.</p>
              <p>Your friend only knows what he wants for the daughter.</p>
              <p>Does he knows what the daughter wants for herself ?</p>
              <p>While many parents think keeping their daughters in a sterile bubble is good for them.  On the contrary, it's bad for her, because she will not be able to pick up social skills. This lack of social ability will make the daughter more suseptible to adverse influence for the long term.</p>
              <p>Teach the daughter how to protect herself and how to fish for her needs. Don't keep her in a gold fish bowl.</p>
              <p>Be more involved in the daughter's life..so that when bad things happens the parent will be the one she goes to seek help,  not some strangers for fear of reprisals from her own parents.</p>

              <p><br>What is the difference when your friend have already raped his daughter email's inbox compared to the guy who is raping your friend's daughter email's outbox?</p>
              <p>Ask your friend to spend more time with his daughter by bringing her for activities such as skating, wushu, taichi, kendo, piano, violin, sky diving, cooking classes.</p>
              <p>Chatting with strangers isn't a bad thing to do compared to running away with strangers and getting herself raped by strangers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ask your friend what is he planning to do to prevent his daughter from being raped on her way home by people she knows or people she don't knows.</p>
              <p>I suggest putting a banana in her undies, so that all future molesters will be frightened when they whipped out a banana while they were groping her. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> </p>

              <p>I think you resemble my friend's daughter. Flirting around with other male forumer (saw your other posts) that you don't even know. What's your mentality when you flirt with unknown guys? You felt precious right? Bahaving like adulterous couple in public forum for others to view. Where's your sense of shame? Are you doing this because there's no way you are getting the same attention in real life? No wonder so crude when replying.

              <p><br>Thanks. I think you gave a very good analysis of what's happening. Will try to relay your message to my friend. This is the kind of replies that I need. Not unique ways to prevent rape by some creative person. Lol. That person must be fantasising about all the rape that might occur to her. But i think she's safe la. For she has to resort to online flirting to satisfy her weird needs.</p>

              <p>I wonder how many daughters out there will actually get good advise from their Fathers on how to protect herself and fish for her own needs. (Like they know and not half clueless like this Dad quoted by TS)</p>
              <p>Think isn't it better for the girl to learn it from her friends and figure it all out by herself?</p>

              <p>Or maybe he's just pretending to be grateful to you because he thinks he can spite me by pretending to be grateful to everyone.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Anyway, you asked me to pick one reason why my friend cannot be a good 'father'. You are so smart. All those things which you said are true. Don't ask me to pick one only leh. Explain for all the cases la. Would you? My friend divorced from 'wife' le. 'He's' an orphan too.</p>
              <p>.I want to know how a young girl sees the real world. lol. Me and my friends have problem understanding mentality of a young girl. That's why i hope you can help us. Thanks for helping =D    </p>
