            <div class='col-md body'>Ok lets get to the basics! Welcome to Detachee's Love Boot Camp! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>In my opinion, I feel that there's a distinct difference between being in love with somebody and loving somebody.<br><br>The definition of love is the subject of considerable debate and it is hard to give love an exact definition. There are also many schools of thoughts pertaining to what is love.<br><br>Personally, I feel that being in love with someone can be termed as romantic love. This type of love often can be generalized into a level of sexual attraction or even a sense of novelty. I wouldn't go into the chemicals reaction in your brain that stimulate such a feeling for I'm no expert on the issue.<br><br>To cite another example for you to see a clearer picture, think about the honeymoon period of a relationship. The sweetness, the extravagance and the effort to be romantic. I'd relate the honeymoon period to the "being in love" feeling, everything is so dreamy and perfect.<br><br>Now, talk about love in its purest form - without the lust and all. Love at its purest form can be defined as the spirit of willingness to sacrifice for the other. It is entirely selfless and forgiving.<br><br>Nothing beats the Bible definition of love<br><br>Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. Love never fails.<br><br>Good luck in figuring it out!<br></div>
