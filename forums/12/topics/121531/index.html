There is no way that you can stop them, so forget and ignore them for your own sake.<br><br>Don't you have better things to do...like cheering yourself up instead of worrying about breaking some nonsense school record. To hell with their records, you don't even need to care if any of them goes to the toilet on time or not.<br><br>Think about the available options that you can still take if it is really true. Spend a lot of time thinking on how to prevent this kind of situation from happening again. Failing sucks...but if you really tried and still failed, then you shouldn't feel too bad about it unless there is something that you could have done to prevent it.<br><br>Remember, exams isn't everything there is to life. There are more crazy and tougher situations in store for you in the future. So please ignore the people around you and what they do and think unless you are in control of your life right now. I hope that you can forget/forgive/ignore them and yourself and give yourself another chance. I'm sure everything will be alright the next time around, don't you think so? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
