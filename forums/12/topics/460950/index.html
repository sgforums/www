              <p>Hi guys, just now my step-mother came in my room with my Dads phone in hand, showing me some chummy messages he made to a girl named Tin.</p>
              <p>In his call history, he even had made over 20 calls in one day to this same number, asussumably this Tin girl. When my step mother Approached me, I asked her to check his Facebook and guess what? He had made a new account, totally different from his actual name with just this one Tin girl on his friends list. No pictures of him and her were to be found on their profiles though. My dad recently has also been coming home late these few days, with one time as late as 5 in the morning. He of course deleted other messages and calls but tonight he was especially drunk and forgot to delete them.</p>
              <p>My step mother even found some receipts in his wallets from a bar called The banana club in Orchard towers. The club was mentioned in Tin's Facebook profile, I assume she works there?</p>
              <p>This comes as a surprise to me because I have always pictured him to be a devoted family man to his 2nd wife and kids but now this portrayal is totally shattered.. Can anyone please advice me on what to do? I myself as a teen can't do much to comfort my step mother! Should I advice her to go and have a long chat with him? Although he is my biological father, I would definitely not hesitate to side with my step mother if he really is guilty of cheating on her..</p>

              <p>@doraemon I think we'll see how things go when we question him.. If things blow out of portion from there, I think we should give it a try..</p>
              <p>@Summer Hill my step mother did not have the chance to speak to him at all.. He just came home, vomited and then tumbled onto the bed into deep sleep.</p>

              <p>Learn to pick your battles.</p>
              <p>Your step mom needs to confront your dad on her own.</p>
              <p>I wonder why she got you involved, what is she up to.</p>
              <p>I told you before in previous threads right ? She is going to get rid of you.</p>
              <p>Now she is turning you against your father.</p>
              <p>If you are a fool... you should side with your step mom. Then your father will boot you out of the house... your step mom will get to keep everything.</p>
              <p>If you are smart.. you side with your dad.. go inform your dad what your mom read... tell him to be prepared for the worst.Then stay out of the fight.</p>
