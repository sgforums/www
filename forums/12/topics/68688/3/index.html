            <div class='col-md body'>Everybody has different ways of expressing their feelings. The prezzie may just be something in the monetary form but still...have you thought about how he felt when he was thinking up a nice present for you? Who wouldn't want to give something nice and cheap to their GF as long as it is something that would brighten up her heart? I am not saying that guys are cheapskates but I would have think that the guy would have wanted to get something for you that would have meant a lot on that day but couldn't think of one. Personally, even a self-made small card on a special day for me would have been more than enough. I am sure he would have felt pretty down as this might be his way of expressing his feelings. I am not saying he should brood over it and instead just think up of something new but still, he would be slightly hurt I guess. Anyway, Valentine's Day is too nice a day to quarrel over such matters and do appreciate the fact that you get someone to spend it with, be it a simple dinner or something else.<br><br>Just my two cents...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Men are like pets (in Yunhaier's word). Women are like babies.<br><br>My friends told me to treat women like pamphering a baby. Giving them full attention and drop some surprises once in a while.<br><br>This is a simple theory, and it has been one of my guided principals. My experience and observations showed that putting this theory into pracitice is not easy, definitely not!<br><br>Many guys do not know how to pampher a "baby". What they think is good may not be. And they can be untactful at times. On the other hand, the "baby" usually do not voice out their intention or feeling, they only send signals. Most dumb guy will not be able to pick the signal. Worst, if the "baby" sends a wrong signal or guys pick a wrong one. I agree that guys sometimes need firm and direct indication (which is sad), this is something that a "baby" can't do, and won't do. And most babies enjoying being pamphered...<br><br>So having said all these, my point is - This is how man and woman are created.<br><br>If you have the "feel" for this guy, and believe that he is the man you are looking for, then you need to have a heart-to-heart talk with him. Tell him how you appreciate his kind intention and how he can do better next time by letting him know your definition of "romance" (you will be surprised to find that the definition varies greatly from person to person... guys or gals who see this note should try gathering this from your partner, it helps when giving romantic surprises)<br><br>I can see that your boy-boy is not that sensitive and tactful yet. Give him the benefits of doubt. He can be trained. If after this talk, and he still does not get enlightment, then you have 2 options.<br><br>(a) Accept his "dumbness", as long as he loves you and you love him. Ability to accept the shortcoming of a person is one of the fundamentals of a lasting relationship (of any type). No point picking up a quarrel...<br><br>(b) "Dump" him, and this is the last resort unless you truly mad.<br><br>Good luck!</div>
