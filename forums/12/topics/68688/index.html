Like a bad service, all it takes is a complete firm rejection about his effort - chances are, he won't repeat it again and would not only be feeling disappointed, he will question about his relationship as well - did it gone wrong somewhere? Why did she not like it? Etc. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I understand how you feel - because in the first place, its dumb of him to ask you straight for your addy and even telling you that he will be sending flowers to your house and lagi best, the reason against your simple desire of wanting just a sunflower is that <strong>because it is valentine day</strong>. So indirectly your brain will key in this implication: 'So if it is not valentine's day, I suppose I wouldn't be getting such thingy ya?'<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Words are dead, speech is alive. Playing around with words is very important in or out (around with crush) of relationship.<br><br>P.S: Of course you don't feel anything much. Then again, you should show appreciation for his effort, however little it is. It truely makes people's day good for the next many days. You too would like your effort to be appreciated ya?<br><br>Cheers</div>
