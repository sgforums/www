              <p>true. when it comes to rs, guys of high class often have almost
              any girl they want but their biggest insecurity is the girls around
              them always go for money, or sex and what not.</p>
              <p>let's not talk about how wealthy you are or tell them you got
              bankrupted, then they will run away. let's say there are 100 girls
              after you. when you tell them that, often 97 gone, only 3 left. one
              is if you provide good sex, she'd stay for it, another is who 
              willing to wait until you grow some money, but if she sees no
              progress, then bye...forever. the last one is who truly loves you,
              even when you remain penniless like forever, she'll be there to
              support you, help you to get back to your feet, she will be the
              cheer leader for you. She even sacrifies her will for you. She is
              definitely a keeper, but this is a super rare creature in this day
              and age.</p>

              <p>It's hard not to have an ego when u have high self-confidence and actually have the skills and all that stuff to back it up u know. But I admit, sometimes one will feel as if all is good and under control, but when it comes to relationships, that is not always the case.</p>
              <p>A person with too much ego tends to focus alot on his self, achievements and how others percieve him in this material and competitive world, and therefore take the girl for granted, thinking that showering her with gifts will be sufficient and that one can make it up after. Its a hard balancing exercise. Sometimes, you just have to learn things the hard way.</p>
              <p>Especially when you lose someone only to realise just actually how important that someone is to you.</p>

              <p>thing is when something bad going to happen or happened, oversized ego people often can realize somehow but just not willing to let go of their ego to fight for their happiness and usually leave it to the other person to make all the moves. and then when the other person decides to move on, they will think, let it be, he or she doesn't love me enough. it means they will tend to blame it all on the other person or try to find a lame excuse to cover up their mistake or to back up their decision to not go for what they want at that point of time, like, lots of fishes in the sea ;).</p>
              <p>true that it often takes a super duper lot of effort to get out of that shell. like you said, especially when one loses someone only to realize just how important that someone is to you. but if one really can let their ego aside when needed, even if they almost lost someone already, they can always win back the person if they truly accept their mistake and willing to fix it.</p>
              <p>i think ts gave a point thats spot on when she said girls actually find it attractive and will really appreciate the guys effort to contribute to the rs which rarely happens in a rs that the girl is usually taken for granted. that way, for people in generall is already appreciated, but for people with huge ego, their significant other will be even more touched because it indicates that the guy really cares for them.</p>

              downs to the whole thing with my self absorption and bloated ego.
              she actually helped me to understand better about myself by her
              honesty, sincerity and oh well pretty strong pesonality inside a
              very loving heart. when she decided to walk away from me, my ego
              took a big hit, especially when she stayed so calm and cool while i
              expected to see her desperately want me back. i kept waiting and
              hoping that she will soon realize what she is losing and will come
              back to me. so i ignored her too, highly focused on my work, i was
              even so confident that i still go out almost every night, check out
              girls and stuff though i couldn't seem to take her out of my mind.
              my excuses were, i can get any girl i want, why shuld i give me
              headache for this one girl. then, i love my freedom, being with her
              i will have to sacrifice it. then, if she loves me, she will come
              back eventually. 1 month, 2 month, 3 month, another month past, i
              didn't hear from her. no contact at all. i could only check her out
              in whatsapp. her statuses were all good so it's clueless. i started
              to think, never mind, she doesn't love me enough, she isn't worth
              my time. but those excuses weren't so convincing. despite my busy
              schedule, despite meeting lots of other hot chicks, my loneliness
              was still killing me and the more girls i met, the stronger i
              believed i would never meet someone like her again. i started to
              consider things more carefully, read over and over again her
              emails, texts, whatsapps msgs and all which were full of her
              sincere love and care for me. even when she knew i was some jerk
              playing with girls for fun, she told me as long as i love her, she
              would never wish to track back my past but she still has to let go
              of me because of my insincerity, that i was using her like any
              other girls. damn it. i didn't take her words seriously when she
              suddenly wanted to pull away. yes damn my ego, i didnt give her any
              explanation at all. i thought that way i respect her decision. that
              way i don't look desperate. that way i saved my dignity. that way
              she will feel regret for losing me out. i was cool, like an idiot,
              but i thought i was a hero. i was even so proud of myself for that.
              i thouht i would easily find someone else perhaps better than her
              with my ability, my money and all...</p>
              <p>it took me almost five months of no contact to finally wake up,
              and took up all the courage, stepped out of my full self to contact
              her, ready to accept the possibility that she has already moved on
              cause somewhat i still had a thought that she doesn't love me
              enough to hold onto me. when i called her, she was cool at first. i
              mean she talked to me like a friend, she wasn't cold or tried to
              avoid me. but she was confusing too, she made it hard to understand
              her thinking but i didn't give up. i asked her out and luckily she
              agreed. that evening, it's awkward at first but then we managed to
              resolve all misunderstandings and it was really only for the
              better. now being together we had ups and downs. but i never once
              regreted for giving that ego killing revolution a try.</p>
              <p>let me reveal to you something from a girl's pov based on what
              my gf shared with me honestly.</p>
              <p>here are the tricks.</p>
              <p>u think she doesn't love you enough.</p>
              <p>but it's actually u are the one who doesn't love her enough or
              doesn't show her or let her know how u feel about her. remember,
              normally a girl would never be the one who initiates break-up/let
              go of a so-called perfect guy. if she initiates that, it's either
              1. she is very sincere and loves you but her affection is not
              reciprocated by u or you make her think that way so she has no
              choice but to let go. 2. she is sincere but u two are not
              compatible. 3 she really doesn't love you enough, she finds someone
              better so she nexts u.</p>
              <p>u thnk she is the one who loes out and there r lots of fishes
              out there.</p>
              <p>this is relative. i don't know the girl in your case so i don't
              comment. but i think love isn't a war to have losing-winning
              parties. u say u are self confident, you have skills and stuff, so
              i guess the girl u were attracted to should denifitely have
              something special about her. so she would have lots of choices too.
              thus don't say it's her losing out, it may be u who knows?</p>
              <p>and yes there are lots of fishes but each fish is different.
              sometimes what u are looking for is actually something u already
              lost. the love you crave for is some love you can have with that
              someone you pushed away. you never try you never know. elimiating
              your ego to some extent is not as hard as u think. i only feel very
              much happier now that i did throw away my ego that day and found
              ways to get back to my gf. seriously i would never change my mind
              about her. i actually asked her what if i had not cntacted her
              again during that time, she told me she was missing me a lot but
              she didn't contact me, not because she had any ego issue like me,
              but because she wanted to see if i was really sincere about her,
              she even gave herself a timeline lol. so if i had not contacted her
              again in a given time, she would accept the truth that i was never
              serious about her and really have to move on. but she was also
              honest and i trust it that she will move on happily. that's what i
              also adore about her.</p>
              <p>so u know, i would never had such answers and happy life with a
              great gf now if i insisted on keeping my ego in a safe box.</p>
              <p>if u think u still have chance to get back with the girl. think
              about it. it's really not that hard. but of couse, if you really
              have feefings for the girl.</p>
              <p>good luck mate.</p>

              <p>We girls are like that. A girl often needs to be constantly assured that the guy likes her. Many girls will take neglect, distance, hot and cold behaviors as signs of being uninterested/losing interest so we move on. But looks like most guys don't read into it that way, so when the girl becomes distant too and moves on, the guy will most likely wonder what he has done wrong and tells himself it's just that the girl isn't that into him which isn't true but the way around to most girls :)</p>
              <p>We know what is wrong yet we still can't manage to step out of our comfort zone, this happens to girls too!</p>

              <p>i have gone through exactly the same path. since i didn't want
              anyone else to fall into the same trap as me, let me share with u
              my story. it can be long.</p>
              <p>it was the biggest turmoil in my love life i have to say, not
              merely because of the issue with the girl who is my gf now, but
              downs to the whole thing with my self absorption and bloated ego.
              she actually helped me to understand better about myself by her
              honesty, sincerity and oh well pretty strong pesonality inside a
              very loving heart. when she decided to walk away from me, my ego
              took a big hit, especially when she stayed so calm and cool while i
              expected to see her desperately want me back. i kept waiting and
              hoping that she will soon realize what she is losing and will come

              <p>Looks like you got yourself all worked out pretty well there. Good on you.</p>
              <p>I remember I used to say that you will only know love when you have lost it, so I suppose it can apply to your situation.</p>
              <p>I do meet other girls, but I am trying to figure out whether I am being objective and looking at the whole thing without any emotional bias or not. The problem is that we will compare, no matter how hard we try not to. Comparing these girls we meet with our ex. No doubt they are different, but sometimes I just feel that the settings are the same, but the main actress is always different. It's hard not to compare, and such comparison alone makes me wonder if I am doing the right thing or not. Or is it the ego again... messing with my head. </p>
              <p>No doubt that I may be losing out, but there is always that thought that there will be a better next one that will come along, or so I think. Cause this kind of thing is just too hard to tell. Or  maybe, every gf I had was actually an ex that I have lost. lol.</p>

              <p>Looks like you got yourself all worked out pretty well there.
              Good on you.</p>
              <p>I remember I used to say that you will only know love when you
              have lost it, so I suppose it can apply to your situation.</p>
              <p>I do meet other girls, but I am trying to figure out whether I
              am being objective and looking at the whole thing without any
              emotional bias or not. The problem is that we will compare, no
              matter how hard we try not to. Comparing these girls we meet with
              our ex. No doubt they are different, but sometimes I just feel that
              the settings are the same, but the main actress is always
              different. It's hard not to compare, and such comparison alone
              makes me wonder if I am doing the right thing or not. Or is it the
              ego again... messing with my head. </p>
              <p>No doubt that I may be losing out, but there is always that
              thought that there will be a better next one that will come along,
              or so I think. Cause this kind of thing is just too hard to tell.
              Or  maybe, every gf I had was actually an ex that I have lost.
              lol.</p>

              <p>Have you ever failed in your relationship or killed a potential
              one due to a problem with your ego or your SO's ego?</p>
              <p>I've read a lot of posts that got to do with this and I also can
              relate to it so just wanted to ask you guys for your experience and
              thoughts so...probably I can avoid or handle it better.</p>
              <p>I think we all know that for many people, due to the inclination
              to defend oneself and self-centredness, they'd rather let their
              potential or current relationship die down than admit their faults
              or do something that they are afraid will shoot down their ego.</p>
              <p>Let's say...</p>
              <p>You like someone but you don't dare to tell him/her due to the
              fear of rejection. Hence you'd hold back but keep asking yourself
              if that person likes you or not or...waiting for the golden moment
              that may never come. It'd be pathetic if that person also has the
              same fear of failure.</p>
              <p>Or someone likes you, you reject them at first or tell them you
              are not sure of your feelings yet but later you find out you share
              the same feeling but you don't want to "lose face" so instead of
              taking action, you just hope or try to give some extremely "subtle"
              hints and wait for them to go back to you and woo/confess to you
              again...that eventually never happens because that person doesn't
              get to know how you feel and he/she decides to move on.</p>
              <p>Or you like someone but you don't really let it show because you
              don't want to appear needy/desperate, so you keep sending mixed
              signals that confuse them and make them tired of waiting, so they
              give chance to someone else who is more daring and aggressive.</p>
              <p>Or if you're in a relationship, because of the temptation to
              always be the one who wins, you don't really listen to your partner
              but want them to listen to you all the time and hardly admit your
              faults. As a results, almost your conversations end up with you
              taking the power of a winner and your partner feeling uncared,
              unloved that leads to her/his resentment and in the end the
              relationship doesn't work out.</p>
              <p>I learned this lesson before and now I'm having problems with a
              bloated ego person and still thinking how to handle the
              situation.</p>
              <p>What about you guys? Do you think you have big ego or seeing
              someone with big ego? Is it true that ego and love are enemies?</p>
              <p>I just think, the ability to drop one's ego is really necessary
              for a healthy relationship. You only can truly love yourself and
              the other person if you can let go of your ego when need be.
              Speaking as a girl, I really think that letting go of ego doesn't
              make someone less than a man but makes him more mature and
              attractive.</p>

              <p>Accurate analysis of current situation, but yet misinformed.</p>
              <p>Anyway, talking about ego and relationships:</p>
              <p>Narcissism is one of the Dark Triad. If  you don't know what that is, Google it. Also, just as men are attracted to beauty, women are attracted to confidence. Self-esteem (Eckharte Tolle) is better than building an ego.</p>
