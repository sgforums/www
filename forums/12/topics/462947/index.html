              <p>Have you ever failed in your relationship or killed a potential one due to a problem with your ego or your SO's ego?</p>
              <p>I've read a lot of posts that got to do with this and I also can relate to it so just wanted to ask you guys for your experience and thoughts so...probably I can avoid or handle it better.</p>
              <p>I think we all know that for many people, due to the inclination to defend oneself and self-centredness, they'd rather let their potential or current relationship die down than admit their faults or do something that they are afraid will shoot down their ego.</p>
              <p>Let's say...</p>
              <p>You like someone but you don't dare to tell him/her due to the fear of rejection. Hence you'd hold back but keep asking yourself if that person likes you or not or...waiting for the golden moment that may never come. It'd be pathetic if that person also has the same fear of failure.</p>
              <p>Or someone likes you, you reject them at first or tell them you are not sure of your feelings yet but later you find out you share the same feeling but you don't want to "lose face" so instead of taking action, you just hope or try to give some extremely "subtle" hints and wait for them to go back to you and woo/confess to you again...that eventually never happens because that person doesn't get to know how you feel and he/she decides to move on.</p>
              <p>Or you like someone but you don't really let it show because you don't want to appear needy/desperate, so you keep sending mixed signals that confuse them and make them tired of waiting, so they give chance to someone else who is more daring and aggressive.</p>
              <p>Or if you're in a relationship, because of the temptation to always be the one who wins, you don't really listen to your partner but want them to listen to you all the time and hardly admit your faults. As a results, almost your conversations end up with you taking the power of a winner and your partner feeling uncared, unloved that leads to her/his resentment and in the end the relationship doesn't work out.</p>
              <p>I learned this lesson before and now I'm having problems with a bloated ego person and still thinking how to handle the situation.</p>
              <p>What about you guys? Do you think you have big ego or seeing someone with big ego? Is it true that ego and love are enemies?</p>
              <p>I just think, the ability to drop one's ego is really necessary for a healthy relationship. You only can truly love yourself and the other person if you can let go of your ego when need be. Speaking as a girl, I really think that letting go of ego doesn't make someone less than a man but makes him more mature and attractive.</p>

              <p>I think you need to ask yourself why you keep falling for guys with big ego.</p>
              <p>Guys with big ego portray the image that they are self-confidence. And it could be that you are attracted to that facade of " self-confidence".</p>
              <p>The problem is, you are unable to differentiate/separate Big-ego from true self-confidence.</p>
              <p>Men with big ego needs constant praise and people giving in to their demands, because they are hiding their low self-esteem. By stroking the big ego, they will feel validated.</p>
              <p>So, big ego men often tout their achievements, and work hard in attaining the goals........in order to get MORE admirations and validations.</p>
              <p>Big ego men tends to wear out people they come in contact with. as they are often demanding and self-absorbed, neglecting the needs of others around them.</p>
              <p>If you are in a relationship with a big ego guy, be prepared to constantly have your needs ignored and neglected. You must be emotionally self-sufficient enough and have more than you normally need to GIVE emotionally to a guy with big ego-. Because he will be constantly sucking you dry emotionally and not giving you back at all.</p>
              <p>Men with big ego, tend to gravitate towards a person who seemingly is self-confident and generous/giving. Because they cannot take/demand from someone who is emotionally in-sufficient.</p>
              <p>You can only give what you have, they cannot take what you don't have.</p>
              <p>So, big ego guy will stay away from needy/clingy girls... as girls are the bigger emotional vampires.</p>
              <p>So yah, time will tell. Just keep observing him. When you are emotionally sucked dry, you will need to leave him. Because that's the natural course of any relationship with a self-absored guy.</p>
              <p>When you learn to identify them, you'll know to steer clear of em.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Big ego guy will never be able to be saved from himself.</p>
              <p>When he gets dumped by the girl (due to his own self-absorbed way), his self-esteem will take another hit.</p>
              <p>In order to make himself believe he is not a loser, he will become MORE self-absored to try to heal his bruised ego.</p>
              <p>The more self-absored he becomes, the more he gets dumped... the vicious cycle continues.....</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Yes indeed, I have met plenty of big ego men and had a few bf with big egos. I tend to attract guys like that...and when they do become my boyfriend.. their egos get so bloated they think they must be super attractive.. and then it's all downhill from there....</p>
              <p>They are a total emotional drain, and they are quick at blaming you if you are unable to fulfill their ego needs.</p>
              <p>It's always about their needs.</p>
              <p>When you realised you are sucked dry, you stop giving. When you stop giving, they will seek the validation from other people.. and they have no problem doing so, because their self justification is .....that since you are unable to fulfill his needs, he need to seek it from another source... and that's entirely valid as it's again... your fault...</p>
              <p>So you see... don't beat yourself up when the big ego guy is trying to manipulate you with guilt...it's not your fault... be kind to yourself.. leave and never get involve with this type of losers ever again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On another note,  Playing mind games is a form of manipulation and deceit. Too many are guilty of playing ,mind games during the course of courtship. I suggest you refrain from it, because the end result is never worth it. </p>
              <p>Always start with honesty, a relationship built on honesty is one that's going to last. </p>

              <p>Have you ever failed in your relationship or killed a potential
              one due to a problem with your ego or your SO's ego?</p>
              <p>I've read a lot of posts that got to do with this and I also can
              relate to it so just wanted to ask you guys for your experience and
              thoughts so...probably I can avoid or handle it better.</p>
              <p>I think we all know that for many people, due to the inclination
              to defend oneself and self-centredness, they'd rather let their
              potential or current relationship die down than admit their faults
              or do something that they are afraid will shoot down their ego.</p>
              <p>Let's say...</p>
              <p>You like someone but you don't dare to tell him/her due to the
              fear of rejection. Hence you'd hold back but keep asking yourself
              if that person likes you or not or...waiting for the golden moment
              that may never come. It'd be pathetic if that person also has the
              same fear of failure.</p>
              <p>Or someone likes you, you reject them at first or tell them you
              are not sure of your feelings yet but later you find out you share
              the same feeling but you don't want to "lose face" so instead of
              taking action, you just hope or try to give some extremely "subtle"
              hints and wait for them to go back to you and woo/confess to you
              again...that eventually never happens because that person doesn't
              get to know how you feel and he/she decides to move on.</p>
              <p>Or you like someone but you don't really let it show because you
              don't want to appear needy/desperate, so you keep sending mixed
              signals that confuse them and make them tired of waiting, so they
              give chance to someone else who is more daring and aggressive.</p>
              <p>Or if you're in a relationship, because of the temptation to
              always be the one who wins, you don't really listen to your partner
              but want them to listen to you all the time and hardly admit your
              faults. As a results, almost your conversations end up with you
              taking the power of a winner and your partner feeling uncared,
              unloved that leads to her/his resentment and in the end the
              relationship doesn't work out.</p>
              <p>I learned this lesson before and now I'm having problems with a
              bloated ego person and still thinking how to handle the
              situation.</p>
              <p>What about you guys? Do you think you have big ego or seeing
              someone with big ego? Is it true that ego and love are enemies?</p>
              <p>I just think, the ability to drop one's ego is really necessary
              for a healthy relationship. You only can truly love yourself and
              the other person if you can let go of your ego when need be.
              Speaking as a girl, I really think that letting go of ego doesn't
              make someone less than a man but makes him more mature and
              attractive.</p>

              <p>true. when it comes to rs, guys of high class often have almost any girl they want but their biggest insecurity is the girls around them always go for money, or sex and what not.</p>
              <p>let's not talk about how wealthy you are or tell them you got bankrupted, then they will run away. let's say there are 100 girls after you. when you tell them that, often 97 gone, only 3 left. one is if you provide good sex, she'd stay for it, another is who  willing to wait until you grow some money, but if she sees no progress, then bye...forever. the last one is who truly loves you, even when you remain penniless like forever, she'll be there to support you, help you to get back to your feet, she will be the cheer leader for you. She even sacrifies her will for you. She is definitely a keeper, but this is a super rare creature in this day and age.</p>
