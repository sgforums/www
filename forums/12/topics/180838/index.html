So I personally think... Does he really deserves all those 'flamings'....?<br><br>You mentioned that your friend and his gf have been having so much troubles before... So if not for her mum who is dissatisfied with things, would your friend and his gf still be having quarrels...? What are the reason(s) to their frequent quarrels btw...? Have the problems been solved already...? How old are they...? And one final question which I would appreciate your honesty... Are you the 'friend' you've mentioned in your story...?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>is that gal in a single parent situation? bcos i dun see the dad in the pic.<br><br>i think the mum (parents) can advise but not to the extend of disallowing the relationship totally. she can advise that they still meet up, perhaps at home where she is around to supervise if she wants to make sure no 'harm' can come to her daughter etc. but to disallow them to meet up at all is a total disaster. both your friend and his GF might do something stupid under long term of suppression. (thinking too much?)<br><br>the other thing the gal should do is to at least defend why they are together in the first place. if the mum don't hear of how much she (the daughter) loves him or cares, then how in the world will the mum knows and even try to understand? perhaps, the mum is super protective of the daughter but it is still between the 2 of them (BGF). in short, the gal should stand up to what she believes is right and if she really loves the person, she will at least try to defend this love? yes? (this is part n parcel of growing up)<br><br>the guy on the other hand should be less quarrelsome. don't pick on a fight always. aim to have peace and resolve matters quietly, communicate at all levels. not easy but at least try.<br><br>apologising to the mum is good gesture but gaining trust is about taking time to understand what went wrong and improve in it. don't make the same mistakes...new ones are alright (we ain't perfect beings yet). learn from his mistakes and move on. be gracious.<br><br>apologising to his GF helps too.</div>
