She throws herself at this poor guy, who of course rejects because he is gentlemanly. Eventually she gives "him a chance" and they have a few happy months together.<br><br>But the ex bf returns begging for forgiveness after being played out by a far more streetwise woman. He suddenly realises what an idiot he was and how he actually really loves her. She crumbles, dump the poor spare tyre and returns to him. (eventually they end up in a miserable loveless marriage)<br><br>The other guy mourns for a long time about this girl. His ego was completely destroyed. Bitter, he feels that women are ALLLLL like this and decides to go play computer games instead. Eventually he probably decides Singaporean women are ALL materialistic and superficial.

I can cry on cue that's why I never suffer from dry eyes. My bf makes me cry practically everyday... that doesn't sound too good does it?</div>

I cried a lot but I know it was a decision I have to make. There are times we can follow our heart, but by doing so, we have to think with our mind as well. So even if it is painful, I know I had to do what I had to do. I refused to become like a drug addict who only craves for temporary bliss, although knowing fully well that what he/she is doing will only harm her in the end. Getting deluded by false hope, is similar to being a drug addict. I long for love, but I do not want to resolve to that state.<br><br>i.c.y</div>
