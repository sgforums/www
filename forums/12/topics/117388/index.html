I find the whole picture sick.<br>I had an ex-colleague who married a rich China girl for her $ hoping to become towkay and also for her "slim" body which he would praise her all the time. After she had a kid, she lost her shape.. and look like a typical china woman with their china face. So he was no happy. Worse is that his child is a boy. The China wife's father decided that the grandson will inherit all the $ and the father will not be given a cent. Hahahaha!!!! Revenge!!!!! Never marry for $, Never marry for looks!!!!  Never marry for all the wrong reasons!!!!!<br><br></div>

Cos I can sort of understand how she might feel. And yea it is hard to make the decision to leave. It was one of the hardest decisions I have made in my life, and it was one of the most painful too.<br><br>Well, you can't tell her to leave, like I said happiness lies in the decision we make for ourselves, and only we can make that decision. Others can advise and make us see some light but if she closes her eyes to it, then it is true others can't really do much...<br><br>Maybe one day she will realize that the guy is wrong for her...we can only pray for her so that day will come faster...<br><br>i.c.y</div>
