            <div class='col-md body'>i understand how u feel.. it seems kinda awkward to speak to her ever since tat attempt yeah? well... i know u like her very much, but u must understand that her reply of saying she don't know means that she doesn't want to break this friendship... or maybe she isn't mentally prepared yet for relationship.. well, i personally think that for the time being, remains as friends... take this opportunity to get to know her even better... this is not the time for u to neglect this friendship or wad... well, even if u cant be boyfriend girlfriend, u two still can be really great friends yeah? perhaps this is only a crush... time will prove everything.. all the best to you =) Cheers ~</div>

In other words, she'd probably have given the same reply had someone else(barring someone whom she has a strong sense of revulsion for) done what you did, which also suggests her seemingly negative response was not reserved exclusively for you(perhaps, she doesn't even know her reaction had sowed the faintest notion of rejection in your mind!).<br><br>Clearly, the fact that she still makes the effort to initiate a conversation with you after the incident is a clear indication it wasn't a outright rejection. I suppose only time will tell if anything comes of this, but I see nothing to suggest she actually rejected you.</div>
