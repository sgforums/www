You've just STEPPED on MY FOOT.....<br><br>THESE PEOPLE are FIGHTING and STRUGGLING to keep THEMSELVES ALIVE.... YES... They can be TERRORIST, BOMBERS... Living in much FEAR before themselves....<br><br>I WON'T even BLINK an eye to the SENSITIVE PEOPLE.... COMMENTING on the NAME of THEIR GOD being used in a MOVIE.... You know about movie-makers and JESUS...? People USED that name before too... Yes, they've received CRITICS for that.... But people SOON LEARN... (like you've mentioned in your earlier POSTs) that movies are JUST mainly for ENTERTAINMENT.... FINE if some people just don't wanna take it that way... Cause in my EYES they're just as 'INNOCENT' as the Ah Bengs who YELL at each other and STARTs FIGHTS just because they see each other 'beh siong'.... (not 'happy' with each other...)<br></div><div class="quote_body"></div></blockquote>you know, i started this post. and i somehow expected someone would post stupid one-lined remarks like this that can be made into a trivial argument. i know its trivial... but sometimes a word is all it takes to rub ppl off the wrong way. my advice to them is this. watch what you say about about the things you don't understand. you can't criticise a movie if you haven't seen it. you don't know whats right if you don't learn the wrong.<br><br>you can't state ppl as oversensitive if you don't understand how serious the issue means to them. bcos u don't pray to their god five times a day, u dun even have any obligations. you're a free man and you can do as you like. so dun abuse that freedom and take it for granted that Muslims are reacting too emotionally on their part towards religion and that it is redundant. because to them it is not. they learn to make certain sacrifices (which you don't see) in their daily life and they don't just do it out of despair. and when someone tries to put in a form of mockery about their god how do you think they would feel?<br><br>and why are you racing your thoughts on war and famine and all? isn't that really out of point? its just your way of preaching your morality to me just to see that you have anything else that is right to say. and as much as i like to pity this sort of trouble the world is facing today, i'd like to face my problems one at a time. now isn't the best time to be whining about the "world destroying itself". cuz as of right now (and as you can see) i have some other daddy issues at hand.<br><br>its actually a straight to the point rule in the Koran that says "Allah" has no face, no appearance and no figure. So when someone acts as Him, as a mortal being with a face, figure and attributes... it simply breaks the ground rule. thats why we dun worship dummies as representations of God. and throughout the years you dun see us doing that and there's a reason why we don't. and then some BIG SHOT decided to change all that because to him (and some 1 or 2 free-thinkers) its okay, but to the millions who worship "Allah" it obviously isn't.</div>
