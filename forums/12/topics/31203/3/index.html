So when someone acts as Him, as a mortal being with a face, figure and attributes... it simply breaks the ground rule. thats why we dun worship dummies as representations of God. and throughout the years you dun see us doing that and there's a reason why we don't. and then some BIG SHOT decided to change all that because to him (and some 1 or 2 free-thinkers) its okay, but to the millions who worship "Allah" it obviously isn't.</strong><br><br>YES... To YOU your GOD is IMPORTANT... To me MY DOG (say... I have to bathe it TWICE a day and trim its FUR 3 times a day...)might be.... But does that mean that we should be STABBING each other for some SIMPLE INSULTs...? RESPECT? IMPORTANT? LEARN TO GROW UP....<br><br>The LAST THING your GOD wants is to SPILL more TROUBLES in its name.... That DOESN'T make it a GOD... It just makes it a SINNER NO LESS than MOST of us...
