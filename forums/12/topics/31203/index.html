The Muslim will IMMEDIATELY feel offended without thinking/pondering on it further... and the ugliness of it starts from there. the picture up there i posted however, isn't mine. i got it from an email.<br><br>secondly, i understand that the movie will have to go some rating and paperworks before their final cut, and i'm confident that there won't be such a character by then. my guess is that either the Wachowskis did it unintentionally/carelessly or they really spite Muslims. maybe they didn't think there'd be muslims who would watch their movie. maybe they didn't know that a percentage of the viewers were Muslims.<br><br>but not all muslims are that narrow minded. i for example, am a fan and are quite open to its ideas which are contradicting to Islam's. i've waited in anticipation for this movie. loyal. dedicated. whatever you call it. thats why i'm pissed to know this sad news. either ways, it has affected the Wachowskis image negatively.<br><br>but thats NOT the only reason why i'm pissed. think of the BIG picture. think of what might happen to the psychology of large groups of ppl. this movie which had a positive image will instead be known as a anti-Islam movie. of course, its just a name to you now. but psychology works in ways beyond description and in silence. and very much then this movie will be its own undoing. not only is their ideas contradicting islam's and true to some extent... but it is already showing signs to thwart the muslim community somewhat. "no ill intentions" you say? well, as above. it happens psychologically and ppl dun haf to actually say/do it.<br><br>this is just the stage setting. their first act. their seed of doubt which will soon grow to become something more global than just a God's name or a "molehill".<br><br>thats how propaganda works. u still think that mountain is just a mountain? if there's no mountain now, there's gonna be flood and ppl are gonna drown "figure of Speech"-ly speaking.<br><br>but then again, i was only OVERSENSITIVE when that jerk made that "racist" if not "foul" comment. its really just about his naiveness which ticked me off. wouldn't you?<br><br><strong>WACHOWSKIS equals to DOG CHOW</strong></div>
