(im still hoping it will NOT)<br><br>*my girlfriend.... she told me that she got nomore feelings for me anymore. SHE WANTS A BREAK. WE TAKING A TIME_OFF now. and its not about another guy, which i believed. i tried talking to her best friend, which is my sort of my friend also, asking if she can advice me. She told me that my girlfriend really want me to understand and let go. i was devasted.. i was so so blur and dun really understand, i asked her, what does she mean by she got no feelings for me anymore? if she is sick of me, why cant she just tell me straight to my face? what really makes the feeling goes away? you know.. at least tell the chief WHY you like or dislike his food.....<br><br>the friend told me to just understand that my gal no longer have anymore feelings for me. if i really love her, i should let her go.............<br><br>hey people, i've seen my fair share of breakups and i keep thinking i can get over it, if it will to happen to me. but im so sad and heart broken right now, i really dunno what to do. somebody pls help me... is there still hope? theres always hope... but is there any this scenario? or should i just... "if you love her, let her go. if she comes back, its meant to be" ?<br>the thing is, i dont want to...i seriously still love her. another thing the friend pointed out is that my gal told her that we have really nothing else to talk about anymore. i agree that sometimes we do have long silent and dunno wat to do times. but i love this girl and i want to make it work... im serving ns now. trying to get my bike. and im thinking of the fun thing we can do in the future... so we will have more things to talk about too. i really want to be with her... in fact, i think of marrying her. YES, i'm 20, she's 17 only. you know wat, you can judge me or watever, but i really enjoy my time with her. she's someone i really cherished. I THINK SHE IS REALLY SPECIAL.<br><br>help me... tell me what to do. PLEASE........ im in so much agony right now</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was thinking that everything came from her friend's mouth and not directly from her.<br><br>You should hear it directly from her. If she really feels that way, you should respect her decision. But this doesn't mean u cannot start anew. Ask to be given some more time (perhaps a month). If it doesn't work out, then it's better off for u to forget it. Reason? You should know her well enough to touch her enough to stay together with you, else you are definitely not suited to be with her.<br><br>I'm just curious how long u hv been with ur gf. Different time periods do need different approaches to this.</div>

But eventually, you will realise that the reasons given are not as important as the execution and the desire to leave. That's probably akin to death, where there's little meaning in analyzing a person's death since even if you have the answer, the poignant lost is permanent. There's nothing you could do to resurrect that dead soul other than using the case study to prevent future mishap.<br><br>I won't go about trying to explain the possibilities because there are indeed quite a number of it.<br><br>You probably have two choices:<br><br>i) One is to seek her out and understand the real underlying reason behind the break-up (even so, you might not get the real thing). Of course, she will likely not agree to your request if you are completely unstable.<br><br>ii) Gather your stuff and move on, knowing that even if you do meet her and such, there's little you could do since you can't force love out of anybody or to be in a relationship with you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>She must have found someone she believes to be more interesting, more cute, richer, or simply better or easier to have intellectual contact with.  Like someone mentioned, you gotta come to terms with it and move on.  Breaking up with you has made her HAPPIER.<br><br>think of it that way, at least she cared about your feelings not to tell you the truth; instead, she chose to tell you she aint got no feelings about the relationship any more.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's think from another point.<br>You are 20, she is 17. What age u wish to marry? 26? 27? That means you 2 have to be together for another 8yrs. It's hard to stay for 8yrs. Anything can happen. Are you confident to hold on for another 8yrs?<br><br>Think far. Compose yourself and don't give up if you want. Come back a few yrs later when she's in her 20s, and try again. Being steady is not impt. What's impt is marriage.<br><br>Which is fresher? Stead 2,3 yrs then marry or drag 8yrs then marry? There is no 1 side to everything.<br><br>If she will be happier without you, let her go. It's very heartbreaking to the power of infinity. Remember her smile. Even if you 2 broke up in the end, do not despair. You just exchanged for a few more smiles on her face.</div>
