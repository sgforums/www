            <div class='col-md body'>hey guys.... thanks for the wonderful advices and quotes. i really appreciate.. im gonna book in a few hours time. i think that, maybe when i book out, i'll pa her a visit and tell her..... that maybe we shoud go our seperate ways.<br>it hurts me to think about it... but maybe you guys are right. i hould let go if she really have no feelings for me anymore. love is between 2people, takes 2hands to clap.<br><br>and pls, i wrote 'not your average' beak ups because for me, this isn't some puppy love or secondary ' i love jack forever' kindda shiit. i really love her.. dont be mistaken also that i think other breakups are normal unimportant, i just write this topic on the spot without thinkin alot, just really a important relationship to me, and its a beautiful relationship...............<br><br>thank you guys again. i haven't been crying. but i know im hurting inside. i wonder if i will have 'internal damage'.... i still wish it wasnt like this.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You know some people will always tell you "you will forget her in due time". And I find that remark weird, why would you want to forget someone you loved or still love?<br><br>For me, I'd keep those I love but have left me close to my heart. TS, recovery phase is probably the lousy thing you will have to go through. But I'm certain that the 3 years is not in vain, you've learned something out of it and become a better person. It's just a regret that most journeys and voyages come to an end someday.<br><br>You don't have to deliberate try and forget her. You know you have moved on when someday in the shower, a familiar song played over the radio and you thought of her.<br><br>Good luck with recovering <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
