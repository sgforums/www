The thing is 'Never fight with your friend over a girl"...the girls will come n go, but good friends will stay for good. This advice was given to me by a good friend who I had broken the frendship with.So my advice would be just trial out maybe 1 month with that girl and then break off like what your friend said. But thats just my opinion. Ultimately its you who needs to make that choice  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
