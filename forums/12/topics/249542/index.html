Currently I am 30. Recently attended one wedding which I have lost contact with the gal for closed to 13 years (We are JC frens) and finally met up with her recently only to find that she is getting married. All these time I have been working and studying part-time attain 01 degree (Hons) and 01 Masters and also working towards a professional qualification and accumulating valuable working experience, only to find that I lost to time. Maybe this is fate. Just felt it as a missed opportunity.<br>For guys the feeling is still not too bad because usually they have a career to work towards. Yes I do agreed that it (to attend those weddings) may be one of the most painful things in life but life has to go on and more importantly, to live a fulfilling life and live to one's potential.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I cannot help but to agree with what both Yun and Zeny mentioned.
