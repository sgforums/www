We're just going to continue taking more and more shit just because these people abuse their rank? I risked getting charged, extras, confinement, walked right into the office and had a word with the top man and basically argued not only for myself, but for all the idiots who were outside the office just too frightened of the big man. Heated words, raised voiced ensued, threats from him came flying at breakneck speed aimed right at me. I stood firm, looked him dead in the eye and challenged him. Mind you, I hold the lowest rank you can have in the force, but I wasn't going to take unlogical bullshit just because a few pricks are too afraid to speak up.<br><br>YES, we're only men while you're a commander, but that doesn't mean we don't have any dignity. Serving your time in the army, you already lose a hell lot of rights as compared to a civilian, but that doesn't mean we aren't human. I'm sick of people using their rank to pressure those under them. Hey, yeah maybe when you were climbing, others higher ranked that you stepped all over you, but does that mean you're going to be just like them? Will this vicious cycle ever end? Lets face the facts here, you're PRACTICALLY wasting 2 whole years of your life, you get an income that is worse than a foreign worker, you get rights taken away from you, you have the longest working hours, and you're basically on standby for 24hours, 365days a year for 2years.<br><br>I didn't enlist to do your bidding and hide in the corner to take anything anytime you feel like throwing at us. I'm just here to do my fucking time, and get on with life. Anyway, the challenge was dangerous, and very much risky, my head was on the chopping block, but sometimes, you just have to fight for what you want. Its a challenge of the mind, but I managed to fight for welfare, fight for not just what I want, but what the bottom wanted from the top. I gave my word that the attitude of the men will change, but on his end, he assured welfare will be given and he would relent to our requests on the account we maintained our performance.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/cry.png" alt="cry.png"><img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/cry.png" alt="cry.png"> End of moi rant!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p></div>
