              <p>I have a girlfriend, and we've been together for about a year, and we really love each other. A few weeks ago, I was out with some friends and met a guy, a friend of a friend, and he was really nice, and we were just talking and hanging out, and we got pretty drunk, and he said I could crash at his place.</p>
              <p>At his place we ended up making out and some other stuff. . . if you know what I mean. For a while after that, I kept seeing the guy behind my girlfriend's back, but then one day, she found messages from him on my phone, and I started crying and I told her everything. She said she wants me to stop seeing the guy otherwise she will tell my parents that I am gay, even though I'm not.
              </p><p>I told her I would stop seeing him, but somehow she found out that we were still having the butt sex with each other. So she told my parents about it, and they got really mad and kicked me out of the house until I stopped seeing the guy and straightened things out. I had nowhere to go. . except the guy's place.</p>
              <p>So now, here I am, no home, no parents, no girlfriend, and a sore butt hole from too much butt sex. The guy is very rough in bed. Sometimes he likes to use things from the kitchen. I don't know what to do!</p>
              <p>I think there could be some carrot bits stuck up there still from last week. I haven't done a poo in a few days. I'm scared. And I don't have much money. Please help me!

              <p>Hmm... carrot bits stuck up there, eh?  Constipation for a few days, eh? </p>
              <p>You know, if you stick foreign matter up the anal region, a few things can happen :</p>
              <p>- infection after the foreign matter decays within you.  You can become really sick (septic, because the infection will enter the bloodstream) and will have to end up hospitalised for scans and antibiotics. </p>
              <p>- The anal sphincter, ie. muscles that control bowel movement, might get affected by the infection and you might lose the ability to ... erm... how do you put this nicely... control your bowel movement, resulting in bowel incontinence.  Just like urine incontinence, where sufferers lose the ability to control when they release their urine, bowel incontinence is the bowel equivalent of that.  And yes... it can be extremely nasty, foul and a huge public embarrassment.</p>
              <p>- In the worst case scenario, a bowel resection might have to be done,
              esp if the infection is extremely bad and has affected your intestines
              in an extreme manner.</p>
              <p>- In an even worse than worst case scenario, the bowel resection can't be completed due to the current condition of the intestines and a temporary stoma + colostomy bag might have to be done.  That means, the end of your intestine is fused onto your abdomen so your stools will be emptied out of that opening into a bag attached outside your abdomen.  No more skintight lycra costumes after that, I'm afraid. </p>
              <p>There... in layman language, is what can occur when instead of eating one's carrots, one decides to insert the aforementioned object into one's anal region. </p>
              <p>BTW, I've always wondered about the origins of anal sex... did the father of anal sex suffer from chronic constipation and one fine day, he finally got his stools moving and was so happy and relieved about it that he got an explosive orgasmic climax sitting on his throne and henceforth decided to reproduce that moment of sweet release by stimulating the anal area? </p>

              I think you should sit down and straighten out your thoughts? 
              
              Why are you in such a dilema when it is obvious it is naturally not right to be doing this? But I believe that everyone of us has the choice. If you really wanted to get out of this shit, just stop seeing him. End it once and for all and let it be a past. 
              
              I guess money is very tempting, guys have asked me if I need a sugar daddy. But no, for me, I don't believe in money for sex. It just isn't right.
              
              IF you are not after his money, then could you ask yourself why exactly you would be willing to have anal sex with a guy? 
              
              IF you think you really like the things that you do with him, then if you think that is what you want, then nobody is to stop you. It is ultimately your choice. But if you ask me, if you truly have feelings for the guy, then you shouldn't be in such a dilema now. You'd know that he is what you want, he can support you, and you wouldn't need to worry a thing. If you are really serious about him, take the time to persuade your parents' thinking. If they die die also won't accept it, you choose. Them or him...
              
              But if I were you, I'd think-is this guy just using you as a playtoy? From what I see, yes. Unless you can prove me wrong.
              
              So is playing ever long term? Soon you'd get bored right? 
              
              So you think he will always be there for you?
              
              No matter what happens, I believe that your family will always want you back.
