People may think that you need a bf, which will be a prefect person who can cater for your needs - but on a serious note: I wouldn't advice you to.<br><br>There are three things you need to do:<br><br>I) Learn to love yourself. Until you truely learn to value of loving yourself - i predict between 2 to 4 relationship crisis you may have to undergo to realise this essential thingy in love. Nothing is forever, only you yourself can be there for you all the time.<br><br>II) Expand social circle. Your emotions needs is heavy and your focus point revolves only your best friend, but your best friend's world doesn't only revolves around you. You need to enlarge your networking and obviously - sgforum is one example you can hang around and socialize.<br><br>III) Reflect upon yourself.

In love, effort put doesn't not equate to result receive. Love is never fairy tale - you are living in a world where people will never match up to your illusionary fantasy - you have to return to the real world.<br><br>You need someone capable to brainwash you emotionally or you pull through yourself and I am very sure if you want to get out of this emotional mess - you need to do the latter first.<br><br>Cheers</div>

You are disappointed because you expected something - love bends on giving, expects nothing. Friendship works the same way. The more you demand a return, the more misery you get from the relationship.<br><br>And you mean there is such thing as a break up and patch back a friendship the way you do like in BGR? There are but don't do it like BGR sense.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Do not attempt to make someone fulfilling duties of a BGR partner, when he/she ain't supposed to.</strong></span><br><br>Respect space and personal freedom. Try to avoid clinging onto her. Walk by yourself and you give room for this friendship to grow.<br><br>Cheers</div>
