Been through that stage myself... What i did finally was to have a good heart to heart talk with my buddy... Of course, that was after I'd thought things through? Years back... He apologised to me instantly... And I told him what was the point of my sharing the whole story with him... I can't accept his apology... Instead I apologised to him... I treats him as a GOOD BUDDY and YES... A BEST friend? And I thought what I was thinking back then and all the negative things were really degrading of me... And the FRIENDSHIP between us... I told him I was TRULY ASHAMED of myself and asked for forgiveness...<br><br>Till this day, he has proven to be MORE than WORTH IT... Can you see your FRIENDSHIP with this friend of yours in years to come? A friendship where 2 should hold hand in hand to FIGHT FOR? Have you GIVEN UP already? If you have given it up then I think you should? For that's probably just how much the friendship is worth to you?</div>

Take time to discover and love yourself... find out who you are, be independent.. and live your life. Not depending on others to live your life for you. And in any relationship, whether friendship or BGR, it's all about giving.... and giving sincerely without expecting return because ultimately, what is important is how you can help make the other party happy. If you keep count of what you have given and what you are expecting in return, you haven't learned the very basics of relationship yet.<br></div>

Try to loosen up a bit... Just slowly expand your social circle and learn to be more independent and you'll see that it's really all no big deal? It'll be better for your friends and also beneficial for yourself on the long run?</div>
