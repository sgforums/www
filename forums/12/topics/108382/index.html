            <div class='col-md body'>Your friend is very patient to have waited for 9 years. Especially when no future between them can be seen.<br><br>Well, some conclusions that i can draw are:<br>1) He really likes the girl(from sec 1? I don't think any of us knew what love was at that age)<br>2) He's stubborn and doesn't like to give up.<br>3) Its the first girl that he's fallen for, and he doesn't want to let go.<br><br>I'm just glad that he has given up. It would be really sad to see a 50 year old saying ...

            <div class='col-md body'>there is a term call escalation of commitment<br><br>ie like gamblers. they gamble lose but still continue to gamble cause they think the next round they will win big and everything is alright ... but the thing is they will never win and the commitment just grows out of hand.<br><br>I've know guy (ex-colleague) like this too. The girl was living with her BF and doing what couple do and yet this guy didn't give up. Rumour has it that this guy and the girl are always together and they would go to empty rooms in the office and have s*x.  The girl knowing how the guy felt about her continued to flirt and led him on. The guy after numerous advice refused to move on. Its a sad case of a lot of wasted time and a lot of wrongs... and will have bad future consequences.  Its also been more than 6 years this has continued.... and still working in the same department...<br><br>But then, its their lives and their choice. They are really blinded so no matter what other people advice or say about them, they continue their actions.<br>People make a lot of bad choices, me included</div>
