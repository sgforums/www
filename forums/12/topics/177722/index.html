            <div class='col-md body'>frankly there is no right or wrong as to which move you should take because nobody can know or control the external factors affecting your decision.<br><br>my opinion is to go along with the transfer and see what comes up.  if it does not go according to plan then join a competitor.  dont make hasty decisions.<br><br>who knows maybe something good might come out of the transfer?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nobody knows whats going to happen tomorrow. Be it staying or applying for a sales position in another Rival company, both have its pros and cons.<br><br>as you are already familiar with how your current company works, its may be easier for you to settle down in the new office and you can request for your new boss to put you in sales. In the same time, maybe you can also apply for a sales job in another company and if you are call up for an interview, go ahead. Gives you a chance to see how's the working enviroment over there, from there i think it will be easier for you to make the decision.</div>
