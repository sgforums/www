            <div class='col-md body'>8th of june, a friend of mine (which i got feelings for her)  birthday. I call named her H, then she got a good friend, also a friend of mine. I call her S.<br><br>On last wednesday, i received a call from S that she wants to celebrates H birthday on her actual birthday itself. Upon hearing this, i was thinking what to buy. S sugguest me buying a doremon bear for her. but for me, i was pondering that it is too common. So i abandoned this doremon. I am heading for something special and new. I want to buy her a pair of hamsters. So i ask S what type of hamster H like. S just bring me to a particular shopping center in the north and show me which one. (H and S often go out together, it happens that one day they walk past this shop, H saw this hamsters and love it very much. almost wanted to buy). WHen S told me which type of hamster, i was reluctant to buy it. coz kinda Xs! But S say that H love this very much and she say that since i wan to woo her, maybe i should buy for her this. Upon thinking. on the same day, i reserved this hamster specially for her. Hoping to make a good impression on me and i can slowly develope feelings to her.<br><br>On the same day (2 days before her birthday), i went to buy the various accessiories for the hamsters. I bought a "condominium", its king coil bed, first class food, and the biggest bathtub for the hamster. Than on the actual day i go and buy those 2 hamster which i reserved de day before...<br><br>Moreover, on the few day before which i decided to buy a hamster. i deliberately go and do research on how to take care of hamster  and designed it as a mini webby format. This i took serverally night to do it. mostly do until 3am plus. and finally i completed the "project" and i give it to her on the actual day. (A CDs with a birthday annimation. hamster infomations etc... which is to be completed within 3 days)<br><br>So on the birthday party, i really wish to chat with her for more than anyone chatting with her. but than, no chance at all. She was chatting happyily with a guy. This guy, i suspect that is her bf-to-be. So i send a spy to find the truth. indeed, from S info, S admited that he is H bf-to-be. When my spy come back and report to me. i was so sad and angry. Why? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Because S did not tell me that she have a stead-to-be already and bluff me that she dun have anyone wooing her and even make used of my feeling to her, buying her de hamster beast. Until when i fouind out, it was too late. i really so regretted buying her such thing... she make use of me, cheat and make use of my feeling to H. I so sad... anyone please step into my shoes... please tell me what will you do?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Should i continue to woo H or completely give up on her.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>[img] <ul> [list=] <div>code:<pre>  <blockquote></blockquote></pre></div></ul>[/list]</div>
