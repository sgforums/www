            <div class='col-md body'>I felt very shocked and hurt. Shocked that my own father will do this kind of thing when u feel that he is the best dad in the world and hurt because you always felt proud of dad being a caring and loving father towards family.<br><br>The hurt lasted very long time even till now when my dad started to fool around. It create chaos among families. It was really a nightmare, many<br>quarrells, fights, crying, screaming, attempted suicide etc etc.<br><br>That was 15 yrs ago. Now he has another family. He has to juggle with 2 families. Everyone stayed together because of money. It's very sad and what's the point of the whole thing ?<br><br></div>

Does she know about all this? What she's saying about these...?<br><br>I think perhaps it might affect you because you feel that you're 'different'.... I can tell you of many other people...

Isn't this world 'weird' to begin with...?<br><br>What's 'complete'? What's 'incomplete'...? What you wanna be...?<br><br>I would personally think of it as a 'little joke' god has to play on you....

            <div class='col-md body'>Discussed this very issue few days ago with some friends.<br><br>They are not surprised at all if their parents break up coz of third party.<br><br>Many of our parents who are now in their 50s and 60s find themselves not talking to one another. In most cases, children all grown up, father becomes grouchier and constantly scold the mother for nothing. Mother always complain to their children how they suffer, work for the family for so many years, kena shouted like that etc etc etc..<br><br>And guys at these age already lost their sex drive, so not all are due to horniness. Just wanting to find another partner for solace and stuff like that..<br><br>Most parents wouldnt break up, main thing is their children. Some come from a family where the eldest is 20 plus year old, and the smallest is in primary. If family break up, the children will suffer the most, especially if they are young.<br><br>I would advise, to be prepared for anything. But doesnt mean one should be startled by false alarms. It could be small matters, so dont think too much yet.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br></div>

Really dun understand<br>what my dad see in her. Anyway, this type of woman will not give up<br>once the man took advantage of her.

My dad nearly disown me but didn't.<br>Anyway, I come to realise we as 2nd generation can't do much to the situation because it's really up to them to sort it out themselves.<br><br>At least I am blessed that my dad is still a responsible person,<br>I think he regret the whole thing and tried to treat our family better.<br>After which, i got to know more similar and worst cases around.
