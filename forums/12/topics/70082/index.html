I was worried also cos my gf and i talk everyday unless either one is very tired.. So sometimes we do tlak a lot of cock and sometimes we discuss tv shows (i.e. reality tv or those taiwan entertainment shows... ), or outing plans.. or maybe even dreaming of our future.. and asking each other abt this and that preferences... Just some pointers.. but other times if either side is not in the mood, then no matter how hard one side try.. got problem means got problem.. then like that got a topic to talk abt liao unless he/she trying to avoid the problem..</div>
