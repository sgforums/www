            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... Not sure how should I advise you on this one... The possibilities are practically rather limitless...<br><br>All I can say for now is... If you trust your bf... TRUST HIM....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  If you don't, it's gonna be a different issue together....<br><br>Though personally I feel that your bf might have made a lie or 2... But they might just be tiny ones and might not even be as bad as you think..? Basically, I won't know for sure... But if I have a gf who's as sensitive as you are to things... I think I would be rather careful of what I tell her too..? But breaking a few 'white lies' in order to reduce big misunderstandings and arguements might sometimes be worth it...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Though it might be 'something' or nothing.. But doesn't it occur to you that it might be too early to just give a 'death penalty' like this...? Or even if it's not that severe...

But i'd like to give my honest response to it, especially when it comes to cheating bf/gf.<br><br>Rite now, she has to ask herself what she wants from the r/s. She's not happy now and continue to have persistent doubts. If her gut feelings telling her the bf some lying tosser, then she shud listen to it and act appropriately. No need to make excuses for his behaviour, and certainly no need to tolerate any dishonesty. Dishonesty sucks.<br><br>Let's just agree to disagree on this. Up to her to decide. Her life.<br></div></blockquote>I remember my lecturer telling me about trust.<br><br>When she asked us about trust, one of my classmates replied "Trust should be earnt."(Sorry, don't remember everything), and she replied "No. Trust should be given. Only if you give out your trust, then will their trust be given to you."<br><br>I think she has made a good point. If all of us are reserved and keep our trusts to ourselves, or rather, decide not to trust people that easily, or not to trust people at all, and compare that to a person who trusts people, what do we have?<br><br>A person who trusts no one because people have to earn it will end up living a very miserable life, looking for backstabs everywhere. He'll probably die young for being paranoid, and will not get married for fear of his wife just wanting him for money.<br><br>A person who trusts everyone will also unfortunately have a miserable life cause his money has been cheated by everyone  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br>But on the other hand, since he trusts people, this will be the guy that make changes in the world. Unless of course he meets up with someone who's really out to get him, but even then his friends will back him up, and he'll have a good life i think.<br><br>I think i've lost my train of thought, just wanted you all to know that giving out trust is the way to getting trust back.<br></div>
