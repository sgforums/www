If there is one at all, the pay must be low and the job can be lost at any time. If you can come to work at 9 and leave at 5pm sharp, your boss will consider getting rid of your job and let your colleague cover your duties. Save one post and pay another overtime to take over the job.<br><br>Accountants work hard, but only if they work in the private sector. Your bf can consider a job in the Civil Service (join the tax collectors) or teach accountacy in a poly or one of the private business schools. The pay will be lower but the hours are better.</div>

Or for that matter, having him dictating what friends you should hang out with? That's basically what you're putting him through if you're even attempting to talk him round to pursuing other careers despite knowing accountancy is what he really wants to do.<br><br>There're certainly other ways to go about addressing your concerns than the measure you've resorted to IMO. Moreover, I suppose you should look at his determination on pursuing a career in accountancy a positive sign - at least, he knows what he wants and is prepared to stand firm. For starters, that quality should stand him in good stead - and to your benefit as well - to stand by you in time to come when the occasions demand it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> I'm sure you wouldn't want a boyfriend/husband who is indecisive and can be easily persuaded to renege on a commitment/decision, would you?</div>

Computerization of the accounting process has reduces accountants having to manually record the entry one by one. The most busy time of their time will be during the auditing period, it is either by internal auditors or external ones. Other than that, most accountants are generally like all office workers working 8-5.<br><br>If his interest is really into accountancy I believe you will have to learn to accept to the fact and support him. Maybe you do have negative steorotypes against accountants in general however trust me it is a relatively respected profession that commands a decently high salary.</div>

If he decides to study banking and finance, he has to work long hours anyway and might have to entertain clients as well. At least as an accountant he is desk bound.<br><br>A vet? You gotta be kidding me. You might as well ask him to be a doctor. It's easier studying to be a doctor anyway. At least you only study the human body whereas for a vet, there are so many different kinds of anatomy to study. Being a vet is not exactly desirable as not everyone wants to handle animals and animals can smell.<br><br>Be glad that he has a goal in life and knows what he wants when most people his age are drifting around. You should be supportive of him and an Accountant is considered a professional as well especially if he goes for the ACCA certification. It's a highly respectable job, plus every company needs accountants  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Reason is simple, you don't own him and neither does he need your permission to go ahead with his ambitions. So you shouldn't waste your time concerning about what career choice he should make, but instead focus more on him as a person and determine if he is really the one for you. When he's being nice, concern, caring, sweet...it's really is a standard operating procedures for him to show his concern for you as his gf. But, does he make any effort to do things beyond that? You should know if he's serious about you and the relationship right? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Let him do what he wants in his life, especially if it is to his interest. He might excel as an accountant for all you know, so do keep your faith in him. I don't think he will take a risk and let you drink porridge everyday for the future. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Don't think too far ahead when it isn't confirmed that you will be spending your future with him. Take a break and zoom your visual back to the present world. It's easier to gain more happiness and enjoy your relationship if you would just take a step back go with the pace of your relationship...rather than fast-forwarding it to preview the anticipated future. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>You can disagree with his decision, but do try to stay within the fine lines of a concerned gf and not a possessive gf. He is who he is and you will love him as the person he is to you, never to the kind of occupation that he's holding.<br><br>For now, please make your top priority to strive for a good, happy and healthy relationship with your bf. For all you know...a lovely relationship will make him  adjust his priorities on his own accord. So you don't actually need to worry so much about it. As long as you're getting more and more lovable to him, he will definitely have to reshuffle/rethink all his present and future decisions for the sake of not losing you in his world. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
