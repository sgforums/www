            <div class='col-md body'>A close friend of mine visited her family doctor in gleneagles somewhere during june because she has frequent nose bleeding due to thin skin wall which have been deteriorating and to the point whereby there is a small hole in the back of her nose. If she sneezes too hard, she'll nose bleed.<br><br>So the doctor prescribed some medicine and a nasal spray. My friend finished the prescribed pill and have been using the nasal spray since June.<br><br>Problem 1 -&gt;<br>The doctor didn't tell my friend that the nasal spray must not be used after 3 weeks if not it'll cause an overdose.<br><br>Problem 2 -&gt;<br>The nurse issuing the medicine did not tell my friend that the spray must not be used after 3 weeks of application because she thought the doctor would have told my friend already.<br><br>Problem 3 -&gt;<br>My friend has been using the nasal spray diligently since June.<br><br>Problem 4 -&gt;<br>Today she went to the doctor and the doctor was shocked and said my friend was very heavily overdosed. Side effects are slight nervous breakdown and panic syndrome, which I can slightly testify that she is already suffering from it.<br><br>Problem 5 -&gt;<br>The ordeal caused her a lot of distressed and trauma.<br><br>Who's fault would it be? Was it my friend's fault for not asking the doctor and the nurse how long the spray can be used, or were the doctor and nurse negligent in their practice? Is it possible to file a complain, and reach a settlement out of court?<br><br>Overall, the spray did help curb the nose bleeding, but it does not justify the ordeal she suffered.<br><br>Any objective insight?</div>
