            <div class='col-md body'>I guess it all boils down to individual preferences and how much you love kids as a couple. This also boils down to the lifestyle you want to have. Anyway, I have always marvelled families who can survived on 1k or 2k a month.</div>

In fact, you are looking from a individualistic point of view and partially from an evasive mindset to indemnify yourself from complication should a divorce arise, where having children is the main source of complication.<br><br>In the end, nobody can make you see how 'good' having a child would do to your marriage/life. Until when you have the maturity to accept the RESPONSIBILITY of being a FATHER, then perhaps you may see some truth.<br><br>In the same argument, why not stay as BGR forever? Why marriage? Isn't it better? Technically, you still get to enjoy being together.<br><br>It's the same old story; until when you have the maturity to accept the RESPONSIBILITY of being a HUSBAND, then perhaps you may see some truth.<br><br>P.S: Nobody can tell you how great certain things are until you have the wisdom to understand. If you don't see it that way, probably you are just not ready.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
