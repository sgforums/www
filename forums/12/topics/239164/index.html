            <div class='col-md body'>Go to SIM and take a look. It's not bad at all. I have worked in UOB Bank and Ministry of Law before. There are several bank asst vice-presidents &amp; top civil servants who were from SIM. It was after all set up by a statutory board EDB. You can choose either UniSIM which is a local uni or overseas university. Look at SMU how it has gained so much recognition since its establishment and it is less than 10 years old. SIM has been around since 1964 and has such a wealth of experience and recognition that it is able to award its own degrees.<br><br>You can even choose to work full-time and study a flexible part time degree course like several people are doing anyway. No harm taking a look. PSB, MDIS and several other institutions are worth taking a look as well. Nothing has been wasted, don't worry. You would be amazed at how many SIM students were from N levels -&gt; ITE -&gt; Poly -&gt; Uni. Same goes for other institutes as well whether local universities or other top institutions. Education is about the journey and your satisfaction at the end of it. Some people pass a level with some luck, some people study so hard but still fail. So just take a look, you are still young.<br><br>Go through the websites and check out the courses, ranging from Engineering, to Finance, to Business, to Law, to Science etc. Go and spot those details that say "students may gain entry to be a member of Institute of Engineers Singapore/ICPAS/Law Society" etc. And good luck</div>

Its just that it all depends on what sector u are going to work in next time! Usually, in Government sector, it will be good if you have a local degree, but that doesn't mean that they will "look u no up" should u be a student who has a foreign degree. In private sector, I am not too sure, but I have a lot of friends who are in that sector that says that they somehow value more those people with foreign degrees because their thinking and mentality is different from those with local degrees. Seems that these foreign companies emphaise more on creativity, thinking skills etc and their biased perception is that local students, who are graded more on the examinations, may not be creative enough or think deep enough.</div>
