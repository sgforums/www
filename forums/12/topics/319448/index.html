              <p>Hi everyone, i sat for my A lvl in 2006, didn't do very well DDC GP A2, and as such have decided to further my studies in australia. I will ORD next year in february and have narrowed down my choices, but i'd still wish to hear your valuable advice and experience.</p>
              <p>I am interested in commerce and,</p>
              <p>Right now my only choices is to go to:</p>
              <p>1. Trinity college accelerated programme</p>
              <p>A 6 month programme that starts in july after which i enter melbourne university. My worries here is that i might not make the 85 cut off mark for entrance to commerce as the programme is described as 'intense with little breaks'</p>
              <p>2. Canning College Diploma</p>
              <p>This programme is affilated to UWA and what i do at is that i take modules related to year 1 business courses at canning after which achieving the scores of 65% i can proceed to year 2 of UWA.</p>
              <p>Has anyone tried this programme? The benefits here is that i can save a year, but i have this feeling that there aren't many international students taking this path as much as trinity, so i'm afraid i might be... the minority and outcasted?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please, I would greatly appreciate it if any advice could be given, especially if you have experienced studying in australia.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thank you very much.</p>

              i have a friend whos in the same situation as you. din do really well for alevels, ORD-ing in feb next year, and is also considering the trinity route. but having to ORD in feb, means he will have to arrive late in auzzie and miss orientation. there are plenty of international students there, so it shouldnt be hard to fit in.
              
              well i guess you really do not need to worry, i have got 2 other friends who went for the trinity route straight after olevels. one of them didnt have fantastic results in singapore, but is doing good over there.
              
              as for the other diploma, i have not heard of it before. do go to IDP at orange grove rd. they have experts there to guide u choose.
              
              im also considering an auzzie degree, so i understand the dilemma you are facing. good luck anyway.

              <p>im of similiar grades and situation as u....and have seek out alll possible  options similiar to yours as i have the same ambition as yours...haha(its almost seems that it was myself that started this thread)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>why not seek this option..(which i probably will do)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>go enrol yrself into a polytechnic(np iin this case, only requires a two yeaar study period for A level holders), to achieve a dip</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and after that, use the dip to enter yr desired choice university in aussie.(most probably u will getrt 1 yr exemptions for your efforts)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>in all u will spend four  year to complete this feat (probably the same time as u will need to get a degree in yr current plans)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>see the light??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>benefits:</p>
              <p>u save money as poly fees are cheaper and u can stay at home, thus, save on housing cost.</p>
              <p>(of course, u will have to face the stigma, of taking a step back...)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>hope this helps!</p>
