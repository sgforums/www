              <p>i broke up with my ex since the start of the yr. it was a rs of 3
              yrs n he was my first bf...we stopped contacting after the break up,
              altho i pretty much accepted the whole break up n stop being overly emo
              over him, he still pops up in my head every single day. its almost like
              my head has this habit of thinking of him...and i would have this weird
              sensation in me whenever my friend talks about him or like when i
              accidentally chance upon pics of him and his current gf on fb..</p>
              <p>then
              there's this guy who makes me happy, i find tht i am able to let go of
              all my sorrows whenever i am out wit him n juz a simple sms from him
              can brighten up my day. i dont have a lack of guy friends around me n
              he is the only 1 who makes me feel this way..but i duno if i really
              like him or not. i duno what i should do. i duno if i have even gotten
              over my ex or not. can smbody tell me what shuld i do? am i even normal
              to think this way? :/</p>

              <p>Yes you like that new guy.</p>
              <p>And you still havent totally gotten over the ex BF.</p>
              <p>I think maybe you shouldnt start a new relationship yet, before you have made a clean break, because otherwise you will be confused, and also, it's not clear whether any new guy is really suitable for you or not, or you just try to "fill up" the role that was previously played by your BF subconsciously. So in order to think clearly and to choose clearly, I think it's better to wait until you have really stabilized.</p>

              <p>The new guy is your rebound guy. And the rebound guy is probably what you need to get over your ex.</p>
              <p>However, rebound guy may also turn out to be the long term guy.</p>
              <p>Or , a rebound guy may just be your rebound guy.. but it ain't gonna hurt you to give it a shot.</p>
              <p>Depending on how the chemistry work out for the both of you.</p>
              <p>If you don't try , you'd never know.</p>
              <p>Reminiscence about your ex or ex-s is a very normal thing. Memories are memories, unless you have brain trauma, they will always remain a part of your life experiences.</p>
              <p>You may fantasise or dream about them many years later, that's absolutely normal.</p>

              <p>there's this guy who <span style="text-decoration: underline;">makes me happy</span>, i find tht i am able to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">let go of all my sorrows</span> whenever i am out wit him n juz a simple sms from him can brighten up my day</p>
              <p>Please understand this - a need is a need, Just don't (if u can) interpret it as love. U would be unfair to the other as well as to yourself.</p>
              <p>As  for this guy from the past - he is a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">psychological hangover</span> - in other words, when u do see him or relate to him - u see him with the 'eyes' of the past. It would seem real - yes, real in the mind only. The reality is one is evolving, changing, growing up. Of course, there is the other type - regressing, growing old.</p>
              <p> Well, only things are permanent - death n taxes. Everything changes!</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Just be aware of these pitfalls</span>.</p>

              <p>I'd advise against chain dating, or serial dating...  Give it a few months or a year ...</p>
              <p>One thing my friends who have been in relationships before have told me is that BGR is like a drug...  it feels so good.. knowing that you are wanted..  but then when it breaks down, everything also can make you emo...  Cannot listen to chinese song cos will get emo.. all the songs you sang together..  cannot go some places cos you went there b4 with the ex and then memories make u emo... eat also emo... sleep also cannot sleep without the sms.. wake up see all the pics and toys and gifts... if throw, then the empty room make u emo..  </p>
              <p>But looking for another BF just to fill up that hole is not gonna end up good..  fill yourself with other things first, get love from your family, and when its healed up ,dont go looking for them... make them chase you..</p>
