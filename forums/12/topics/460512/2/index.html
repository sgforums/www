              <p>Agree. Some guys just deserve it. But there are nice guys out there too. If you think u are helping her then go ahead but must have evidence, if not its all a waste of time.</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>It's very hard to be in your position as you never know how it's going to turn out for you. Even if she is not mad at you she might be embarrassed by the situation and decide not to see you anymore...</p>
              <p>First, try to get some evidence. Then, why don't you try to ask your friend directly by mentioning another case or celebrity case? I had a neighbor who was cheating on his wife... luckily I was not friend with the woman. But I had a close friend in my condo and talking about that we agreed if we would notice anything suspicious about our husbands we will let each other know. I definitely want to know but some women don't... Try to find out. If she says she would like to know then wait for a few days, invite her for lunch, show your evidences and try to comfort her...</p>
              <p>Good luck!</p>

              <p>Gather evidence first (photos?) then just send an anonymous email? But you need to consider how the wife would react in such a painful situation. Would she be capable of handling such a shock? Consider this so you may figure out the most proper way in letting her know, let all out at one go or little by little give her some hints.</p>
