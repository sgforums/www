              <p>Why that man need to wait one year ? He can divorce the wife anytime wat. That man stringing along not only his wife.. he also playing his mistress lah.</p>
              <p>Since that man and his mistress are your friend.. why you never ask them why they do such unscrupulous things ?</p>
              <p>Next time take pictures and voice recording with your smartphone lor... then send to the wife annonymously lah... with our current technology... there is no such thing as secrets anymore lah.</p>
              <p>Besides... after 10 years of marriage.. the wife probably already know something is not right with her marriage lah.... your evidence may not even be a shock to her... just something to confirm her suspicions... so yes.. go ahead and send the evidences.</p>

                  wife. But I read a lot of forums regarding this topic and they said
                  the messenger is the one who will get into trouble but I really
                  cannot put up with this!! Any suggestions on what to do? Help
                  please!!</p>

              <p>Well... since there is no children involve.. then what are you waiting for.</p>
              <p>He is an A-hole anyway... and that mistress totally deserves this kind of man.</p>
              <p>Spare that wife and set her free earlier... short pain better than being dicked around by an A-hole any longer.</p>
