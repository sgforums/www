            <div class='col-md body'>It's all fated .<br><br>I might not agree with some guy's view point here though ,all my posts has been reveal and she knows everything about what i have posted. Ironically from my first posts till now, I somehow, instinctively earlier or later she will be aware of the posts .<br><br>It takes time, care and some thinking to maintain and cultivate love, it might as simple  as you think but not yet so simple for some. Drastically, using words to describe my situation is difficult . I am sure of myself, my own thinking, my own feeling, but i am certainly uncertain of her , of her thinking , of her emotion.<br><br>You never try , you never know what's the outcome . I am trying , trying hard , but i knew being forceful bring no happiness . Love is not about being single directional , but mutually to have a fulfilling and lasting relationship.<br><br>I love her much more everyday, crazy as many of you will describe , giving up as the rest of you might suguest. One even recommend persistence.  I will augment all paths and choose the best for me .<br><br>To my gal: I love you much more than you love me , I knew , saying i love you forever is unrealistic, childish and foolish. To count the days we had , the laughter you bring into my life during this period,  the happiness that you inject into this period is wonderful  . I sincerely hope there will no end to your sunlight which will clear the cloudy skys , paving a clear blue sky . I love you .<br><br></div>
