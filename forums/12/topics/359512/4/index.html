              Singlehood is better. Its not economical to have babies at all and if you tried, you probably end up in a worst state than you were before with no money to support yourself and your child. Unless your rich of course, but we all know rich people don't have kids.

              <p> </p>
              <p>IMO are you sure you no longer love your wife? because from all the scenarios that you've given it seems that you'll return to her whenever she's hurt or she's feeling down. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When a guy truly have no feelings for a girl anymore it doesnt matter if she's creating a scene or pleading you to stay, the guy would just break off all ties with her and move on. (Oh wells maybe I'm just heartless and this doesnt apply to everyone.)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just give you and her 1 more chance, take a day off from work spend quality time with her and try to reignite that feeling you once had for her, if all these fails make a cold hard break with her, you know you've done your best in salvaging this marriage and be prepared to be heartless during the process of divorcing in order to hold on to your assets.</p>

              <p>A Chinese saying that it takes a 1000 years to be destined to share a bed and be a husband and wife. So don't talk about a divorce so easily. For a relationship to last, it takes 2 to compromise with each other.</p>
              <p>May I suggest to you that your too giving in to her demand, have a part to play in this. It had created in her the habit that things had to be done her way. Therefore you have to be firm when necessary. Talk to her. Put your foot forward for your right to have your own personal time too.</p>
              <p>Most people faced the same problem that after starting a marriage life, you start to lose all your friends, so do make sure you keep your friends. A female friend may make her jealous, so request her to join in your gather whenever possible. Similarly, participate in her gathering with her freinds whenever possible too.</p>
              <p>I would suggest that you ironed out the problems before having babies. I am one that firmly believe that babies make a marriage life complete.  It also tend to divert the 100% attention on you to the others as well.  It is also an "acheivement" that both can share But be warned taht other problems may arise as well. So, learn to resolve it together.</p>
              <p>Nobody can decide the solutiion to your problems except the 2 of you., but keeping an open communication helps</p>

              <p>GreyMeow,</p>
              <p>IMO are you sure you no longer love your wife? because from all
              the scenarios that you've given it seems that you'll return to her
              whenever she's hurt or she's feeling down. </p>
              <p>When a guy truly have no feelings for a girl anymore it doesnt
              matter if she's creating a scene or pleading you to stay, the guy
              would just break off all ties with her and move on. (Oh wells maybe
              I'm just heartless and this doesnt apply to everyone.)</p>
              <p>Just give you and her 1 more chance, take a day off from work
              spend quality time with her and try to reignite that feeling you
              once had for her, if all these fails make a cold hard break with
              her, you know you've done your best in salvaging this marriage and
              be prepared to be heartless during the process of divorcing in
              order to hold on to your assets.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>i'm sure i don't love my wife...even though i still care for her as a husband should...but it's just the way i'm brought up by my parents to take responsibilities as i should and my character.</p>
              <p>i'm the quiet calm patient type and it's hard to get me to be angry. i'm also the 'service' type. it's no wonder that i'm working in a service/support line. i'm the peace-maker for my family and friends.</p>
              <p>i think it's b'cos of these, i couldn't handle my own distress. after more than 25 yrs of 'servicing' others, everybody around me expect me to help them, not the other way around. and i couldn't articulate my problem very well (verbally). even if i tell them my problems, they will think it's not severe or i can resolve them somehow.</p>
              <p>so, even when i don't love her, i just care for my wife the only way i know until she come to term that i don't love her and let me go willingly.</p>
              <p>if both of us can get a divorce, i don't really care about my assets. she can have everything. i just want a clean break and that she or her family don't bother me again.</p>
              <p>maybe saying the above with classify me as a hypocrite, soft and
              cowardly but i honestly admit i don't know how to handle my situation
              at all.</p>
              <p>i'm desperate - i don't know how to approach her and make her come to term
              properly.and hence, seeking help desperately.</p>

              ur mind - she wants u to initiate sth - even divorce - so its ur
              responsibility, its could be a war of attrition, and even if its
              not like i have .... she is equally responsible, she is selfish -
              how ? - she is a burden on herself - a burden on u, emotional
              burden is sickness.</p>
              <p>To stay in a marriage, relationship cos one wants to not lose
              face, or lose materially, or fear the loss of one' sense of
              identity or meaning of life .... is a betrayal of oneself.</p>
              <p>Love deos not compromise, needs and fears masquerading as love
              always compromise</p>

              <p>self-flagellation...okay, make sense.</p>
              <p>relish in it? that's a horrible thought.</p>
              <p>give me a meaning of existence? maybe.</p>
              <p>i've
              been asked by psychologists before...that since i already know what i
              wanted, why am i still dragging my feet and not having the courage....i
              couldn't ans the qns. i usu. end up with a bad headache at this stage
              and had to end the session</p>
              <p>i still can't ans to the qns
              now...couldn't break thru this barrier. everytime this qns pop-up, my
              brain shut-down and i couldn't think at all...then the headache will
              come strong, painful and hard.</p>
              <p>there were some external factors that diverted me from divorce a few times.</p>
              <p>1.
              on the 3rd-4th yrs of our marriage, we were on the verge of breaking up
              the marriage. then her uncle's wife suddenly divorced him (after 19 yrs
              of marriage and 2 children) and her family was very chaotic over it. also my sis marriage life was on the rock. her husband had called the police several times and get protection for her children b'cos he said she was abusing them.</p>
              <p>2. on the 5th yrs, one of her relative committed suicide due to
              a failed relationship. also, her sis had a bad depression after her bf
              of 5 yrs (they were almost to get marry) broke up with her that same
              yr.</p>
              <p>3 on the 6th yrs, my father had stroke and the situation had my full attention</p>
              <p>anyway,
              these were external factors that kinda complicated my situation. i know
              my decision, i just need to be able to get her to accept it too</p>
