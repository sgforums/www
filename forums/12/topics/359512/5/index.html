              <p>errr...hmmm...i don't understand. what do you mean? this is too complicate for me.</p>
              <p>that i stuck myself in the past or put myself in a static present unwilling to move fwd? if this is true, then it's unintentional.</p>
              <p>consciously i want to move fwd, i want an end to this relationship...i do not know what's holding me bck. fear? maybe..of her doing something silly. maybe there are other reasons locked in my brain that i cannot access that stopping me to move fwd</p>
              <p>others told me i shouldn't care what she do to herself since it's her own life. is that also a process that i should experience and simply hope she won't do something silly?</p>

              <p>okay, i got it loud and clear now.</p>
              <p>i don't care of the material lost if i can just be free from this relationship.</p>
              <p>you captured the core of my problems. somehow i feel responsible of how she face the end of this relationship...and i don't know why (probably the four evils - family, society, the priest,
                                          the politician that's messing with my mind)</p>
              <p>the other problem is how to make her acknowledge the problems (of her denial, her insecurity) and seek help.....which again is the above (feeling responsible for her). i think i own it to her to at least somehow get her to acknowledge her problems and seek help.</p>
              <p>so, i identify the cause. strategically i know what i need to do - overcome my own mental barrier, get her to seek help, leave her, live my own life. i need a tactical action plan</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I'm 38 yrs old male. married for 7 yrs (incl. this yr). my marriage has been rough right from the start. i ve no children till now (but also mainly at certain point in our marraige, i decide i should not ve any) on the 1st 2 yrs of my marriage, she had constantly been having a bad temper scolding or critizing me on my untidiness, my hobbies, my habits, my family and so on.</p>
              <p>i think i'm a soft-spoken and thoughful person and so i often self-reflected on her comments and start to change for her. i know i'm not an untidy person, just not as tidy as her. she likes things to be exactly the way she wanted e.g. towel folded in a certain manner, cups place at a certain position, carpet laid out flat and straight (i.e no flipped corners) etc.so, every time the house's tidinees is not up to her expectations, she will flare up and start scolding and critizing me. also,</p>
              <p>i'm a gamer and love to diy my PC too. I also love to read books too. i often spend 5 days a week playing PC games 2-3 hrs. she knew about these before we marry but as soon as we were married, she clam down on it. again she will flare up the moment i start up my PC, saying i don't give her any attention, i wasting too much time, etc. i tried to negiotate with her to play only 1-2 hrs for 3-4 times a week but she won't have it. so i gave it up almost completely. i still play when she is out with her frens or when she is working late (which is not very often).</p>
              <p>so i start spending more time reading. once again, she was very angry saying i spent too much money buying the books and comic and again wasting too much time. i was a little pissed off by now but still loved her, so again i compromised and cut down on all my hobbies to almost zero time or none at all.</p>
              <p>i don't have many friends but we still meet occasionally. some of them are female. again she knew about them before marriage but won't let me go out with them at all after marriage, saying i should spend my time with her only. again, i thought maybe she is not feeling comfortable with marriage life, so i stop seeing my friends and stay with her at home most of the time or visit her parents and relatives.</p>
              <p>by the 3rd and 4th yrs, i became depressed. i became very tired easily since i'm always tense, always checking the house are in order (tidy). always checking if i'm giving her enough attention. somehow i still couldn't meet up to her expectations...so, i was also always tense..readying for her next scolding. it was also this year that we talked about divorce, we had 3 major quarrels and i mentioned about divorce. initally she would agreed...but then she would back out, saying she can't live without me. she even threaten suicide. we went to marriage counseling but she coulldn't accept the counsellor's comments, got angry and said i caused the problems that make her always getting angry. so, our counselling sessions ended without any results.</p>
              <p>by this time, i lost interest in the marriage life or life in general and was in a depression. i seeked help for my condition and start taking medication. She knew about it but thought it was just for my tiredness. I also didn't bother to explain to her anymore 'cos it was getting so hard just to live another day. naturally, during these few yrs, we didn't have any sex. in the 1st 2 yrs, she was always angry. in the next 3-4 yrs, i was always tired and i started having many different problems with my health. by now, she sensed something was wrong, we talked and she agreed to change, be less controlling, less anger.</p>
              <p>however, from the 5th yrs onwards, i found i don't love her anymore. i don't know when i stop loving her. i couldn't find back the feeling i had for her before we got married. i'm not angry with her or anything, i just don't ve any feeling for her. i still take care of her like any husband, celebrate her birthday, anniversay, valentine days, go holiday, etc. i believe she knew about it too 'cos she told me she don't want me to care for her but to love her. i tried to love her but i can't. i tried telling her it's not working but she started ignoring the problems. she rarely throw temper now but she also not facing the fact that we are both unhappy.She also start asking to have a baby.</p>
              <p>This was when i realised i cannot continue with the marriage life. i totally think she is immature, insecure and making the situation worse if we have baby. i'm unsure how to break the problems to her 'cos each time i tried to talk about it, she will flare up again and telling me to shutup.</p>
              <p>also, my depression is getting worse and i've visited various psychologists and psychatrists without any good. the doctors told me to talk to her parents but her parents are supportive of her to have a baby (in between there are many stories/issues at her parents side that complicate the problem of talking to them) . i'm too tired to fight her temper and ignorance now. i wish somebody can help me to solve my problem.</p>

              <p>yes, i got that. at the moment, i still don't any action plan or
              suggestions to let her acknowledge her problems yet. it's not going to
              easy to tell her or suggest to her anything when she is in denial and
              has no respect for me. the best i think is someone else to tell her but

              <p>No 3rd party here can tell you or advise you what is best for you. Only you can decide for yourself. Asking a couple to divorce is very bad. It takes alot to become husband &amp; wife.</p>
              <p>38yrs old is still young and dun rush to conclusion. Think of the times that both of you were happily together. Give each other space to cool things down.

              <p>thanks for your reply. i was still wondering when somebody will
              'bash' me here. i admit in the past 2 yrs i had been dragging my feet.</p>
              <p>i've
              stated my situation completely here in my post...didn't leave out much
              or being one-side in my story (although it's a post of my problems). i
              don't deny my poor handling of my marriage and was ready for any
              'bashing' when i made my post.</p>
              <p>believe it or not, the past 7 yrs
              of marriage had been hard and unhappy. i can hardly tell you of any
              happy moments. all i can say is that i'm always tense around her, not
              knowing where she will flare up for whatever reasons.</p>
              <p>i can explain to you all day all things i had tried and perhaps you will still think i'm biased.</p>
              <p>i
              didn't post my problems to give myself excuses in my failure or to make
              myself feel better or right..neither can i ask for your understanding.
              it's in my desperation too that i put up my post.</p>
              <p>it maybe true nobody knows me here and nobody can tell me what to do.</p>
              <p>after 7 yrs, i'm just an emotional wreck right now and i feel very guilty and ashamed i couldn't save my marriage..still
              i feel responsible and hope to find a way to make her acknowledge her
              problems and seek help. i still think the marriage is over for me and i just want to move on even
              if it appear selfish to you.</p>
              <p>i cannot express to you how much guilt i've towards her and i doubt you'll believe me.</p>

              <p>thanks for your reply. i was still wondering when somebody will 'bash' me here. i admit in the past 2 yrs i had been dragging my feet.</p>
              <p>i've stated my situation completely here in my post...didn't leave out much or being one-side in my story (although it's a post of my problems). i don't deny my poor handling of my marriage and was ready for any 'bashing' when i made my post.</p>
              <p>believe it or not, the past 7 yrs of marriage had been hard and unhappy. i can hardly tell you of any happy moments. all i can say is that i'm always tense around her, not knowing where she will flare up for whatever reasons.</p>
              <p>i can explain to you all day all things i had tried and perhaps you will still think i'm biased.</p>
              <p>i didn't post my problems to give myself excuses in my failure or to make myself feel better or right..neither can i ask for your understanding. it's in my desperation too that i put up my post.</p>
              <p>it maybe true nobody knows me here and nobody can tell me what to do.</p>
              <p>after 7 yrs, i'm just an emotional wreck right now and i feel very guilty and ashamed i couldn't save my marriage..still i feel responsible and hope to find a way to make her acknowledge her problems and seek help. i still think the marriage is over for me and i just want to move on even if it appear selfish to you.</p>
              <p>i cannot express to you how much guilt i've towards her and i doubt you'll believe me.</p>

              <p>Keeping quiet dun solve things in relationship.</p>

              <p>Selfishness is when one is a burden on another, when one is expecting another to be responsible for one's happiness, well-being and so on so forth.</p>
              <p>In other words, one remains a beggar, one is never an emperor, wheter it be in a marriage, or a relationship or even a friendship, the emperor is rich within, he/she is abundant - able to share without expectations. The beggar has nothing to share, what can he/she give?</p>
              <p>Translate this into the arena of everyday living (add on ....), look around, and one can see!</p>
              <p>Alas, it is misconstrued  - i m talking about richness that emanates from one's Being, one's heart.  one is either impoverished or one is abundantly overflowing</p>
