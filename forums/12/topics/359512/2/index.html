              <p>I am glad you have the presence of mind to be strong about not having children.</p>
              <p>Some relationships can be draining. It seems to be that your efforts in keeping the relationship going is draining all your resources for the rest of your life.</p>
              <p>After 7 years, it looks like you have tried your best to make a good marriage for yourself and your wife. Unfortunately, marriage takes two hands to clap. it isn't even a blame slinging exercise anymore - it really doesn't even matter who is at fault.</p>
              <p>At some stage, when you realise that, it isn't working despite having tried everything - someone needs to move on from there.</p>
              <p>It will probably be ugly and leave bad scars on both of you. But a strangling relationship will end up with both parties badly wounded anyway.</p>

              <p>as for sex, i don't think it's going to work anymore. maybe in the 1st 2 or 3 yrs of our marriage. now? i don't think so b'cos now i don't want to continue to relationship anymore. can i love her again if i've sex with her? i don't think so...just thinking about her give me a headache.</p>
              <p>i also think the problem is now with me...b'cos i didn't want the
              relationship to work anymore..but i just don't know how to get her to
              sit down and talk it out maturely and properly...and i know i m
              dragging the problem b'cos i'm not strong and of cos, the depression is
              not helping to make me stable and strong. (hence, i'm here seeking for

              <p>Correct me if i'm wrong.</p>
              <p>A seperation is different from a divorce in that a divorce needs to be agreed on by both parties while a seperation can be a 1 sided affair and after a few yrs of seperation can a legal divorce be made even if the other party does not agree. Its also partly to give both parties time apart to consider their relationship and whether divorce is really what they want.</p>

              <p>someone has to start breaking the cycle. </p>
              <p>if i may suggest, you put aside your ego for 1 week. do everything you can to show that you love and care for her. buy her flowers, write a card, spend quality time with her (i know not easy)</p>
              <p>do everything to show that you love her. then see how she respond. my guess is, she will start showing respect.</p>
