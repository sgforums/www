              <p><br>yes, it's always 'pretty clear' from a person not in the situation.</p>
              <p>presently, what i can do is to be more firm and strong against her temper and fix my emotional/depression issues.</p>
              <p>after 7 yrs of living in this situation, nothing is 'pretty clear'...so appreciate if you tell me what is 'pretty clear' to you. thanks.</p>

              <p>It is pretty clear whatever we tell you goes in from one ear and goes out the other.</p>
              <p>After 10 pages of good and bad advice, you are still stuck at square one.</p>
              <p>It is pretty clear you still can't make up your mind.</p>
              <p>After all this "counselling" you are still not taking action.</p>
              <p>It is pretty clear that you should divorce her.</p>
              <p>Yet you are still sitting in front of your com and complaining to us.</p>

              <p>As a person who just completed my Divorce, let me tell you it's painful but necessary.</p>
              <p>Why ?</p>
              <p>1. Unless you decide to really restart the relationship, someone is always going to bring up the past.</p>
              <p>2. Better to kill it now or end up living in regret.</p>
              <p>3. Kill the whole relationship forever, don't even look her up or anything, treat her as a real stranger.</p>
              <p>4. Don't make the life of your future kid miserable.</p>
              <p>Why because when you have kids, you have a responsibility to them.</p>

              <p>Hi grey.</p>
              <p>Short term pain is better than long term pain. You yourself have found the answer to all these problems. You dont love her. Short and sweet. From what it seems, divorce is inevitable.</p>
              <p>Just be mentally prepared for the problems that will hit you, dont fall down. Stay strong. Remember, its your happiness that your fighting for, your living your life and it should not be dictated by your current situation. I guess, slow steps to head towards divorce is a neccesity, it is important as she wouldnt get a shock or what. Everyone deserves happiness in a marriage. When a marriage has failed and cannot be salvaged due to external factors or long term of trying, you know what to do.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, its your life, as long as you feel you did the right thing, screw what other people think. Be strong mentally.</p>

              <p>Marriage is an institution - persons are not. It is the <strong>lack of friendliness</strong>, not love that spoils, destroys  ..... Marriages dont fail, people fail, love does not hurt, its something else that is parading as love n when it is not reciprocated - one hurts.</p>
              <p>Love knows no fear, knows no reasons, knows no boundaries- its <span style="text-decoration: underline;">beyond the mind, beyond reasons</span>.</p>
              <p>You say:<em> 'At the same time, I'm also trying to be more strong and firm with her. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If I still can't stand her or she still treat me badly</span>....then I'll give up.'</em></p>
              <p> No one can change another with words - changes comes about thru <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your behaviour</span> - if u can be a catalyst for change that is sufficient.</p>
              <p>As to whether you want to stay or leave, to me, its makes no difference - I say that cos what is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unresolved, not reconciled within oneself</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is always there</span>, it would surface in a situation/circumstance.</p>

              <p>I must say something.</p>
              <p>I must tell you about DIVORCE</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) 3 years of separation with her concerns.</p>
              <p>2) 4 years of separation without her concerns.</p>
              <p>3) House will return to HDB</p>
              <p>4) She can Claim maintenance.</p>
              <p>5) Both You and Her live in REGRETS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>UNLESS YOU FOUND NEW LOVE.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>YOUR BRIAN REMEMBER THINGS. you will constantly remember her.</p>
              <p>you once loved her. unless someone win your heart.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BUT DIVORCE IS NOT A JOKING MANNER.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>YOUR CASE CAN STILL BE SOLVED, without divorce.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the farker marriage consultant only mess up. you are not young any more. you are 38.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>from reading what you type up. i summarize something. something which many people will not see.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) you like playing video game, she nag you. ok. believe me, after you sign the deeds of separation. you won't even want to touch the game pad.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) you read comics, she nag you. believe me, after you sign the deeds of separation. you won't even want to touch the papers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) you are messy, she nag you, believe me, after you sign the deeds of separation. you will be extremely neat. for no reason.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) you are depressed now, because you afraid she nag you,believe me, after you sign the deeds of separation. you will feel even more depressed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5) you will live in regrets. you will one day wake up saying you will want her back even if it take your life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>HUMAN always regrets. regrets of many things. so take my advice. don't do it man.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>yeah you might see others saying divorce is good, it put an end to one problem. but loneliness at old age is a problem.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for me, from a certain angle, i can see that you just didn't treasure her enough., thus she become your burden. losing her over some games/books/dirtiness/messiness/ other female friends are rubbish!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>UNLESS she have another guy and you can't take it, you let her go. UNLESS you have another girl and you considered. found the other lady is better, you let her go.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for your case. you must seriously reconsider.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seems like i am the one of the few who tell you to reconsider.</p>
              <p>but still, you must take our advice. Don't do it man. Don't do it. if you bother to post here, that mean you still want to seek advice, seek her, that mean you are still unsure, that's mean she's still a part in your mind. that's mean in a certain corner of the vast universe of your heart, she still there. you just have to find her back.</p>

              <p>Dear Mr Firecracker, follow these few steps carefully before giving the next advice and you can never go wrong.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Hold a  live hand grenade to your crotch</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2)Remove the safety clip and pull the safety pin.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) Count to 100 as fast as you can even though this is not really necessary</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4) Forget about step 4 (cuz you don't need ear plugs)</p>
