              <p>you're right. i didn't think about it in this way...that i was
              unfair with regards to her recognizing my depression. my apologies.
              i guess i've to find an opportunity to break the news to her.</p>
              <p>well....yes, i'm afraid of hurting her feelings and her family's
              feelings too. her family have high expectations of us..that we'll
              give them a baby soon. it's going to be very hard and shocking for
              all of them. i doubt her family will let me leave after i break the
              news to them. her mum is the same 'controlling' type. she'll want
              me to 'work it out' with my wife   immediately.</p>
              <p>my wife and her mum are not in good term. they often quarrel
              b'cos both want to be controlling. her mum will sure to criticize
              her and make her 'small' the moment i break the news. she is her
              dad fav daughter, so her dad will sure to kill me....if not,
              question and persuade me not to do it.</p>
              <p>it'll be history repeating itself when her uncle (her mum's bro)
              wife divorced him. every single members incl. the relatives cursed
              and blamed the woman for leaving her uncle as if there is no fault
              from her uncle.</p>
              <p>i must say i very dread doing what you suggested. i really feel
              very bad to say it but i don't think i can handle that
              situation.</p>

              <p>May I ask.. do you live for yourself.. or do you live for others.</p>
              <p>I understand the pressure from her family. But have you consider the fact that YOU have your family too ?</p>
              <p>Do you know that your own parents will be heart broken.. when they found out that you had to live your life according to your wife and her family's wishes , and disregarding your own ?</p>
              <p>Do you know that your own family and friends will be sad.. when they see you falling apart because you are trying so hard to please some group of people who only cares for themselves ?</p>
              <p>I can fully understand the pressure you face.. but you must understand that .. this is YOUR life.. and you answer to no one but yourself... and than GOD.( if you are religious).</p>
              <p>So who cares what her family thinks of you  or expect of you ? Are you not giving yourself too much credit ? Are you afraid of losing this very "important" status in HER family ????</p>
              <p>They may grief over the lost of a relative in law and the end of this union.. but by the time your ex wife.. finds a new love.. you will be nothing but HISTORY.</p>
              <p>You only get one chance to live this life... live it the way you want... and think about your OWN parents first.. they are the ones who raised you. Have you forgotten them ???</p>

              <p>i don't agree or disagree..was thinking that to you, the spouse who wanted to end the marriage will be the bad spouse regardless of reasons. so just want to know more of your thoughts.</p>
              <p>if there is a family to begin with..then yes, breaking up sounds bad.</p>

              <p>To Ts,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well as you've mention that you might not be able to articulate ur problems verbally or your wife would just shut you up whenever you wanna do the talking, I suggest you communicate with her through some other ways.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What i'm suggesting is through mails/letter, you can write down how you feel and what are your plans and decisions, pass it on to your wife I believe sometimes using the indirect way to approach a problem might be more effective, as compared to confronting each other when both of you are agitated and arent thinking properly, through letters and mails it'll give the sender more time to think through what his going to write for his content as well as the receiver to have more time to go through the content of the letter and what it really meant.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So I assume that your mind is set on divorcing? Sometimes even though you're 100% sure that you dont love her anymore when the time really comes that she's INDEED leaving you, you might realise how important she is to you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However its your life and you only live it once, so make a decision that you wont regret and stick to it. Be a man do the right thing.</p>

              <p>Well.. you stop loving her.. because she don't give you the gratification you seek.</p>
              <p>In other words.. you don't give for nothing.</p>
              <p>You give so you want to feel appreciated, so you do live for yourself.</p>
              <p>When your parents are proud of you for your achievements.. you are receiving some form of gratification .. pride. If your parents don't show pride .. you will feel that your hard work is all for naught. The same goes for your master degree which you have decided to forgo.. because you don't see the gratification from such efforts.</p>
              <p>When you provide good customer service.. you feel good about your ability to fullfill the customer's needs.. and that is gratification. If all your customer complains you suck even after doing your very best.. you'd probably find another non-customer related job.</p>
              <p>When you become the good brother.. you get respect from your siblings. And that is gratification.</p>
              <p>SO.. the reason why you stopped loving your wife.. is because.. you don't get the gratification from her. You are not getting the respect you seek by giving in.. you are not getting more love nor approval from her when you forgo your hobbies..and so you stopped trying to please her.</p>
              <p>The most hurtful of all for men.. is to feel so inadequate when your woman complains about being poor... unable to afford a life pleasure.. when you have studied so hard to get your part time degree.. work so hard to bring home the bacon.. so you feel like your past efforts are all for naught.</p>
              <p>If you don't disagree.. I think you really need to convey this part of your life to her.  Let her some time to digest this.... if she still don't get it.. then it's not too late to leave the marriage.</p>

              your ability to fullfill the customer's needs.. and that is
              gratification. If all your customer complains you suck even after
              doing your very best.. you'd probably find another non-customer
              related job.</p>
              <p>When you become the good brother.. you get respect from your
              siblings. And that is gratification.</p>
              <p>SO.. the reason why you stopped loving your wife.. is because..
              you don't get the gratification from her. You are not getting the
              respect you seek by giving in.. you are not getting more love nor
              approval from her when you forgo your hobbies..and so you stopped
              trying to please her.</p>
              <p>The most hurtful of all for men.. is to feel so inadequate when
              your woman complains about being poor... unable to afford a life
              pleasure.. when you have studied so hard to get your part time
              degree.. work so hard to bring home the bacon.. so you feel like
              your past efforts are all for naught.</p>
              <p>If you don't disagree.. I think you really need to convey this
              part of your life to her.  Let her some time to digest
              this.... if she still don't get it.. then it's not too late to
              leave the marriage.</p>

              <p>well, yes &amp; no. yes, i do need gratification but it's not that i'm angry over it. just sad. even if it is just seeing the happy face on the other people.</p>
              <p>i think everybody humanly so and servicing others at one point in time
              or another will need some form of gratification..i believe even those
              people who saved or take care of others get a form
              of gratification just knowing a life is saved even though they don't
              expect anything out of the others.</p>
              <p>it may sound cynical but
              everything we do that involve loving, helping or servicing others can
              be view as needing gratification in th end....one form or another.</p>
              <p>i'm not angry over her for not showing gratification...just sad that
              whatever i do seems to get her diapproval or not up to her expectations but that's over.</p>
              <p>so, i agreed with you but it's just that i don't know how to convey this
              part of my life to her well.</p>
              <p>frankly,
              now after all the comments/suggestions/advices from everyone in this
              post, i still don't know what's stopping me from walking out of her
              life or talking to her about it.</p>
              <p>i agreed that i want out and i
              don't love...yet there is barrier mentally that i can't get across to
              open it up to her and settle it. i can't articulate this 'barrier'
              wel., it's like a paranoiding fear of the final confrontation...i'm so cowardly
              hopeless.</p>

              <p><br>There's somewhere for you to start. Talk to her about it, write her a letter or email or something to tell her how you feel. I'm pretty sure your wife doesn't read minds so she probably doesn't even know she's causing you such hurt.</p>

              <p>you got it right. i've to fix myself first...but i just don't know how. my 'foundation'/upbring is obviously flawed and right now, there is nothing for me to fall back on (no friend, no family, etc) to rebuild it. it's really a shitty predicament....</p>
