            <div class='col-md body'>I had the same feeling too that night when my granny passed away when i was in Sec 4 (I still remembered it was September 2003).<br><br>I don't know why but i had no mood to do anything and for some reason i felt really sad as though someone close is leaving me. And then the phone call came from my uncle in the hospital. He told my mum that my grannny cannot make it much longer (I think she was also diagnosed with cancer) and asked her to rush down to the hospital immediately. Straight after my mum put the phone down i can sense that she's gonna break down in tears. My heart sunk.<br><br>I canÂ’t even get to see her for one last time becos my mum told me to look after my nephew (3 years old den) who was staying with us den. When i was at her funeral i found out something from my mum - my granny passed away with a smile. At least that made me "happier" by a bit as I heard that she had gone thru alot of pain in the chemotherapy and radiotherapy.<br><br>I can see that u're a filial grandson/granddotter. These 100 days are too short to forget and move on. Give yourself some time and i'm sure ur grandma is smiling somewhere out there and acknowledging that she had a wonderful grandson/granddotter.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>
