Even pple who attend their service says so...<br><br>And if u actually think that my earlier msg was said literally... haha, its suppose to be ironic and sarcastic! Duh!!! Sorry.. protestant humor.. hehe!!</div>

So are u an undergraduate, or post-graduate doing research? Try your best to hang onto your studies.. Nothing beats a good education for solid backing... For nite driving... This is tough job, u know all those main wet market distribution points which open in the early morning around 2-3am? its in Pasir pajang if i am not wrong. Its the place where market sellers get their supply of fish to sell from, ask the aunties and uncles where is the distribution point for where they get their fish. (for veg, its a diff wholesale point), confirmed they will tell u where it is cause they all get their fish mainly from 1 of the few wholesale distribution points. So definitely they would need drivers somewhere to send the goods to the markets... sure got job. but know the time, it starts at around 2-3am.. bloody tough job. but pay for drivers is definitely better as its the graveyard shift.<br><br>Feel really sorry for u. u should know that u ain't suppose to give more food to others than what u need... Know u wanna help, but in the end, u still need to eat rite? And now, u bear their troubles and problems too. I hope my suggestion helps. But u are nuts to do it cause u would be working 24/7... u need to rest too rite? getting sick now would only make the situation worstl.... Best of luck</div>

At this rate, both industries aren't doing too well and getting very competitive.<br></div>
