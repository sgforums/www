So are u an undergraduate, or post-graduate doing research? Try your best to hang onto your studies.. Nothing beats a good education for solid backing...</div></blockquote>I'm not a research student. I work full-time at the university. The pay is low compared to what my friends get outside. The university doesn't pay well.<br><br><blockquote><strong>For nite driving... This is tough job, u know all those main wet market distribution points which open in the early morning around 2-3am? its in Pasir pajang if i am not wrong. Its the place where market sellers get their supply of fish to sell from, ask the aunties and uncles where is the distribution point for where they get their fish. (for veg, its a diff wholesale point), confirmed they will tell u where it is cause they all get their fish mainly from 1 of the few wholesale distribution points. So definitely they would need drivers somewhere to send the goods to the markets... sure got job. but know the time, it starts at around 2-3am.. bloody tough job. but pay for drivers is definitely better as its the graveyard shift.</strong></blockquote>Thanks for the idea. I will look up and see if any of the market stall people can link me up with anything for Fri and Sat nights.<br><br><blockquote><strong>Feel really sorry for u. u should know that u ain't suppose to give more food to others than what u need...

But u are nuts to do it cause u would be working 24/7... u need to rest too rite? getting sick now would only make the situation worstl.... Best of luck</strong></blockquote>Sometimes, it's a call to duty. I couldn't just leave them there to fight it out on their own. And now I pay the price for helping too. I'm almost to the point of begging for help and charity, but I don't of anyone out there who would look upon me now with such favour. So I'm trying to struggle on.<br><br>Regards, Colin Teo</div>

I did some other sums along the way too. The worst kind of liability I can think of while being in Singapore is to own a car. A HDB flat is still not so bad since it can be financed by CPF (20% of our pay is going to go in there anyway).<br><br>To own a car that cost around S$80,000, the overall cost over seven years (which will include road tax, parking, fuel, insurance), is going to bring the cost of owning the car at around S$140,000!!!

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks, I did my sum too, and yes, your're right - car is the worst liability - no appreciation level at all.  HDB, well, it depends how you use it.  If you rent it a room or two to cover mortage, it's good.  However, if you take a loan to renovate, that throws the sum off again.  At the end of the day, if you have positive passive cash flow, that's good, otherwise, re-do sum.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The important thing to consider now is to try and ensure that some money goes into savings after all the expenditures are considered, ie. monthly food, PUB bills, transport, loans (hopefully non by that time).<br><br>Then with the savings, plan out what is necessary to be purchased. Excess luxuries should only be considered when the initial planned savings have been set aside and there is excess from previous months to be considered for luxuries.<br><br>And even with that excess from previous months, it would be useful to set that aside as savings too. Things like a car can wait. Perhaps I might consider one after I get married and when we plan for kids (but that entire plan has to be shelved for now).<br><br>In this time and age, cash in your own pocket (or in your bank accounts) is at least some form of comfort against the bleak outlooks of tomorrow.
