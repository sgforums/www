              <p>How can I make my hubby love me more?</p>
              <p>He is now very focused and consumed by work, which I understand is necessary for men, and I don't wish to stand in his way or disturb him. I really wish I could be more self sufficient and not depend on him emotionally. I know it's very difficult to have to feel bad when you think your wife is unhappy with you not spending enough time with her.</p>

              <p>We already did. He told me he is going thru a difficult phase at work where by he just started a new job, i been asking frens about it and they all say as with all new jobs, there is normally a learning curve that can be challenging at the start, they say it's normal.</p>
              <p>Why should it be me that he is ultimately after? I thought men normally put career first. I know my hubby is the sort who puts his career on a high priority and achieving is very important to him.</p>
              <p>We spoke already about the issue, and he kept on insisting it's not about me at all, and it's really about work. He also said he feels he's not living up to his own expectations.</p>
              <p>I dont mind him focusing on his work, but i just wish he won't shut down emotionally from me when he does. When he is deep in focus in his work in the living room, he will sleep outside on the couch and refuse to sleep beside me in the room. There was also once he suggested out of practicality that I go back to my parents' place for the time being until things improve cos at least I will have company there, I reacted strongly to the suggestion and said we're married, how can I go back and live at my parents (although I do go back now and then about once a week)? Anyway beside the concept being inappropriate, I dread what my mom would react and say, she will give me a earful.</p>
              <p>And we got married very recently in less than 6 mths ago.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I dun know much abt marriage life. But I am in my early 30s and I am also working hard. A man like us, when we say, leave us alone, its best to leave us alone, take it literally. The more u try to understand, the more he will feel that u are stifling him. But u did things well like just making him food and drinks and then leave him to his work, he will appreciate it when he finished his work, trust me, i am like that also.</p></div>

              <p>err yeah i have some frens to tell me to get some kinky costumes or lace lingeries lol and use sex to relax him and lure him out of the shell.. but I dun think it will help. My hubby is a very serious person and very career oriented and goal oriented..</p>
              <p>btw should explain my hubby did not change company, it's the same organisation he's been serving since he started work after university so there is no probation period, but it is an entirely new job in an entirely new place. But same organisation.</p>

              <p>Thanks for your testimony, it's very encouraging to me to know that some other men have experienced this before... why didn't you just marry your wife then instead of postponing the wedding, I thought after ppl marry they feel they can then focus on their career cos they have 'laid to rest' the other big part of their lives?</p>
              <p>Yea I tried to be nice to him, tried to order food for him, and iron his clothes, but he did not respond well, just told me to leave him alone.

              <p>I'd say things were worse and have improved slightly since he came back from a work trip 2 days ago (we actually went out for a yummy seafood dinner once on the weekend after he returned, an amazing feat in the last 1.5 months). I guess he had been extra busy with the trip preparation. But I know he will continue to be stressed.</p>

              <p>Don't disturbed him.</p>
              <p>When he gives you an answer already, that it. It's the answer from you. Since that he has already told you it's not about you, then take it.</p>
              <p>Try to cheer him up (especially in this time) and tell him that you'll be there for him no matter what. Give him your support when he needs it. Try cooking some dishes for him.</p>
              <p>***Seriously*** Cook something for him!!!! Show him some love~ by making some effort in learning or cooking something for him =DD Girl who can cook meals are homely. You learn some cooking, learn some desert, learn some snacks etc hao ma?</p>
              <p>Your man is busy working leh - he wants to concentrate working. He seems not responding well, but he does loves you. :) Maybe one day out of the blue, he will priase your cooking skills.</p>
              <p>Ahhh!! Tabo-Alert!!!!<br>Never Never pester him about your cooking skills. Because it irks guys. When it's nice, he'll tell you it's nice. When it's bad, he might give you suggestion (AND PLease take note).</p>

              <p>I hadn't been good at anything. So when my wife brought up the idea of marriage, I wasn't confident enough I could provide for her. I think the reason I postponed the wedding could be that I was so sure I am not good enough for her. So I thought maybe by postponing the wedding I could make her see she could have a better life with someone else. Very silly of me. Haha</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lol! Every girl had dreamy hopes for their wedding day. I remembered my mum told me that my grandma told her to think twice about marriage because life changes after that. Aside from love, financial matters and other things comes in and that was the ancient days.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Getting stressed is without doubt. It may not be my place to say this, hence no offence. See, you are married. As I mentioned above after marriage other things other than love comes in to place. However love and faith are still essential for couples to stay couples, I believe. Both of you are working, I do wonder whether you over-exert yourself too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My advice though. Coming end of the year, if both of you have leftover leaves and cash go for an overseas trip with friends or relatives. Doesn't have to be grand, a change of environment, a time your husband know he could relax. At least for that time you could have fun with him and maybe upon getting back to work he could have some burden lifted up. Works for me, though I like travelling and my hobby is photography.</p>

              <p>TS, I think you don't really understands man.</p>
              <p>Man are basically practical person. They do things in a very rational manner or rather the most practical manner. This explains why he asked you to live at your parent's house cos he dun want you to feel alone and leftout. He didn't meant that you gonna live at your parent's house for months right, it is only temporary.</p>
              <p>For a woman, as you know, are emotional person. You values emotional stability more than financial stability. However, it is very difficult for a man to juggle between work and wife, so compromise has to be reached. In this case, I believe your hubby is working hard for your future, so just tolerate through this moment. In a marriage, there are more huddles to conquer, so don't break down for such a small problem.</p>
