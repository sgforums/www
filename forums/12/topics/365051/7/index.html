              <p>Yeah no worries, I do not think that it's a justification. i was
              only 'forced' to stand my ground because some people had stubbornly
              maintained - with almost deity-like all knowing certainty of the
              larger universe- that they're aware of all the kind of personality
              of all men in the world and that there is NO way it's possible for
              anyone to be career involved or obsessed to this extent, and hence
              that there is 'more', by that there alleging there is a larger or
              other issue that is endemic in the marriage that I'm supposed to
              explore, and also the second consequent allegation that I am "in
              denial".<br> <br> I never meant for this character of my husband and the former
              character of xtrevier as a form of justication for his
              behaviour.</p>

              <p>I know there will be guys who can be very obsessed with their careers...and it is good you are not using the fact that there are a lot like him out there to justify that his behaviour is something you must tolerate.</p>
              <p>Actually it is more or less up to you. If you think you can accept being ignored day and night, the fact that his job is more important than you...then you can bite the bullet and carry on. But don't think that just by standing by his side silently, he will come to his senses one day. Humans tend to take things for granted and once he thinks you are alright with him ignoring you for the sake of his job, he will continue down this road.</p>
              <p>And tolerating this fault of his doesn't really prove that your love is so deep and noble...in fact it will cause the detriment of your marriage and also causes him to break down one day due to overwork...you should help him to become a better person for the benefit of the two of you, not just suffer in silence and hope he will wake up on his own one day...</p>

              <p>TheMissus, if this makes you happy, then so be it.
              You've been waiting through 6 pages of posts
              for someone to provide a "correct" answer, and xtreyier
              has happened to provide it, and you sound supremely satisfied.
              Good luck to your marriage.</p>

              <p>I also feel the same way...it is obvious that she already has the solution in her mind even as she is posting...I think she is just seeking reassurances that she is making the correct decision. So as long as we said something which is not in line with what she is thinking of (suffering in silence beside the husband for many years to come), she will reject the possibility...oh well...</p>

              <p>TheMissus, could we know what line of work your hubby is in? It
                  sounds like an extremely overwhelming job. investment banking? I've
                  not heard of any other job which requires one to be on-duty almost
                  24 hrs a day (10 pm emails?!) Perhaps we could view things in
                  better context if we understood his line of work and his
                  motivations, which you have claimed is the central problem in your
                  marriage. Some types of jobs are just that demanding.</p>

              <p>if it is not a problem, then it need not be tolerated.</p>
              <p>it is okay for a man or woman to be obsessed with anything to the extent of oblivion. because everyone has different principles, different goals to seek, different means of attaining wat they seek.</p>
              <p>okay fine. granted some humans could care less. they don't need to see/touch/communicate for months on end and their lives and r/s is still problem free. Y? because neither party is deprived. both are okay with that arrangement. hence the union works. they are happy. they live together, exist in a commitment bound by their own standards and definitions.</p>
              <p>the problem now is, TS needs more love from husband. and he has no time/ability/whatever to give her more for now.</p>
              <p>so she has choice A, option B, life C, resolution D... there is no definite way to solve the problem, possibilities are endless. yes it doesn't matter.</p>
              <p>but she needs to take it upon herself to make a change. not place her own happiness onto the hands of her husband.</p>
              <p>y wait for him to respond, wake up, give her more love or provide more happiness?</p>
              <p>y not look to the future with reality in mind?</p>
              <p>everything is in her own hands. not in the hands of god, his work, his mindset.</p>
              <p>in life, wat she want, must match wat she choose.</p>
              <p>proceed knowingly. not hopefully. not passively.</p>

              <p>if it is not a problem, then it need not be tolerated.</p>
              <p>it is okay for a man or woman to be obsessed with anything to
              the extent of oblivion. because everyone has different principles,
              different goals to seek, different means of attaining wat they
              seek.</p>
              <p>okay fine. granted some humans could care less. they don't need
              to see/touch/communicate for months on end and their lives and r/s
              is still problem free. Y? because neither party is deprived. both
              are okay with that arrangement. hence the union works. they are
              happy. they live together, exist in a commitment bound by their own
              standards and definitions.</p>
              <p>the problem now is, TS needs more love from husband. and he has
              no time/ability/whatever to give her more for now.</p>
              <p>so she has choice A, option B, life C, resolution D... there is
              no definite way to solve the problem, possibilities are endless.
              yes it doesn't matter.</p>
              <p>but she needs to take it upon herself to make a change. not
              place her own happiness onto the hands of her husband.</p>
              <p>y wait for him to respond, wake up, give her more love or
              provide more happiness?</p>
              <p>y not look to the future with reality in mind?</p>
              <p>everything is in her own hands. not in the hands of god, his
              work, his mindset.</p>
              <p>in life, wat she want, must match wat she choose.</p>
              <p>proceed knowingly. not hopefully. not passively.</p>
              <p>btw i don't get it. y is infidelity in the picture? it's
              irrelevant.</p>

              <p>I see what you mean..so you're saying (with a lot of truth) that my problem will cease to be a problem the moment I can alter my expectations. The problem now lies in my feeling my expectations are not met. If I manage my expectations, the problem is solved. Like you said there are couples who do not meet or talk for months on end and they are happy with the arrangement. I will work on that.. its strange but I have never thought of this before.</p>

              <p>Of course the result won't appear right after the confrontation but there must be some effort made to get it across to the husband that hey, something is not right, we need to talk about it now.

              <p>every relationship is unique, has its own dynamics.</p>
              <p>sometimes u persuade, convince and beg, sometimes he's put in dat position while u compensate or ignore him. our roles are ever changing. dat's wat makes life interesting, it's never smooth sailing, devoid of problems and challenges.</p>
              <p>since his background, character and profession obviously doesn't allow him to evolve in terms of personal r/s at this point, so y not u evolve first?</p>
              <p>maybe he will pick up ur tempo and move along towards u, with u again.</p>
              <p>if he doesn't, then y does it matter since u're honest with urself, true to ur own attitude and needs, and chose ur best possible move?</p>
              <p>sometimes when u free urself from a chain, good things unravel and come to u.</p>
              <p>i'm starting to sound like a freaking horoscope here so this will be my last post.</p>
              <p>Missus, do take some time out and regain ur perspective. and who knows, maybe 10 years down the road the both of u will look back and be glad u handled this situation in a strong, confident and mature way.</p>

              <p>My husband can be pretty preoccupied with his work sometimes but we agree that we will try to spend at least 1 hour everyday with each other, be it having lunch or dinner together. And one day of the weekends will be reserved for family time...</p>
              <p>Most importantly, it is not about the quantity of time spent, but the quality. Spending one hour with me everyday doesn't mean we will just sit together in the same room and ignore each other..it means we will spend that time communicating, maybe updating each other about what has been going on at work, etc...</p>

              <p>In my opinion, you should:</p>
              <p>- Give him space for the next 1-2 months, for him to learn his new job</p>
              <p>- But after that, if his pattern is still the same, you should mention to him that you object to it, and ask him to rebalance his priorities and his time schedule</p>

              <p>Basically, I see that your husband character might be a recurring problem. You have to talk to him that he can be ambitious but must remember to balance his life, and not act like he is a single man.</p>
              <p>If he listens to you, I think there is a chance he can change. Of course, changing a basic personality character is difficult, but this is not really changing, it's merely adjusting or moderating it. It's merely paying attention and spending energy on another additional thing, which he should be doing, as a husband.</p>
              <p>So good luck to you.</p>

              <p>I have spoken to him. He says that basically, if he feels he is not doing well @ work, he cannot feel happy outside of work. his perceived performance at work will affect his overall state as a person, he says this is normal of guys.</p>
              <p>He asked me imagine any of his bosses 'flailing' at work, how could they possibly feel happy on the weekends and be relaxing and partying? Anyway my hubby was never the party animal type. He is a serious person, especially when he is working, he's also a strong leader.</p>
              <p>He maintains that he is tied up (time, energy and commitment-wise) to his work now, and says I knew full well the intensity of his job, and his last postings though not as intense as now, was also much more intense than the average person and I sucked it up and never once complained and knew full well of the terms of the relationship when we started it.</p>
              <p>But he says the situation will not be permanent, however he can't tell me what is the end date of this situation as of cos being unable to tell the future, he doesn't know when he is good enough to meet his standards (in the new job).</p>

              <p>I agree, but it's not like the change will occur tomorrow after
                          a confrontation today, sadly a fact unacknowledged by our

              <p>It takes time and patience, but the gentle will must be there,

              <p>Thanks for your kind words. But..I am only a nobody, insignificant, just another nick on the net, speaking freely, with the hope not to change perceptions but only to present more views, may be right or may be wrong, for others to consider and make decisions on, if they wish to. </p>
              <p>I am not important. You are the important one here, seeking for views to help salvage or improve your marriage, a noble aspiration everyone of us who can, should help.</p>
              <p>Everyone else matters egalitarian-wise, for we are all one race - humanity, more so our fellow citizens.</p>
              <p>Hope you will find solace in whatever you decide upon. Good luck and be happy always. Cheers,<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>Let's just put aside the 'disconnect' for the time being (which I still feel is the primary point to explore.)</p>
              <p>Even if its true your husband neglects you due to work-obsession, it remains the case that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>work obsession is not a valid reason for neglecting your wife</strong></span>.</p>
              <p>Since this is a fresh 6 month marriage, it seems clear he is not aware of the emotional maintenance that females require.</p>
              <p>You need to stop viewing your husband as a victim suffering from some sort of sickness or obsession. If you worship him to the extent you cannot see his faults, your marriage will be in trouble. To be honest, assuming I shut my eyes to the 'disconnect' issue, your husband is frankly just being an insensitive bastard.</p>
              <p>You should consider using either soft approach (sex him up) or hard approach (threaten him) and make him wake up to your sensitivities. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Do not keep wallowing in pity and harping on his obsession as if he were a victim or patient in need.</strong></span><strong> </strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Remember, women do not need very much in terms of emotional maintenance. It is the small things that count. Little things like voluntary peck on cheek, pat on backside, and one-liner flirts, take no more than a few seconds. No matter how work obsessed a man is, they can satisfactorily create romance<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> if they want to.</span></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You repeatedly say your husband is 100% consumed by work thoughts. Sounds like an insensitive bastard to me, not a victim.</p>

              <p>Thanks artspraken. That is why I spoke to him. What do you think of his explanation?</p>
              <p>He can be a bit insensitive at times, but he's not here to present his side of the story while I am. I too have my insensitive moments, when I make very cutting or curt remarks to him when i feel mean or out of spite, especially against people I don't like.</p>
              <p>I am also a bit afraid of making him angry, as when he is (very) angered, he is very fierce.. can yell at me real loud. maybe I just have a knack at pissing men off.</p>

              <p>His explanation is long-winded bullshit lah.</p>
              <p>Basically, he is saying:</p>
              <ol>
              <li>"my job very intense"; and </li>
              <li>"I am very busy".</li>
              </ol>
              <p><strong><em>My retort is: SO WHAT?</em></strong></p>
              <p>I think he dunno what it takes to be a husband. He need to grow up. He think everybody's lives revolve around him hah? Hello! He wanna be husband. Husband got duty to wife okay. At the barest minimum, the least a wife can expect is to get bang by her husband.  Even if he wanna be insensitive bastard, at the very least be a man and knock up your own wife right? Where got 4 months no action wan. If he got bad libido, hello, other men make the effort to battle impotence by sourcing for viagra, lingerie, festish etc etc ok. Even if your husband got no mood for sex, does he at least make some effort with his little brother? does he even make an effort to talk to his wife or romance his wife? If he does not even try, it means he does not even care. He does not know how to be husband. All this bullshit about work is just excuse. It is a convenient excuse that every man can recognise lor.</p>
              <p> If he fails as a husband, for a wife that is acceptable provided that failure is preceded by effort. If he is failing because there is no effort made at all, then he really does not have what it takes to be a man, nevermind a husband lor.</p>
