              <p>TS, I think you don't really understands man.</p>
              <p>Man are basically practical person. They do things in a very rational manner or rather the most practical manner. This explains why he asked you to live at your parent's house cos he dun want you to feel alone and leftout. He didn't meant that you gonna live at your parent's house for months right, it is only temporary.</p>
              <p>For a woman, as you know, are emotional person. You values emotional stability more than financial stability. However, it is very difficult for a man to juggle between work and wife, so compromise has to be reached. In this case, I believe your hubby is working hard for your future, so just tolerate through this moment. In a marriage, there are more huddles to conquer, so don't break down for such a small problem.</p>

              <p>i agree. i suggest you do some gym or some CC classes like yoga to keep yourself busy. </p>
              <p>Example :</p>
              <p> yoga twice a week. You will have 5 days left.</p>
              <p>2 days =&gt; Weekend go out with friends for dinner. Join forums outing. </p>
              <p>1 day  Weekday do some houseworks.. etc. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2 days Pamper yourself with spa or massage. I sure will relax you and you feel better.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cos these are the things we girls can do without Man around. Heehee.. he work hard. You just need to let him do what he want to do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When he find you occupy, he won't worry so much cos he will understand you can take care of yourself and he can ease his worry. And go all out to get his career. Bare in mind, do let him know that you guy will have dinner on occussion to make up for the time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is not about tolerating, it is more like to make each other at ease and feel comfortable living together. When you busy you won't notice his miss out on you.</p>
              <p>You don't need to be a xiao nu ren at home waiting for him. Make more friends hang out more. </p>

              <p>Hmm.. actually it seems to be the opposite for me... in the sense that... I'm the one who tends to spend a lot of time at work while at home rather than my hubby.</p>
              <p>I have to say that .. like an earlier poster say, its the small touches that he does that makes me feel very appreciative.</p>
              <p><br>Such as slicing a plate of fruits and even displaying it nicely when he passes it to me while I am busy at work. Just seeing that makes me feel like its such a treat and I mentally 'relax' a little when I feel stressed. So perhaps this is a way you can help. I am sure when he feels you are trying to understand, he will appreciate it too and put in more effort towards your needs.</p>
              <p>Perhaps what you need is to find something you can occupy yourself with too, such Marriage doesn't and shouldn't change us from adults to children. A certain amount of reliance is normal and can be reassuring  - but we still need to lead our independent lives and its not fair to rely too much on our spouses for emotional happiness.</p>
              <p>Instead of seeing what he has not done to fill up your emotional pie chart - perhaps you can see what other things you can do for yourself that can make you feel gratified and emotionally fulfilled too.</p>

              <p>I hadn't been good at anything. So when my wife brought up the
              idea of marriage, I wasn't confident enough I could provide for
              her. I think the reason I postponed the wedding could be that I was
              so sure I am not good enough for her. So I thought maybe by
              postponing the wedding I could make her see she could have a better
              life with someone else. Very silly of me. Haha</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lol! Every girl had dreamy hopes for their wedding day. I
              remembered my mum told me that my grandma told her to think twice
              about marriage because life changes after that. Aside from love,
              financial matters and other things comes in and that was the
              ancient days.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Getting stressed is without doubt. It may not be my place to say
              this, hence no offence. See, you are married. As I mentioned above
              after marriage other things other than love comes in to place.
              However love and faith are still essential for couples to stay
              couples, I believe. Both of you are working, I do wonder whether
              you over-exert yourself too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My advice though. Coming end of the year, if both of you have
              leftover leaves and cash go for an overseas trip with friends or
              relatives. Doesn't have to be grand, a change of environment, a
              time your husband know he could relax. At least for that time you
              could have fun with him and maybe upon getting back to work he
              could have some burden lifted up. Works for me, though I like
              travelling and my hobby is photography.</p>

              <p>i do work also, but i am not very happy at my work place, my hubby said before that when we have kids, he prefers me to look after the kids and be a full time mom, as he doesn't trust maid, no idea why. I am older than my hubby by 2 yrs, he is 27 this yr. my job is quite stressful, but I guess i am not as driven as my hubby towards our careers. For eg, he lets his work affects his marriage, affects his home life, for me is the other way round. I let my marriage affect my work. My boss complained that I have been distracted and asked me whats wrong and whether there's something going on at home. I have allowed whatever that's troubling me get in the way of my focus at work.</p>
              <p>i will certainly suggest a holiday with him this year end, but I worry whether he has the mood to go. money for it isn't a problem, as we have do substantial savings. my hubby wanted to put all his $ in stocks earlier this yr, and guess what he was so busy at work, that he opened a trading account and has 'no time and bandwidth' to do any trading.</p>

              <p>i do work also, but i am not very happy at my work place, my
              hubby said before that when we have kids, he prefers me to look
              after the kids and be a full time mom, as he doesn't trust maid, no
              idea why. I am older than my hubby by 2 yrs, he is 27 this yr. my
              job is quite stressful, but I guess i am not as driven as my hubby
              towards our careers. For eg, he lets his work affects his marriage,
              affects his home life, for me is the other way round. I let my
              marriage affect my work. My boss complained that I have been
              distracted and asked me whats wrong and whether there's something
              going on at home. I have allowed whatever that's troubling me get
              in the way of my focus at work.</p>
              <p>i will certainly suggest a holiday with him this year end, but I
              worry whether he has the mood to go. money for it isn't a problem,
              as we have do substantial savings. my hubby wanted to put all his $
              in stocks earlier this yr, and guess what he was so busy at work,
              that he opened a trading account and has 'no time and bandwidth' to
              do any trading.</p>

              <p>you are sad because your hushand fails to provide u the comfort when u need it most. It is understandable why you are disappointed with him.</p>
              <p>However, you cannot coined him as uncaring because he is focused with his work. He may think making a lot of $$$ = taking care of you (at least u dun have to worry about $$$). You have to die die communicate with him to understand his motivation for working hard and not dwell over why he is not caring to me.</p>

              <p>I think it's internal.. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/greggman.com/confused.png" alt="confused.png"> he has always been this way, ingrained in his character since he was a kid, and between us 2, he's the driven, ambitious overachiever to the point of obsession &amp; serious in nature, I am the slack one that's more relaxed and bubbly in personality. I am indeed older, as for having my own career, i guess we both do, but that's normal, nowadays all girls also have their own careers, although he's younger than me by 2 years, he can more than take care of me, as he earns double of what I earn.</p>
              <p>I do want a successful and capable husband like all other women, but i also want one who can spend time with me on weekends, and not shut down from me emotionally and be detached, like totally shut down, tell me to leave him alone for weeks on end, and sleep in the living room, thats too extreme liao.</p>
              <p>I know i can be needy at times, and he said to me before that I am needy, so I'm trying to correct that. I just really miss my hubby after some time of not talking to him for a week, even if I do keep myself busy with recreational activities and going out with frens. newly wed, less than 6 mths, is it normal for your spouse to end up not speaking to u for weeks and not sleeping on the same bed as u? I think i am not really being unreasonable for thinking something crossed the line.</p>
              <p>U are right, I also cross my fingers that it's a temporary situation. i pray to God everyday that He will bless my hubby at work and also make him happy, make his mood good and light</p>

              <p>Anyway, confiding in the opposite sex can complicate issue here... it's okay to get the male perspective in this matter but you can really mess things up if you ended up getting closer to this guy than your husband.</p>
              <p>Unless of course this 'guy' is your father or somebody your senior or you are confiding to a couple.</p>

              <p>Your husband got a problem with YOU, not his work. He is not telling you.</p>
              <p>When a man sleep in living room couch, he is going out of his way to avoid his wife. That is the biggest indicator there is something very wrong.</p>
              <p>Sorry, I am afraid this has nothing to do with his work. Its just malespeak excuse. The problem is something else.</p>

              <p>regular sex? dream on.. we don't do it often, even before the new posting stress blew up in my face, it was not that often already due to us having dated for 1.5 yrs before marriage, about once a mth on average.</p>
              <p>Even during our honeymoon in europe which was 14 days, you'd think honeymoon is when there will be lots of sex, thats what I was taught, in pop culture and references, but during the whole 2 wks we only did it twice. <br><br>There is no dinner together due to different working hours. My work starts later, and ends later. By the time i get back, he's all showered and changed and ready to sleep or engrossed in his work in the living room or reading his work-related journals. In the morning he leaves the house earlier than me since my work starts later, no interaction either.<br><br>It gets worse, I work on one of the 2 weekend days ( every Sunday) in return I get another weekday off. So every wk, I am off on one weekend day (Sat) and one weekday. Its still 5 day week but it's all out of whack lah. He is off on Sat and Sun like everyone else in SG. So basically I only get to spend one weekend day with my hubby every wk, we only have 1 common off day a week lor. Weekend day with him is very precious, but since he started becoming work obsessed almost zombiefied, in which he told me to amuse myself with other guy and girlfriends and go back to my parents', I also dun really see him much on weekend.<br><br> I just hope things improve as he becomes more used in his new posting with time. may God help us.</p>

              <p><br>the part in bold........there lies your answer.</p>
              <p>on the other hand, seriously, though, you should talk with him during the time he's least busy. i'm sure he won't be 24 hours at work everyday right?</p>
              <p>if he still don't change,  just give him cold shoulder for a few months.</p>
              <p>if still no result, seriously, consider getting a new man.</p>
              <p>i mean, there's so many good guys out there who simply love to go shopping and holidays with you on afternoons, watch TV and movies together, buy pop-corns for each other, go cycling on weekends, regular sex every 2 alternate nights, cook home dinners for each other every now and then, go to courses and workshops together.......do sweet little things.......</p>
