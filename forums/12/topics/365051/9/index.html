              <p>hmm..different people will have their own mindsets and viewpoints.</p>
              <p>if it was me, i would play with whipped cream and naughty sensual surprises, but i dont think its appropriate to describe in this forum and it wouldn't be a possible solution to this case, since ur hubby is in a foul mood and trying to spice up a relationship between a married couple this way is not likely to work in your situation..</p>
              <p>i dont believe the "age old trick, play hard to get, and treat them mean" as you have described as i find it rather immature. what would seem more appropriate would be to give in to him, and understand that hes being in a period of stress, work overload, and give him some time, but not let it persist for too long, by then if too long should insist for him to take some leave off work as it is ruining his health and his life. </p>
              <p>i know many will not agree with my viewpoint, as i am leading a single life and am still in my early 20s approaching mid-20s (no experience in marriage). but what i believe is, if you love a person you must support them  even if it makes u unhappy, but there is a limit to everything..</p>

              <p>So you guys are recommending the age-old trick of 'play hard to get' and 'treat em' mean, keep em' keen'?? Does it actually work? Such blanket tricks may work on 80% of men but my hubby is likely not under the category.</p>
              <p>So people really respond to pain huh?? Too good to them, too available, they take for granted lah.</p>

              <p>Every action has a reaction. That's newtonian law. Every patient positive or rash negative action will result in equal patient positive or rash negative reaction. Thats buddhist philosophy.</p>
              <p>Whatever action you do, you will have to accept the repercussions, sadly. Such actions tend to take a life of its own, and turn out way out of your control and beyond even one's imagination and preparedness.</p>
              <p>In my flawed opinion, I think it is best to be just true to yourself, based on the vow of love you both swore before witnesses, and let love takes its course.</p>
              <p> It may be difficult time that you may go thru, but if you can weather this temporary tribulation of your new marriage, it would make you a stronger person with a better insight on what marriage entails, what needs to be improve upon, and make your decision from there on.</p>
              <p>Just my thoughts. Good luck.</p>

              <p>While what you said is true, it does sound harsh. In my view,
              harsh counselling should only be used as a last resort. For
              example, when a circumstance becomes a do-or-die situation, to get
              the message across, usually found in battlefields, or the last few
              minutes of a game to be won.</p>
              <p>The situation with TS doesnt warrant such technique, at least no
              yet, and I do believe a less harsher sharing of views would persent
              her with a clearer concept to clear her confusion and perhaps save
              a precious marriage and love between 2 persons.</p>
              <p>I agree with you that it would be impossible to work 365 days a
              year without breaks. No human, not even slaves can perform well
              under those situations.</p>
              <p>Such situations only occurs when there are deadlines to meet, or
              under the employment circumstances and position held by TS's hubby,
              more so if it is the civil service, worse if in a crisis, it is
              frenatically normal and real, and would be considered abnormal by
              normal 8-5pm 5 day work week workers, but only for months and not
              an entire year, unless one screws up and end up rectifying and
              modifying faults.</p>

              <p>Not possible..and not necessary. Not possible as doing so is a clear communication to your boss that you yourself are saying you can't make it. Not necessary because it's only been one month. It wasn't a promotion, but a change in posting. I believe it's the fact that the posting is so different from what he was doing before and the fact that he's not done it before that is posing the teething problems.

              with me. true enough in the last few weekends, I went clubbing and out

              <p>He is now very focused and consumed by work, which I understand
              is necessary for men, and I don't wish to stand in his way or
              disturb him. I really wish I could be more self sufficient and not
              depend on him emotionally. I know it's very difficult to have to

              <p>I am beginning to wonder if all alpha-males behave the same, if not, then your hubby must be my twin!</p>
              <p>I gave complete freedom to my ex, same as he did to you. She was surprised and asked my why I am so different from others. I told her that a relationship is built on trust, and if there is no trust, then there is no sense continuing a relationship. It would only hurt each other into unnecessary and unfounded suspicions.</p>
              <p>While in my relationship with her, I did not fool around, not even if I had the time and would rather pour myself into looking for solutions and improvement at work. She would at times tempt me wearing silky lacy lingeries, but I simply laugh and tell her I gotta finish my projects.</p>
              <p>She would dress to her nines in open cut gowns or tight skimpy skirts for clubbing, just to get a reaction from me. All I did was kiss her goodnight and wish her a good time, sincerly,  for I trusted her to know where the line was drawn.</p>
              <p>At times it hurt, but I guess I had more important work on hand, driven on a mission with belief in the work I am doing that will benefit others, without realizing the one that should benefit was the one who comforted, supported and stood by me when things got out of hand at work, and who will be there for me when we are both old.</p>
              <p>It wasn't all lovey dovey, and there were times when we quarelled over the slightest things, sometimes on the bed and any chance for lovemaking would be spoilt. Worse was during her PMS, and I dont blame her for it is only natural in women during that period.</p>
              <p>I did love her truly, and approach love as i did in my work, and that is to love totally or not to love at all. I loved her and would lay down my life for her. But unfortunately in my stupid and immatured perceptions of love, under the similar vein as of work, I placed a priority level over it.</p>
              <p>Work took priority as it was paying the bills and a secure future,. so I thought. Love can wait. But it all screwed up in the end. Humans are not binary machines but fuzzy logic biological beings. No 2 humans think the same.</p>
              <p>I just want you to know that I am sure he does love you, in a way many would think nonsensical, but i guess that's how some driven people approach life and love.</p>
              <p>I am not making excuses for him, but only that you may try to see him in a different light and perhaps slowly guide him and wean him off the nonsensical priority placing. You are a human with need for love and companionship, and not a complex tangible work issue to ponder and solve.</p>
              <p>Give him and yourself time, if the love is strong. Marriage is an eternity and takes time to work out. No one ever had a marriage that is plain sailing everyday. Ask the rest and you will know it is true.</p>

              <p>what xtreiyer says is true........and has been mentioned in dating books.</p>
              <p>if your wife / gal go out with other guys and instead of getting jealous, you encourage her to do so, she'll go crazy over you (meaning, going ga-ga over you).</p>
              <p>this is proven by xtreiyer's wife and TheMissus, and is a very powerful technique indeed.</p>
              <p>in future, if my gal wants to go clubbing, i'll gladly ask her to wear less and give her sex drugs to make her high instead of getting jealous.</p>

              <p>It is indeed strange that he prefers to chill out by himself
                      rather than with you...are you sure he willingly get himself into
                      this marriage? If yes, does he even understand what is his
                      responsibility towards his wife as a husband? From what I have seen
                      through your description, it seems better that both of you are not
                      married, sorry to say. He doesn't seem to adapt well to the fact
                      that he needs to accompany you nor does he seem to enjoy spending
                      time with you.</p>
              <p>I think the problem is not as easy as him being stressed at
                      work...even if he is stressed at work also he should look forward
                      to spending time with you after work as a way to destress...why did
                      he seem to imply that spending time together with you will sap away
                      all his energy and is emotionally draining?</p>
              <p>If I mention to my husband that I am going clubbing with my
                      ex-boyfriend, he would be jealous and worried. I think most
                      husbands will feel that as well, of course by varying degree. But
                      he seems nonchalant about it...I wonder about the depth of his
                      feelings to you.</p>

              <p>cos i have been bugging him for love, attention lor..i think thats why it makes him feel that I am a source of his emotional expenditure,..and i think its been the wrong tactic used..backfired on me..yeah he willingly proposed to me with my dream 1 carat ring when we holidayed in HK.. i didn't force him, I was so happy I said yes immediately but I wish he could have gone on bended knee which he didn't..</p>
              <p>He doesn't know that I went out with my ex lah. I didn't say. I did say I went out with a friend, which is not a lie. My ex is really now my friend. I do treasure his friendship. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>what xtreiyer says is true........and has been mentioned in
              dating books.</p>
              <p>if your wife / gal go out with other guys and instead of getting
              jealous, you encourage her to do so, she'll go crazy over you
              (meaning, going ga-ga over you).</p>
              <p>this is proven by xtreiyer's wife and TheMissus, and is a very
              powerful technique indeed.</p>
              <p>in future, if my gal wants to go clubbing, i'll gladly ask her
              to wear less and give her sex drugs to make her high instead of
              getting jealous.</p>

              <p>I am beginning to wonder if all alpha-males behave the same, if
              not, then your hubby must be my twin!</p>
              <p>I gave complete freedom to my ex, same as he did to you. She was
              surprised and asked my why I am so different from others. I told
              her that a relationship is built on trust, and if there is no
              trust, then there is no sense continuing a relationship. It would
              only hurt each other into unnecessary and unfounded suspicions.</p>
              <p>While in my relationship with her, I did not fool around, not
              even if I had the time and would rather pour myself into looking
              for solutions and improvement at work. She would at times
              tempt me wearing silky lacy lingeries, but I simply laugh and
              tell her I gotta finish my projects.</p>
              <p>She would dress to her nines in open cut gowns or tight skimpy
              skirts for clubbing, just to get a reaction from me. All I did was
              kiss her goodnight and wish her a good time, sincerly,  for I
              trusted her to know where the line was drawn.</p>
              <p>At times it hurt, but I guess I had more important work on hand,
              driven on a mission with belief in the work I am doing that will
              benefit others, without realizing the one that should benefit was
              the one who comforted, supported and stood by me when things
              got out of hand at work, and who will be there for me when we are
              both old.</p>

              <p>Yeah same..my hubby also feels a strong passion in serving the nation, he is also driven by that amongst other things like self fulfilment</p>
