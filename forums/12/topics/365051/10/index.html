              <p><br>i'm sure i'll be able to do it, because:</p>
              <p>if i get jealous or want to control her, she'll get even closer to other guys.....and this is BAD!!!!</p>
              <p>since in such a situation, i've nothing to lose liao, so might as well use the trick.</p>
              <p><br>besides, even if it fails, it just means the gal is unfaithful or gonna be unfaithful sooner or later, and that's not worth my time.</p>
              <p>as the saying goes, there's a lot more gals out there who are more worth your time.</p>
              <p>in your case, there's a lot more guys out there who're more worth your time.</p>
              <p>maybe u could use reverse-psychology on your guy like what i said earlier?</p>
              <p>meaning, just ignore him for a few weeks or up to 3 months and see his response.</p>
              <p>after all, at this stage, u got nothing to lose liao, why not? for all you know, it might succeed and he will start eating out from your hands and begging you for affection.</p>
              <p>if he doesn't, there's still plenty of guys out there who are dying to go shopping and holiday with you, fly kites, go beach, go cycling, do crazy and fun things, with you.</p>

              <p>Since we know that your husband works in the private sector, it is expected that he is very driven to succeed as it is very hard to climb up the corporate ladder. Maybe the reason why he is working hard is because he wants to assure you both have a better future? Nevertheless, sit down and have a heart-to-heart talk with him. Heck! I believe everyone has said that numerous times already. But this seems to be the only good old fashioned way to go. If he is the kind who opens up easily about the problems in his heart, that's one problem down! If he doesn't, then you have a HUGE problem there. But to begin with, if he doesn't trust you enough to talk about the things bothering him, then why did you guys even get married in the first place? There is a lack of trust here...</p>
              <p>And I suggest you had better not use the tactic of TELLING HIM that you are going out clubbing with your ex-boyfriends and all just to make him feel jealous or spite him. This is not going to work in any way. There is a chance that by doing so, his faith &amp; trust in you might drop and let's just say I've seen quite a few relationships go down the drain because of a lack of trust between the couple. (Notice the pattern? Again the lack of trust problem) Just talk to him about it. Let him know that no matter what happens, you would always be by his side as his faithful wife. Even if you can't help in any way. Just your pressence should be able to reassure him &amp; allay his doubts.</p>
              <p>You can continue on with your seduction acts. No problem and all. But you must know that if he is not biting in any way, it is not necessarily because he has lost interest in you. He might be just be tired after a hard day at work. And don't go jumping into assumptions that he is seeing another girl outside. Even if you think he is, find a way to broach the subject carefully. If not, he would think that you would have so little trust in him. (Yet again, the "Trust" word comes out) And don't go snooping around checking his emails and messages or go so far as to hire a PI to tail him. This would really prove how little you think of him. But if the tell-tale signs are there that you suspect there is really a girl out there, then collect your required evidence to confront him and take him down. That should be your last resort in order to protect yourself.</p>
              <p>To me, in a relationship you must have not only love, but trust, commitment, responsibility, respect and understanding. Without these, I feel that you shouldn't even get started. Let alone get married. If any of these components are absent to begin with, then the relationship would break down tragically and in the end, who would be the hurt ones? You &amp; him. So just think it through and tread lightly. I wish you all the best in your marriage and relationship with your hubby.</p>

              <p>Yes i do like to gossip, which woman doesn't? But I make sure i do not reveal 'classified' stuff bout our lives, his private personal stuff or his classified work stuff (which I do know quite a lot) to anyone else.</p>
              <p>But when it comes to complaining about him, I do complain about him to some friends, but only in the context of friends confiding in one another.</p>
              <p>Things have improved since I spoke to him, he knows that he has to do some basic things required of a husband eg sleep beside me at night.</p>
              <p>Yesterday he texted me while he was at work to tell me to book tickets to transformers as he really wants to watch it. We watched it last night after he finished work. However, he still had to work at home on his laptop today, which he did. He felt tired and is snoozing now. Hope we at least get to go out for dinner one night cos its the weekend after all and my weekend is ending soon (i am off on fri and sat, have to work on sun). Just had to attend to neighbour from downstairs who knocked on the door to confront about the noise from the weight lifting while hubby is sleeping...</p>

              do you have any wierd habits he doesnt like? what about the wierd habits of his you disliked?
              
              All I can say is this. give and take. sometimes when he is angry or pissed off, let him vent his frustrations on you, but dun allow him to lift his finger on him. when he is angry, let him vent and dun retaliate, just keep your mouth shut and leave him alone. when he is ok, he will feel guilty about it and might even treat you better.
              
              Just dun nag and nag at him can already if you are fond of nagging.

              <p>Yeah I just had this talk with my hubby too last weekend, he was confiding in me about some feelings he has work-wise. He related that even when he achieves or succeeds in something, he does not feel pleased or jubilant, all he feels is relief. His life is a journey of having to fulfil things to meet expectations. He said whenever he succeeds at something, he does not look back and go, wow he feels so proud and happy that he did it, all he feels is a sigh of relief that he 'cleared' that and can move on to the next thing he has to overcome just to be relieved. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Violet/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>thanks for the help from everyone. I just wanted to update, my hubby's mood has improved tremendously, and that is cos things at work have indeed improved, in fact last night something very good happened at work, in which he received praise from someone he regarded, this made his mood very good. When his mood is good, his mojo returns. Still, all this is very much tied to his work situation. Which means when work situation = good, he will be in good shape as a person. I just pray that things continue to improve from here on so we can be happy.</p></div>
