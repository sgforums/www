              <p>Sigh i dont know. He doesnt really hug those stuffed animals or anything its just always on his bed. And obviously he doesnt read those things in front of me. And i dont think he knows that i know that the stuffed animals were from his ex. And he doesnt know that i know about the letters because i chanced upon them by accident, and no i am not the sort who will invade someone else's privacy. All i know is that his ex meant alot to him and i dont even know if he is over her or not. And i dread confronting him over this issue because i am quite sure it will start another quarrel... </p>

              <p>The fact that he keeps the toys and letters show he hasn't forgetten the past. There is no problem if a person keeps something of the past for memory. The problem is that should his ex for one reason or another comes back to him, would he then dump you for her? are you now his true love or just a temporary stop gap?</p>
              <p>may be you can buy some stuffed toys and see if yours could replace the old ones overtime. Keep him a chance.</p>
              <p>But...for you, don't jump into a relationship, until you are absolutely clear you have a good ground to build the relationship! you need to protect yourself from being hurt.</p>
              <p>God bless.</p>
