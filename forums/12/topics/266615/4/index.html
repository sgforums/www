            <div class='col-md body'>Looks do matter at some point. But it only last at the very first impression. Its the beautiful mind inside of you that will really give people a lasting impression. Looks can fade and can change. You might never know when an accident can leave a beautiful face disfiugred.<br><br>My advice to you is to build up your character through knowledge, confidence and courage. People will start to look at you differently once you have these inner beauty traits as it will make you outstanding from your current peers. So dont worry, this sort of discrimination only last during the teens. Jia You  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i suggest you go watch the korean movie -- 200 pounds beauty. she is a talented singer, but is overweight and ulgy. later she went for plastic surgery and become a stunner. but then she found out that beauty is not enough, it is only skin deep, she still relies on her great voice to be accepted in the world of entertainment.<br><br>You are still young, later when you go into the work force, you will find the people around you are not so superficial, they are more spohisticated, they can see your good nature. so you will have a better chance, so have patience, do all you can to enhance yourself now, you will be accepted later. (When you need company and need people to talk to, visit sgforum.)<br><br>Loosing weight is definitely not easy, and should not be taken for granted. some people do everything but still fail to loose the weight, but of course there are some who succeeded.<br><br>My advice, do something small first, do it bit by bit, slowly and steady you will loose the weight, well at least you don't gain more weight. Best of luck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've faced exactly the same thing since young.  It still depends what pple u meet I believe.  If you have family to fall back on for emotional support, that would be really helpful.<br><br>My workplace still okay, dont have such pple.  However I have met a prick who says that if girls are fat, it's their fault for not attracting a partner cos they are too lazy to take care of their body.  Made me so angry.<br><br>If u got time, find an old movie called Shallow Hal.  It will make u feel better when u see the female lead in the story accepts being a fat yet nice, wittty and kind lady.  That to me wins over some cutey-on-the-surface-swearing-backstsabbing gal.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>This issue may continue in your life - being left out, neglected or forgotten.  You can use that time to improve yourself or spend it on hobbies.  If you yearn to go out with your classmates, try to ask the girls whether u can join when you hear an opportunity.  If they still don't want to invite you, its ok, find company elsewhere. You dont need pple who dont care about u.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi gal,<br><br>You may not be blessed with fantastic looks and body, but you can make the best of it... focus on your good points, don't obssess over your weak points or try to compare yourself with other girls.  Because it will eat away at your confidence like an insatiable piranha.<br><br>When people see how you shine with confidence, a positive face and a glowing image, they will be naturally attracted to you.  In fact, you'll be highly admired for being able to overcome your barriers and attain such a state of mind / success.  Once you give yourself a positive, realistic goal to achieve a better self-image, you will almost automatically want to beautify yourself.. not for vanity's sake, but because it's the smart thing to do.  Sure, you might have to spend a little money to improve your image, but think of it as a necessary investment for your future. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
