They are only attractive when they r their true self and when they show lack of confidence, not attractive anymore liao...<br><br>Example :<br>When a lack of confident girl is concentrating on her work, she display her natural beauty. It makes a guy want to have a second look at her. But when the girl go to check her face in mirror, no matter how the girl look it just look sucks...<br><br>In fact, for a chio bu, I dont even throw a second look at her but for those natural beauty, I just cant resist to have a second look... Natural beauty is at tat instant minute but chio bu can see anytime u want...<br><br>I bet u have the same point of views when u looking at guys ,rite??? &gt;&lt;<br><br>So, try not to think so much ... be yrself... The more uncomfortable u feel, the more guys wont approach u...<br><br>Keep telling yrself this :<br>" Every1 have a beauty in them and I believe I also have it in me...

They will first judge you on your external looks.<br>That is why they say, first impression is very important.<br><br>Now, I am not trying to make you feel hopeless.<br>I just want you to understand the reality of adult life, so that you can work on improving some of the areas which can help with your social effort.<br><br>I have a sec school classmate.. she wears really thick bulky and ah mah looking glasses in school. Was really fat and don't seem to like to brush her hair.<br>Everyone shuns her..... but she was really smart girl. She scores very high in her exams....after sec school we don't contact each other ..but I heard she<br>further her studies in a prestigious uni overseas.<br>She wasn't from a rich family, she worked part-time and pay her way with bursaries and study grants..... I remember she was very frugal...she would used her stuff untill so beat up but still don't want to change a new one.<br><br>Few years later, I met her during our reunion gatherings.<br>My eyes popped out. She slim down.. her thick glasses gone.. I think she went for some corrective eye surgery , so she only wears contact lens now.<br>She dress up really nice and needless to say.. she was the center of attraction during the gathering.<br><br>Everyone was going " Wow.. is that really you ?"...<br>She was still the friendly girl we used to know.... except , now the caterpillar has morphed into a butterfly......a smart butterfly.....<br><br>Do you believe you can be like her ?<br><br></div>
