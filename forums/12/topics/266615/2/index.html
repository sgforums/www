I felt hurt at times but hey that's life. My best friend was one of the most popular girls, and I realised guys would come up and talk to me ONLY when she's around!<br><br>i was doing design and tech. and during an important exam, just before passing up my entire project broke into half.

They are only attractive when they r their true self and when they show lack of confidence, not attractive anymore liao...<br><br>Example :<br>When a lack of confident girl is concentrating on her work, she display her natural beauty. It makes a guy want to have a second look at her. But when the girl go to check her face in mirror, no matter how the girl look it just look sucks...<br><br>In fact, for a chio bu, I dont even throw a second look at her but for those natural beauty, I just cant resist to have a second look... Natural beauty is at tat instant minute but chio bu can see anytime u want...<br><br>I bet u have the same point of views when u looking at guys ,rite??? &gt;&lt;<br><br>So, try not to think so much ... be yrself... The more uncomfortable u feel, the more guys wont approach u...<br><br>Keep telling yrself this :<br>" Every1 have a beauty in them and I believe I also have it in me... "<br>Haha.... tat is what I always tell myself... Coz, I m also fat and ugly too &gt;&lt;<br><br></div></blockquote>Oh man, this is so true. I find that whenever im on the streets or on the mrt. Whenever i see a pretty girl , i'll just look at her once and immediately look away. However, whenever i see someone behaving really natural; Filled with confidence. Even if she is short, fat and ugly. I wont hesitate to look at her twice, thrice or as many times until she thinks im a pervert.<br><br>I've once heard something like this:<br><br><strong>Attraction is not what keeps the man</strong>.<br><br>So start feeling good about yourself, accept yourself.<br><br>And most importantly, love yourself =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's a fact that people emphasise on external looks in the beginning. That's life.<br><br>However, you must bear in mind that such friendships are rather shallow. Those friendships that are true are really those that stand in the test of time.<br><br>There's nothing wrong with being fat and ugly, but there's something wrong if you refuse to accept your present self. Think you are slightly heavy? Go exercise and cut down on the weight (I have personally tried it). Think you are ugly? Go dress up better and be more confident. I am even worse, used to be fat and short and I am a guy. What to do? Go exercise lor and accept my own height. What shows the person's character is not what he/she has, but rather how he/she managed to make full use of what he/she has.<br><br>Often you will realise that the friends you have are really friends with you for what you are, not what you look. Build up more self-confidence and present it out. You will gradually find friends that look past the shallow 1st layer.</div>
