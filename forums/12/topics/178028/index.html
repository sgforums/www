            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with what you've said.<br><br>But to put it this way, if you happened to read one of Xiaxue's blog, it kinds pf says it all.<br><br><blockquote>It's a secret...<br><br>Girls do not actually like flowers.<br><br>I KNOW RIGHT?! You gasp, but it's true! I mean yes, flowers are pretty and they smell nice, but they are but some dead plants.<br><br>So why do girls still want flowers on V day?<br><br>BECAUSE EVERYONE ELSE IS HAVING IT. And not getting flowers means your boyfriend treats you inferior to how the other boyfriends are treating their girlfriends.<br><br>And that sucks - because every girl wants to feel special. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></blockquote>The above was extracted from Xiaxue's blog. I'm no fan of hers, but I read her blog occasionally when I'm bored. So as it goes, girls want flowers 'cos everyone else on the streets are having it. If you don't give her flowers, she might feel envious of other girls. Of 'cos in that case flowers are just material, but if you can make your girl happy by spending a bit of money, why not?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For me...Valentine's day is not just a day that falls on 14th Febuary. I'm one unlucky chap who doesn't have much chance to celebrate this so call special day.<br><br>Anyway, to me...everyday is like V Day. Any day that I feel like making my gf special, I'll pop by a shop to get her something she likes or make some small little gifts for her. This is what I call special. This is what makes her special. When everyone else is only celebrating this only day in the year, I make sure she is given the surprise. That's what makes her feel special.</div>
