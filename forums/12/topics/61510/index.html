            <div class='col-md body'>I just broke up with my gf. We are in a long distance relationship. I feel very very sad, I don't know how to forget her. I've even planned to proposed to her. How could she do this to me so suddenly? But no matter what I do, she don't want to patch things up. She even started going out with another guy right after we broke up. I am really devastated and feeling really suicidal, but strangely I still love her very much no matter how much I tell myself to hate her.

Well, by now, you ought to realise a few things about LDR:<br><br>I) Discipline of all forms must be instill, from both party, for without physical presence, the other party isn't here to cater to your possible needs. If not, the likelihood of breaking is very high.<br><br>II) LDR is <strong>not</strong> your usual, common and normal kind of BGR relationship you are leading; everything must be twice da effort.<br><br>III) Main reason why LDR fail is almost always because of the failure of (I) from one party, which result in the dating of other people, <strong>in consideration </strong>of a potential parter.<br><br>P.S: Even if you were to propose - its utterly foolish to do it right after your come back. You just never know what has really happen during this period of time. By the way, if she can't even survive the test of this transitory separation, do you think she is in and ready for marriage? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

He loves his gf so much that he keeps missing her...pasting her pics all over his room and even in computer..<br>Somehow, his gf decided to leave him and he was so devastated that he nearly broke NS rule and try to fly back to America. His days after were submerged in sorrow.......<br>Anyway, after seeing so many advices from the kind pals here, I also feel that one must move on somehow..<br><br>It is hard...it is very sad...(and i still cry like a gal at times when I longed for her)...I feel that I still need to move on....no matter how hard it is......that's life........ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

My personal view is that if that gal is able to find a 'new love' pretty soon, then there are only 2 reasons: 1) She has known that guy for quite some time, and already wants to start a relationship with him thus ending the current one 2) She treats relationships lightly...<br><br>There may be other reasons....but it's what I perceive at this moment.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
