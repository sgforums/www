But then....do you really expect her to make the first move? Why didn't you make the first move after that???<br><br>Anyway the best thing you could do now is to help her out with her revision for the O'Levels or leave her alone to concentrate on her O'Levels and give her a call after her O'Levels to ask her about her exams and sweet-talk her out.<br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

Cos your attempt to make your presence known to her is going to disturb her preparations for O'Levels and will definitely ruined any possible chances that you might have with her.<br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Wearing a tiger outfit and roaring in front of her might just make your presence known to her and there's a huge chance it might amuse her and lighten her tense exam mood. ---&gt; Joking only so do not try this stunt at all. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
