              <p>I have natural social anxiety due to being bullied a lot in the past so I have naturally closed up to people these days. Plus the fact that I have confided a lot in my ex-best friend and she uses my weakness to insult and humiliate me during arguments make me even more distrustful of humans in general and I ended up having panic attacks and extreme social anxiety these days. To be honest, I will never forget what my "best friend" did to me, and I probably will hate her for my entire life.                     </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Anyway, the issue now here is, whenever I bump into past acquaintances (friends of the bullies), or even the mutual friend of my ex-best friend.... I can't help but to hesitate saying hi to them. Seeing them brings back a lot of hurtful memories even though they didn't really do anything to me. I really don't know why they still have to come up and say hi to me when they saw me on walking on the street. Hey people...if you are in this situation, what would you do? When they tapped your shoulder and said hi to you, would you bother to respond to them?        </p>

              yes u shld respond to them. Try to have that big heart there to say the HI to them somemore if there are merely the mutual friends who did nth to u, you shld not be hesitating to say hi to them.
              
              It mayb difficult to walk out of a painful past but what's infront of u is the future.Learn to look forward and try to leave the past behind. Mayb u can slowly try to take the first step. Do not let a person ruin your entire life. Take care =D

They were friends of the people you don't get along with, but this doesn't mean they always talk to your ex best friend. You don't have to reveal much, just say hi back to them.

              <p>I think if you clearly know that they're there and they know too, then by not even acknowledging them makes you look snobbish and basically shows that you are at war with them. If you're happy with that, then go ahead.</p>
              <p>Be the bigger-person and say hello and have abit of small-talk if you want to.</p>
              <p>As for moving on, as mentioned spend less time worrying about them and focus more of your efforts finding new friends and doing the things you enjoy. Its okay to be upset, but important to move on too.</p>

              <p>No problem, just say hi to them and talk to them.....</p>
              <p>Ask them what they are doing there, how they've been doing so far, and ask them for phone number when you part ways.</p>
              <p>I do that often.</p>
              <p>Human mind is a strange thing. I remember one time when I was young, I was working in a committee. I had a committee chair who was rather unfriendly and strict. I just had very negative feelings and it manifest itself strangely. I had aversions towards women who look like her.  Funny huh ?</p>
