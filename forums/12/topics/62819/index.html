Alternatively, you can hint him indirectly... Not anything about the girl but his true feelings for you.... How old are the both of you?<br><br>Another option is to tell him you would just wish to remain as friends for now until you're more comfortable with him then you'll consider his offer. At the same time, try to 'dig' out some things regarding this girl through indirectly prompting but try not to be too aggressive on that....<br><br>I'll just like you to understand that whatever his intention for wanting you to be his gf now does not neccessarily reflects on how the future would be... Take for example... His intention might not be so sincere for now, but his feelings might grow for you in the future as he gets to know you better? On the other hand, he might be very sincere now in wanting you as his gf but there're no guarantee that he won't change one day...? Well. Whatever's your decision, once you've made up your mind then don't worry too much for now... Cause the future is often quite unpredictable... And that's actually the 'fun' of it...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
