              <p>think for the future, not the wedding itself. Even u got the money to buy her a big fat rock for the wedding, how about the life after the wedding? You gonna be more stressed after the wedding. You ain't earning much and if after wedding she will still complain about the lack of money and it's gonna be back to the same situation.</p>
              <p>Think properly. Most and MOST women's security refers to the cashy cashy that u have.. got money = got honey and vice versa</p>

              <p>That is why you planned to get a specialist Diploma so as to switch to a better paying job. The main problem now is that it will not be easy for you to job-hop in the current recession, as there will also be many graduates competing with you after you completed your course.</p>
              <p>I am not being mean here, but your gf should be more realistic about career opportunities now instead of bugging you to be not "lazy and unmotivated". Even if you study hard and try your absolute best, there is not even a single bit of guarantee that you will be rewarded with a better paying job after you receive your specialist diploma.</p>
              <p>Well, since you have already made up your mind, then just do the best that you can, and see which direction fate points you in.</p>

                              <p>It is noble for you to want to give your woman a good life, as
              it should be with all men.</p>
              <p>But you have to be realistic in the end. What is considered 'a
              good life' anyway? Is
              a shipyard worker considered giving his family
              a 'bad life' with his pathetic earnings and social standing, even
              after he had taken care of his wife and watch his kids go through
              Uni?</p>
              <p>Is a BMW, a career in a GLC company, often away, a condo, no or
              only just 1 kid, considered a 'good life'?</p>
              <p>And such 'lives' are good for who? You or your partner? Should
              not a good life be shared, in good times and in bad? Are we
              civilised beings or rapacious wild beasts, that we must be 'king'
              and be at the top of the food chain?</p>
              <p>Questions, questions...unanswerable, save yourself to know and
              realize. Nobility is one thing, possessing love that is not
              true love, and living a responsible shared eternity are issues
              that you have to grapple with and confront the reality before you,
              as clear as the piece of crystal you are demanded with...</p>

              <p>To marry someone for love itself is the reason to marry lar, if it is to secure oneself in that marriage with a career or well-paying job or even propping it up with material 'stuffs' is setting up a 'house' with a weak foundation. What comes from the ,outside, can change or be lost!</p>
              <p>However, one that brings 'goodies' in the form of love, respect, kindness, compassion can endure anything cos it has a strong foundation. Of course, it is on the premise both are self-fulfilled and abundant <span style="text-decoration: underline;">within</span>.</p>
              <p>The other thing marriages fail not just cos of money but cos one goes into it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to get</span> rather than share what one is or give what one can. Also it is the lack of friendliness and not love that spoils everything lar!</p>

              <p>This is a very testing period of time, but you should not give up. Look on the bright side, and have faith in yourself in finding a better job after you completed your course and received your specialist Diploma.</p>
              <p>Just maintain your relationship with her as it is for now. Getting married while studying and working at the same time is a very bad idea.
