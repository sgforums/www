Sometimes a break (cool down) will be a beta solution to think &amp; reflect on wat had gone wrong. Guys are pressurise when their gfs are too emotional or expressive with their sadness. They nid their own personal space n understanding from their gfs.

            <div class='col-md body'>i realise it now to..... spoken to a guy friend whom told me that he may have thought he is really for marriage but when it came closer and closer to it. there fear. Actually we thinking of getting ROM next yr december initially. He suddenly realise he is not ready.<br><br>It's just that i expects him to speak up and discuss any issues uprising. and he didn't. When i make a mistake in the past , he said he never angry and he jokes with me. I was so happy back then, that he tolerated me.<br><br>It's only when he wanna be apart and he brought out mistakes i made in the past. which is already history.<br><br>I can only apology for it. but he wanna be apart just after V day and note he did not even see me on v day at all</div>
