              <p><br>Since you are one of the victims need to know more about your case. When you first know of them have you seen any of their portfolio photos or were you shown? Any wedsite from them and testimonial of their clients? what makes youwant to go voer to their company in the first place? like they promise to take photos and give you for free? Otherwise when they hard sell their package to you you can leave and tell them to delete the photos from their computer if not call the police file a police report. presse for time and whatever is irrelevent here. No matter what race of peopl to you upon its singapore and if you find the situation threatening calling the police is the best option.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the takeover we don;t know under what terms their agrements is like so its too early to make any accusations. wait up a while see if any similar tatactics re surface and tell everyone around you to be cautions of such companies. when they strike again its time to strike back, and make sure when you go to them for photoshoots go with guy friends instead. they hard sell again call police.</p>

              <p>When the ACT has found the case in your favour and NBN has failed / refused to pay you the sum awarded within 2 weeks, you can go back to the SCT to enforce judgment.</p>
              <p>NBN has a habit of challenging people they have suckered to use the law against them because most people do not know what to do.</p>
              <p>Enforcement of judgment will drag the case further and can be rather frustrating. But all the more you should persist or NBN will be let off the hook and continue their unethical ways!<a href="402416#"><img src="../../../images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif?1212956094" alt="Icon_evil"></a></p>
