              <p>God is watching every move! Look out for this morning's papers on ST prime news, Big news on Naughty by nature. I was surprised that thousands are victims and not just me alone.You know what? The Indian boss mentioned above, text me and asked if I am the one that wrote on sg forum.He said that I defamed his name.I wondered how so as his name was also published on papers today.He claimed on papers that he just took over the company. Thus, as a new director of a pte ltd co, he is also liable.In fact, he is not new to the company, I have seen his face when I last visited the studio1 year ago.I tried to call Citibank to stop my monthly instalments which i am still paying now but Citibank said that have already paid upfront the full amount to Naughty By Nature the moment the credit transaction went through.</p>
              <p>I wanted to serve Letter Of demand to the address stated on ACRA but was told that the address doesn't belong to the director.Now that the studio is shut, I am not sute what I can do to recover my money.</p>

              <p><br>smart people won;t have to ever bother themselves with such problem because they will never land in this type of problem. although many people own digital cameras now, from low end to profesional grade type, few really know how to fully utilize it and much fewer know why they should press the shutter. just like religion, many practiose them but few knows for what and even fewer make full use of it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>why cannot leave the place, did anyone threaten them if they leave with the photos taken? all these points is enough for people to file a police report even before parting with their money. why do you need to take photos, do you really need theoe photos tobe taken? or just too rich neeed to spend money?</p>

              <p>But sometimes u know la... we cant expect everyone to be careful and literate. We have to take into account the ignorant and thegullible.</p>
              <p>The question on why they need their photo taken , we dont really know, why do people open photography shops ? But all i know is , they paid with the expectation of what is advertised ma. Supposedly advertised la. hahaha</p>
