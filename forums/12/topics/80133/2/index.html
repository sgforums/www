If possible, you can even ask her to PM me if she gets herself a nick here...<br><br>'Dead' or 'alive'... From what I see, you've already gone into a very crucial next stage in a relationship...<br><br>A few things I would like you to understand from here...<br><br>1. What you could have done already becomes 'could have been'. You can't undo your past.<br><br>2. Your relationship 'dead or alive', you're alive. So long as you're alive, you stand a chance to fight. But remember, don't make the same mistakes again. Especially if your ultimate aim is for her happiness.<br><br>3. No matter if the relationship ends, at least you still remember to 'make up' to her.<br><br>Regards.</div>

As long as you are willing to fight for this relationship, it's never too late to change things for the better. You've identified the problems of your relationship so work towards changing for the better. You need to talk to her when you go back, because it's easier to understand how she feels when you see her face to face.... Sometimes you just need to see each other to understand how much each other had meant to you.... All said and done, at this point in time, the most important thing you should do is not feel sorry for yourself b ut instead think about how you can try to win her heart back again ....</div>

IÂ¡Â¯ve been here for almost 9 months and about to return in another 3 weeks time. WeÂ¡Â¯ve been married for almost 4 years. Gone thru the ROM but not the customary dinner yet. we have been staying together in my parentsÂ¡Â¯ place ever since after our ROM. When I left for UK, she moved back to her parentsÂ¡Â¯ placeÂ¡Â­ much nearer to her working place. Now when IÂ¡Â¯m in preparation to go back to spore for anout 3-4 months.. sheÂ¡Â¯s telling me that she might not move back to stay with me when I return. Saying that the distance is too far from her work place. Thou, it has always been the case when she stayed with me before I came. Her claim was that no married (ROM) couple would stay together before they have their customary dinner. Did she had a changed of heart? Why didnÂ¡Â¯t she said that during those times in my parentÂ¡Â¯s place? To her, it is like we had done things wrong back then and we should not carry on staying together every night from now on.<br>I was so looking forward to be with her every night when I return. Now that she said thatÂ¡Â­ I guess things have changed. IÂ¡Â¯m so sad to hear that.. and that now I canÂ¡Â¯t concentrate on my exams in days time. How can things be wrong when we have actually done it for almost 3 years! And it just turned wrong over 9 months!<br>What is wrong here?<br></div></blockquote><span style="color: indigo;">My mum also thinks that a couple should not stay together even though they are legally married (ROM) and have not gone thru the customary dinner.  Well, what she said makes sense also..she said the female would likely to be looked down upon by the male's side.<br><br>One true incident is that my sis's best fren stayed with her boyfren after they ROM but had not went thru the customary dinner.  Then the family treated her very family, the husband also..even brought up the issue of divorce..and she got depressed and finally insane..got into woodbridge hospital for some time, attempted suicide many times and finally this year, she jumped down from her apartment block...died instantly.  very young..she is around 27 or 28 this year..a very nice girl..not bad looking also..used to have many suitors.</span></div>
