We are all bystanders in your relationship. We dun know anything about you and your boyfriend. Thus, it is unwise to take our opinions as your opinion. Seriously, you should ask yourself what the whole relationship means to you. Hopefully, you can make a sound decision, without the hearsay and reassurance from all other sources besides you and your bf!</div>
