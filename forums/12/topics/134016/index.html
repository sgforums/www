In fact, we are not<br>spending lots of time togather as he claims he has to work! He frequents pubs often<br>these days and seems to be hanging out often with other gals!

How long has it been since...5 years?<br><br>Well...7 years itch probably refers to in another 2 more years, he'll be dying to try the bitch-next-door if there're any around. &lt;- Ignore this...just my evil thoughts. :-P<br><br>Guys always want other guys to look up to them and give them face as their friends. So...it is merely a case of ego-boosting. You guy probably does that to give his friends the impression that he's wearing the pants in this relationship and you aren't controlling him by his balls in this relationship. He just wanna show his friends that he's the man of the man and just wanna win faces like the other guys does. Some guys does that when out with their friends, but seriously speaking...you really got him by his balls in the relationship haven't you? He does loves and respects you a lot, hasn't he? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Hmm...I don't see any potential threat this relationship, and you're probably just feeling insecure about this relationship. But you'll feel better and get over this once he marries you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>It's has been a stalemate for 4 years almost 5 years already right? Remember, a whirlpool of love is not as exciting as a whirlpool when it has settled down into a stalemate.<br><br>Bottomline...he still loves you a lot as far as I can see. So let him do his braggings to his friends and earn back his ego and he will be back to loving you again after he has recharged his ego and moods and depleted all his frustrations. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Well...he's going to marry you. It's been 5 years together with him and he still didn't get sick of you and even want to spend at least another 50 years staring into your starry eyes occasionally(once in a while...LOL) and says he still loves you. I think if you can also agree that he's the kind who might do such a thing after 50 years....you should be assured that he truly deserves you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Hahahhaa.......so Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

This warning shouldn't be valid. Sadly, because couples do not/lost the will to work on foundation.<br><br>When relationship is spiralling downwards. Always do self check and try to start from a point to climb upwards again.<br>It's a cycle, except whether it's going down or going up.<br><br>Cheers<br></div>
