            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Liya, i will answer this question but itÂ’s important you understand the reasoning behind the answer: So let me start from the beginning:<br><br>First, remember that the term: "Depressive Illness" is a man made term to fit your symptoms into a compartment. It helps to do this, but there is a lot of overlap and the bottom line is that every case is different.". Brain activity and therefore our thinking is all related to chemical reactions. Over the last few years, I have been specialising in treating men with low testosterone levels and it has really confirmed what we all know that "Chemicals affect the way we think". . Taking the example of Testosterone , a hormone present in men and women, it has been found that the concentration of Testosterone in the brain cells is ten times higher than in the serum. This means that the brain cells actively absorb or pump the stuff in. Obviously they need it to function. Look at the change in personality and behaviour of a prepubertal boy developing into a Man. If you cut off the boyÂ’s testicles (and this has been done) before they start pumping out testosterone, the boy never becomes a man. He doesnÂ’t get to be a "smart-ass" doesnÂ’t do burn- outs in his car. DoesnÂ’t get aggressive, doesnÂ’t chase skirts, doesnÂ’t get romantic..DoesnÂ’t develop into a "larrikin". DoesnÂ’t have the drive or the ambition or the feeling of invincibility etc etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>For example: if you drink a bottle of Whisky, you will be drunk, inebriated, you will act stupid and think stupid and no matter how strong your will-power, you will not be able to think and act as you do when your are sober. This is because "chemicals" in this case " alcohol" is affecting your brain. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>"Clinical Depression" is the name doctors give to a common medical condition that is completely different from the usual feeling of depression that we all experience in our life time, a depression that we CAN snap out of without help. Clinical Depression is the condition that can make people feel so depressed that they will take their own life. Their life may be perfect, there may be no reason to be depressed, yet they will be depressed. And not all the will power, not all the counseling, not all the support of friends will be able to change that personÂ’s mood. There will be other symptoms often such as insomnia, irritability, feelings of low self worth, a feeling if immense tiredness and lassitude, a breaking out into tears often for no reason, complete lack of joy of living and unhappiness all sorts of physical symptoms. Just like the Drunk person, these people are controlled by chemicals, the wrong chemicals affecting the way they think. Treat these people with medication and you can remove the depression.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Many depressed people are treated these days with an "SSRI" ( selective serotonin uptake inhibitor Â– a drug that will change the chemistry of their brain) such as PROZAC, and after 2-4 weeks they come back feeling like a new person.<br><br>Most of these people need to stay on the medication for several months. If they then stop, a certain percentage will have a recurrence of the symptoms and need to get back on medication again for a few months. If they then stop, again not all but a percentage of them will again get a recurrence and need to be on the medication for the rest of their life.<br><br>If a patient develops Diabetes, his metabolism is badly disturbed and this can be rectified by medications: tabs or Insulin injections. In the bad cases the patient needs to be on Insulin for the rest of their life. Off it for a few days and they get very sick. Again Diabetes is a term that encompasses a broad range of degrees of illness with differing aetiology ( cause).<br><br>If a person is diabetic because of self-indulgent stress on his body, e.g. eating enormous amounts of sweets, not exercising, he can eventually cure himself by change in life style and diet. If the diabetic is a young healthy teenager who suddenly gets sick, has a parent who is an insulin dependant diabetic, the lad will need insulin for the rest of his life.<br><br>So too with depression. If the "chemical change in the brain " has been caused by a large amount of mental stress over a long time, change in environment and stress levels can of themselves effect a cure. If the person gets depressed when there is no obvious cause and there is a family history of depression, or suicide, or nervous breakdown, this is more likely to be a genetic malfunction that will always be present and always require treatment.<br><br>I talk about depression because there is so much more of it and I have a huge experience in it, but the concepts equally apply to all the related conditions. DonÂ’t forget, as I said, the partitions and pigeon-holes are man made. We donÂ’t understand problems of the mind as well as, for example, diabetes. You can take a blood sample to check sugar and insulin levels, but you canÂ’t take a brain sample to measure serotonin or noradrenalin etc.<br><br>I hope it helps..<br><br>cheers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Before I begin on my part, I would urge you to seek professional advice if ya can? With extension over time, this could develop into something quite serious?<br><br>To begin... I would like you to know that being retained and repeat for a year is not everything? Though it's gonna mean that you've probably wasted (well.. Not everything? At least ya still have your experience to gain?) for that year...? Bad, but could be WORSE with your form of mentality...? This kinda thing is pretty COMMON.... People DO get retained for studies, and I'm NO EXCEPTION..... SIMPLE MATHEMATICS.... A year of your life GONE, your WHOLE life GONE.... SIMPLE PICTURE? Running away from home won't help much too, cause eventually you'll still have to face your life? Only more time wasted.... Running away from home, running away from school, I've tried all that.... Personal advice, they don't work.... I guess I certainly did wish that they would work? Certainly would have made life so much easily for me now won't it....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">&gt;<br><br>If you couldn't make it this year DO IT AGAIN NEXT year??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  And the one after and after if you can't...? UNTIL you make it...? Well.... I can still remember the days when I was just a normal human being.... I cried alot too...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  The year I REPEATED, it was like HELL... Despite my 'couldn't be bothered' attitude.... Despite me getting SO USED to failing EVERY SINGLE one of my test and exams..... But one thing I realised? No matter how much I cry, things won't change.... Treasure whatever you've got now... If you've DONE YOUR PART, you shouldn't be despair? You should be PROUD of yourself no matter whatever's the result....? I've came to realise this thing and I'm gonna share it with you here... In Life, it's not WHO you're gonna be that's gonna really matter... It's WHAT you gonna DO...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Cause ALL of us would eventually DIE one day.... And when that day comes, there won't be much left of the 'WHO'......<br><br><strong><br>2 and a half years in e course, i've been stressed before, but never as stressed as what i am feeling now. maybe because it is the final proj in my course, and i know i will have to repeat the year if i fail.</strong><br><br>What course are you handling now? Seek around among your friends and see if you can get any good help or sound advices from the people in the related field? Final year project or not it's still the SAME.... If ya can't handle it, what makes you think your other friends can?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Have a little more confident in yourself...?<br><br>I still remember there was this 'killer maths lecturer' from UK doing one of our module during my poly days... Everybody was REAL SCARED of him... His requirement was SH[/i]ITTY and he held HIGH EXPECTATIONs of us... He THREATENED us.... And almost everybody was SCARED out of their WITS.... And finally when the FINAL PAPER came...? More than half of the classes got RETAINED a module because of him... But there was something which I've learnt from this lesson.... That is... Some of the students were still KICKING no matter HOW IMPOSSIBLE it seems...? They might not have done that great for score... But they MANAGED it... Some FAILED no matter how hard they tried.... They CRIED infront of me... I told them... What do they think they could have done...? They said 'NOTHING'.... I guess that's PRECISELY the point.... The next module, they just KICKED EVEN HARDER.... MOST of them  PASSED with FLYING COLORS..... And of course there're some who just GAVE UP on themselves..... They FAILED, they BLAMED it on that lecturer... I said since you've already GIVEN UP.... What can you say? Such people have just resigned their results to 'fate'.....<br><br><strong><br>i started out in e course being one of the lousiest students in class. then eventually, maybe i improved, maybe the rest got worse, i manage to do better year after year. i think should be latter...my standards did not really improve, just maintaining... i finally managed to do a relatively good proj for my last sem, then now i am facing the largest mental block.<br><br>i do know that i am be stressing myself too much, because like my friends say, i expect a lot from myself, xiang tai duo, yong ren zhi rao, but i never want to stress myself up, but for the past few days i have been crying uncontrollably on and off.<br><br>i am not exaggerating, but over the past 1 week i might have cried at least 50 times. i cried at least 10 times in my 20 waking hours each day. </strong><br><br>Tell you the funny part I realised about the 'crying me' of the past...? If I didn't cry that much, I probably could have used the amount of energy I spent CRYING and managing my emotions establishing MORE in Life.... But well... I guess it's just all PART of growing up...? So long as ya LEARN from it... NOTHING is wasted....<br>I somehow have this idea.... Perhaps you've just got this GREAT PROJECT that requires so much of your time that you're having difficulty completing it..? So it could be a pretty good thing in a sense...? And another thing...? Other than TIME SCHEDULE for projects, there're also 'SCALING DOWN'.... If ya cannot finish a project but you 'die die' have to submit it... You can either (1) ask for TIME EXTENSION... Which usually happens in society situation where matters of life and death is involved... It's not advisable for you to do it here for though you would be GRANTED your wish, a considerable amount of your grade would probably be PENALISED for that.... (2) cut back on things... Try to build and concentrate on the 'skeleton' of your project 1st so as to ensure that it would be 'completed' on time.... Put the 'touch ups' later in terms of priority? Hope this would help...?<br><br>I used to be someone from the bottom of the ladder climbing to the top too... So I can somehow understand your anxiety... But REMEMBER this, it's NOT WHO you WERE which matters... It's WHO you ARE today...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  And nothing's really gonna change that FACT except yuorself....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><strong><br>i really want to die, literally, i kept thinking about jumping off the block's roof, or run away from home. hen xin ku... really cried until eyes puffy. But i am not sad every hour every minute of the day of course, usually is when i see my family members watching tv, but i am in the room doing and doing and doing and doing. my things like cannot finish one, do until i fall sick do until i cry still cannot finish.</strong><br><br>Another thing here... Learn to take care of your 'SELF'.... As much as the project is IMPORTANT to you, never neglect your health... Try not to neglect your 'mood' also as it's a natural 'boost'.... Though you would probably have to exercise some discipline and control over yourself, giving yourself some time to rest, take a break... Breathe... IS IMPORTANT.... Nobody wants to work for a lousy boss...? Not even your own body...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  It's a matter of 'give n take'..... Try to work a little on that? It's somehow quite easy to figure out as you goes along...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><strong><br>then finally 3 am liao, can sleep liao, whole night at the back of my mind i kept hearing myself talking about my proj, 'cannot finish how', 'if i don't stay up for the next 3 days i sure cannot finish my work'... but even with all these thoughts, i cannot wake up, they just keep coming back, but i can't wake up without a lot of struggling with myself.</strong><br><br>Try to take up meditation or some relaxation techniques... It's IMPORTANT for you to understand the DIFFERENCE between WORK and REST.... Perhaps it would be easier to comprehense it but nt your body...? Using those 'relaxation techniques' teach your body to rest when it has to.... It's just like tucking a child into bed.... Learn to control your mental state of mind... This might not be easy for some but it's almost definitely POSSIBLE with practice..... I USED to experience the same kind of problem as you.... Now I can SLEEP ALMOST instantaneously.... ALMOST anywhere...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br><strong><br>today was a bit worse, i could not finish an amount of work i gave myself within a time frame. i know the consequences that one section of the proj delayed means the whole proj will not be able to complete. i begin crying (as usual, i am so sick of myself) then i started to have problem breathing properly. gasping for air, fist clenched, shivering... </strong><br><br>Please refer to above.... Projects ain't always about the 'fight against time'... There're sometimes 'shortcuts' to them.... 'Make to do' with some drop in standard... TRUST me that I was a PERFECTIONIST in project handling in the past... I couldn't stand such ideas too... Until I came to realise that 'something' is always BETTER than 'nothing'....?<br><br><strong><br>i very scared, i am not having depression am i? i only know i am sad, upset, but i hope this's not depression... </strong><br><br>Don't worry or think too much about it...? If it is, it is.... Or it isn't you won't be do any better by worrying so much...? Sometimes 'depression' can be cured... Sometimes ANXIETY could be CREATED.... Your state of mind in IMPORTANT especially when you're pretty much under STRESS now....<br><br>Don't worry, be happy... Getting a pinch on your arm's probably not gonna kill you...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Master -_-:</div><div class="quote_body">Dear Liya, i will answer this question but itÂ’s important you understand the reasoning behind the answer: So let me start from the beginning:<br><br>First, remember that the term: "Depressive Illness" is a man made term to fit your symptoms into a compartment. It helps to do this, but there is a lot of overlap and the bottom line is that every case is different.". Brain activity and therefore our thinking is all related to chemical reactions. Over the last few years, I have been specialising in treating men with low testosterone levels and it has really confirmed what we all know that "Chemicals affect the way we think". . Taking the example of Testosterone , a hormone present in men and women, it has been found that the concentration of Testosterone in the brain cells is ten times higher than in the serum. This means that the brain cells actively absorb or pump the stuff in. Obviously they need it to function. Look at the change in personality and behaviour of a prepubertal boy developing into a Man. If you cut off the boyÂ’s testicles (and this has been done) before they start pumping out testosterone, the boy never becomes a man. He doesnÂ’t get to be a "smart-ass" doesnÂ’t do burn- outs in his car. DoesnÂ’t get aggressive, doesnÂ’t chase skirts, doesnÂ’t get romantic..DoesnÂ’t develop into a "larrikin". DoesnÂ’t have the drive or the ambition or the feeling of invincibility etc etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>For example: if you drink a bottle of Whisky, you will be drunk, inebriated, you will act stupid and think stupid and no matter how strong your will-power, you will not be able to think and act as you do when your are sober. This is because "chemicals" in this case " alcohol" is affecting your brain. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>"Clinical Depression" is the name doctors give to a common medical condition that is completely different from the usual feeling of depression that we all experience in our life time, a depression that we CAN snap out of without help. Clinical Depression is the condition that can make people feel so depressed that they will take their own life. Their life may be perfect, there may be no reason to be depressed, yet they will be depressed. And not all the will power, not all the counseling, not all the support of friends will be able to change that personÂ’s mood. There will be other symptoms often such as insomnia, irritability, feelings of low self worth, a feeling if immense tiredness and lassitude, a breaking out into tears often for no reason, complete lack of joy of living and unhappiness all sorts of physical symptoms. Just like the Drunk person, these people are controlled by chemicals, the wrong chemicals affecting the way they think. Treat these people with medication and you can remove the depression.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Many depressed people are treated these days with an "SSRI" ( selective serotonin uptake inhibitor Â– a drug that will change the chemistry of their brain) such as PROZAC, and after 2-4 weeks they come back feeling like a new person.<br><br>Most of these people need to stay on the medication for several months. If they then stop, a certain percentage will have a recurrence of the symptoms and need to get back on medication again for a few months. If they then stop, again not all but a percentage of them will again get a recurrence and need to be on the medication for the rest of their life.<br><br>If a patient develops Diabetes, his metabolism is badly disturbed and this can be rectified by medications: tabs or Insulin injections. In the bad cases the patient needs to be on Insulin for the rest of their life. Off it for a few days and they get very sick. Again Diabetes is a term that encompasses a broad range of degrees of illness with differing aetiology ( cause).<br><br>If a person is diabetic because of self-indulgent stress on his body, e.g. eating enormous amounts of sweets, not exercising, he can eventually cure himself by change in life style and diet. If the diabetic is a young healthy teenager who suddenly gets sick, has a parent who is an insulin dependant diabetic, the lad will need insulin for the rest of his life.<br><br>So too with depression. If the "chemical change in the brain " has been caused by a large amount of mental stress over a long time, change in environment and stress levels can of themselves effect a cure. If the person gets depressed when there is no obvious cause and there is a family history of depression, or suicide, or nervous breakdown, this is more likely to be a genetic malfunction that will always be present and always require treatment.<br><br>I talk about depression because there is so much more of it and I have a huge experience in it, but the concepts equally apply to all the related conditions. DonÂ’t forget, as I said, the partitions and pigeon-holes are man made. We donÂ’t understand problems of the mind as well as, for example, diabetes. You can take a blood sample to check sugar and insulin levels, but you canÂ’t take a brain sample to measure serotonin or noradrenalin etc.<br><br>I hope it helps..<br><br>cheers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>wah!! pple oni 2 sentence u can write so much... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
