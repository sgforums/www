Basically, is to let her mature, so that she won't wonder off with another yandao again. It is also to let her know u better?? How long have u known her?? A yr?? 2 yrs?? 3 yrs?

In this world, is there any one who can escape from using money to obtain things that we need, use or eat in life?? But the reason behind getting a better life that's wat is important... Is it to show off to pple that u have succeed in life?? is it to tell pple that i got money and girls will want me?? Or to get back at pple who have rejected u or look down on u in the past?? I'm not saying the want to have lots of money is bad.. but at least u must know y u r earning it, know how it is to be used...<br><br>THere are less true love in this world, i agree to that.. as we can see the divorce rate is rising.. But there are guys who become house husbands, they are not the breadwinner of the family, they dun earn much. Do u think the wife of the house husband married him because of material needs?? Or do u think that this is becoz the guy loves the girl's wealth?? Which I seriously doubt so. There was a documentary show around Fathers' Day touching in house husbands, and there was one who was on the telly.<br><br>U sure there's no such things as true love?? Maybe just that you have not met up wif one... I doubt that u are that much older from me, hence there's still a long way to go... y go ard telling urself there's not true love in ths world?? u still got decades of ur life to live... and there's still lots of time for u to get a girl. And i tell u becoz on ur thinking, it could have a negative impact on ur life...<br><br>Besides, furthermore if u think that there are no such thing as true love in this world, y are u looking out for girls?? Y are u still finding ur true love?? that's because think that it exist.. Coz u have been telling us how badly u have been hurt from ur rejections...<br><br>Well, if u like a girl, perservere on.. one day that sun will shine on u.. she will be touched... Just be there when ever she needs someone to comfort. support her when she falls, joke wif her when she's happy that's how u care for her.. she will reflect, telling herself that u have been there for her all these while, things will change.. and things did change for a friend of mine.. after 11 yrs.. she realised something.. and told me abt it some time ago..<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)
