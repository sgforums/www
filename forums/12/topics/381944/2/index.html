Be absolutely sure he is of the character you hold in high regard, and is what you want. Do not just because he put his arms around your waist, you fell in love with him.</div>
              <div class="actions overlay_dropdown_menu">Go slow, study him, and then when you know you really like him, give him the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hint</span>.</div>

              <p>The high wages and shortage of labor brought into the labor market
              many persons who would not have been in it in peacetime, such as old
              persons, youths, clergy, and, above all, women.</p>

              social life and modes of living, revolutionizing the relations of the
              sexes, bringing women up to a level of social, legal, and political
              equality closer than previously to that of men, obtaining for them the
              right to vote in some countries, the right to own or dispose of

              costume of women by such innovations as shorter skirts, shorter hair,
              less frills, and generally a drastic reduction in the amount of
              clothing they wore...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The shift from home to school in the
              early grades was adjusted to by girls more easily than by boys, partly
              because girls were more self-assured and gregarious. By the age of ten
              or twelve, girls were developed physically, neurologically,
              emotionally, and socially about two years in advance of boys.</p>
              <p>All this
              tended to make boys less self-assured, indecisive, weak, and dependent.
              The steady increase in the percentage of women teachers in the lower
              grades worked in the same direction, since women teachers favored girls
              and praised those attitudes and techniques that were more natural to
              girls. New methods, such as the whole-word method of teaching reading
              or the use of true-and-false or multiple-choice examinations, were also
              better adapted to female than to masculine talents.</p>
              <p>Less and less
              emphasis was placed on critical judgment, while more and more was
              placed on intuitive or subjective decisions. In this environment girls
              did better, and boys felt inferior or decided that school was a place
              for girls and not for boys. The growing aggressiveness of girls pushed
              these hesitant boys aside and intensified the problem. As consequences
              of this, boys had twice as many "non-readers" as girls, several times
              as many stutterers, and many times as many teen-age bed-wetters.</p>
              <p>     While the outside world was decreasing its
              differential treatment of children on a sexual basis by treating boys
              and girls more and more alike (and that treatment was better adapted to
              girls than to boys) within the middle-class home, the growing emotional
              frustrations of the mother were leading to an increasing distinction on
              a sexual basis in her emotional treatment of her children.</p>
              <p>     The earliest feeling of sensual reassurance and
              comfort any child experiences is against the body of its mother. To a
              boy baby this is a heterosexual relationship, while to the girl it is a
              relationship with the same sex. In most cases the little girl avoids
              any undesirable persistence of this homosexual tendency by shifting her
              admiration and attention to some available male, usually her father.</p>
              <p>Thus by the age of six or eight, a daughter has become "Daddy's girl,"
              awaiting his return from work to communicate the news of the day,
              getting his slippers and newspaper, and hoping that he will read her a
              story or share her viewing of a favorite television program before she
              must go to bed. By the age of twelve, in a normal girl, this interest
              in male creatures has begun to shift to some boy in her class at
              school. With a boy baby the transference is later and less gradual.</p>
              <p>The
              undesirable aspects of his love for his mother are avoided by the
              powerful social pressures of the incest taboo, but this merely means
              that the sexual element in his concern for the opposite sex is
              suppressed and is undeveloped. Thus there is a natural, we might almost
              say biological, tendency in our society for the sexual development of
              the boy to be delayed and for the girl to be free from this retarding
              influence...</p>
              <p>ne result of this is that the much greater (sometimes indefinitely
              postponed) delay for a boy of emotional readiness after sexual
              awareness leaves the boy emotionally desexed for so long that it
              affects his sexuality and emotional maturity adversely and to an
              increasingly advanced age. But the opposite is true for a girl, because
              of the shorter and decreasing lag of her emotional readiness after her
              sexual awareness.</p>
              <p>Lolita, who is not as rare as the readers of that
              novel wanted to imagine, becomes increasingly frequent, and cannot be
              satisfied by boys of her own age; consequently she seeks for many
              reasons, including financial resources and greater emotional maturity,
              her sex companions among older men...</p>

              <p>The high wages and shortage of labor brought into the labor market many persons who would not have been in it in peacetime, such as old persons, youths, clergy, and, above all, women.</p>
              <p>This flow of women from homes into factories or other services had the most profound effects on social life and modes of living, revolutionizing the relations of the sexes, bringing women up to a level of social, legal, and political equality closer than previously to that of men, obtaining for them the right to vote in some countries, the right to own or dispose of property in other more backward ones, changing the appearance and costume of women by such innovations as shorter skirts, shorter hair, less frills, and generally a drastic reduction in the amount of clothing they wore...</p>
