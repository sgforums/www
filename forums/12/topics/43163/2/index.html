Read from some forum and find it interesting.<br><br>^^Hey which forum is this?  Icered?<br><br>Saying that singapore chinese guys are<br><br>1.) Cheap Skate<br>* sg gals claim to be financially stable n they can earn their own $$..yet, they wan their guys to pay everything for them..kinda contradicting right??<br><br>^^actually, i agree with you on this.  sg gals want to go eat at posh place.  bring them to hawker centre not class enough.  go food court slightly better but go Restaurant is best.  BUT one meal in restaurant can feed me for 1 week in hawker centres.  hahahaha....<br><br>2.) Not Gd Looking ( So they prefer malays and india guys )<br>* beauty in eyes of beholder..btw, sg gals also must look into the mirror how goodlooking 1st<br><br>^^sg gals are very pretty BUT only when they smile.  They cannot anyhow smile because then the sg BUAYAs will think they have a chance.  So best not to smile and be less goodlooking.  Pity them - smile! Guys think they got chance, Don't smile!  Guys say they're bitchy.  heh heh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>3.) Not Caring and Considerate ( So they choose Ang Mo )<br>* how caring n considerate u wan??..to let the gals climb over their heads??..<br><br>^^Go ask ang mo char bors and see if western guys caring or not?!?  Be man must have a little style.  Can care but cannot care too much.<br><br>4.) Too MCP<br>females are very mcp these days as well.<br>I like FCPs!  But most of them like their own sex so.... ulp!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>5.) Just want Sex<br>if its human, all need sex.<br><br>^^It's true.  Guys who want sex can be very charming, NOT cheap skate, very caring, very NOT MCP.  So give them SEX, SEX and more SEX and you'll see that chinese guys are very COOL.  But face it lah.... Western guys also want SEX.  Difference is that their tactics are more refined.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

If you go to Coffee-StarBeans make sure you order the cheapest coffee and sit there for the whole afternoon to maximise your $3.40.  Dressing a little nice can also enhance your posh-ness.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   hahaha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
