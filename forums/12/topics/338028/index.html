              <p>Back to aunt agony after a long while. Hope you guys will give me some opinions of yours? Thank you in advance.</p>
              <p><br>Lately, got back into contact with a friend. Well, our relationship was a complicated one, i will say. About a year back, we're in 'More-than-friends,less-than-couple' status. Both didnt want to take a further step, unsure of own feeling. (note: lately i wasnt the one that contacted him first) I wanted to leave many a time then, but always dont bear to, for fear of hurting him.</p>
              <p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>He left, out of my life, all of a sudden then (overnight, in fact), via a sms saying that he wanted to look for true love, which he found in his work place (that time he only started working for a week) , a girl he fall in love at first sight. He didnt admit it initially  till i finally forced the truth out of him (i noticed a huge change in his attitude since he started working, &amp; all those mushy smses, phone calls &amp; msn with another girl, things that once done, for me only. I didnt say anything, for i'm not in the position to. All i did was just watch. I refuse to believe, initially, just deceiving myself to feel better). He previously said he wanted freedom, asking me to let him go &amp; work, so i let him go out &amp; do whatever he want, to work &amp; what's not. Only to find him coming back saying he fall for another girl.</p>
              <p>Was devastated then, definitely. Just when i found myself slowly falling for him, touched with everything he'd done, he send me a sms saying he found his true love &amp; asked me to let him go. Told me that he'd never loved me before &amp; he was too immature then &amp; he really regret starting with me. He said he really didnt know what to do in order not to hurt me that much so he decided to leave all of a sudden &amp; avoid the awkwardness of telling me in the face. ( and ya, leaving me to clear up the mess, alone.) I cried, did all i could to salvage the relationship (or not, since we didnt ended up officially together. He did say that i was his gf, but i didnt admit it for he never officially asked me) He cut off all possible contact with me, telling me to find my true love, as he'd found his.</p>
              <p>I'd my down-period for about a month &amp; decided to buck myself up, grateful that it was exam period. So there's something for me to concentrate on apart from feeling all upset. His shadow was everywhere, every single corner, it was horrible. All the place that i used to hangout near my place before knowing him, were all filled with him because we went all those places together before. I started avoiding every single possible place that remind me of him. Stop all the furtile effort of contacting him (he wont even bother replying), divert all my attention into exam &amp; finally found him totally out of my life, even memories.</p>
              <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Just some background story.</p>
              <p>Anyway, i injured myself sometime back so i told him about it. Since then, he started messaging me everyday asking how is my injury, is it getting better &amp; what's not.  When i told him that it's recovering, he stop replying to my messages &amp; stop messaging me anymore.</p>
              <p>Seriously, what is he thinking? Hurt me to the max &amp; left, leaving me to recover on my own. Suddenly message me out of the blue, &amp; kept messaging me asking about my opinions on his decision, appearing in my life all over again. Then show me alot of concern upon knowing my injury, then left all of a sudden again.</p>
              <p>Are all guys so complicated? Or am i just unlucky to have met one like this?</p>
              <p>Drop me your opinions of what you think he's thinking alright. Thank you.</p>

              <p>Well, there was no relationship between you and him that is officially announced and when he tried to announce, you denied. So, there was no break out in the first place.</p>
              <p>Anyway, he is just being nice to ask you about your injury... In regards to the leaving you alone and didn't tell you about it in person is just so typically coward of him. Anyway, I guess you just boys and gals still in school... so, forget about it lah... young love usually don't last...</p>

              <p>hmm, alright. But why did he disappear out of my life totally by not replying at all that time then suddenly appear &amp; be nice...before disappearing again?</p>

              <p>hi R-emo, I think you are stuck in the same situation as I do. I really don't know what to say. But just hope that you try to get over it without any thoughts or question and focus on your exam. He may be just a passer-by in your life. In future there more to come. So just forget it, and take thing easy.</p>
              <p>But if you really wants to know what the reason, you can confront him, scream and yell at him, just to get it off or seek for justice.</p>
              <p>Sometime, people always ask "why can't I find a right man". But have anyone ever thought that are they really mentally or physically fully prepare to meet the right men in life. If the answer is "yes". I think god already had a plan, but just time is not ripe yet. However, if the answer is "no", I think there no point in finding one now. cause, we are not fully prepare yet. Even manage to find one, the relationship will  not work  or the path will  be a difficult one.</p>

              <p>Look at it from his PoV. Perhaps he wasn't experienced/ mature enough to handle breaking up properly. </p>

He didnt admit it initially  till i finally forced the truth out of him (i noticed a huge change in his attitude since he started working, &amp; all those mushy smses, phone calls &amp; msn with another girl, things that once done, for me only. I didnt say anything, for i'm not in the position to. All i did was just watch. I refuse to believe, initially, just deceiving myself to feel better). He previously said he wanted freedom, asking me to let him go &amp; work, so i let him go out &amp; do whatever he want, to work &amp; what's not. Only to find him coming back saying he fall for another girl.</p>
              <p>Was devastated then, definitely. Just when i found myself slowly falling for him, touched with everything he'd done, he send me a sms saying he found his true love &amp; asked me to let him go. Told me that he'd never loved me before &amp; he was too immature then &amp; he really regret starting with me. He said he really didnt know what to do in order not to hurt me that much so he decided to leave all of a sudden &amp; avoid the awkwardness of telling me in the face. ( and ya, leaving me to clear up the mess, alone.) I cried, did all i could to salvage the relationship (or not, since we didnt ended up officially together. He did say that i was his gf, but i didnt admit it for he never officially asked me) He cut off all possible contact with me, telling me to find my true love, as he'd found his.</p>
              <p>I'd my down-period for about a month &amp; decided to buck myself up, grateful that it was exam period. So there's something for me to concentrate on apart from feeling all upset. His shadow was everywhere, every single corner, it was horrible. All the place that i used to hangout near my place before knowing him, were all filled with him because we went all those places together before. I started avoiding every single possible place that remind me of him. Stop all the furtile effort of contacting him (he wont even bother replying), divert all my attention into exam &amp; finally found him totally out of my life, even memories.</p>
              <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>Just some background story.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Anyway, i injured myself sometime back so i told him about it.</span> Since then, he started messaging me everyday asking how is my injury, is it getting better &amp; what's not.  When i told him that it's recovering, he stop replying to my messages &amp; stop messaging me anymore.</p>
              <p>Seriously, what is he thinking? Hurt me to the max &amp; left, leaving me to recover on my own. Suddenly message me out of the blue, &amp; kept messaging me asking about my opinions on his decision, appearing in my life all over again. Then show me alot of concern upon knowing my injury, then left all of a sudden again.</p>
              <p>Are all guys so complicated? Or am i just unlucky to have met one like this?</p>
              <p>Drop me your opinions of what you think he's thinking alright. Thank you.</p>

              <p>Hi R-emo</p>
              <p>This is just a guess.  He likes your companionship when he is lonely or bored, but he wants to choose the best girlfriend that he thinks he might able to search for, or at least try to look for one himself and not someone entering to his life naturally.</p>
              <p>He has feelings for you but just care and concern as a good friend that knows him, not because he loves you at this time.</p>
              <p>Not a bad guy afterall as he is honest to you about his feelings. Some guys will never tell their gf the truth at all and dragged a few years and then dumped the girl. He did it fast so that he is not wasting your time. He dare not face you to solve the issue, could be he feels guilty and he might  be a soft-hearted person that could not do it  face-to-face.</p>
              <p>Some guys are just shopping for the best gf( beautiful, rich, capable and independent) along the way till they found one.</p>
              <p>Please move on.  There are many good guys around you, and this time, safest to make make sure if the person is interested in you before you fall in for him so that you wont get so much hurt again.</p>
              <p>One key issue in relationship is to have good communication and care for each other feeling all the time.</p>
              <p>What i mean is when both parties are honest about their feelings and you have to find out yourself. There are many ways to know besides asking him, observe him closely and that cant be hidden in the long run.</p>
