            <div class='col-md body'>Omg this is wad i did....<br><br>perhaps its due to the way i grew up as a only child,which results in my limited social skills..even some of my good friends that i most often mixed in are very shy persons..(u know the we are the guai guai type and is quite popular among the girls in school type but still gonggong dunno wad to do type)so inevitably im indeed the very "noobie" type in approaching girls,so i didn't know where i picked up the courage make out this 1st step...<br><br>spent the whole of last night practising in front of the mirror planning wad to talk to her...<br><br>today morning wake up with an exceptional eagerness which i never had b4..<br><br>brush my teeth repeatedly 3 times until its shinning white...<br><br>spent about 45mins just to do my hair alone..!!!!(which is so new to me,often i don't comb my hair at all as most of the girls im going to meet everyday dosent catch my eye,most often i have this feeling that combing my hair to meet them is a waste of my gel..)<br>But its so DIFFERENT today..45mins.....(im so concern of wad she thinks of me) im afraid from these facts im already able to make a conclusion of the kind of "feelings" for her..<br><br>then happily dressed up picked my bag,and step out of the doorsteps with my rarely worn long sleeved white shirt which i rarely wear unless there's important occasion spray some perfume together with my "45mins combed hair"<br><br>then when i happily reached the bus stop,i saw some many malays in their traditional costumes which suddenly reminds me of today is hari raya (WHICH MEANS A PUBLLLIICCC HOLLIIIDDAAAYYYY!!!!)  OMG!<br><br>i actually got so excited over meeting her that i forgot its a public holiday today..which means there's no tuition class today!!..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>However imma gonna try again next week..<br><br>but the main important point is that im finally able to build up the courage to approach her but sometimes shyt do happens...<br><br>so im indeed very very very worried about my courage is going to be diminished by the time next week comes..<br><br></div>
