Find some excuse to talk to her even if it is a silly excuse and she knows it is just an excuse.<br><br>There is no need to be brilliant (what you think is brilliant) and instead scare her off.

First step is nothing too hard, and if you do it right - most of a time it's a yes <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Get the number, call her - the local culture seems to prefer to sms in this situation instead, after few days... Keep the chat brief and ask if she would like to come out for dinner/tea...<br><br>If she doesn't take bait,  keep in touch with her. Wait till she is a little more comfortable with you in real life (you mentioned tuition) and then invite her to go out again.<br><br>I normally prefer dinner dates for the first time, it's much quieter than movies or any crap of the same nature. Spend the time during dinner, to understand her better - keep it cool and funny, make sure she's comfortable <br><br>Depending on how the dinner date goes, make your own plans from there. It might lead to a movie, a stroll by the beach, more chatting in a park, some drinking in a bar  &gt; or even immediately...... hehe</div>
