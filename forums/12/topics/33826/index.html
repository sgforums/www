If not, to surmount to the top - its difficult.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Woman, who needs to feel depended - when comes to LDR, cannot meet their partners often.

I am sure you have no lack of suitor thg7... I believe you will go through this in no time. Your guy doesn't appreciate you, but that doesn't mean other guys are the same. I believe someone suitable will be there.

            <div class='col-md body'>things took a sudden turn of change for the past few days.<br>he told me that he had a crush on another singaporean gal, and even held hands together. I was crushed when he told me tat.<br>I even scolded him. Though i shld not scold him, as he has the right to like anybody. Still, i just don't understand why he treated me like tat. Do i deserve to be treated this way ........<br>He kept telling me it is just a crush,nothing impt. Who he is trying to fool ? Me not a 3 yr old kid. Now he told me tat he has given up on the gal as she told him that she is not ready for any r/s. Again he stated the same reason "long distance hard for him" Crap reason, i guess.<br>What does he take me for ? Spare tyre ? I felt so pissed that i told him off that i wun trust guys and will make life difficult for them.<br>Then he told me he is sick and not feeling well. He is trying to get my attention, isn't it ? He damm lousy.<br>When he needs me, then he comes and finds me.<br>When he doesn't need me, he forgets abt me.<br>my friends tell me to ignore this type of guy, not worth my time.<br>i regretted knowing him........<br><br></div>
