Hey Junk, can you imagine if you ex-gf were to declare with full confidence that you learn absolutely nothing from WHY she left you and WHAT'S wrong with the relationship - you truely need to reflect deeply or seek professional help if you can't handle it yourself.<br><br>To Junk:<br><br>If you do employ sucide and death as measures to get back on ANY form of relationship only reveal your gnawing inferiority, lack of spiritual wisdom and a twisted form of emotional mindset. These three elements combine and fuel your inability to control your own emotions and when you experience anger - you lose your rational sense.<br><br>All the post you posted, focus on why you didn't love her more - when in fact, you need to dissolve your personality issue INSTEAD of habouring any form of relationship.<br><br><strong>YOU CANNOT LEARN TO LOVE OTHERS IF YOU FAILED TO EVOLVE YOUR SOUL SPIRITUALLY AND MATURE.</strong> Mark my words, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all future relationship will fail if you continue this way.</span><br><br>Evelyn made a decision to FORCE you to learn this theory - you pushed them aside and wanted her back - like lost toy to a child. Don't you see it? A break is essential for you to learn. Do you wish to see this effort put to waste? 5 years relationship - not even worth a cent in value? Please lar, at the very least, don't let other people depise you in relationship like what it is here. Stop walloping in self-pity and self-delusion. The very fact that you ended up in such a hell hole is because you don't even have the courage and willpower to improve yourself.<br><br>And you wanna talk about love? Please lar, don't make me laugh. How many people have I encountered who always talk so 'great' about their lost 'true love' and gotten so much ranting and violence? (Come Sunrise, tell them how many? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> )Stop drama and start doing something concrete to improve yourself. If you farking want to die, go ahead - by the way ar, don't need to tell anyone. If you farking want to prove that this 5 years relationship is worth its every value - learn to learn and grow. <strong>If you want to live in your illusion and avoid reality - wOohOo, Evelyn, You MADE such a good choice - how can you expect a man like HIM to protect you? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He can't even handle himself</span>.</strong>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>To Evelyn:<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Every relationship brings us somewhere and because of that, in return, we serve to bring people elsewhere simultaneously. Your intense relationship with him is based on two karmic possibilities:<br><br>Law of Polarity: Opposite end attracts.<br><br>Psychological: Mirror Law - relationship with others is in fact relationship with ourselves.<br><br>Learn to love yourself. Only then you will attract people who will care and treasure you.<br><br>Cheers</div>

Yunhaier, i do agree from your point of view.. in fact very much.<br><br>Forget it, junk, we understand how you feel after what has been done, but maybe it's a way or method to let you grow up. But say the truth, you're lucky to have a 5 year relationship.. but still, in this 5 year , you've learn nothing.. that i 've no comments on you. should i say you're hopeless, stupid.. or something like that? nah, i won't say it. coz one day you will learn to think for yourself and doing all those are wrong.<br><br>but right now, the only way out, break up is already break up. you want her to forgive you in some a short time, i find it quite impossible. right now, you're free, learn to calm yourself down.. and think.<br><br>you didn't acted pity, but what's feeling your heart is guilt.. and to others, this kind of things, sometimes we really find it hard to say. so don't just see people's wrong.. but reflect it to yourself as well.<br><br>Wrong is already wrong.. milk has been spilled.. can you re-filled it ? Can you mend the crack that's in her heart? Only you know, junk.<br><br>But the best to you, no next time, or else you're really no hope.. get the courage to admit it's your mistakes and stop telling everyone that you didn't do this and that before and why now and that.. coz it's  O V 3 R .<br></div>

Apologise when you're wrong, even if you've also been wronged<br>- Well, somebody gotta start breaking that wall of ice before the whole friendship is destroyed.<br><br>3.

Hey Junk, can you imagine if you ex-gf were to declare with full confidence that you learn absolutely nothing from WHY she left you and WHAT'S wrong with the relationship - you truely need to reflect deeply or seek professional help if you can't handle it yourself.<br><br>To Junk:<br><br>If you do employ sucide and death as measures to get back on ANY form of relationship only reveal your gnawing inferiority, lack of spiritual wisdom and a twisted form of emotional mindset. These three elements combine and fuel your inability to control your own emotions and when you experience anger - you lose your rational sense.<br><br>All the post you posted, focus on why you didn't love her more - when in fact, you need to dissolve your personality issue INSTEAD of habouring any form of relationship.<br><br>YOU CANNOT LEARN TO LOVE OTHERS IF YOU FAILED TO EVOLVE YOUR SOUL SPIRITUALLY AND MATURE. Mark my words, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all future relationship will fail if you continue this way.</span><br><br>Evelyn made a decision to FORCE you to learn this theory - you pushed them aside and wanted her back - like lost toy to a child. Don't you see it? A break is essential for you to learn. Do you wish to see this effort put to waste? 5 years relationship - not even worth a cent in value? Please lar, at the very least, don't let other people depise you in relationship like what it is here. Stop walloping in self-pity and self-delusion. The very fact that you ended up in such a hell hole is because you don't even have the courage and willpower to improve yourself.<br><br>And you wanna talk about love? Please lar, don't make me laugh. How many people have I encountered who always talk so 'great' about their lost 'true love' and gotten so much ranting and violence? <span style="color: red;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">(Come Sunrise, tell them how many? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> )</span></span></span>Stop drama and start doing something concrete to improve yourself. If you farking want to die, go ahead - by the way ar, don't need to tell anyone. If you farking want to prove that this 5 years relationship is worth its every value - learn to learn and grow. [b]If you want to live in your illusion and avoid reality - wOohOo, Evelyn, You MADE such a good choice - how can you expect a man like HIM to protect you? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">He can't even handle himself</span>.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>To Evelyn:<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Every relationship brings us somewhere and because of that, in return, we serve to bring people elsewhere simultaneously. Your intense relationship with him is based on two karmic possibilities:<br><br>Law of Polarity: Opposite end attracts.<br><br>Psychological: Mirror Law - relationship with others is in fact relationship with ourselves.<br><br>Learn to love yourself. Only then you will attract people who will care and treasure you.<br><br>Cheers    </div></blockquote>Er.. Uncountable.. those i know and those i dunno.. think you can named out a whole lot of them!<br><br>People who always claim to die, commit sucide and blah blah.. You will still see them living in this world.. They will never dare to do it.. is jus saying.. They jus out to get sympathy and attention back.<br><br>Since now the truth is out, we know wat actually junk has done WRONG to evelyn.. which he din mention in his previous post.. Finally evelyn couldn't take it.. and expose all your wrong doings.. Do you feel remorse? Ashamed? Like wat many ppl has said.. you never learn anything from this relationship.. you didn't take immediate step to amend it.. 5 years of r/s.. she given you so many chances.. yet you dun cherish.. who on earth can TAHAN you for so long!! Now you lost her.. but still you wont repent your ways.. what's the point of having her back.. To let you beat her up again.. will you love her more and care for her more??<br><br>She made a choice and that is to chose to leave you.. She wants you to realise what's with you.. and what's wrong.. But nevertheless... she tried but you didn't.. even till now she's still helping you to get thru this sh|t.. She dun blame you.. she forgive.. why cant you be so magnamious as her... Yes, both are hurt.. but one is pyhsically and mentally.. the other is emotionally..<br><br>Well, after som many posts from ppl.. no matter how much we say you jus listen.. what need to be done is your action!!! Everyone make mistakes.. there's no perfection in this world.. if everything is so perfect, and goes your will.. wouldn't this world be so boring.. Learn and start afresh.. Maybe you guys still can friends..<br><br>Learn to let her go.. Learn to take care of yourself first before taking care of anyone.. Learn to forgive and forget.. Learn to TRUST your loved ones.. Give you and yourself more confidence and sercurity..<br><br>Cheers   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
