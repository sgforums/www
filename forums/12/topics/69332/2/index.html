Trying to talk me out... Haha. Alamak....i'm ok!<br>I'm just posting my tot, about the people's perception on V-day,... not against it V day itself.<br><br>About the rebuke statement. Which didn't happen. I made sure that we have a common ground expectation from one another so that V-day won't be a day that we give points to one another when they do things right. Your are right with the effort comments.<br><br>__<br>I went for a morning jog with her and suppose to go fishing after that. Very unromantic hor. Haha!<br><br>My findings for this year was.<br>The trend wasn't bouquet of roses (very few couples were seen holding a bouquet of flower! Surprise man!)<br>Just for information sake.<br>(i bought Lilies for her. And spent 36 sleepless hours to fine-tune a PP Presentation for her.)<br><br>Anyway, she wanted the present and presentation but not the Lilies...she said too paiseh to bring home. She told me that i was supposed to bring it to her house. (I suppose it a girl's thing - you can never fully satisfy a girl)<br><br>V-Day was just like other days. Presents and Effort made the difference!<br><br></div>
