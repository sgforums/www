            <div class='col-md body'>origin of valentine's day (source: www.yahoo.com)<br><br>The Catholic Church recognizes three different saints named Valentine who were martyred on February 14, and all date from very early in the church's history. One was a priest in Rome, another was the bishop of Interamna (modern-day Terni in Italy), and the third died in Africa. Some suggest the first two are the same person. The holiday was inspired by the bishop of Interamna or a combination of the bishop and the priest of Rome.<br><br>Many kind, sometimes miraculous acts are attributed to St. Valentine. One of the most popular legends concerns marriage. The reigning Roman emperor, Claudius, was recruiting soldiers to go to war, but many men didn't wish to leave their wives or girlfriends, so the emperor outlawed new marriages. Valentine defied him by secretly marrying couples, which earned Valentine a prison sentence and, ultimately, death. Another tale (sometimes mixed in with the first one) recounts Valentine's stay in prison, during which he cured the jailer's daughter of blindness. He fell in love with the woman and sent her a final letter signed "from your Valentine." This is why lovers call each other their "valentine."<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmmz... farmer's in this thread now.. haha<br><br>k... v-day.. i'm not pro v-day.. neither am i anti v-day. i think it was quite sexist of u to say that the ladies apply the pressure on men. i think its a two way thing and i'm not sayin its wrong. u guys might think i'm anti vday cause of my thread "Vday? Crap or the real deal" but my case is that v-day is a day to celebrate LOVE. not just romance.<br><br>i hope u all can distinguish the difference. in addition, i think u shouldn't have rebuked your gf so strongly about vday. i mean its a day of importance to her. though it isn't to u, u should atleast respect that and not try to change her views. the least u could do is change your perspective that vday is just any other day.. and that u coincidentally decided to do something extra on that day. whats wrong with going that extra mile eh? haha.. and as gendy and RP are doing on this vday, its something simple nothing super extravagant. yet it generates that warmth and affection that connects two souls in mysterious ways...<br><br>well.. i hope u and your gf have a wonderful vday in your own special way.. cheers!!</div>
