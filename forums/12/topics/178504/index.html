After that I've been tinking alot of us having sex. I know it's bad. But whenever I tink of us making love, I just couldn't help masturbating to ease the erection. Even when I'm working, I can imagine us making out n I began to erect n really really feel like masturbing in the toilet. Luckily I'm still able to control not to do it when working.<br><br>I tried not to tink too much by going gym, jogging outing with friends, but whenever I back in my room I just tink abt us making love n I began to rub myself again. I've refrained myself from having sex with her again cause I dun wanna her to feel that I'm using her as a sex tool. But if I dont do it, I gonna explode too....Arrghh I'm really at a lost now.
