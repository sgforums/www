              <p>Hmm...I think you should have asked her about it between the giggles and laughs when you were hanging out with her. She could be going through something really bad on that day when she rejected your call (I didn't read the previous thread, or at least I don't remember doing so). She's probably as elated as you to be able to regain this friendship despite a misunderstanding, so don't worry too much about it, yea? Ask her out for a quick lunch after a week from now - if she accepts your invitation, you'll know everything is ok.</p>

              <p><br>No doubt you have your own reasons why you should stay away from her in the past, but ask yourself this question.</p>
              <p>Do you have any reasons to stay away from her in the present? If not, why not give both of you a chance to become friends again?</p>
              <p>Do you want to welcome her again as your friend?</p>
              <p>Don't call her if you know she doesn't like to pick up your calls and also remind yourself not to put her as a priority until she have earned it by calling you and picking up your calls.</p>

              <p>Yea... its common lah.... then after that everything becomes normal again... then after sometime it becomes complicated again.... makes u very confuse and you dunno whether ur fren is being serious or not.... can see u treasure friendship alot... i am also like this... but experience tells me to "mai chup ane zuey". Because at the end of the day u r the one feeling down. I had enuf of friendship like this. I think you shouldn't keep on call and call when she doesn't wanna pick up the call. Because this will give her a impression u care abt how she react very much... u may think ppl like this dun exist but there are... they just like playing mind games wif u and make everything so hard to understand... in that case, just dun care her, mai chup, u will meet better people or normal people who dun make simple thing like friendship so drama.</p>

              <p><br>Nothing was really lost in the past and there's nothing for you to lose even if you choose to befriend her again.</p>
              <p>Accept what had happened in the past and forgive her because things could turned out to be worse with other friends. Not picking up your calls could be because she wasn't ready or in the correct mood to communicate at that point in time and she could be facing a personal struggle which she was uncomfortable to share or be reminded.</p>
              <p>Surely it is safe for you to befriend her again if you also felt no ill intentions from her, and use what had happened in the past to understand deeper about her.</p>
              <p>I believe even bad friends also have their own cute nature. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> </p>
