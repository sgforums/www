              <p>Hi to all.</p>
              <p>I really never expected so many ppl can console me. I thank alot
              for all your information and time.Thank a million.</p>
              <p>However, my case is abit more complicated then normal case.</p>
              <p>I think i shouldn't be shy if i want some help.</p>
              <p>Ok, i know this guy at the age of 14. At tat time i think he the
              man i want coz he is so much older then me. And after a few mth of
              meeting up with him we became an item. He will always ask me to
              stay over nite at his place coz he wan to spend more time with me.
              As a result, i skip sch, and run away from home. my parent is dame
              upset with me. But wat do i know at tat time. He has a sweet mouth,
              always came up with alot of sweet words making me can't turn him
              down.</p>
              <p>At tat time, my dad is so worry of my safety. Everyday he will
              go around looking for me. He even bring my photo to geylang to ask
              all the passes-by just to find me. Isn't he is a great father? But
              i'm so "in love" tat i can't see tat. I blame him instead.</p>
              <p>Our relationship turn sour after a few mth together. He will hit
              me if things not done properly. He will beat me when he has no
              money. He will use his fist, and leg to kick me. When i told him i
              want a break up he told me to pay up all the expenses he have spend
              on me and he want to see the cash immediately no delay. Then i
              start to steal and cheat from friend and relative just to give him
              the money so he won't hit me.</p>
              <p>Soon, he is out of job, and slowly i found out that he lies alot
              to me. He lie that his dad was a business man, his age, his highest
              qualification, and claim he stay in a appartment. I do not dare to
              confront him coz i scared he will hit me. But i still stay with
              him. He even scold my dad and want to hit my dad. Suddenly, i was
              send to the girls home for BPC. after 1 mth, i was release from
              girls home. I was forbid to see him. But i still break all those
              rules and be with him. because i was under probation. i must go
              home everyday after sch. and he use this as an excuses tat i'm nt
              spending enough time with him to have another woman outside(not 1
              but 3 woman).After i found out he told me to give him time to
              settle but it an empty promise. I change my hp num and we lose
              contact. But he still came to my sch to look for my friend for my
              num. Then everything start all over again.</p>
              <p>Until i found out i was pregnant, the hitting stop but not the
              scolding and blaming. My dad even disown me. But i told myself if i
              can have a good family, i believe my dad will understand. so i try
              my best to give in to him. We have to stay with his parent coz we
              do not have a marry cert to apply for house. As soon as my baby was
              born, (2nd day) during the nite my baby cry non stop. he blame me
              for all her crying making him can't sleep properly thur the
              nite.And this continued even until now.</p>
              <p><br> I found out i was pregnant again. i do not dare to give birth to
              the 2nd one coz i don wan another innocent life to surffer like how
              my gal is surffering now. So i go for a abortion. the next
              day after the abortion he start to hit me already.He hit
              me with baseball bat, TV remote and guitar. so tat when i call the
              police and he was charged and sent to imprisonment for 4mth.</p>
              <p>After he came out he still hit me. but not those hard one. So it
              don't leave a mark. But now he don't hit me because i told him if
              he hit me i will still call the police again. Now wat he dare to do
              is scold my mother, and my family. in a sense, verbally abuse. He
              said 1 day if he cannot take it he will kill me with a knife then
              my family.</p>
              <p>I really have to act strong infront of him so he won't take
              advantage of me. I have to hid from him and go to those family svc
              for help.Now i have so many question:</p>
              <p>1st: how am i suppose to divorce if i'm not even married?<br> 2nd: Because he is a malay and my daughter has a malay name, he
              told me i can never win the case cause in the future my daughter
              need him to consent on her marriage.<br> 3rd: I'm not yet 21 how am i suppose to fight for my daughter?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Since you cannot divorce him, apply for a personal protection order. Under the women's charters there is something which will bar him from even approaching you or your child.</p>
              <p>There is no case to fight here, he is just being a jackass and trying to intimidate you. He has a criminal record for physical violence, and no job, so as long as you can get a job and your mum to look after your baby, there is no way he will win custody.</p>
              <p>There are always exceptions, even in the syariah court. In your situation, there is no need to worry as there is no need for his approval for your daughter to get married. Instead of thinking about your child's marriage, worry about your immediate situation.</p>
              <p>You are not 21 that is why you need to seek help from your mum. If she can look after your child for you, and is willing to be her legal guardian, you can keep the child with you.</p>
              <p>Here are the steps for you to take:</p>
              <p>1) Get a PPO</p>
              <p>2) Ask your mum for help</p>
              <p>3) Get a full time job unless you want to go back to study</p>
              <p>4) Seek LAB for help in getting a lawyer if he tries to fight for custody</p>

              <p>OK. So what are you waiting for ?</p>
              <p>You stay in this kind of abusive relationship, your daughter is going to grow up thinking it's ok for men to abuse a woman. Your daughter will end up JUST LIKE YOU.</p>
              <p>So , think about what you want for yourself and your daughter.</p>

              <p>You want a better life.. then go make a better life.</p>
              <p>When you pack your bags, you should have packed your baby girl along with you. Are you not confident enough to take care of her all by yourself ?</p>
              <p>Your boyfriend and his family has no rights to cut you off from your own child.</p>
              <p>YOU are the baby girl's MOTHER.</p>
              <p>Since you have been financially supporting your baby, make sure you DOCUMENT these. Keep copies of your cheques and transaction records.</p>
              <p>Go and visit your baby girl as often as you can. Take pictures when you are both spending time together.</p>
              <p>This will prove that you have never "abandoned" your child.</p>
              <p>Remember this, your boyfriend can chase you out of his family house, but he cannot deny your visits to see your own baby girl. </p>
              <p>Once you have settled in and is financially stable, go and bring your girl HOME. If your in laws complain about losing contact with their grandchild, assure them that they will be able to VISIT your baby girl as often as they want.</p>

              <p>Your boyfriend is a control freak.</p>
              <p>He wants to control you.</p>
              <p>What he is doing and has done in the past to you.. are typical behavior of a controlling and manipulative person.</p>
              <p>He probably realized his threats of "throwing you out" no longer works. That's why he is taking on a different stance.</p>
              <p>Don't mistake his sudden "goodwill" as his concern for you.</p>
              <p>He is just changing strategy. Taking a different approach, yet manipulative and controlling nonetheless.</p>
              <p>No man who cares about his partner will do what he had done to you.</p>

              <p>Hi Stress_Out,</p>
              <p>Since you have decided that you will prefer your daughter to be with him, you can start looking for a full-time job to support yourself. However, there is a very major concern here which you must think through carefully about and make your choice.</p>
              <p>If you are to "end this suffering", it means that you will stay away from him, and in turn your own child as well. When your child grows up, even if she does not like her father, it will be likely that she will not accept you as her mother as well.</p>
              <p>If you are to continue to visit your child frequently, you will have to see this guy, which will only result in more arguing, and possibly physical abuse from time to time. Thus, your suffering will not end.</p>
              <p>Please do think through carefully - It is not possible for you to have the best of both worlds in the current situation.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
