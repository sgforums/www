Period.<br><br>Nevertheless, you are a very giving person to help out your parent's debt.<br>Now with the same kind of perseverance, you can start saving for your studies or retirement funds.<br><br>Private studies are not cheap. And you will need to save for rainy days.<br>Full time studies is a luxury you cannot afford.<br><br>Right now, you have no job, means no contribution to CPF , medisave, and no safety net to fall back on.<br>All you have now is your 2k and more expenses.<br><br>With your N level, you should consider taking up some part-time certification, with it you can further yourself into diploma. Just make sure the cert you take allows you to go into a diploma or other higher level education.<br><br>What course you take.<br>First you need to figure out what your strong points are.<br>Are you good with numbers ?<br>Are you good with people ?<br>Are you a leadership material ?<br>Are you good in teaching others ?<br>Are you good in analysis ?<br>etc.<br><br>Then you look at what the courses has to offer and consider if you can survive the subjects.<br><br>Next thing you need to do... don't look back.<br><br></div>

However, its ur mentality that can pull u down. Sweetness comes after bitterness.

Banks in Singapore are not risk takers.<br>And it is never a good idea to pay those high flying bankers with your hard earned money. But if you must, you can try.<br><br>It is possible to finance your own studies. That way, you only owe it to yourself if you fail or succeed.<br>As  you aquire your papers, your market value will start going up.<br>The only limitations is time itself.<br><br>Please do more research on the courses you are considering.<br>What are the paths it will lead you to.<br>How far up are you willing to go ?<br><br>Do you have the brochures for the business cert ? Are you able to enroll in one with N level ? Some of those requires a minimum amount of working experiences.<br><br>LCCI secretarials cert, how far does it allows you to further your studies.<br>After you get this cert, what is the next level ?<br>Will you be able to enroll into higher learnings with this ?<br>Are you an organized person ?<br><br>I think you can avoid private O and head straight into a skill/knowledge based certification with diploma/degree down the road. But please confirm this on your end.<br><br>Else, you should also consider picking up a vocational skill.<br>A skill that will generate income for the rest of your life.<br><br>At your age, the options are plenty. Consolidate ALL your options first before you take the plunge, because it is very painful to have to give up half way to start something new again.<br><br>Your life is like a blank piece of paper, you are the artist.<br><br>The best thing about having nothing now, is that you have nothing to lose.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Broke_Sista84, i know how you are feeling <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Can i give you a suggestion Why don't you become a nurse like my elder sister both of you are the same age <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">. My sister sign up for a bond with NUH two years ago before going into ITE to do her nursing course. NUH paid all her school fees and everything and gave her a monthly salary of $600 also (which will increase over time) i know its nothing compared to the 1.5K admin job but now that she's a full time nurse she earns quite the same. She is going to poly this year to become a staff nurse and NUH is still going to sponsor her. After that she plannig to do her degree in nursing.<br><br>You also don't study all time in the nursing course every six months you go out to work and once your studies are over the hospital that gave you the bond will take you under their wings<br><br>I know not everyone can become a nurse but is there a more fulling job then that. Everytime you see a person recover under your care especially really old people you just feel a kind of very happy feeling. Everytime my sis comes home from work she tells us stories of the different patients she worked with that day and its quite fasinating to hear. And furthermore i see you got a real kind heart<br><br></div>
