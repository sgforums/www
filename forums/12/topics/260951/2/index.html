Find ways to make it interesting; try to think of what your gf likes most and try to drive the topic to be associated with that thing she like for example.

Becareful when you sent gifts or flowers, dun overdo it or else she will pampered.<br><br>Another trick,<br>- Tok abt your school life and your projects.<br>- Tok about your future. (women prefer man with vision)<br>- Give her creative and cute name (women like being called differently)<br>- Bring her to beach, said some witty and romance jokes<br>- Read more newspaper, can discuss matters with her.<br>- Understand her more, by asking alot of open ended questions. keeps her thinking.<br><br>there are alot of things tat you guys can talk about.
