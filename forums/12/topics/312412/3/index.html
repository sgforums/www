              <p><br> No worries, like u said u guys are always out together, a good
              friend wont mind if u break your promise sometimes specially if its
              only outing and if you wanted to be with your bf. u guys can
              go out together some other time. I dont think its too soon anyway,
              u didnt know your bf suddenly free on Sat, dont blame yourself.
              Chill out of this misery and enjoy very much with your boy. Your
              action here already proved you still priotise ur bf. U already made
              the decision today instead of waiting for Friday nite. I somehow
              sense you're a good gf. </p>
              <p>Perhaps u can let your bf know that u cancel the outing to be
              with him. Hey, he should know this and you're not lying right?
              :)</p>
              <p>I personally will feel touched if my gf said she cancel outing
              just to be with me. Well, who wouldnt.</p>

              <p>I dun dare to say I'm a good gf. I always talk to him about my circle of friends and he knows their names, just that he never met them face to face only. I mean, what's there to hide about their names right? Sometimes I would tell him about the fun stuffs that happen etc.</p>
              <p>Yesterday night I haven't decided on who to go out with, but today I'll tell my bf about this.</p>

              <p>Thats very good already. Hope u both stay together forever. Like i said , you're a good gf.. Not many gals tell their bf bout their frens cycle and not to mention their names. Now i can see why your bf trusted you and giving u freedom to go out with guy alone even hes jealous. Your bf is very lucky to have you seriously.</p>

              <p>Ask the other guy to bring his gf along, then you can bring your bf as well</p>
              <p>It's easier for guys to trust if that guy already has a steady relationship with another girl.</p>
              <p>I am friends with a guy and a girl for quite some time.</p>
              <p>Afterwards they got tgt. I still meet up one on one with any of them, just that we'll be waiting tgt for the other person to come then we go group outing.</p>
              <p>He was alright when I had lunch with the girl alone cos we were going to attend a lecture all tgt.</p>
              <p>Most importantly is compromise, you can't one shot ignore anyone.</p>

              <p>I made it very clear that no one-to-one outing is allowed. So far both of us have managed to stick to it.</p>
              <p>And yea, sometimes it is not that we do not trust our partner, it is more like we do not trust the other party. Maybe for me, it is hard for me to find it in my heart to trust someone I am not really close with. But it is hard to put that across without the partner seeing it as you are not trusting him instead.</p>

              <p><br>i understand how u feel. IS like. U like her. And scared she will be injured by her "so-call-friend" or u will be jealous when she go out w guy alone. Cos i also feel this way everytime.</p>
              <p>But funny part is. my gf is the same as urs. She say she is okay if i go out with ger alone. But when i tell her al abt those, can sense the feeling is weird.</p>
              <p>From wat i think all we can do is just learn to trust them more. And must  ask them to be careful of those friend. That i think is the best solution?</p>
