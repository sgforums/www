              Now, ask yourself how come you have so many MALE friends wanting to hang out with ONLY YOU? With no one else in tow?
              
              I'm assuming they know you're attached, but as long as you're not married, some guys think of you as fair game, ready to snatch you from your bf. Heck, even married wives get 'snatched' away at times.
              
              Sometimes, it's not the gf's fault, but rather the lecherous guys posing as 'friends' to get closer, first emotionally then physically. With guys always on the prowl for any defenseless chick, how can any sane bf just let his gf hang out with just any other guy? And letting the two go together?
              
              The thing is, I believe your bf is right. He trusts you, being his gf, but not your friend. People are very deceptive, as evidenced in friends cheating one another. Just because you were told by your friend that it's "just an outing to meet up" does NOT mean your friend actually thinks of it so. Beware, he may have ulterior motives in mind.
              
              Also, pardon me, but why would you rather forgo a weekend date with your bf for another male friend? Shouldn't you as a gf be spending more time with your bf? While you must never 'kill' off your friendships for the sake of your bf, there should be a consensus between you two to spend more time together. After all, bf and gf should be close right? As they say, out of sight, out of mind, so spend more time together while you can.
              
              Well, if going out with that friend can't be helped, try talking to your partner. Let him know that you still love him very much, and SHOW him (not just planting sugarcanes on the lips, to quote a Malay proverb, i.e. lipservice). If you keep quiet to prevent misunderstandings, you better know that if he FINDS OUT (even if no hanky panky takes place), he will NOT like it. And there goes whatever little trust you may have left.
              
              Now, as for your platonic friend...you have said both are only free on Saturdays...so who is MORE IMPORTANT? Is your platonic friend close enough to warrant an outing between only you two? If you're only gonna meet that friend once in a blue moon, forget it. These people come and go anyway. Focus on those who matter more, your BF.

              <p>I made it very clear that no one-to-one outing is allowed. So far both of us have managed to stick to it.</p>
              <p>And yea, sometimes it is not that we do not trust our partner, it is more like we do not trust the other party. Maybe for me, it is hard for me to find it in my heart to trust someone I am not really close with. But it is hard to put that across without the partner seeing it as you are not trusting him instead.</p>

              <p>hm ok. since u promised your fren, then u can do something bout it.. if possible ask your bf together with bowling since u wanted to meet them both too. YOur bf wont worry much too as he can see what is the guy doing or the way the guy talks to u. Should u consider this option? If you think its ok, try talk to your bf too. If he dont wanna go, then i also duno wat to do.. But at least he would appreciate it very much cuz u at least invited him together. This action of yours alone already let him thinking that u never go out with the guy quietly. If im your bf, i would appreciate it very much and i can trust u more even if im not goin bowling with another guy. </p>
              <p>Whatever it is, Miss Tiny, i beg u just dont cheat on him even a small matter. If hes asking ur frens name or anything, just tell. There should be no secret from both of you.</p>

              <p>honestly, your guy just dont have confidence in himself and to you. any r/s deserves honesty and toleration.

              <p>By judging your actions, it seems u cant tolerate him anymore. Give him some chance then if he never change for good, then better dun waste time for you and him too.</p>

              <p><br>No worries, like u said u guys are always out together, a good friend wont mind if u break your promise sometimes specially if its only outing and if you wanted to be with your bf. u guys can go out together some other time. I dont think its too soon anyway, u didnt know your bf suddenly free on Sat, dont blame yourself. Chill out of this misery and enjoy very much with your boy. Your action here already proved you still priotise ur bf. U already made the decision today instead of waiting for Friday nite. I somehow sense you're a good gf. </p>
              <p>Perhaps u can let your bf know that u cancel the outing to be with him. Hey, he should know this and you're not lying right? :)</p>
              <p>I personally will feel touched if my gf said she cancel outing just to be with me. Well, who wouldnt.</p>
