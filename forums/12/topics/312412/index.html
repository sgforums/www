              <p>Does your bf/gf worry if you are going out with the opposite sex friend alone?</p>
              <p>I once went out with my male friend alone, it's really nothing between the both of us but my bf was kinda jealous after I told him that I'm out with a guy friend.</p>
              <p>He said he trusts me but not the guy, and I really wonder if he really trusts me or not.</p>
              <p>Now, there's another male platonic friend whom wanna meet me out to chill, but I'm thinking if I should tell my bf about this.</p>
              <p>Both are only free to meet on Saturday and I dunno how..</p>

              <p>i will never understand people who never asks the simplest of questions before they do anything.</p>
              <p>Rule #1: Put yourself in the other persons' shoes, think about how that person will think and feel. Treat your partner as how you would want him/her to treat you.</p>
              <p>Then again some people like to ask the obvious so they can hopefully get encouragement to do stupid things and get justification by telling themselves 'its alrite, everyone is doing it'. this is what i call the 'privates itchy' syndrome.</p>

              <p>guess its all about the girl bah.</p>
              <p>who says guy trust the gf but don't trust the other guy?</p>
              <p>i guess the bf trust the gf won't do anything BUT the bf doesn't trust that the guy WOULDN'T do anything to the gf.</p>
              <p>get it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>sometimes it really just takes the bf to know who the guy is that is all. all you need is to get your bf to trust that guy friend of yours. simple. afterwhich you can go out with tt guy without any worries!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>just a question. why a solo outting? wouldn't a group outting achieve the same results at the end of the day? fun and some catching up?</p>

              <p>yea. shouldnt be any problem if anyone goin out with opposite sex..</p>
              <p>but the best is to avoid it or dont do it frequently.</p>
              <p>my gf always have this guy calling her every weekend. but its just her ex-collegue and they talked to each other alot in office cuz others are more to malay and the chinese are not that close. till now he still call my gal, yea im a bit upset and pissed off, but i can trust my gal cuz she never hide from me when the guy called her.</p>
              <p> we all know when a guy date a gal outing alone, it might means something.. no guy wanna meet the gal alone for outing just for fun. Its obvious that the guy wanna get closer to u. If only one outing alone, that would be fine. but many times will be some doubts.</p>
              <p>Ms Tiny, u said u wouldnt mind now cuz he might not have do this kind of outing alone with gal. But when he really does this and hes telling you hes goin out wit a gal alone, then u will know how its really felt.</p>
              <p>Think bout this. Has he ever go out alone with any gal. even if the gal is his best fren? and think again, of course he can go out anytime with any gal alone, but why he never? cuz he might have think bout u and doesnt wanna get too close with other gal.</p>
              <p>and you? have u think bout his feeling? Trust is not an issue here. the problem is that u know your bf wont like it and u still doin it? How long u expect your boy can keep trusting you?</p>
              <p>One more thing, if a guy wann call u out to so-called chill, then be honest, tell your guy. and hopefully you're SMART enough to call other frens together to CHILL out not alone with him.</p>
              <p>Once u hide this from your guy, it means you're betraying his trust to u.</p>
              <p>And you clearly dont understand us guy, we guy always trust our gal, its just we never trust guy who approach our gal especially alone. It doesnt mean we never trust our gal at all. Not a single thought.</p>

              <p>Yes I understand it's natural to feel jealous and insecure, but does that mean I cannot hang out with my male friend anymore, just to spare a thought for his feelings?</p>
              <p>Yes me and that guy had common friends and we had group outings several times before, but recently the rest were busy and we were trying hard to meet up. The guy just wanna meet up with me for a chill. Does it mean it's perfectly abnormal to be hanging out with an opposite friend alone?</p>

              <p>Yes I understand it's natural to feel jealous and insecure, but does that mean I cannot hang out with my male friend anymore, just to spare a thought for his feelings?</p>
              <p>Yes me and that guy had common friends and we had group outings several times before, but recently the rest were busy and we were trying hard to meet up. The guy just wanna meet up with me for a chill. Does it mean it's perfectly abnormal to be hanging out with an opposite friend alone?</p>
              <p>If I can trust my bf, why can't he?</p>

              <p>Everyone needs friends. Never mean that u cant meet your fren just becuz of your boy, but if this is too frequent, your boy might suspect or doubt u. Again, trusting is not the issue, To  trust some1 is based on what is that some1's action.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your boy understand that.. if he dont, he wouldnt let u go out with any guy alone at all. and again, he trusted u but never trust the guys. its 2 different things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway, what kind of outing? just yamcha or other? Dont tell me your watching movie wit the guy fren alone.</p>

              <p>simplest way is to get both guys to meet each other and introduce him to your bf so there will be some common frens.</p>
              <p>than let ur bf decide if he allows u to meet him..</p>
