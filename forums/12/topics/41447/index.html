            <div class='col-md body'><br>today I was walking along the library then I saw this girl who was my former classmate then she said hi to me and asked me something but i couldnt hear her and so i went downstairs to talk to her and she told me she dunno where a spot in the sch is. So I took her there, while walking there we talked abit. She is the friendly sort and quite cheerful loh. Then before we parted we exchanged numbers(hp). I dont mean that i love/like her or something lah. Normally i see her i would give her a smile and wave hi but didnt talk much to her since she is always with someone else and I dont want to interrupt.but the smile is different from those when you see someone u know and give a smile that kind.<br>anyway she has this cheerful attitude that really infects.the smile seems be also at the heart.like my heart is also smiling.<br>then later i saw her at the library and she asked me whether i wanna accompany her to collect something but i didnt hear her so i stayed there to look after her stuff and she didnt even pack it up ( like dont care if my friend is with my stuff ). then she asked me if i was free to help her do something which i agreed, when i was supposed to do a chem tutorial as it was going to be discussed later on.<br>while waiting for the queues for the com to clear i sat near her.grabbed a chair and sat near her.she didnt mind when i was looking thru her notes. then took her hp and wanted to play games and she taught me how to play 1 when i got a prob with it.and didnt mind at all when i just took her hp.<br>last yr because we had a common module and once we had a test and i sat quite behind in the lecture theatre (LT) there was this seat beside me( the LT was not full at all ) normally no girls sit beside me,esp my class ppl. she had no qualms abt it.<br>ok lah i admit the part abt sitting beside me,looking at her hp,etc maybe i am thinking too much lah.or it's just that she is friendly to everyone but this is the type of girl i like. friendly,nice attitude,presentable,<br>something nice to note is that she replies to my sms not in monosyllables nor in just 1 word.at least that;s nice or friendly.<br>there is this nice feeling abt her loh.<br>i dunno whether to go after her,because i afraid she will stop being friendly to me or ignore me altogether when she rejects me. in short i afraid i will scare her.and i have no gf before this and even if i go after her i dont think i wanna treat it like a relationship like the way adults have. since we are 18 at the most. i find it;'s too young for it.<br>i dunno whether u call this<br>at the most i wanna be close or good friends with her only.<br>will try to ask her if she wanna come to some outings i have with my other friends to see how far to go w/o giving her the wrong idea.<br><br>i think now i wanna treat her as a friend first try to talk to her more often.then attempt to go on.<br><br>anyway i am abit to go try because i afraid later her friends ( her classmates that i know) make have something to say<br><br>welcome anyone to post a reply and esp from yunhaier. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

I dont mean that i love/like her or something lah. Normally i see her i would give her a smile and wave hi but didnt talk much to her since she is always with someone else and I dont want to interrupt.but the smile is different from those when you see someone u know and give a smile that kind.<br>anyway she has this cheerful attitude that really infects.the smile seems be also at the heart.like my heart is also smiling.<br>then later i saw her at the library and she asked me whether i wanna accompany her to collect something but i didnt hear her so i stayed there to look after her stuff and she didnt even pack it up ( like dont care if my friend is with my stuff ). then she asked me if i was free to help her do something which i agreed, when i was supposed to do a chem tutorial as it was going to be discussed later on.<br>while waiting for the queues for the com to clear i sat near her.grabbed a chair and sat near her.she didnt mind when i was looking thru her notes. then took her hp and wanted to play games and she taught me how to play 1 when i got a prob with it.and didnt mind at all when i just took her hp.<br>last yr because we had a common module and once we had a test and i sat quite behind in the lecture theatre (LT) there was this seat beside me( the LT was not full at all ) normally no girls sit beside me,esp my class ppl. she had no qualms abt it.<br>ok lah i admit the part abt sitting beside me,looking at her hp,etc maybe i am thinking too much lah.or it's just that she is friendly to everyone but this is the type of girl i like. friendly,nice attitude,presentable,<br>something nice to note is that she replies to my sms not in monosyllables nor in just 1 word.at least that;s nice or friendly.<br>there is this nice feeling abt her loh.<br>i dunno whether to go after her,because i afraid she will stop being friendly to me or ignore me altogether when she rejects me. in short i afraid i will scare her.and i have no gf before this and even if i go after her i dont think i wanna treat it like a relationship like the way adults have. since we are 18 at the most. i find it;'s too young for it.<br>i dunno whether u call this<br>at the most i wanna be close or good friends with her only.<br>will try to ask her if she wanna come to some outings i have with my other friends to see how far to go w/o giving her the wrong idea.<br><br>i think now i wanna treat her as a friend first try to talk to her more often.then attempt to go on.<br><br>anyway i am abit to go try because i afraid later her friends ( her classmates that i know) make have something to say<br><br>welcome anyone to post a reply and esp from yunhaier. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote>You are in SO good position.

When you gaze, is when your eyes start to speak on its own. Normally it begins when you look at a person in their eye for too long.<br><br>That's why I say, Don't speak with her like you wanna chase her. Speak with her as like a good friend - you have very good guy friends don't you? Act the same way to her like to them (Modify a little thats all you need)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Breakfast? Well, a good beginning. You could throw in excuses like nobody to eat breakfast with everyday, then always never eat damn hungry, etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Its not small progress - its steady progress. Take a steady upward <strong>continuous</strong> progess than a hasty rise and an equally quick fall. Don't worry about the rejecting part - just concentrate on what you should do and suppose to do. Well, if it happens, then you could pte msg me or post a new topic to seek suggestion from everyone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Never reveal what your intention of doing things indirectly or directly yet.
