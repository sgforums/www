            <div class='col-md body'>hi bismark,<br><br>i think all that is happening is just the process of knowing her.. be it her bad habits or her nice personalities.. but in the process, you have <strong>try</strong> to see past your nice feelings you feel for her.. don't let all the emotions blind you from seeing her real self.. then ask yourself if you can accept all these things..<br><br>it's good that you are level-headed till now.. so try to keep it this way.. also, no matter how patient anyone might be.. try to cool down on the sms and phone calls when you can't get her that easily.. like in the case when she was asleep.. sometimes, it can be a bother when she's really busy with other stuff..<br><br>lastly, don't do anything rash <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
