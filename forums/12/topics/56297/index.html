            <div class='col-md body'>hmm, from young, my sis was born 1/2 deaf, so my parents would always shower their attention on her, so usually i as the older sibling would feel very neglected. i would always quarrel with my sister, sorta as pay back for taking away my parents from me. it would be very bad, always quarreling, whacking each other. even simple stuff like TV we will always fight.<br><br>my parents would also put alot of pressure on me, always comparing me with other people, why i cannot do as well as other ppl, from young, i would always be distant from my family. always shutting myself from family life, leaving the house early in the day till late at night, once i reach home i would shut the door of my room till the next day.<br><br>when i first received Jesus and became a christian, family life grew worse, they didn't really understand, so there were even more quarrels, esp when i decided to be baptised. but it was when i became a christian, i learnt to forgive, not forgetting totally, but forgiving was a first step. i would pray for them to understand, and to know what joy i had found thru my faith. it was like finding a cave full of gold and i want to share it with my family. there was enough, certainly for everyone.<br><br>God works funny. my dad fell sick, his face was totally swollen, until now we dunno wat is the cause, he went to see the doctor and skin specialists who didn't know what was the problem so they just gave him skin ointments and stuff, but for over 3 months, the condition grew worse and worse.<br><br>one day, one of my dad friend, who is also a christian, we all call her aunty cindy. she was training to be a pastor in australia or was it her husband. i forgot, she came back to visit us. my dad was very concerned over my new faith in christ. so she came over to talk to me and share with me a few stuff. and to share with my family as well. then she asked if she could pray for my family. somehow while she was praying, we could, not just me, feel a presence in the room, there was a peace, unable to describe, and a burden lifted. my dad just broke down and cried and we all cried. and reconciled. aunty cindy then invited us, as a family to her church to take a look. so we went the following week.<br><br>at the end of the sermon, aunty cindy encouraged my dad to try prayer, since medication didnt work, after prayer, he said he saw hands of light, touching his face and he felt a heat on his face. then he woke up already lying down on the floor. for me. it was like 20 mins seeing my dad on the floor. and the great thing was, my dad condition got better, the sore and pus got lesser and lesser.<br><br>and over the week, he was totally back to his old self.<br><br>after 2 visits to the church, after the sermon my dad pulled my sleeve and said he wanted to be a christian and receive salvation as a family. so he went up there to be prayed for.<br><br>now my family is very close, of course there would be occational quarrel, but none would hv a lasting impact. my sis and i grew closer together, from hatred to indifference, and from indifference to small chats, now we would still chat and talk, small topics of course, but we could stand being in the same room together, and i believe God will still work through in me, and my family, to become closer together..<br><br>this is my story.. whats yours?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

He can do the same for everyone.. its just that no one wants Him to work in their lives, cuz they are afraid things will go wrong when it is out of their control.<br><br>i believe when you seek out the real God with all your heart, you will find Him. cause He will never abandon you, leave you, or forsake you. like i said. there is a cave of gold. some of us found it. and we want to share it with you.<br><br>for me, it wasn't simply just forgetting, or forgiving.. it was a change of how i look at life. yea i will hv problems, but there is always joy, peace, love, and strength to overcome.
