              <p>u sound like many "typical" girl. who gets into a rs just for the sake of it. Even if the 1st one hurt u along the way, isnt it the price for being in a rs in the 1st place? Like having pets, u don just dump us after u're bored, gal. . . <br><br>And in a rs, there can onli be 2 in it. . . not 3. no such thing as 3 of us. Grow up la.</p>

              <p>your story already told me you have decided to choose the second guy.</p>
              <p>Because you are not willing to work as hard as the first guy works for you. Instead of trying to see what the problem is and how to communicate with him better, you decided to feel tired instead and started to think whether the two of you are suitable not. You are doubting your relationship. You know that if anything happens you have the second guy to fall back.</p>
              <p>Why did you do such thing. Poor first guy. Didnt the second guy know you already had a bf when he made his move? If he already did knew about the first guy, then its his own problem, dont worry about him feeling hurt, because he already knew you had a boyfriend.</p>
              <p>Let me say this, if you go with the second guy, your bf would be devastated, but if stay with your bf, the second guy would not be that hurt because you already had a bf in the first place, and he can sort of expect this to happen when he made his move.</p>
              <p>Dont give up on a guy so easily. The new guy may not be the better guy. Guys are always sweet when courting you... understand?</p>

              <p>Grow up. If the 1st guy read this he would be disappointed with you.</p>
              <p>Basically all you want to say is that you are in a relationship but you have found a liking for some other guy. Now you want to be with him but you do not know how to break up with your boyfriend.</p>
              <p>Please do not come here to find support for your unfaithful ways. Do what you will.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In this case, they guy should be the one being protected. Now its becoming more common for girls to play around with a guy's feeling.  There are tons of information in the mass media about how to seduce a guy, how to play hard to get, how to make sure he is not cheating on you, how to emotionally blackmail him so as to gain the upper hand in the relationship and etc. Honestly, women are not as vulnerable as what some of you may claim anymore.</p>

              <p>i agree with MaNyZeR. I loss my ex-Gf to a guy whom made his move while our relationship was unstable. I was devasted. I gave her up. Since you are already thinking and choosing if you wanted to be with another guy, it is quite obvious that you are not worthy of your bf's love for you.</p>
              <p>Break up with him. He will evolve into a better person and will in turn find true love</p>

              <p>I have been trying hard in this relationship. used to be sweet and rosy, but things changed as with all relationships. Some are able to keep up, some are not. We are still trying to.</p>
              <p>I know the two guys are separate entities and i shouldn't lump them as one thing to talk about. But how many are clear-minded enough when caught in something like that? The reason I am in AA is because I am not.  Thankfully, some comments are there to help me out on that. It cleared my mind a little.</p>

              <p>I guess as long as you are not married yet, you still can make choices. It's only once you take that sacred vow, come hell or highwater, you and your partner MUST NEVER give up easily on each other.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So dont unnecessarily make any committments that will ultimately hurt others,  just because you are lonely, possesive or on impulse. True love takes serious committment to keep the flame burning eternally. Love cannot be baised on 'kiasuism' that we grew up with as Singaporeans. We've always been taught to stand on 2 boats to be safe, better than to be sorry. But the problem is, once the boats take off, you can no longer stand on both, but only 1 or you will only fall into the deep waters.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No 2 humans think ever think alike. We are not mirror image of one another. Thus, we really have to communicate with one another on things we want, and not by hints that can be easily misunderstoo. Love needs honest comunication. Without it, we might as well as become strangers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>True love sets you free, not for just one faked moment, but eternally, if you find and treasure that quality in your flawed partner which all flawed humans will at least have one or a few, which appeals to you that can last a lifetime thru good and bad times - good nature, kind, generous, etc, etc - characteristics that goes beyond pure changeable materialism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Make friends, take your time. True love is more than just having sex, being possesive, buying that HDB flat quickly or even having children. But do understand there is no perfection in this world. There will NEVER be the perfect guy, but i am sure you can settle down with a good guy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>No one can predict the future. However, the future can be determined and projected, and it is by both's confidence and faith in each flawed human partner to face the constant of change courageously together.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>May you make the right choice. In the event you don't, don't blame yourself if you had truly tried your best to make things work out. As long as you had tried your best and fell, and not because of some petty excuses, just stand bravely up and continue on, just as million others had done before you. </p>

              <p>I know where you guys are coming from, but some of you doesn't
              know the same about me. But i appreciate all these comments.</p>
              <p>I have been trying hard in this relationship. used to be
              sweet and rosy, but things changed as with all relationships. Some
              are able to keep up, some are not. We are still trying to.</p>
              <p>I know the two guys are separate entities and i shouldn't lump
              them as one thing to talk about. But how many are
              clear-minded enough when caught in something like that? The
              reason I am in AA is because I am not.  Thankfully, some
              comments are there to help me out on that. It cleared my mind
              a little.</p>

              <p>That's why the first step is to distant yourself from BOTH then you can evaluate what YOU want and understand yourself and what you want. The problem now doesn't lie in whether one guy is better than the other, or whether you get along with one guy better or not - but rather what sort of rship you want for yourself.</p>
              <p>Who knows - it might end up that NEITHER suits you and without either, you can even be happier? If you complicate matters, in the end everyone suffers because you can't make up your mind. As far as I see it, being fair means to not 'exchange' one for another because you can't compare them. Being fair is to understand yourself enough to not regret whatever decision you make - for better or worse.</p>

              <p>anyw, i think it is up to u to decide. Like ur future to consider. do u see urself in gd hands with 1st guy ? is he going to last up to marriage ? Is he financially capable ? does he suit u at all with all e quarrels n stuffs?Who will treat u better in long run ?</p>
              <p>To be fair, i would say both guys loves u , but it is e approach n method of showing care n concern.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">One is
              a long term bf who can be both sweet and bad tempered.
              Communication is always a problem because it almost always ends up
              in a quarrel whenever we talk about issues. We still don't know how
              to talk to each other. yet. It is nobody's fault. Just different
              personalities. Apart from that, there are many issues between
              us still unsolved. But he is always working so hard, i know he is
              genuinely trying to make it work. The thing is, sometimes I am
              tired and can't help but wonder if we are simply
              unsuitable?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">The other is
              a guy who made his move recently. Only then i know
              he has been waiting all these while and what
              he has gone through for me.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial; color: black;">No matter who i

              <p>There is no such thing as the right thing for all three of you.</p>
              <p>There is only such thing as doing what is best for yourself.</p>
              <p>Obviously, your current relationship is unsustainable for the long term. Your boyfriend will not change as long as you continue to be there.</p>
              <p>You are having doubts because you are not sure if your current boyfriend is THE guy of your life.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, the only way to know is to take a calculated risk and try out other relationship with other men.</p>
              <p>There are sacrifices in life you must make.</p>
              <p>Let there be no regrets for whatever decision you take.</p>
