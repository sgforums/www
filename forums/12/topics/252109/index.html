Most of my teachers in secondary school were more than happy to arrange remedial classes or provide one on one assistance to the weaker students.<br><br>Post secondary, if I recall, most of my friends did not have tuition either and many of them went on to do very well. If you pay attention in class and work hard, tuition really is unnecessary in Singapore's education system where the curriculum is so well structured and laid out.<br><br>EDIT: Do not blame society for any of your failings as a student. Once you start looking for any excuse as to why you should not be doing well (especially using social differences), you'll pretty much start finding excuses for everything else ... and from there you'll lead on to blaming the government, and this and that ... DON'T.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no such thing la.. see ah.. the rich ppl can afford all the fringe benefits that makes studying easier ( assignment books.. private tutor etc ) but that also means that the student might hence become lazy and over confident. also can end up screwing up in the studies mah.. then also the poor people.. are they going to roll over and die just because they cant afford tuition? also no.. they would become more hardworking as a result and hence do better. actually the family financial status doesnt really matter.. unless you're talking about the people who are too poor to even afford to buy the basic of the basics.. ah then he has a problem. but theres no such thing as that in singapore because such a person would be eligible for financial help. in fact i think being poor would be better for most people.. because there are some people who is in comfortable situation would not be as motivated to study hard than when they are in a difficult situation. Being rich has got nothing to do with academic success.. only 70% hardwork and 30% intelligience</div>

We all know you have pressures etc.<br><br>Hey, the less rich ones have problems too, you know. Which is the lesser of 2 evils, you tell me??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>And what would those pressures be?<br><br>Rich kids always get compared to their successful parents, living in their shadows.<br><br>People who have not experienced the tiresome routine of moving from school, to cca, to tuition and then to misc. private cocurricular activities such as piano/ballet/art have no say. It's so easy to be a bystander and go ... wow gee, so lucky to have all that, i can do that too!<br><br>Let's see you stay on top of your game, by achieving leadership positions in your CCA, earning grade 8/diploma in piano etc etc. all the while being at the top few percent of your academic level ... in addition to that, having to listen to the derogatory remarks/comments of strangers who have not achieved equal level of success.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Don't forget, the higher you go, the more that is expected of you.<br><br>People won't look at a chicken rice seller's son and expect him to rise to any level of greatness, but if he does, praises are heaped upon the fellow (and rightly so).<br><br>But people will look at a doctor's son, and expect him to reach a similar level of success, if not surpass his father, or else the poor boy will have to deal with being looked upon as falling into the stereotypical perception of a rich kid.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My comments are not to be viewed narrowly as being elitist. I'm not a rich kid (and never have been).<br><br>I do acknowledge that "poor kids" have their equal share of problems; I'm merely stating the case fairly, because people always seem to award a house advantage (unnecessarily) to those from less well to do backgrounds.<br><br>As has been said, I don't think "rich kids" have it any easier than "poor kids", and likewise "poor kids" definitely don't have it any harder than "rich kids".<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There are pros and cons to both sides.<br><br>Those not so well to do may have to struggle with daily expenses, while the rich ones have to carry unecessary burdens or expectations. From personal experience, being born in a rich family does not necessarily mean a better life. For example, one will live a highly protected lifestyle with little chance of making 'real' friends or perhaps gaining life experiences.<br><br>Wherever you go, you would be under scrutiny from the public. Especially if you have generations of family reputation to protect and uphold. Parents may have the thinking "Here are the resources for you to study, all you need to study and nothing else" and expects you to surpass them.<br><br>Did one ask to be born in such circumstances? Why cant I go out with friends of 'different class', browse shopping malls together, enjoy a plate of hawker char kway teow alfresco style? Or perhaps get a part time job at McDonalds? I may not earn much but at least I can have a sense of fulfillment and knowing the value of the money I earn.<br><br>This life is suffocating. Until now, I do not know what happiness is. In my mind, happiness is to be free from all this, social constraints and all that. But when that time comes, all I can do is make the most of what I have.</div>
