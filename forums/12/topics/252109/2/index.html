I ask that because you seem to make the assumption that they would rather let their offspring squander away their hard earned fortunes than put it to better use.<br><br>A Singaporean education is very very very very subsidized. I remember being given an option to do a third language back during my high school days for minimal cost. Further, the government hands out those edusave? edugrant? good student? awards very freely ... In fact ... I think my parents gave me more allowance than they spent on my education  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  and my allowance wasn't an obscene amount above the norm; it was in line with what my peers received.<br><br>Of course at the tertiary level it's different; university is considered the final lap and naturally, you pay to receive the specialised and advanced knowledge that the lecturers/tutors have.<br><br>FYI, don't give me that crap about "dui de qi" your parents - that one applies whether you are rich or poor and that has nothing to do with money, but rather the basic morality (filial piety).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it is sad but it is true. i have studied in both 'top' and 'neighbourhood' schools and i have seen the trend 1st hand. the rich are able to send their children to better tuition classes and schools and etc so the chances of their child doing better is higher, although not all the time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Rich ppl kids can get the "outside" help to make them do better.<br>- Get in to best schools instead of "laoya" neighbourhood school, then they have better envoirnment to study.<br>- Can hire good tutor to help them in their studies.<br>- Most rich parents push their kids harder on studies.<br>- No need to work part-time for extra pocket money.<br><br>For kids from poor family, they have something "inside".<br>- Want to study hard and help to improve family situation. They work really hard by themselves.</div>

I wouldnt say top school la. Is 243 PSLE entry good? Anyway among my friends they all stay condo, bunglow, terrace etc. Of course there are those stay in HDB too. I always find myself the poorest among them. No money to play pool, bowling. Sometimes wan pay school fees oso cannt. On top of that I have to study hard bcos de pricipal know me on first name basis.<br><br>Of course maybe your definition of poor is more extreme than mine but when you are surrounded by rich people, you cant help thinking you are poor.</div>
