Even my present gf who is a diploma holder, her dad who is a lazybone, spendthrift, doesnt contribute to family will ask whether i can support her or not. Her father only work for himself, sometimes worse, will get money from my gf or the mother who earns only hundreds a month.<br><br>Ironically, i had abit indirectly contribute to her family, I pay for some of her bills. SOmetimes i give her money, and she give it to her family when they keep asking for $.<br><br>He will talk about the standard of living in Singapore, in future what will i do if i leave my present relatively well paid job (consider a diploma). I was questioned when i ask to apply for flat together with her. Nevertheless we still applied secretly before he approve of it.<br><br>Even my ex gf parents would only approve her of getting a diploma holder or higher bf, sounds like criteria of a job right?<br><br>Dun give up if you really love her.

Frankly there will always be small minded people no matter where you go in life. Some people dont want to be associated with fat people, or bald or of a different race or religious group. The small minded think small and as such will only value things that are of little value. Thankfully that small mindedness hasnt rubbed off on her daughter. However be wary, it is my experience that a person brought up in a family that has such attitudes will have other prejudies. Find out if your girlfriend has prejudices - is she a racist, or a sexist, or prefers white men over asians or the other way around. If she has then sadly, your education qualification (or lack of) may well become an issue when the 2 of you have an argument.</div>

Anyways leh, maybe it's a chinese thing - man must prove his worth to support girl - only way to support her is get a good education then get a good job- then he is worthy. My grandparents always say :"there are gold in books " meaning it is worthwhile to study hard and get a good job. Very much like ancient times (the scholar system) whereby poor scholars take exams to be an officer of the court. Then people are happy to offer their daughters in marriage</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey to all again<br><br>i wish my article can be published and i hope that my experience will bring light to those who are in the same plight as me ..... i was supposed to meet my gf yesterday at 3 but her mum trailed her from her home and kept leeching on my gf. my gf had some appointment with her friends later on in the night and she thought her mum will leave her towards the evening for my gf appointment .... i then went on to join my gf during her appointment ... to my suprise i saw the mum lingering around the vicinity so i thought that i had to avoid her so as not to create any scene ..... 30 min later, i walked around the vicinity and did not detect her presence but 2 hours later she showed up and she saw my gf with me, she then swooped down like a hawk and took my gf away from me and her friends, i pursued towards them and i was trailing behind .. the mum simply bo chup and kept telling my gf not to bother, i asked the mum is this the kind of future she wans for the gf, (as in she always restricts the gf from doing things and going out), the mum says yes, she will have control over my gf ... after hearing this i felt so against the mum .. i could not do anything! then they flagged a cab down, they got in and my gf asked me whether i wanna get in too, the mum said if i got in, she will send me to the police .... my gf was embarassed by her mum in front of her friends and in public too ...... as for me i feel that be it whether i am around or not, i feel a need to help my gf to break out from this chain. my gf was also weeping throughout the ordeal<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i m sort of in the same boat as u. but not really the same.<br>I m happily engaged to my fiance last yr thru 3yrs of courtship. However, our problem usually lies with his mum. She simply loathes me, is wat i cud say.<br><br>In the beginning of our r/s, his mum is so nice towards me.....until she found out tat i m merely a diploma holder....... she tends to compare his cousin's gf with me whom had juz got her degree. and even says tat she's very nice and polite; which I always felt unfair.<br><br>my problem is whenever i greeted her(eg. good morning, or addressing her when we are having meals....etc), she nv even reply once in these 3yrs+. whenever my fiance is not around, she will grab the chance to nag at me, grumble and gives  me a tongue lashing.<br><br>once she had a heated argumentl with my fiance, cuz he's trying to clear our room. She had no idea wat we were doing then and thought we were messing up the house...blah blah blah. In the end, when he went for his shower, I stayed in the room and dun dare to walk out(fearing tat she has something to scold me again). However, i still couldn't run away from it. She didn't even knock the door and barged in.<br><br>She accused me tat it's always because of me tat makes them quarrel, i was dumbfounded and of cuz i kept quiet like i always do.<br><br>In the house, there's lots of restrictions like i cannot keep my shoes in the shoes cabinet coz its full; and better dumped all those shoes at the corridor cuz it's so messy. It's as if the shoes at the corridor all belongs to me. omg..and there's lots more of coz. and we seldom talk.<br><br>I mean these are things u have to overcome in life. Yes, u may be feeling  upset about ur gf's mum, u felt heartache when she bombarded and dropped bombs on ur gf all these while. Juz ask urself, is she the one u are searching for, for life?<br><br>No matter what, my only advice is that if you really loves your gf, u should be thick-skinned, swallow your pride, go to her house more often and communicate more with her parents. Die die oso must win her mum's trust.<br><br>Your problem lies with the lack of communication and mutual trust with her parents. As we can see from all your postings, her parents are the conservative sort; just like every other parents(it's a natural instinct to protect your own child, but of coz the mum is overboard).<br><br>Instead of creating more conflicts by hurling hurtful remarks, you have to make her parents feel secured that their daughter has choosen someone who deemed to be a good partner for the rest of her life. Don't feel inferior about your qualifications and hold back yourself.<br><br>This type of future mother in law is definitely a challenging one. Your gf has been courageous all along, and if she doesn't love and care enough for this r/s, i don't think she will be able to tolerate her mum's nonsense and nasty remarks.<br><br>In fact she's the one sandwiched in between. Moreover, you can't ask her to make a choice between you or her mum rite? Her mum is definitely a hassle in ur r/s but she's someone whom u cannot avoid. You have to pass your own round b4 u are able to pass the torments of obstacles she has created ahead for you and ur love one.<br><br>Buy her family a hamper since Chinese New Year is approaching.<br><br>Be generous and accomodating.<br><br>Even thou deep inside you know something bad may happen, but again.. you will nv know; something good or bad will come out from it. You have to show your sincerity.<br><br>Be daring, You can seek her approval to invite your gf over your house for a dinner when CNY is drawing near.<br><br>Pay her family a visit on CNY, at least show her that you respected her  no matter how she treats you. I doubt during CNY she will chased you away with a broom.... for such a conservative woman it's definitely not auspicious.<br><br>Then after that you can seek for her approval again to bring your gf to your house to pay a visit to your parents mah. Slowly her mum will feel your sincerely and accept you.<br><br>Sweet talks and Tiny thoughts count alot.<br>Like praising her diamond ring is so glittering and beautiful if she's wearing one.<br>Her new hairstyle looks so stunning and young if she had juz trim or perm her hair.<br>She slims down abit if she's plump.<br>Her complexion is so smooth unlike your mum( juz makes her feels flattered even thou it may be a white lie)<br><br>She might say tat u r bullshitting and trying to get into her good books, but naturally she will feel flattered inside and change her prejudices against you. Such things take time...... take care and all the best. Hope I can be of help.</div>
