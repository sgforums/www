I would suggest u do sth abt it fast. One's patient has its limits. I think u can do things to help ur gf as in be there for her always.

            <div class='col-md body'>actually it does not matter what academics. It's your ability to bring home the bacon not in your early marriage but continously in to your old age.<br><br>I guess every parent won't actually want to look down, they are rightly worried for their daughters marrying someone who is sensible and can provide security. If you look from their point of view: The parent is not dating you so they can't really observe you closeup. Also because being a young man unless you are in sales or already running your own show there is very little details available to know if you are someone capable to provide for the well being of another other than yourself since you are still unproven hence the only thing they can use is academic as a benchmark.<br><br>In the end I think the most important trait in a guy that a woman should observe while dating is his ability or savvyness in managing his money given his current paying ability regardless of academic because he could be very well educated but fond of gambling or excessive entertainment which can be a problem and strain later on. If he is able to manage and save even on what little he earns currently normally these are seeds to a bright future don't you think thats very good.</div>
