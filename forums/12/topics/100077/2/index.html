            <div class='col-md body'>you have to understand that every parent have different ways of expressing their concern for their child.<br><br>most parents express their love and concern by being nice and fair to their child. some believe that by totally controlling their child, it's the best way to protect and care for them. others express their concern by scolding and punishing them into submission.<br><br>you must have heard before the chinese phrase, 'to hit is to love, to scold is to adore'? (not very sure about the exact phrase...sorry)<br><br>in this case, her mother thinks it's best for her daughter if she has total control over her life. this way, she can prevent any kind of harm from coming to her daughter. her mother might have been through alot of emotional pains during her early years, and now she's determined not to let it happen to her daughter.<br><br>there are two ways for you to handle this matter:<br><br>1) choose to avoid the problem and run away. that is, if you're not planning on marrying her.<br><br>2) you have to gain the trust of her mother first. right now, she's treating you like her enemy because she doesn't trust that you will treat her daughter good.<br><br>you must find some way to appease her and let her realise that you aren't the kind of person she believed to be.<br><br>i must tell you that this will take up ALOT of your time, effort, and patience. but it will definitely be worthwhile.<br><br>good luck man!</div>
