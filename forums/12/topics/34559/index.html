            <div class='col-md body'>I have decide to pop the ultimate question to defend the name of Love - which many people in this forum have comdemn, spit and curse at its doing that has led to their emotional turmoils which they are undergoing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Scenario:<br>It is predicted that you will have only two relationships this lifetime.<br><br>If you have a choice and it has already predicted (you were told and you knew) that your first relationship relationship wouldn't last to the end of time or marriage (whichever seemed more applicable), BUT however, spiritually and emotionally you will grow from the departure of this relations...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>And (you already knew) that your second marriage will be the partner that will be with you till death do you apart...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Question is... WOULD you people choose to escape phrase 1 of your relationship and just enter the later relationship KNOWING fully well you wouldn't have to go through all those postive and negative aspect of the lost first relationship and KNOWING fully well that the later relationship will be the guy/girl you will eventually marry?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Or you rather choose to enter first love relationships - to grow, mature, to experience different sort of emotions that relationships could give to you? And finally the second relation which you will indeed treasure?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Variable that are kept constant: Two guys/girls are your style of partners. The reasons why you cannot be with your first love is because he/she has to move overseas and won't be coming back. You can't go over with her - this relationships has to end. (Fated lar, but in a very good sense, not as in he/she dump you for another person, etc)<br><br>What you will choose?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
