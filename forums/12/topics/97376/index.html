Don't try to control her life, if she prefers to call you rather than smsing you...so be it. She is just only your gf and you shouldn't try to take control of her life. Always check to make sure that you are not possessive of her and never try to control what she does. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Let her do what she wants...no girls likes their bf to place restrictions on them, even though this is what usually happens after the girl agrees to be the guy's gf. She is who she is...and that is what you liked about her. If she is somehow changed to accommodate you...then she wouldn't be feeling happy about it and being with you. So be a cool guy and trust her to do what she wants. Don't make this mistake okie? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
