            <div class='col-md body'>sorry this isn't going to sound nice<br>my first impression when i read this post: im skeptical of yoiur relationship as the age gap is too great, moreover your gf is only 16. plus this is a long distance relationship<br>at 16, she gets to meet many other guys and MIGHT want to experience more<br>its going to be difficult handling a long dist r/s because as she said, feelings will change more so when you are younger and want to see and know more<br>hang on that is just my opinion<br>anyway, i think you should just move on<br>you're not young anymore and you will definitely meet someelse whom you might find more compatible for you<br>take some time to get over your feelings for her<br>then you should move on<br>good luck</div>

And I didnt plan on this. It just happened.<br><br>So you see, life works in very mysterious ways. U cant control what happens outside, but you definitely can control your own life.

            <div class='col-md body'>i guess you can continue to live your life...do not be tied down by this relationship and think that "OH...love is romantic...i will wait for her till she turn 18 or so...its so romantic"...<br>you situation is that you are far apart and you do not see each other everyday...you might meet some other girls someday and she might meet other guys another day too...it won't be fair if she would forgo a potential relationship in indonesia just because you and her promised to wait for each other...its a similar situation for you...<br>2 years is not long...nor its short...so you can probably wait and see what happens...however...you must let her know that if she finds another suitable guy...she will not need to follow the promise you all made...similar for you...but break it to her peacefully if not she might think you are having a change of heart...explain to her its for her benefit cos you dun wanna hold her back on anything...<br>you never know..maybe tml you will meet another girl of your dreams...so would she...<br><br></div>
