              <p>It part of it, more or less the way to it, you dun go invest blindly, at least you must know the market, like commodities today is a good investment, cos food are getting lesser and more expensive, so I will go buy commodities to diversify abit  on equity and EM.</p>
              <p>In Love, if you fall blindly, you do not know her character, her temper, her objectives, her intention, then you are bound to lose out, if you know she is materialistic, hot lady type temper like me who throw high heels at bf with an intention of money transfer in real cold hard cash, which I am not, then you are in for trouble, and remember, nobody, i said nobody asked you to go for her, so most guy end up crying like a small boy who lost his plastic nipples with nothing to suck except his own thump,  too bad.</p>

              Fallin in love is ''normal'' , at least it is perceived so cos 8 out of 10 persons lack love within themselves, hence this phenomena. One is malnourished within and also carry ideas of an ideal person, ideals of life, love and in the MIND ... and when someone that resembles or bears the the semblance that which is in one's head is unwittingly/unconsciously projected onto another it is miscontrued as falling in love. One never loved another - it is being in love with the projections and when the other displays such ... one assumes it is love.
              Imagine the other in the same boat - after awhile, the struggle will start to maintain that image (that persists in one and found in another), hence the consstant bickering and what-not in not allwoing the other to change. Why? Cos the changes in the other will be a threat to one's existence, one feels diminished.  However, being human, one evolves, only dead things remain the same. Love was never there and it happens all the time,and it is cos of misunderstaning oneself. The wise would reconcile to these polarising dichotomies and only when understanding happens would love (presupposing it emanates from within oneself FIRST) stand the tests of the vagaries of every day living.
              
              When one is ''self''-full ( not to be confused with ego-trips) one is an emperor/empress and this individual ( he/she is no longer a persona excepting fulfilling roles/responsiblities)is abundantly rich within. This person shares his/her being. This person does not look for love and an aura of lovingness pours forth from his/her presence. 
              In today's age of noise - the neurosis or rather the misintreperations,misconceptions have cause many to fear love. Love does not bind anyone, only fears/expectations/needs that unfortunately pretends love is the culprit!
              Love cannot co-exist with ego-trips and where it is transpires, know jolly well it is not a loving experenice or relationship/marriage but a mutual benefit scheme!

              <p><br>The sad true is people love infatuation and crush, that kind of feeling which usually begin at the initial contact is the most exciting of Love relationship, then when genuine love finally set in, the begin of deterioriation of Love begin, you see young gals like me, love infatuation and crushy feeling, you see young couples still looking and searching for each other flaws and good excitingly, then you see middle age couple having lots of family and maybe financial problem or parent problems, then at the end, you see one  walk in front, and one walk at the back...</p>

              <p>i think she is just wasting your time. im sure she knows your feelings. you see if she had liked you, you wont have waited so long but with no answers. i think she might just not know how to reject you properly that is why she make an excuse saying she needs time to think.</p>
              <p>maybe you should just find a time ask her out and make your stand clearly, telling her how you feel , and tell her to make clear of her feelings towards you , so that it will be fair for you. if not you might be wasting your time.</p>

              <p>what is there so hard, it just like a business bargaining, you let go a little of your expectation, i let go abit, and viola! senorita! we can be partners.</p>
              <p>In relationship is the same, you set out with a high expectation will never get you much choice, lower it, try again, aim at those who you really want, eg if you want a 28yo gal, dun go out with a 19yo just for the sake of getting a company to go out, then end up wasting yr time and effort, unlike me, who is also young, most young peoples or teenagers do not talk the same frequencies with Uncles, one 93.3fm, the other 98fm, how to match? Even if you fail to get the gals you want, you can alway ask them to intro you some, like me, I had introduced many gals to guys and some even got married and invited me for dinner. To get a galfren the best introducer is thru a gal, can be yr sisters or normal gal frens, cos we gal are good in finding another gal for you, you go ask a guy, he will most probably get you a lousy one, cos the good one he would had taken himself.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I realised that there are many different definition of love is, not to mention it's from different person. I think that in everyone's love/relationship, the experience is unique, there may be some similarity though. Like for mine, I had a senior in my other martial art club, he had gone through the exact same thing as me, just that he was lucky that the girl finally accepted him after sometime. But I doubt he chased her for very long time, I think only about a year. In short, everyone had a unique definition and experience on love, not one theory or solution can be absolute to everyone.</div>
