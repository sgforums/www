              <p>For woman, let me tell you guys some of our secret, we actually do not like guy to chase us, those chasing us are desparate ones, if we really like a guy, the guy dun even need to chase, just a date and the r/s can start liao. Those who chased so desparately and finally manage to get her is because we gal get ditched by the guy we loved and given no choice and also need some console, then, you can at least temporary come into the role, if not, chase until die also no use.</p>
              <p>If guys want to spend time and money on us, what can we do? chop lah</p>

              <p>From a gal perspective,</p>
              <p>first you need to know her family, get close to her mother (but dun go court her mother hor) and father, her siblings, get to know and chat freely with her family members, once they like you, you get the upper hands, cos they will tell this gal that you are a good guy and the better choice, most gal listen to their daddy, like me.</p>
              <p>Then work your way into her, effort must be there, send her home often, especially on Monday, which is a boring and blue day, she will needs company to go home. And if you are there for her, she will cherish it. Do remember her birthday, offer to organise it with her family, once the family get close to you, and she feels you are also able to get along with her mother, father, granny, etc etc.. which ultimately end up you and her having a lots of thing to talk about her family. Remember gal like to complain this and that, be a good listener and understand her, slowly, slowly...she will fall for you.</p>
              <p>Dun say Angel teach you hor</p>

              <p><br>Hello, if the front door cannot go thru, look for the backdoor, no harm trying, maybe he can get her heart, educated gal like us are alway filial to our parents, once a boy can get the trust of my parents, get along well, I see a light in the end of the tunnel for this guy. Most importantly is to make sure he is sincere, willing to sacrifice and give, he must have a believe that he wanted the gal to be his gf, his future wife and care for her for the rest of his life. If you have doubt with the gal you are chasing and unsure whether she can be your steady or future wife, then you better forget it, dun waste our time and your time.</p>
