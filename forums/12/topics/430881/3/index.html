              <p>It seems like this gal is waiting/looking for someone with not so much of an age gap of 5 years. Since there is this guy that falls head over heels with her, why not just enjoy the attention and at the same time lookout for other guys. Else, frankly, if she truly likes you, it will not have been dragged for 3 years and still no result. She already told you twice she only treats you as good friend or a brother. It will be best that you too are keeping your option open. It is you who are not willing to let go, that you can't see there are other potential gals around. Why not play the devil adovate? Withdraw partially and reject her occassionally and see how's the reaction. If there is nothing, then you are sure to know she simply just want you to be a brother to her. Or, as she has been brought in a single family, she may not feel confident enough to be in a relationship. So either you chase her till she gets involved in a relationship with another guy and take the risk of heartbreak, or, you give yourself some option to look around too.</p>
              <p>At the end, its about choice and consequence. If you choose A to woo her till she end up in another man's arm, rejected and heart-break, or choose B woo and still look out but the conseqence will be different.</p>

As said, life is yours, if you choose to go on and waste your life on someone that has no affection and playing hide and seek with you, by all means, as long as you are happy with it.</p></div>

              <p>"Last month, I went to a fortune teller with kelvin and terry, the
                                      master said that the girl for my life already appeared, but the
                                      timing is not ripe yet. This was the same thing being told to me
                                      when I go to goddess of mercy temple before I enlist to æ±‚ç°½, the
                                      girl is already here, but not the right time yet."</p>
              <p>seems like no matter what we say TS is willing to wait for this girl.</p>
              <p>What the above statement means that the girl you liked had not yet experience enough bad guys out there in order to learn to treasure a nice guy like you.</p>
              <p>In life, the girl you like may feels that you are not the one yet, cause there is something more she wants. She may feel that you are not handsome, rich or bad enough for her. Sorry bro to her you are just a back-up in case anything happens she can come back to you. Sadly this is the path the you have chosen and it may even last up 20 to 30 years without the girl liking him at all.</p>
              <p>For what I have seen, the longest wait for a guy is around 11 years, in the end he give up.</p>
              <p>I am not asking you to give up, but since you want to wait why not work harder to earn more money.</p>

              Love abides when there are no reasons to love, no fears to love. Many confuse needs (expectations) to be love which is not. Till that anomaly within oneself is unreconciled one is always accidental.
              It is alright to have needs but it has to be acknowledged within oneself and when it is not forthcoming from another or needs are not fulfilled the responsibility is one's own.
              
              Of course, all of us go thru phases but better to risk and if one gets hurt in that process so what.
              Growing old is playing careful, playing it safe and always on the lookout for what can go wrong. Growing up is taking ti all and despite the mistakes,mishaps and  what-not it is really living.
              
              There is no secruity in love but what good is a relationship/marriage when it has the permanency (security) of a dead cemetery!
