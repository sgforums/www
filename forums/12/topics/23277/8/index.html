            <div class='col-md body'>yup... very likely to be a fraud...<br><br>but even if true, his attitude so far shouldnt justify anymore sincere help/advice....<br><br>to me, he's a lonely soul, deprived of true friendship..... wanting attention......<br><br>my fren, i'm sure you will realize one day that<br><br><strong>character, not personality builds trust....<br>trust builds true long term relationships...<br>relationships give meaning and hope to life...</strong><br><br>i sincerely hope you dun die a loner....coz tat would mean more tax burdens for the rest of us...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After going through this whole thread, i feel compelled to sign up and post a reply here. Anyway, i am going to use politically correct english so that my point can be understood. First things first, if you had really done what you mentioned here to your girlfriend, then you are really a man without a conscience in you. And to think that you could still joke about having sex with her on and on, including mentioning about having sex with her without worrying when she was pregnant. As for the cost of an abortion, i do not feel i am qualified in this field enough to tell you how much it costs. From a legal perspective, although it is considered "legal" to have sex with a "minor" that is sixteen years of age and above, it is still possible to charge you with having sex with a minor. So do not be too happy. You should be thinking of the consequences rather than thinking of how to get more sex out of your current girlfriend and your previous or future ones. The way i see it, you are not serious and not commited to your girlfriend. Anyway, i hope what i have said will make you think about what you have done. If you have any problems, feel free to find me for advice. And, go think about what you are doing, whether all this you have posted is for real or not. And i do not see any fun in posting a thread so that people can give their insights and breath their flames on you.</div>
