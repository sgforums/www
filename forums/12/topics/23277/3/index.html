            <div class='col-md body'><br>Methods of abortion<br><br>Menstrual Extraction<br>A very early suction abortion, often done before the pregnancy test is positive.<br><br>Suction<br>The abortionist first paralyzes the cervix (womb opening).  He then inserts a hollow plastic tube with a knife-like tip into the uterus.  The tube is connected to a powerful pump with a suction force 29 times more powerful than a home vacuum cleaner.  The procedure tears the baby's body into pieces and the hose frequently jerks as pieces of the baby become lodged.  See Photo. The placenta is then cut from the inner wall of the uterus and the scraps are sucked out into a bottle.<br><br>Dilatation &amp; Curettage (D&amp;C)<br>Uncommon today and used during the first 10 weeks of pregnancy.  This is similar to the suction procedure except that the abortionist inserts a curette, a loop-shaped steel knife up into the uterus.  He then cuts the placenta and baby into pieces and scrapes them out into a basin.  Bleeding is usually profuse.<br><br>Dilatation &amp; Evacuation (D&amp;E)<br>Performed during the second trimester (4-6 months) of pregnancy.  This method has largely replaced saline and chemical abortions, which too frequently resulted in live births, a complication from the abortionist's perspective!  A pliers-like instrument is needed because the baby's bones are calcified, as is the skull.  There is no anesthetic for the baby. The abortionist inserts the instrument into the uterus, seizes a leg or other part of the body and, with a twisting motion, tears it from the baby's body.   This is repeated again and again.  The spine must be snapped, and the skull crushed to remove them.   The nurse's job is to reassemble the body parts to be sure that all are removed.<br><br>D &amp; X  (Partial Birth)<br>Also used for advanced pregnancies.  The cervix is dilated to allow passage of a ring forceps.  A foot or lower leg is located and pulled into the vagina.   The baby is extracted in breech fashion until the head is just inside the cervix. The baby's legs hang outside the woman's body.  With the baby face-down, scissors are plunged into the baby's head at the nape of the neck and spread open to enlarge the wound.  A suction tip is inserted and the baby's brain is removed. The skull collapses and the baby is delivered.   See Photo.  Sharp and suction curettage is continued until the walls of the womb are clean.<br><br>(Parial Birth Abortion)<br><br>Hysterotomy<br>This method is usually used late in pregnancy and is likened to an "early" Caesarian section.  The mother's abdomen and uterus are surgically opened and the baby is lifted out.   Unfortunately, many of these babies are very much alive when removed.  To kill the babies, some abortionists have been known to plunge them into buckets of water or smother them with the placentas.  Still others cut the cord while the baby is still inside the uterus depriving the baby of oxygen.<br><br>Salt Poisoning a.k.a. "Candy Apple Babies:"<br>Most often used after the first trimester (first three months).  The abortionist injects a strong salt solution directly into the amniotic sac (fluid surrounding the baby).  The baby breathes and swallows it, is poisoned, struggles, and sometimes convulses. It takes over an hour to kill the baby.  The mother delivers the dead baby in a day or two (sometimes alive!).   Why "candy apple" babies?   The corrosive effect of the salt solution often burns and strips away the outer layer of the baby's skin.  This exposes the raw, red, glazed-looking subcutaneous layer of tissue.   The baby's head sometimes looks like a candy apple.  See Photo.   Some have also likened this method to the effect of napalm on innocent war victims.  This technique was originally developed in the concentration camps in Nazi Germany. (source: Abortion and Social Justice, NY: Sheed &amp; Ward, 1972)<br><br>Prostaglandin Abortions<br>Three forms, two are injected and one is a vaginal suppository.  Its first approved use was for "the induction of midtrimester abortion."  The hormone produces a violent labor and delivery of whatever size baby the mother carries.  If the baby is old enough to survive the trauma of labor, it may be born alive, but is usually too small to survive.   In one article, among the complications listed was "live birth!"<br><br>RU-486<br>A drug that produces an abortion taken after the mother misses her period.   Its effect is to block the use of an essential hormonal nutrient by the newly-implanted baby, who then dies, and drops off.  Note that RU-486 is not a contraceptive because it does not prevent fertilization or implantation.  It is used only after the mother has missed her period and the baby is at least two to three weeks old, with a beating heart (the fetal heart begins to beat when the woman is four days late for her period).  It is no longer effective after six or eight weeks.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's not to say you cannot have sex. Teenagers nowadays will normally have sex but you have to make sure it is SAFE SEX.<br><br>If the girl is already pregnant, abortion is not the way of solving the problem. You're the guy and the advantage is on your side. She might not know anything since she is still so young and at the end of the day, you might leave her for someone else.<br><br>If she is not being able to get pregnant again, or she has complications due to the abortion, you think you'll always be there for her ?<br><br>Done is done but it is a matter of how you overcome this. She might not regret now but she might regret the rest of her life going through the abortion. Of course, saying is easier than doing and you can say you'll treat her well after this abortion and stuffs but whether you really do it, it's a different story.<br><br>Sooner or later, you get horny and get attached to another girl, you go dump her. If she cannot take it then think of suicide, will you feel guilty ? I think you never would ? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Basically coz you're 18 and maybe coz you just don't have that humane feeling ?<br><br>I might not know you in real life but I could only advice that abortion is certainly not the right way out. Good luck and think about it !</div>
