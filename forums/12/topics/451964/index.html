              <p>ok, i got into a sticky stiuation with a female friend, hope you guys can help me.</p>
              <p>there's this friend tht i just know for a month and have been going out regularly for a week or so. She's the type that like to let pple guess things, eg her job, her age etc...</p>
              <p>being the idiot that i am, i actually went to google it up and found some answers with only the intention to know whether i'm correct or not and with the thot that it's just for fun.</p>
              <p>i told her abt it and she got kind of upset, saying that i shldn't be searching her information as there's things that she she has yet felt comfortable to share with me yet, so i gave her a call to explain myself and to assure her that i have no ill-intentions or whatsoever cause if i do have, i wldn't have tld her abt it.</p>
              <p>We ended up have a chat abt it and i felt at least i know her a bit better now.</p>
              <p>at night, i texted her and said "hey i know this sounds crazy but i'm kind of glad this happened cause at least we gotta know each other a bit better. hope you feel the same way too."</p>
              <p>she ans "well i rather this didn't happened"</p>
              <p>i ans "aiyah, what happened has happen already. we can only try to make the best out of it and move on from it correct?"</p>
              <p>from then on, she didn't replied.</p>
              <p>anyone can help me on this? i hope i didn't blow this up big time, i do still want to remain in good terms with her</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>hmmm, will it help in this situation by ignoring her? my intention is to let things cool down 1st and also see whether she's serious in this frenship. what i'm afraid is that if she's really a player, she'll know what to do in this situation too</p>

              <p>Not ignoring her la...but call her out by telling her she
              shouldnt be so childish about such stuff la...not asking you to
              scold her also but who the fuk in the world would get so upset over
              such stuff....even if shes someone you like its no exception
              ...Just beecause you like her means she can step on your head
              meh..have some dignity la..girls like sincere guy who believe in

              <p>hmmm, i do think that my msg to her abt "wat's happened has happen" is already clear enough to her tht she doesn't need to behave like this.</p>
              <p>in this situation, I am standing by my principles. I'm someone when faced with tension between a friend, will try to sort it out by talking, reasoning etc...</p>
              <p>if she doesn't take it aft me trying, then i'll forget abt it and move on unless tht fren is very dear to me</p>

              <p>But don't ignore her la...handle this with maturity. Still can be friends..be magnanimous and just talk to her normally but let her know that you have already put the matter behind you and likewise if she wants to be mature about it you can still be very good friend :) Also good time to test her if she feels its really ok or alright or really just saying only.</p>

              <p>The knee-jerk reaction could mean that she didn't expect you to bring it out <em>so openly</em>. I am one of those who behaves - like this - in return when the unexpected happens. However, the lack of interaction on her part after the episode doesn't correctly interpret that she's avoiding you. Maybe she needed that "time-out" to digest what you have just told her. You are fortunate to know and <em>witness</em> someone who's trying to pick up her own pieces and face the reality.</p>
              <p>There are those who would rather avoid the (long-term) struggle to clarify when being confronted of something they are not comfortable to talk about. (I belong to this category.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/confused.png" alt="confused.png">)</p>
              <p>You need to take a step back to understand that the struggle is not about facing you and addressing your concerns <strong>alone</strong>, but the "inner struggles" that have been holding her back from confiding in you.</p>
              <p>Secondly, I am genuinely befuddled by what you wrote in your first post and in subsequent ones. There wasn't a clear indication of your (romantic) interest <em>in her</em> in your first post. Subsequent posts told otherwise. So was that part of the reason that caused her to back off because that took her by surprise?</p>

              it sounds like your friend is a secretive person. Since you cannot undo the mistake, you can assure that you will keep her information private and confidential and wont sabo her. Then she will feel at ease. 
              
              If she continue to ignore you then you can forget about this relationship. If she still talks to you then there is still hope for you.

              <p>Wonder if this is the same dream gurl who rejected you the last time.</p>
              <p>Don't know why you so desperate to make friends with her. Just admit it - you like her and wanna court her.</p>
              <p>There is danger of not revealing age. I once accidentaly dated a mid 30s girl whom i thought was 24. I am only 23 but when I met her - I assume she was 25 because she look so young with fair skin until one day one of my friends told me that she's really 35.</p>

              <p>ok, i got into a sticky stiuation with a female friend, hope you guys can help me.</p>
              <p>there's this friend tht i just know for a month and have been going out regularly for a week or so. She's the type that like to let pple guess things, eg her job, her age etc...</p>
              <p>being the idiot that i am, i actually went to google it up and found some answers with only the intention to know whether i'm correct or not and with the thot that it's just for fun.</p>
              <p>i told her abt it and she got kind of upset, saying that i shldn't be searching her information as there's things that she she has yet felt comfortable to share with me yet, so i gave her a call to explain myself and to assure her that i have no ill-intentions or whatsoever cause if i do have, i wldn't have tld her abt it.</p>
              <p>We ended up have a chat abt it and i felt at least i know her a bit better now.</p>
              <p>at night, i texted her and said "hey i know this sounds crazy but i'm kind of glad this happened cause at least we gotta know each other a bit better. hope you feel the same way too."</p>
              <p>she ans "well i rather this didn't happened"</p>
              <p>i ans "aiyah, what happened has happen already. we can only try to make the best out of it and move on from it correct?"</p>
              <p>from then on, she didn't replied.</p>
              <p>anyone can help me on this? i hope i didn't blow this up big time, i do still want to remain in good terms with her</p>
