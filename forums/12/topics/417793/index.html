              <p>Has she always been like this ? Or was this "messy-ness" a recent problem ?</p>
              <p>Your parents in their 70s already, why arn't <strong>you </strong>the one cooking and cleaning up ?</p>
              <p>You fed up, they also fed up you lazy bum don't do jack for them. Still make them your maid at such an old age.</p>
              <p>If you are so good, why don't you hire a help to take care of them ? Instead they have to take care of YOU ?</p>

              <p>Yes, it's passive aggressive behavior. And it's very common in older folks. They usually grow up in a family that has no freedom of expression.</p>
              <p>People become like this when they grow up in OPPRESSIVE environment.</p>

              <p><br>Hi Louis, can you spare, say about $30 per week? If so, why dont you engage a cleaner to housekeep your house, that's include sweeping, mopping, cleaning of kitchen, etc..? That will make you less stress. Just part $30 per week, I am sure that will be no problem for you. And any other day, you may just sweep and clean up generally.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Come on, they are your parents, one day everybody will walk this direction. Love your parents, once gone, its gone. Treasure them.</p>

After the wife past away, his whole house up until the garden is filled with junk. The adult children have a headache trying to convince him to throw his junk away. And thn he is very fierce, the children are scared to live with him. Old people are like that, they get stubborn, you cannot change them, only thing you can do is to be there for them.</p></div>
