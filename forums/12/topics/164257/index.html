And this guy own me alot of money and after that bcos of me and her together this useless guy try to do funny thing behind my back.<br><br>This usless trying to win her over by dragging her away from me. One nite where this useless guy actually join for drinking and after that he bluff me that his called to go MS to pick him up. After the next day one of my very gd gf called and tell me she saw this model was at MS with this useless guy. I was very very angry with this female model which I love her very much.
