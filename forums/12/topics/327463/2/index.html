              <p>eh, started thinking of this issue when i was about 10 yrs old. then i would like cry myself to sleep at night. it was very often when i was small, then my life began to become busier.</p>
              <p>and most of the time, i forgot about it.</p>
              <p>just once in a while ...  the feeling rushes back again and i will be down for the entire day. and i'm not even 18 yet</p>
              <p>&gt;.&lt;</p>
              <p>yea, so, lesson learnt is - be good to your parents when they are still with you.</p>

              <p>hey split second, i am an only child too. both my parents married late and are in their seventies. my mum was diagnosed with cancer last yr... i'm not sure whether u have any strong reason for worrying... are ur parents in good health?</p>
              <p>but even then, i understand very well that it's tough. i had the same fear even before my mum's diagnosis. sometimes i get so scared tt i might never be able to survive, shld anything happen to them. cos they are one of my main reasons for living... tho i bring in the income, i am still very reliant on them emotionally. but i suppose we have to learn to count blessings. cos at least we still have them with  us now. the most impt thing is to have friends and relatives who can support you... need not be a gf or bf... or maybe join a religious community, be it christian, buddhist or any others...</p>
              <p>i guess u already know all these things... just wanted to let u know tt there are others like urself... heh i used to think tt i was the only one having this fear... :)</p>

              <p>it's gd tt u discuss wif ur parents... traditional asian families tend to shun topics of death... but i feel tt no matter how much we've done for our parents in their old age... we will always be indebted to them more than they are indebted to us... even if they're not ard anymore, by the will of god, like u said, they wld wan u to live on and be strong...</p>
