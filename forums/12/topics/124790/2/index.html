having suicidal thoughts right now..my cousin (chrysalis_guy) told me that sgforum people can help me..so here I am..i canÂ’t seem to get registeredÂ…cos no verification sent to my email..<br><br>HereÂ’s what happened..<br><br>IÂ’m a 25 years old guy..2 years ago..I ended a 9 year relationship with my 1st gf..she ditched me because of another guy..it left a huge impact on me..and at that point of time..i lost my job..and all my friends..i went into deep depression and live in seclusionÂ….for the next couple of months..i couldnÂ’t muster myself up and canÂ’t find any jobs..i was really determined to end my life once for allÂ…until..one day..i told myself I need to survive..and found a job finally..but even then..i have totally forgotten what is happiness..till I met a gal through a friend who was still studying then..<br><br>She was my ever emotional support and accompanied me through my darkest hoursÂ…after many months..we started a relationship..for the past 1 year..we were loving..she was teaching tuition and I was workingÂ…we met about 4 days each week..most of the weekends we meet and for weekdays..we always meet a few hours from 7pm+ to about 10pm+..thenÂ…at certain points in time..i will suffer a mental relapseÂ….it seems to stem from my previous depression..sometimes I will get really emotional..and she has kept helping me to cope with it..she knows that she means everything to me..and every second with her is important for me to maintain my sanity..as I am very scared of being lonely..very scared of not being lovedÂ…sometimes I can be perfectly normal..sometimes I can just become emotional and feels that she doesnÂ’t love me anymore..though deep inside me..i know she doesÂ…I also dunno why I feel so uncertain..anyway..whenever she is with me..i am able to control my sanity..to have a reason to live..<br><br>It all went well when recently..she told me she was planning to start work in a firm which requires her to go United States for the 1st month..she still continues tuition..i was devastated..my emotional Â‘pillarÂ’ was gonna leave me for a whileÂ…Â…I know I am being rather childish here..but she is really my emotional support..i duno how to explain..without her..my depression will come back..i knowÂ…I started to worryÂ…and I was so scared she will Â‘changeÂ’ when she comes backÂ…I donÂ’t know why I am so uncertain..i really donÂ’t know..she kept assuring me that she wonÂ’t and nothing will change when she comes backÂ…<br><br>Now..she calls me everyday though only a few minutes..as it was expensive to call in the United States..those every few minutes were like Â‘life pillsÂ’ for me to sustain my emotions and to keep on goingÂ….yesterday..she didnÂ’t call me and she smsed me instead from the US..that it was inconvenient and she canÂ’t call me everyday already as it was very expensiveÂ….she then told me to take careÂ…and that when she comes back..she canÂ’t meet me that often as she will have to start a long-term project which her company requires her to doÂ….and hope that I will support herÂ….and not get emotionalÂ…<br><br>When I saw this emailÂ….i was devastatedÂ….i know I should give her supportÂ….but my emotional depression kept bugging meÂ…my emotions kept telling me: Â“she has changed..she said she wonÂ’t..but only after a few days..she told me she cant meet that often..Â”Â….i keep asking myself since she knows that only by being with her can I sustain my emotions and carry on living..why is she still wanting to tell me all these that will destroy me..especially at this time when IÂ’m having problems at work..she knows that the next few weeks..i will be really stressedÂ…and yet..she is telling me now that once she is backÂ…she canÂ’t meet me that often as she has tuition to teach after her workÂ….<br><br>I know I am selfish..a bastard evenÂ….but I just cant control my emotions..i am so uncertainÂ…I feel she will become distant from me if donÂ’t meet that oftenÂ…and if one day she leaves meÂ….she knows that I have no qualms of leaving this worldÂ…not that I using this to threaten herÂ…Â…Â…Â…..i really have no goals and nobody to turn to in this world already..and mentally drained to meet new friendsÂ…Â…..she is the only I have and reason to liveÂ…Â…I donÂ’t know what to do nowÂ…I really donÂ’tÂ….i am really having suicidal thoughts..i havenÂ’t replied to her yetÂ…please may anyone guide meÂ….donÂ’t ask me go counsellrosÂ…cos I really need some advice right nowÂ…please help me..a friend used to tell me that once both started workingÂ…there will be less time to meetÂ…maybe only during the weekendsÂ….itÂ’s commonÂ….not like the study period..where almost everyday meetÂ…..but I still cant controlÂ…<br><img

Is it worth for you to kill yourself over a girl? Even if you die, will she know? How will she react even if you are dead? She will still move on with her life doing what she wants in her life.<br><br>Without her, you are still living posting in this forums....If you think it's better for you to die, then you should go ahead. But have you think about how will your parents feel if you commit suicide? You are not only selfish, you have no conscience at all. After living for 25 years, this is what you do best?! only know die is the best solutions? Face it bro! Reality is cruel but it's not the end of the world!<br><br>A person who wants to commit suicide, he or she won't let anyone know. they will think it through on their own and then they end their life. It's up to you. If you think you want to die, go ahead! Dun waste your time in sorrowing without thinking of a solutions in a real man way! No one will pity you even you die! You have to wake up now or else it's too late.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ok im only 16 and i know nuts about the working society etc etc..<br><br>alright, i read through what you have said and i think that what you need now is friends to help you tide over the crisis. For you to even think of posting in this website shows that you trust the people here. would you not say you treat us as friends? i understand ur problem with your friends, but what is the cause of the rift between you and your friends? im sure you cannot possibly aggravate all your friends at once unless you've done something terribly wrong. ask yourself, did all of your friends leave you? or did you isolate yourself, distancing yourself and your friends and making it seem as though they have left you.<br><br>what about your family? i was once a very sad child that was not able to hang out with friends, go to parties. all of that changed when i started talking to my parents. they realised my problems, in the meantime, i gained my freedom, and opened my parents up. i allowed them to know my problems, know my friends. that helped alot as whenever i had problems, i know my parents understand me enough to carry me through. which parent does not love his/her child? yes, people might feel that their parents do not love them, but i always believe that the parents just take a different approach which the child is unfamiliar with. that is the cause of the misinterpretation and misunderstanding.<br><br>communication is one of the things a normal person cannot live without. to be able to communicate well is to be able to put your ideas and thoughts clearly across anyone's mind. have you been communicating well with your family? do your parents understand you? if no, the way to let them know you is through speaking the truth about yourself.<br><br>ok i've been ranting and suicide should never be an option. you dont have to go to professionals to seek for help, you didnt have to post on this forums. the one who can only save you is you yourself. you are what you think and what you do. By committing suicide, you are trying to run away from the problem. In the process, you hurt your loved ones. By overcoming this period of depression, you become stronger, and more aware of how to cope with oncoming pressure. come on, take it as a challenge. you only have 1 life, are you going to give yourself a game over even without playing? In life, there are many choices, you can't say which is a wrong or right choice, but you have to bear in mind that the choices made.. are the results you get.. and the consequences that follow. i have said enough...</div>
