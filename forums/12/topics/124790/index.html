            <div class='col-md body'>Guys..this is my 1st post..really really need your helpÂ…IÂ’m having suicidal thoughts right now..my cousin (chrysalis_guy) told me that sgforum people can help me..so here I am..i canÂ’t seem to get registeredÂ…cos no verification sent to my email..<br><br>HereÂ’s what happened..<br><br>IÂ’m a 25 years old guy..2 years ago..I ended a 9 year relationship with my 1st gf..she ditched me because of another guy..it left a huge impact on me..and at that point of time..i lost my job..and all my friends..i went into deep depression and live in seclusionÂ….for the next couple of months..i couldnÂ’t muster myself up and canÂ’t find any jobs..i was really determined to end my life once for allÂ…until..one day..i told myself I need to survive..and found a job finally..but even then..i have totally forgotten what is happiness..till I met a gal through a friend who was still studying then..<br><br>She was my ever emotional support and accompanied me through my darkest hoursÂ…after many months..we started a relationship..for the past 1 year..we were loving..she was teaching tuition and I was workingÂ…we met about 4 days each week..most of the weekends we meet and for weekdays..we always meet a few hours from 7pm+ to about 10pm+..thenÂ…at certain points in time..i will suffer a mental relapseÂ….it seems to stem from my previous depression..sometimes I will get really emotional..and she has kept helping me to cope with it..she knows that she means everything to me..and every second with her is important for me to maintain my sanity..as I am very scared of being lonely..very scared of not being lovedÂ…sometimes I can be perfectly normal..sometimes I can just become emotional and feels that she doesnÂ’t love me anymore..though deep inside me..i know she doesÂ…I also dunno why I feel so uncertain..anyway..whenever she is with me..i am able to control my sanity..to have a reason to live..<br><br>It all went well when recently..she told me she was planning to start work in a firm which requires her to go United States for the 1st month..she still continues tuition..i was devastated..my emotional Â‘pillarÂ’ was gonna leave me for a whileÂ…Â…I know I am being rather childish here..but she is really my emotional support..i duno how to explain..without her..my depression will come back..i knowÂ…I started to worryÂ…and I was so scared she will Â‘changeÂ’ when she comes backÂ…I donÂ’t know why I am so uncertain..i really donÂ’t know..she kept assuring me that she wonÂ’t and nothing will change when she comes backÂ…<br><br>Now..she calls me everyday though only a few minutes..as it was expensive to call in the United States..those every few minutes were like Â‘life pillsÂ’ for me to sustain my emotions and to keep on goingÂ….yesterday..she didnÂ’t call me and she smsed me instead from the US..that it was inconvenient and she canÂ’t call me everyday already as it was very expensiveÂ….she then told me to take careÂ…and that when she comes back..she canÂ’t meet me that often as she will have to start a long-term project which her company requires her to doÂ….and hope that I will support herÂ….and not get emotionalÂ…<br><br>When I saw this emailÂ….i was devastatedÂ….i know I should give her supportÂ….but my emotional depression kept bugging meÂ…my emotions kept telling me: Â“she has changed..she said she wonÂ’t..but only after a few days..she told me she cant meet that often..Â”Â….i keep asking myself since she knows that only by being with her can I sustain my emotions and carry on living..why is she still wanting to tell me all these that will destroy me..especially at this time when IÂ’m having problems at work..she knows that the next few weeks..i will be really stressedÂ…and yet..she is telling me now that once she is backÂ…she canÂ’t meet me that often as she has tuition to teach after her workÂ….<br><br>I know I am selfish..a bastard evenÂ….but I just cant control my emotions..i am so uncertainÂ…I feel she will become distant from me if donÂ’t meet that oftenÂ…and if one day she leaves meÂ….she knows that I have no qualms of leaving this worldÂ…not that I using this to threaten herÂ…Â…Â…Â…..i really have no goals and nobody to turn to in this world already..and mentally drained to meet new friendsÂ…Â…..she is the only I have and reason to liveÂ…Â…I donÂ’t know what to do nowÂ…I really donÂ’tÂ….i am really having suicidal thoughts..i havenÂ’t replied to her yetÂ…please may anyone guide meÂ….donÂ’t ask me go counsellrosÂ…cos I really need some advice right nowÂ…please help me..a friend used to tell me that once both started workingÂ…there will be less time to meetÂ…maybe only during the weekendsÂ….itÂ’s commonÂ….not like the study period..where almost everyday meetÂ…..but I still cant controlÂ…<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img

            <div class='col-md body'>Sorry, i just had to let u read this:<br><br>Suicide... You've decided to do it. Life is impossible. Suicide is your way out.<br><br>Fine--but before you kill yourself, here are some things you should know. I am a psychiatric nurse, and i see the results of suicide--when it works and more often, when it doesn't. Consider, before you act, these facts: Suicide is not usually successful. You think you know a way to guarantee it?<br><br>Ask the 25 year old who tried to electrocute himself. He lived. But both his arms are gone.<br><br>What about jumping?<br><br>Ask John. He used to be intelligent, with an engaging sense of humor. That was before he leapt from a building. Now, he's brain-damaged and will always need care. He staggers and has seizures. he lives in a fog. but, worst of all, he KNOWS he used to be normal.<br><br>What about pills?<br><br>Ask the 12 year old with extensive liver damage from an overdose. Have you ever seen anyone die of liver damage? You turn yellow. It's a hard way to go.<br><br>What about a gun?<br><br>Ask the 24 year old who shot himself in the head. Now he drags one leg, has a useless arm and has no vision or hearing on one side. He lived through his "foolproof" suicide. You might too.<br><br>But...<br><br>Who will clean your blood off the carpet or scrape your brains from the ceiling? commercial cleaning companies may refuse that job--but SOMEONE has to do it.<br><br>Who will have to cut you down from where you hanged yourself or identify your boated body after you've drowned? Your father? Your mother? Your wife? Your son?<br><br>The carefully worded "loving" suicide note is of no help. Those who loved you will NEVER completely recover. They'll feel regret and an unending pain.<br><br>Suicide is contagious. Look around your family. look closely at the 4 year old playing with his cars on the rug. Kill yourself tonight, and he may do it ten years from now.<br><br>You DO have other choices. There are people who can help you through this crisis. Call a hotline. Call a friend. Call your minister or priest. Call a doctor or hospital. Call the police. They will tell you that there's hope. Maybe you'll find it in the mail tomorrow. Or in a phone call this weekend. But what you're seeking could be just a minute, a month, or a day away.<br><br>You say you don't want to be stopped?<br><br>Still want to do it?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Fuck you, cheebai! You are one BIG selfish Fucker!<br><br>Before you even think of killing yourself, think of the ones around you that actually cares - your parents, your siblings if you have, your relatives.. etc. Your deliberate death will scar their hearts and cause them eternal pain and agony. Why hurt the ones who love you like this?<br><br>Also, if you kill yourself now. How would you ever get to know that something wonderful might happen in a week's time? Or perhaps in a month's time?<br><br>Calm down. Think about this. Think REALLY hard about this. Is it worth it?<br><br>I'm leaving you to seriously ponder about this.<br><br>S.H.I.N.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>whoa whoa people. he's already depressed. don't be harsh on him!<br><br>Ok um, chrysalis_guy's cousin, dun do anything foolish. your posting a call for help here shows u don't want to die right? Now, I can understand the girl being your emotional support. I've kinda gone thru that b4 so I know how it feels. And as for suicide, well lets say its something I've considered and nearly attempted b4. The thing here is, u have to learn to look at things from a different point of view to pull yourself out of the depression. Thats all I can really advise u on. And the rest is up to u.<br><br>And oh, the harsh posts by the other 2 forumnites? dun take it too hard. the reason they're being harsh is because they dun want u to die either. Here's wishing u'll be able to pull yourself out of depression soon.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Chrysalis_Guy<br><br>1)  Please forget about suicide. Everyone regrets after suicide, I'm sure. If your soul were at your own wake, you'll understand, think about it. Nothing is so bad that you have to die to escape from it. Things will always work out, one way or another.<br><br>2) You feel insecure after the break-up with your first girlfriend. You may not know it but if you're insecure you'll need more re-assurance from your current girlfriend and will tend to be more sensitive which will be taxig to your current girlfriend. You'll also need more attention from her. BUT, you have to understand, if you love her and afraid to lose her you have to loosen your grip. Hold on too tight it'll break and let too loose it'll slip through your fingers. If you go on getting too emotional, it won't be long before she leaves you, put yourself in her shoes.<br><br>3) I feel that you have to relax and unwind yourself, maybe go for a massage or a sit at the beach, i think your stress level is too high. Think things out in these situations and the picture will get clearer and clearer.<br><br>I hope to be of help. REMEMBER! You only live once, don't be a loser. When you thought you'll die after you break up with your first girlfriend, you met your 2nd girlfriend. There's always hope.<br><br>God Bless.......<br></div>

Everyone needs to work and have their own space. By being too emotional and senseless, you are driving your gal nearer to the verge of emotional stress and subsequently break-up.<br><br>If your gal is send to US and after coming back, do you think she will still be having any easier life after this from her company. You mentioned you have stress at work and suffer from emotional laspse. Have you think about her ? Is she also having also great pressure from work and again your need for emotional support?<br><br>Please wake up and stop behave like a kid. A healthy relationship needs both parties to grow. Don't be such a burden to her. Stand up on your own and make her proud!!! If you love her...<br><br>If you are stressing her out , are you loving her?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Perhaps you had a bad experience before, and so you lost faith in this r/s.  I understand the feeling of missing somebody and yet cannot be with him/her..even for a day.  But, isn't quality time together better?  And I can tell you that she won't be happy to see you so depressed everytime you are with her.  At times she tried to comfort you and times and again, you repeated it.  You are giving her stress, you know?  She said that she can't meet often right?  But it does not mean that she dun want to meet.  It's not easy for her also..to be working and give tuition..she needs your support too.  If you are going to die, you are really selfish..coz you will break her heart.  She might even blame herself for the rest of her life if anything bad happens to you.<br><br>You are not fit to love anybody if dun even know how to love yourself.  Put the past behind you, cherish her, dun stress her..and dun get so stressed up youself..if you continue this way, your 'emotional support' (gf)will break down too. </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Believe me.... suicide is a long way down to nothing at all. Both metaphorically and literally.<br><br>While you may end up escaping from your problems, trust me, you're going to end up hurting a lot of people. All the other forummites here have been saying the same thing, and I agree with them.<br><br>I should know. Last year a friend of mine took his own life after depression owing to work stress and girlfriend problems. He was a highly-respected section commander in my company.... everyone looked up to him. It was a highly traumatic time for everyone who knew him when the news broke out.<br><br>How traumatic? I got nightmares about how as the company medic I should have saved him, but didn't. I constantly felt the guilt for not really being there for him to hear out his problems (he didn't tell me). I couldn't eat well, and lost weight as a result. I suffered from blinding headaches, nausea and vomitting, and severe involuntary muscle twitches in my left eyelid. It forced myself to undergo professional counselling.... it helped somewhat, but it still took a long time before I was really back on track.<br><br>To this day, it still hurts when I think about it. It hurts as I'm typing all this.<br><br>He was a friend, and I had to go through all that when he took his own life. I can't imagine how his closest loved ones must have felt... his parents, siblings, girlfriend... they definitely suffered more than I did.<br><br>If you do have suicidal tendencies, please seek some help. Talk to your friends, your family, a counsellor... anyone you can trust.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The way you hold her on as an emothional crutch will drive her away sooner or later. Eventually She will feel emotionally drained, tired. You will become her liability.<br><br>I dunno, maybe indulging in this kinda emotional state is attention seeking in itself, it draws her closer to u, to show that she really do care.<br><br>The past is the past, and it will not be a repeat as situation, people etc. are  different. Be fair to yourself and most importantly, her. Dun imagine what she's not.<br><br>Why dun you take this oppurtunity to think ot through, toughen yourself up. Stand on your feet. Call her or sms her about happy things, stuffs that u are doing. When she's back, show her you are coping well on your own and everything's OK.<br><br>Just think, one fine day, you will be a father to your own children. You will be the pillar of support  to both your spouse &amp; children. Someone they will look up to. Be the real man you used to be.<br><br>You have a choice.<br><br>cheers.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>before you decide to take your very own life, realise tt the life you claim to lead, with such agony, was never yours to speak of in the first place. it belongs to your parents as well as your girlfriend, who has chosen to identify herself with you and partake in your sufferings when she could have chosen a much better alternative by running off with another guy. so pause for a moment to visualise the trauma your girlfriend would have to inevitably endure in the aftermath of your death. n you will come to a firm conclusion that suicide isn't the best way out, working on your self-esteem is.</div>

intense that you never realise how it will actually drain your partner of personal space, inner space and emotional space. Yes, it will suck her dry without you realising. The problem doesn't lies with her nor the relationship...<br><br>...It's all about you.<br><br>This insecurity breeds like demon manifesting; it's nothing but your mind playing all sort of tricks on you. Your hidden phobia and fear - this extreme fear of being left alone by your ex of nine years always surface and haunt you, thinking that history WILL repeat itself and, you unknowingly, goes to fulfill this self-prophesy.<br><br>Have you ever realise why did your gf left you previously? Am I right to say that it's somewhere along this line that she left you... about her being squeezed emotionally and you 'repelling' her out of the relationship to breathe?<br><br>Frankly speaking, to see your partner as a ONE, solo, ultimate emotional pillar and to cling onto it like gold, would only serve to ruin the relationship eventually. This is a slight deviation from possessiveness, but runs the same result. There are ways to maintain such relationship, but it's not healthy and tends to suffocate relationship and hinder it's potential growth.<br><br>Inferior complex, low self esteem and negative outlook are probably a few common elements that exist in your psychological state. Your love attitude is equipped with an unloving quality about yourself and how definite your partner will leave you because there is simply nothing positive nor good you can retain your partner.<br><br><strong>You panic and gripped your paws onto your love tighter, only <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to see it bleed further.</span></strong><br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Relationship deteriorates with you having no goals, no life outside your love while she has hers. Reason is simple: No woman would want her man to be like that. You must stand in equal with her in order to command respect from your love... in equal not as in career-wise or such, rather having ample understanding, trust, personal space. She gave you these qualities during your darkest times - where are yours then?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Love lives better when complement with personal life</strong>. </span>Only then you can truely achieve much... even self actualization. Continue your own way of doing things will ONLY strangle this relationship with your own bare hands - like a deranged father killing its newborn child.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>P.S: Are you a Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces?<br><br>Cheers</div>

Give them a chance to talk to you and you will know if suicide is really helping you or killing all your love ones around you.<br><br>B) Do what you always wanted to do which you never got a chance to do it...when your gf and work hindered you while they were around.<br>Now is the time. Finish that dream.<br><br>C) Go and buy a camera. Go to place you always wanted to visit. take as much pics as you want. Look through the pics you take. It will make you make you find news life.<br><br>If you have finished what you have been dreaming off (Probbaly a week at least) and you still feel like you must kill yourself, then do it.
