If you feel that your feelings are all mixed up, just relax and calm yourself down... They'll probably just settle down in time to come...<br><br>Just as much as you understand that your life is important to you, you should learn to love yourself as much as you love the others around you... You don't always have to act so brave... If you're tired just rest... If you're sad just cry... Afterall you're only a human...? You're no machine, there's a limit to what you can take.... If you need, get yourself someone whom you can pour out your feelings to... I'm sure it's possible to find one....<br><br><strong><br>i wont commit suicide..i just thinking is death the only way to make ppl appreaciate wat u have..</strong><br><br>Not true... In Life, there're many ways for people to appreciate who you are.... Death is just a more drastic one... Whether you prove your point or not, you won't be around to find out... Now it's commonly known as a DELUSION... As if you come to think of it when you're not troubled and in your right frame of mind, you'll probably realise that whatever reasons you give for suicide are just twisted views and facts...<br><br><strong><br>but silly i will never do it....my life may b useless to they all but to me it is a treasure...there is no one else like me...</strong><br><br>Glad ya think that way...?<br><br><strong><br>i am just really tired pray for me its just pms..haha</strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Hope so too...?<br></blockquote></div>
