              <p>simple...</p>
              <p>you have a liking for A, so you feel jealous when she gets too close to other guys..</p>
              <p>but then, A is not your gf, so even if you feel jealous, what can you do? She has the right to be close(or flirtatious) to any other guy, including you! :)</p>
              <p>Things get a little bit complicated, if A becomes your gf. But till then, go after her if you fancy someone. If not, she be gone( with your other alphabet friends) lol</p>

              <p>From what you described, it seems the feeling isn't mutual. She may treat you like a normal friend only.</p>
              <p>Invite her out for dinner and chat. If she refuses, it means she doesn't wanna give you the wrong impression and thus, you can forget about her.</p>
              <p>If she accepts, then watch her body language for any signs that she may be interested in you after all.</p>

              <p>This is a risk, because there is a chance she might ask if the rest are going and those kind of stuffs.</p>
              <p>Maybe TS can try something like calling her up and asking if she is free to go somewhere with him, buy clothes, look at some stuffs or something.</p>

              <p>If I were you, I would continue to like her.</p>
              <p>Continue to be yourself and be the best you can be towards her like she's your most important friend, but don't be desperately all over all her.</p>
              <p>Must spend some of your time with her everyday, or at least spend a bit of time with her...with whatever excuses you can come up with.</p>
              <p>Cos if you spent enough time with her, and she's comfortable with your existance in her life, I won't be surprised if one day she woke up yearning for you.</p>
              <p>Be it you don't want her physically (I don't believe you), but you still need her as a friend in your future, don't you?</p>
              <p>So...be honest with yourself and us, tell yourself if you are desperate for her or not. Honestly isn't that bad, as long as you are prepared to admit, accept and face it.</p>

              <p><br>Sweet, short, advisable.</p>
              <p>Firstly, if she likes you she would tend to be more sensitive to how you feel thus maybe slightly avoiding contact(physical) with the other guys to start off with.</p>
              <p>Secondly, you guys are hardly that stage of maturity. Firstly, you have the issue of instability to start of with, still want to play play. Chances are that if you confess she might go together with you just to experience being in a relationship instead of stepping into one seriously.</p>
              <p>Thirdly, you don't know if she likes the other guys.</p>
              <p>Lastly, when guys say they choose you over her. Hah, what bullshit. If your alphabetical friends fall for her, don't think they give a shit about you. Regretably it's hoes over bros in the real world(most of the time at least)</p>

              <p>This is a risk, because there is a chance she might ask if the rest are going and those kind of stuffs.</p>
              <p>Maybe TS can try something like calling her up and asking if she is free to go somewhere with him, buy clothes, look at some stuffs or something.</p>

              <p><br>True, if you gamble with your chances - either you might end up in a relationship that has a high chance to not work out or get rejected and face awkwardness which eventually leads to you losing a friend.</p>
