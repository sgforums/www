Her mum just found out about about us together and objects to it since I am not a christian.

She also said one of her BF criteria is that he must be a christian.<br><br>So I'm really feeling very depressed now. What should I do?

Should I even try going to the church again and make myself believe in it? (Although I know that at first the main reason for going will be because of her and not because of the religion itself).

Its a different story when she's your wife.<br>Think carefully.<br><br>My personal opinion: I hate to be forced to change and I hate threats. These 2 things I will not live by and I would not want my life to bend upside down just because my bf feels my belief systems do not fit his (ie I do not have the freedom to live my life as I wish) and hence I have to give up everything just to be with him or else he will walk (ie. Threaten that I will not have a r/s with him). I would rather tell him to take a hike since he cannot see what a good gf and wife I can be.

Her mum just found out about about us together and objects to it since I am not a christian. She, too, told me that although she have feelings for me, this relationship will not last, main reason is also because I'm not a christian. She also said one of her BF criteria is that he must be a christian.<br><br>So I'm really feeling very depressed now. What should I do? I really don't know what to do as I am a strong believer of "seeing is believing". I also tried going to the church but I don't think it is suitable for me. Just feels wierd going there, especially when many strangers come and talk to me.<br><br>Really hope people here would be able to advise me on what to do! Should I even try going to the church again and make myself believe in it? (Although I know that at first the main reason for going will be because of her and not because of the religion itself). Or should I just continue to believe in my own things but have the risk of losing her?<br><br>*Edit: I hope this thread wouldn't offend anyone of any religion. Just hope posting here would solve my problem. So please be peaceful!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Another... Jupiter-based BGR problems.<br><br>It's so tricky to handle that you will probably see yourself giving up altogether because it takes MUCH endurance to face up to this daunting challenge and its duration would stretch for YEARS.<br><br>Is your Love strong enough to surmount this crisis? I don't know... considering that you are still so young.<br><br>Yunhaier's take is that if Religion matters more than Love and you are unable to conform, then allow her to pursue what she wills. This is not about communication nor expectation - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>it's more about parallel mindset that would never meet</strong></span>. It is true that some couples managed to overcome this hurdle, but that's because their mutual focus is on Love and not religion on the whole.<br><br>They fight to preserve their Love and not bow to 'human agents' acting on the pretext of 'God's Word'.<br><br>If it's truly God's will and God wants you to leave her - your Love will surely crumble with time to come and fade into memories.<br><br>But what if God didn't want it that way?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What if God didn't want to intervene at all and leave it to freewill to decide?</strong></span><br><br>Zealous 'human agents' are trying to justify with all sort of reasoning - when in fact, the main reason is because you are different and people dislike unfamiliarity. They would prefer something more 'familiar' or similar. It is the same with race, with status and all other aspects that place people on measuring scale that categorise us.<br><br>The truth is that Love and Religion are two separate entities. Zealous humans lump them together.<br><br>If your woman can't see that - then, you may consider heeding for the exit or prepare for a lengthy, drudgery fight in name of Love.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The great French king Henri IV reputedly said that Paris was worth a Mass when he converted from Protestantism to Catholicism in order to gain the crown. So if you think your girlfriend is worth it, why not convert? However, if you really feel that Christianity is not for you and your girlfriend has made it abundantly clear that there's no future for the two of you if you do not convert, then I guess it's best to break the relationship.</div>

Some people think its preferable for a Christian to be with a Christian but its not a must while for others , it is considered a sin if a Christian ends up being with a non-believer.<br>Not sure about your bf's reaction to this, maybe he doesnt mind u being a non Christian or he has allowed his feelings to be prioritised over this.</div>
