Read carefully the replies we've given to you and THINK OVER IT.<br><br>2. follow the rules of Sgforums. As much as you might find the analogy I've given to you about the innocent old man inappropriate, I would agree with you myself. But given the FACTS that I have to clear and go through AA in the middle of the night despite the fact that I would have to wake up very early the next day for work and knowing that Monday (and even the days which follow) would be too busy for me to backtrack events in AA; managing on a laptop which is giving me problems reading and replying the posts certainly doesn't help further. Least to mention that I have to entertain your post which would means more time and energy consumed. Why did I mentioned job? End of the day if I don't perform up to the standard on my job, who do you think is gonna be feeding me? You? Or Sgforums?<br><br>I did not really bother to reply your post. I think MC has been doing a great job. I know I might sound naggy repeating the same old things, so I guess some things people just fail to read and get the information into their head on the 1st note. I'm ok with that. Nobody's perfect.<br><br>About 'shape out' or 'ship out'. Me and MC have something in common. In fact, you think we really feel great as moderators in AA? What we wanted initially was to ADVISE people in need. The MOD job just came in so that we can better manage the situation.<br><br>Hereby I would like to APOLOGISE to MC if you're reading this.

(and that includes my rights to CRAP around  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ) But don't worry... Since I've decided to, I'll try to get back to you when I can...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>THANKS MC. I think I'll take over from here. I know you've always been in a difficult position as well. Stuck between me and the forumites.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>To begin with, I DID NOT wanted to continue with this because...<br><br>1. MODERATING is NOT my MAIN OBJECTIVE in AA. I'll rather be spending time despatching ADVICES. But of course, sometimes when threads get out of hands and defy the PURPOSE of giving PROPER ADVICES to those who need them.. MODERATION COMES IN.<br><br>2. ARGUES. Often leads to FLAMINGS. FLAMINGS are not encouraged in Sgforums. Not in AA. Not even if I'm a MODERATOR.<br><br>3. Like I've said earlier. This issue has been addressed before. You know how many forumites there are in this forum? As much as I believe that one can only be truly convinced if we bother to spend time explaining things to them instead of bashing them (family discipline). We're not handling just a small family here. You know how many forumites there are in AA? What would happen if people keep asking the same question again? I rather be spending time on more meaningful things (or relaxing). But of course, I know you won't be happy with my reply this way... As I certainly won't be much happy if a moderator tells me the same thing. All of us feels that we're 'unique' in a way... That's why we often don't see a bigger picture...<br><br>4. I've thought of 'shipping out' too. But if you can TRULY CONVINCE me of a person who can BETTER take the job, I'll be MORE THAN GLAD to 'SHIP OUT'. Till then, NO. I'm not likely to be ABANDONING AA.<br><br>5. This thread has it's OWN PURPOSE. I HATE to 'ENTERTAIN' people in a thread like this. It just BREAKS the thread.<br><br>6. This thread is of RELIGIOUS and FLAMING NATURE. Walking along with you on this would make us PUPPETS who walk RIGHT INTO people who tries to start up FLAMES in the 1st place. I'm not gonna let them have their 'objectives' achieved.<br><br>7. You've ALREADY BROKEN the RULES of Sgforums. We need not even be doing an arguement with you. So what if the others have done that too? We'll try to get to them too if we can. But that's NO EXCUSE for us to SPARE you. At this point, we're just trying to be 'friendly' and close one eye MOST of the time... Whatever 'arguements' which you might have that follows.. If you've shot a person, you've shot a person. Even if the others have shot people too won't make you any less of an evil. We take you on THAT, you've got NO GROUND for ANY ARGUEMENT....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the threadstarter better think twice before jumping in to become a christian.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Contrary to other people believe, I felt tat wat u believe in not really a choice. It is not as simple as going to church and follow the tiruals just because u have to do it. U really have to believe in EVERYTHING the bible had said and felt tat these practices r meaningful in order to follow it through your life. If u felt tat the religion is not true according to wat u preceive, then u really will felt the rituals u had done are simply rubbish and a waste of resources. Imaging every sunday going to church for a few hours, including exam period and your future short army weekened and tilthing away money tat can probably buy u another car or house in your life. On the long run it will toil on your life.<br><br>Secondly, I felt tat changing your belief just because of a girl is silly  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Remember tis decision will change not only your life but to those around u as well as your future decendents. From your passage I can deduce tat your parents r not christians. They could be freethinkers, buddhist or taoist or even muslim, wat do u think they will feel when u change your belief for your girlfriend  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Also your future decendent will probably be converted by their grandmother to be christians as well. If u felt tat the religion is rubbish, do u wanna see your children go the wrong way because u wanna be with a girl <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> (Of course tis is on the premise tat u believe making a girlfriend is the intention to make her your wife. If u think girlfriend is only to pass this period of time now then I guess u can do anything  want. )<br><br>My suggestions is these. U have to let the girl make the choice. Either accept u as wat u r now or better break up before feelings get too deep. U respect her religion and she respect your belief, otherwise it is not fair to u. Remember it is your girlfriend life, not your girlfriend's mother life. Otherwise might as well ask her mum to just pick her husband for her since she had no say in the matter. In the end she should show her determination in her choice.<br><br>Or u can just continue to go to church and hope tat u will be brainwash enough to really become a christian.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Or u brainwash her enough so she convert to your religion  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> A christian is the same as any other beliefs, such as yours, and the exchange can goes 2 ways. Ask her to go to any place where your current religion is worshipping now and let her have a taste of how u feel.</div>

If we tell you to continue, then next time you might regret that. So what we can only do is present to you all the issues that you might not have known.<br><br>So as I can see the situation is this:<br>1. Her mum does not like you. You can hope that she becomes fond of you or tolerates you. You can learn to simply put on a show in front of her every time you meet her but keep a distance emotionally from her. Hey we do not get everything we want in a nice package that we want in life.<br><br>Her mum is trying to persuade her to leave you becuase she does not like you. Obviously the girl likes you otherwise she would have listened to her mum.<br><br>That she did not shows that she has a mind of her own.<br><br>Will you be matured enough to ignore whatever her mother says if you continue with her? You cannot speak for your gf because you are not her and she might change next time.<br><br>You can try to do things to make her mother likes you but there is no guarantee that she ever will. So the best you can do might be that she tolerates you and leave you alone.<br><br>2. You have different beliefs. Beliefs will results in the decisions one makes everyday. There are people who believe one thing but acts (make decisions) in another way. That is to say, they act in a way that you would not expect since they claim to belong to certain religions.<br><br>But then again, some people believe only certain things in certain religions and not necessarily all of it.<br><br>Bottom line is, she is your gf inspite of her beliefs and her mum.<br><br>The ball is now in your court. Will you stop her from doing what she wants to do that to you are meaningless because you are not a christian? If you are going to stop her, then the relationship will suffer and she will suffer.<br><br>3. Nothing is certain and sure in a relationship. People change all the time and people come into different experiences all the time. That is the biggest problem or biggest treasure in having relationships depending on how you look at it.<br><br>You have to constantly day by day work at a relationship. Even after you are married. There is no such thing as a relationship going into automatic mode and it will run by itself with minimal maintenance. You will need to work at it for it to continue as a successful relationship.<br><br>So far you do have a relationship with her. As long as you continue to have a relationship with her, all these problems are meaningless. The relationship and not the problems is the important thing here. You have a relationship that has problems but you have a relationship!<br><br>As long as the both of you are having a relationship, just continue to work on the problems while still having the relationship.<br><br>You think that the relationship might not last because of all these problems. Hey, here's news for you... relationships never last or is of such low quality you can hardly call it a relationship, if you do not work at it, with or without problems.<br><br>So decide. Do you want to have a relationship with this girl? If yes, then have it and as to whether she will end the relationship with you... that is outside your control and as long as she wants it and you want it... then just continue to have the relationship and try to inject some romance, happiness into it.<br><br>Use your brains to make it romantic and a happy relationship. That is the other side of the same coin.<br><br>Meaning, even without the problems, if there is no romance and is a sad relationship, it will not last and is pointless.<br><br>Even with the problems, as long as it is a romatic and a happy relationship, the relationship is worth it.</div>
