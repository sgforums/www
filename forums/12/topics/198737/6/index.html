I said there're other options available sometimes other than 'fighting it'... Read carefully.... But nonetheless, yes.. You can CHOOSE to 'fight it'. Of course, given that it was your own decision... You'll naturally have to be responsible for it....?<br><br>'Do as the Romans' wasn't really referring to the 'helpness' and 'fighting it' things... It means more to respect the laws and system when you're somewhere... Of course, you can once again choose to 'fight it'. But in this case, it would be more like challenging it...? All depends on your reason(s) for challenging the authority and whether is it truly a meaningful act? And 'meaningful' in what sense? In your own opinion or otherwise...?</div>
