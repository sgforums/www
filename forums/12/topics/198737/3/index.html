            <div class='col-md body'>You have to be really careful...it may still backfire if she questions your sincerity in becoming a Christian. It's much more ideal if your faith comes from within yourself.<br><br>Meanwhile, you may want to ask yourself/her a few questions:<br>Do you see facets which you've heard about God in her?<br>Does she inspire you to find out more about her religion?<br><br>She's already given her criterion, but exactly what makes her stay with you instead of ending it there and then?<br><br>Depending on how patient you are, you may elect to:<br><br>- terminate the relationship with her and free yourselves up to find mroe suitable partners, or<br>- keep the status quo and<br>(a) enjoy the relationship while it lasts<br>(b) see if something causes a U-turn in your unbelief or her ultimatum.<blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by technoboy:</div><div class="quote_body">I had a talk with my GF yesterday. Her mum just found out about about us together and objects to it since I am not a christian. She, too, told me that although she have feelings for me, this relationship will not last, main reason is also because I'm not a christian. She also said one of her BF criteria is that he must be a christian.<br><br>So I'm really feeling very depressed now. What should I do? I really don't know what to do as I am a strong believer of "seeing is believing". I also tried going to the church but I don't think it is suitable for me. Just feels wierd going there, especially when many strangers come and talk to me.<br><br>Really hope people here would be able to advise me on what to do! Should I even try going to the church again and make myself believe in it? (Although I know that at first the main reason for going will be because of her and not because of the religion itself). Or should I just continue to believe in my own things but have the risk of losing her?</div></blockquote></div>

If not, you have to break up.<br><br>If you tell her that you do not mind; then what that means is that, you do not mind her going to church and leaving you alone... or worse, she insist that you go with her.<br><br>If you tell her that you do not mind; then what that means is that, she will want your children to go to church with her... or worse, your children end up wondering why daddy is "like that one?"<br><br>So my advice to you is to find a girl who has the same mind as you in important matters.</div>
