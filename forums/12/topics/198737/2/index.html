Of course!, u know y? cos God is God and our minds r(duh) way simpler and stupider than god.

You and I are so in the  same position... just that my GF has a rather understanding mom, and my GF is also insistent that I have to convert to Christianity before marrying her. But I am perhaps in a better position cos her sister married a buddhist husband too.. very complicated event.. very awkward one too.. but at least my GF can look to that as a way out too. For your case.. if the relationship is not too deep yet.. let go when you still can. For me.. it's 4 years next month..  so I'll just have to let things happen on their own.</div>

Should I even try going to the church again and make myself believe in it? (Although I know that at first the main reason for going will be because of her and not because of the religion itself).

Women always complain the leopard never changes its spot (referring to their ah lau), but which Christian woman dare to proclaim "once an atheist, forever an atheist"?<br><br>Hey .. if you have any questions on Christianity, can always come EH.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I wouldn't suggest forcing yourself to go church. This is most unbiblical. Sure, you can find out more about Christianity, which I suggest you do. If you can match her "wavelength", then it makes things easier too.
