For those who opt for JCs, they have another two more years to consider about the question on what specialization they wanna choose...but people who opt for Polys need to make the decision now. Maybe you should take time and think about it. Are you more into Business? Finance? Engineering? Mass Com? IT? There's so many to choose from. I'm sure they provided a booklet...if not, you can go to the Poly's open house when they organise one. Need to really consider for yourself. It's your future, it's your life. If you choose wrongly, you may be wasting your time and money on those three years in Poly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

However, if you decide to go to the business areas, you had to pave out your route after your poly education, a business dip will giv u a career which is rather stagnant and you definitely hav to attain a Masters in future,mayb in SIM if u wanna succeed in your career, unless u wanna b an exective for the rest of your life, it's rather boring.  Therefore, I would suggest you opt for courses more related to the IT &amp; communication courses where it's in high demand even in economic crisis period, however, it's your choice, hope my advic comes in handy...<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>
