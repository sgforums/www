In any case, the main problem is that the TS is trying to keep his family in the dark about his smoking habits. All his friend has to do is to whisper to the police that the mastermind who ordered the contraband is the TS, the police will make enquiries. Of course the TS will be found innocent, but I don't think he wants to see policemen at his door.</div>

If your friend wants to make easy money and sell contraband tobacco, he should be prepared that heÂ’ll get caught sooner or later.<br><br>And coming from a legal stand point, there is no way your friend or the police can ever implicate you because the Â“transactionÂ” was never completed. The tobacco never reached your hands and there is insufficient evidence to prove that the tobacco your friend was caught with was indeed for you.<br><br>Even if you go to court, you could have insisted you knew nothing about the tobacco and youÂ’ll walk free. Even if you admitted you accepted your friendÂ’s offer to purchase contraband tobacco; in a worst case scenario, you will be let off with a stern warning as you have mentioned, your friend offered you and you accepted. He was not forced into doing it and it was he who approached you. Besides, the tobacco never reached your hands, so you were never in possession of contraband tobacco.<br><br>Asking your friend to buy or accepting your friendÂ’s offer is not against the law. Possession is. YouÂ’re clean hereÂ…<br><br>Since your friendÂ’s brother asked you to turn yourself in to the police, ask him for the name, number and division of the arresting officer. As mentioned above, theyÂ’ve got nothing on you and if your friend really can provide you a name and number, call the division directly and ask for the arresting officer. I am certain that your friendÂ’s brother will not be able to provide you with the details here.<br><br>Even if he did, you can always call the officer and tell him you knew nothing about it and inform the officer that your friendÂ’s brother is extorting your for money. Extortion is against the law.<br><br>If your friendÂ’s brother is unable to provide you with the details of the arresting officer, tell him that extortion is against the law and that you will not hesitate to file a police report against him.<br><br>Also, since your friend is required to pay a fine, he will certainly have to go to court. As your friendÂ’s brother for the details for the court appearance and turn up to ensure that your friend isnÂ’t cheating you of your money.<br><br>After all, you paid them all they asked for, if they don't provide you with the details of the court appearance, you can still threaten/file a police report against the both of them for cheating.<br><br>I smell a rat here!!!<br></div></blockquote>Well, if you are the one caught in posession of contraband tobacco , the first question the police will ask, who are the buyers.<br><br>Remember the most basic of all rules, if there are no buyers, there will be no sellers.<br><br>So do you really think the police will go lenient on those buyers ?<br><br>Do you think your advice to him is sound ?<br><br></div>

Excited over the chance to save money, I gave him 40 bucks for a carton. He promised to give it to me the next week.<br><br>So the cigs never arrived because he was not feeling well at that that time and when I had the chance to meet him, he said he was having some sort of 'problem' but wouldn't want to tell me what it was. It was only yesterday morning his brother called me on my HP to tell me that he was caught by the police with the cigarrettes. I was obviously shocked and panicked when he told me that his brother was fined $5000 for the offence. I met his family yesterday night and I agreed to fork out $200, for being involved indirectly.<br><br>When I thought everything was over, his brother called me again this morning (after giving me 25 missed calls the night before) and said that they managed to collect $4600. He said that since I was the one who ordered the carton (there were others who ordered the contraband cigs but they ordered packets), he asked me to fork out the $400 balance. Of course I was shocked when he said that and I tried to negotiate with him. After a heart-pain and head-breaking talk, he said that I need to pay only $100 while the rest will be forked out between him and my friend. I told him that I only had $50 in my wallet and that was what's left of my allowance before my pay, but he wouldn't take no for an answer. If by tomorrow night the fund is still insufficent, I will have to turn myself in to the Police.<br><br>So I had no choice but to use the $50 and find my own way to pay the balance. I tried to sell my X Box this morning at Cash Converters but the cd tray was spoilt so the guy wouldn't take it. I can't tell my family about this because they don't know that I smoke. And you can say its all ego, but I'm not the type who borrows money from people. But this time I guess I have to make it an exception and borrow from one of my friend. Guess I have to swallow my pride this time.<br><br>My advice to you people who smoke is that although contraband cigs tend to be cheaper, they are illegal and you might find yourself in hot soup like I do. To some, 5000 dollars might be peanuts but for me who takes home a meagre $350 per month, only God knows how I'm feeling right now. I've just learnt the hard way. Now I'm so worried that I might see myself behind bars.<br><br>I will stick to Singapore cigarrettes, thank you very much.</div></blockquote>http://sg.news.yahoo.com/061201/5/singapore244746.html<br><br>Three men arrested for supplying contraband cigarettes<br>ADVERTISEMENT<br><br>SINGAPORE: A Singaporean and two Indian nationals have been arrested for supplying contraband cigarettes to peddlers.<br>A total of 18,590 packets of duty-unpaid cigarettes worth about S$167,500 were seized on 28th November.<br><br>The duty and GST payable totalled S$139,240.<br><br>Customs officers found a total of 2,990 packets of duty-unpaid cigarettes in an apartment unit at Geylang Lorong 4 and 110 packets in its false ceiling.<br><br>Another 15,490 packets of duty-unpaid cigarettes were seized from a truck in Toa Payoh<br><br>The Singaporean was charged in Court on 29th November for customs offences.<br><br>The two Indian nationals were found to be immigration offenders and were therefore handed over to the police for follow-up action.<br><br><span class="large"><strong><span style="color: red;">Under the Customs Act, offenders can be jailed as well as fined for having in possession or dealing with contraband cigarettes.</span></strong></span><br><br>For a packet of duty-unpaid cigarettes purchased, the offence may be compounded for a minimum of S$200 or prosecuted in court. - CNA/so<br><br></div>

Upon analysis of the image taken of the container, ICA officers discovered that there was more than one type of goods in the container. This aroused our officersÂ’ suspicion and they decided to check the container physically. There was no inkjet printer greeting the officer when he opened the container. Instead, our officers found boxes of contraband cigarettes stacked inside the container. Some boxes containing porcelain bowls were also found in the container. All in all, a total of 11550 cartons of contraband cigarettes were found together with 7,200 pieces of porcelain bowls in the container.<br><br>The total amount of customs duties and Goods &amp; Services Tax involved is estimated to be $813,120 and $52,000 respectively. The case was referred to Singapore Customs for further investigation. Investigations are underway.<br><br>Singapore Customs warns that storing, possession, conveying or dealing with any contraband cigarettes are serious offences under the Customs Act. First time offenders can be fined up to a maximum of 20 times the amount of duty evaded. For the second and subsequent convictions, offenders can be jailed for up to 2 years, as well as being fined. The offenders also face further fines based on the amount of GST evaded. Members of the public with information on smuggling activities or evasion of customs duty or GST may contact Singapore Customs Intelligence hotline at 1800-2330000 or email to customs_intelligence@customs.gov.sg. <strong><span class="large"><span style="color: red;">Members of the public are advised against buying duty-unpaid cigarettes. Those caught buying or having in their possession duty-unpaid cigarettes stand to face severe penalties.</span></span></strong><br><br>As our countryÂ’s first line of defence against terrorist threats, ICA has a duty to ensure the security and safety of Singapore. We have tightened our security checks on passengers and vehicles at the checkpoints to prevent attempts to smuggle in undesirable persons, drugs, weapons, explosives and contraband items.<br><br></div>
