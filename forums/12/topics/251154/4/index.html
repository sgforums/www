            <div class='col-md body'>Hello everyone. I am back.<br><br>Wow, I've never had imagined that my post could have garnered a lot of interest, and I would like to thank everyone (particularly mhcampboy) for hearing me out.<br><br>Let me just share on how I felt when I got that phone call from his brother.<br><br>Obviously no one can imagine how scared I was when his brother called me to say that he was caught with the cigarrettes. One of the first things that his brother told me was, "someone has to be responsible". He even said that he wants to go over to my place to talk to my parents over what has happened. Of course I did not want my parents to know about all this; I'm an adult and I feel that I can handle the situation, and that was the reason why I agreed to meet his parents that night to sort things out.<br><br>It was out of fear and the feeling of guilt+taking resposibility that I agreed to pay part of the fine.<br><br>I know I am being stupid for not asking for any proof that he was arrested or fined but seriously with his family around VS myself, I knew I was at the losing end during that time.<br><br>Haiz, maybe I'm not matured to handle such situations.<br><br>I was really down the next day when his brother called me again to settle the balance. I was damn stupid not to be firm and refuse to pay. What for? I mean, I've already paid the day before out of goodwill and now he's taking advantage to a whole new level and because of the fear again that was in me, I relented.<br><br>I was so desperate to get the remaining $50 that I nearly sold my X-Box for a measly $65. Luckily the CD tray was spoilt. Or perhaps someone up there is knocking some sense over my head. So I turned to SGForums and by reading the responses I got, I blamed myself for being naive and submissive. So I'm not surprised that his brother actually took advantage of me.<br><br>I met my friend at night and discussed my problem to him. His advice was: if that $50 would settle things once and for all, then go ahead and pay. I had to swallow my pride and borrowed that amount from him. After paying my friend that outstanding debt, he thanked me and said that he would show me the letter from the Police, but since I'm on course and won't be seeing him till next week, I've yet to see the proof.<br><br>I know I should have been more firm or perhaps aggresive but what would you do when you are stuck in a sticky situation like mine? Fight all the way till court or just be submissive. Yes, the latter is a silly choice but at least I was never threatened with another phone call anymore and I got myself a good night's sleep after a rather lousy weekend.</div>
