            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Once a friend approached me and asked whether I am interested in buying contraband cigarrettes. Excited over the chance to save money, I gave him 40 bucks for a carton. He promised to give it to me the next week.<br><br>So the cigs never arrived because he was not feeling well at that that time and when I had the chance to meet him, he said he was having some sort of 'problem' but wouldn't want to tell me what it was. It was only yesterday morning his brother called me on my HP to tell me that he was caught by the police with the cigarrettes. I was obviously shocked and panicked when he told me that his brother was fined $5000 for the offence. I met his family yesterday night and I agreed to fork out $200, for being involved indirectly.<br><br>When I thought everything was over, his brother called me again this morning (after giving me 25 missed calls the night before) and said that they managed to collect $4600. He said that since I was the one who ordered the carton (there were others who ordered the contraband cigs but they ordered packets), he asked me to fork out the $400 balance. Of course I was shocked when he said that and I tried to negotiate with him. After a heart-pain and head-breaking talk, he said that I need to pay only $100 while the rest will be forked out between him and my friend. I told him that I only had $50 in my wallet and that was what's left of my allowance before my pay, but he wouldn't take no for an answer. If by tomorrow night the fund is still insufficent, I will have to turn myself in to the Police.<br><br>So I had no choice but to use the $50 and find my own way to pay the balance. I tried to sell my X Box this morning at Cash Converters but the cd tray was spoilt so the guy wouldn't take it. I can't tell my family about this because they don't know that I smoke. And you can say its all ego, but I'm not the type who borrows money from people. But this time I guess I have to make it an exception and borrow from one of my friend. Guess I have to swallow my pride this time.<br><br>My advice to you people who smoke is that although contraband cigs tend to be cheaper, they are illegal and you might find yourself in hot soup like I do. To some, 5000 dollars might be peanuts but for me who takes home a meagre $350 per month, only God knows how I'm feeling right now. I've just learnt the hard way. Now I'm so worried that I might see myself behind bars.<br><br>I will stick to Singapore cigarrettes, thank you very much.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>now this is what i call an Aunt Agony post. firstly your friend got into some shyt with the police, you are partly involved and next you realised you got conned. not trying to make a joke out of you or anything here.<br><br>do feel sorry for you to a certain extent but guess the real problem was his brother visiting your house telling your family about the incident if you didn't agree to fork out the money.<br><br>just pay finish the rest of the debt and get over and done with. you should know what to do after this incident. no doubt its hard to trust your friend again but guess the real crux lies with the brother and not your friend. true friends never backstab one another.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
