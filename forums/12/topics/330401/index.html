              <p>Good for you TS. You have seen the light, but do spare a thought for others as well. If you can see the effectiveness of being around superior people, maybe they wish to mix with you in order to get motivation?</p>

              <p>Didn't the bible teach you not to pass judgement on someone else? You were once lazy, but fortunately, have changed for the better. But instead of helping those who shadow your past, you regarded them as inferior.</p>
              <p>Sorry to say, but I think your character is more flawed than those you've regarded inferior to you.</p>
              <p>“<em>When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is wisdom</em>.” -Proverbs 11:2</p>
              <p>Your arrogance will most likely get you nowhere in life no matter how hard you try to improve. You clearly know that you're not the best either, as a true leader understands the consequences of self-gratification.</p>
