            <div class='col-md body'>are these questions for a survey or to help us decide the paths in life? the world changes and nothing in the next 15 - 20 years will remain the same, which ever path you choose is the one that should make you happy. socialology is probably what you are look for. Life does not have definite answers, you can learn from history, current affairs and technology to help you make an educated guess, other than that, its how you lead your life through your own values to attain happiness.</div>
