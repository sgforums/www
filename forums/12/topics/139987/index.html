Sadly, it creates another form of impression and image of you. YOU treated her well, thinking that the GOODNESS you have showered upon her is READ... i say again... READ as the road to chase her and she received the message as it is. No... she doesn't see it as this way; in her mind, she thought of you as a helpful guy who is willing to help her with her school work and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>NOT </strong></span>a suitor trying to chase her.<br><br>Helping her with her school work is a good gesture, especially so if she is someone you fancy, but to depend entirely on this?? What you are trying to do is like trying to buy some shampoo in Econ Minimart using Euro dollars.<br><br>Don't always RANT that girls are taking guys for granted <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>when guys market themselves are pure helpful.</strong></span> This is the case of a bad courtship marketing. You got to keep the correct constant message in the art of chase and not assume random messages. Even if you get rejected right in the face, at least you know you are walking in the right direction afterall and not like this... complete wrong route to Tuas.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

If you let her do it repeatedly to you, then you can't blame her. You are just letting yourself to be a fool for her.<br><br>If she really likes you, she will make an effort to fulfil her promise about your dates together. And I especially despise people who likes to "fly aeroplane", my ex did that a few times to me and true enough, we broke off a few months later because of lack of commitment on his part.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>She may just be treating you as her good buddy, someone who is always around when she needs help, and you fufill that. As words like "I like you" doesn't really mean anything. What she meant maybe, "I like you (as a friend)" We become friends with each other as we have a liking for each other unconsciously.<br><br>Maybe, you think too much.</div>
