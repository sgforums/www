            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>My story begins when i was in secondary 3. On the very 1st day of school, the moment i step into class. I was attracted by her Â¡Â°SiminÂ¡Â±. I didnÂ¡Â¯t know why. Maybe just a crush or maybe I really have fall in love with her. I never tell this to anyone. As i think itÂ¡Â¯s not really important. So for that entire year, no one knew that i like her. And that time i was a very timid boy. I wouldnÂ¡Â¯t dare to talk to the person i like. So, for the whole year, we talk less than 10 sentences. I didnÂ¡Â¯t care much about it also.<br><br>Then, the 2nd year. We are in secondary 4 and still in the same class. In this particular year, i found that i have fallen for her. But i still dare not tell anybody. Although a lot a lot rumours is spreading round saying that i like her. Because i feel that iÂ¡Â¯m not good enough for her. So, i just continue to Â¡Â°Â°ÂµÃ�ÂµÂ¡Â±. I tried all means to get close to her, let her feel my existence. But, the feeling she gave me is, Â¡Â°iÂ¡Â¯m nothingÂ¡Â± like that. Of course i will be sad. But i just think that maybe because i still dare not talk to her, thatÂ¡Â¯s why she never talk to me at all. But soon, I found out that the guy she love most is tommy, in the very first place, i was not at all sad as we really never talk a lot and i all the way feel that maybe is just 1 sided-love or maybe just a crush.<br><br>So, in a very very very short time. I can say to be never go think about her le. Even if i still love her. I stand no chances also. As i always heard from them or herself saying Â¡Â°tommy tommy tommyÂ¡Â±. Although i will feel uncomfortable. But what can i do? This kind of thing cant be forced. So, as time goes by. I slowly slowly slowly forget about her, i try not to think about last time i have once fallen in love with her. After that, I will still be hearing things about them. And i also know how close they two are in class or outside school.<br><br>End of secondary 4. She did not make it to secondary 5. It was quite sad. But i did not really feel anything as i think the feeling towards her have really depleted almost completely. Life still continues. In secondary 5, although i have fallen for another girl Â¡Â®Liang JueÂ¡Â¯. And it was really spreaded. A lot people know about it. But in the end, we were not together. Soon, secondary 5 was over le. During the holiday period when the result was not out yet, i was always out together with shinyun, lifang and of course simin. We went out very frequently. And this time i did talk quite a lot with her. And very soon, i found that the person i still love most is her. I dare not tell anyone yet. I want to get to know her more, and see if she is the right type of girl that i will really love a lot.<br><br>For the next few months, we have been spending time meeting and going out together. I really had a great time whenever she is there. Then one particular day in march, at toa payoh snooker zone. We were playing pool. And from the way and what she talks to me. I feel that she is trying to hint me. As in willing to accept me as her boyfriend. Of course i did tell her that i love her. And we are together. I was so happy. That night i was too happy till i canÂ¡Â¯t get to sleep. I didnÂ¡Â¯t expect to be with her. I always thought that it will always be Â¡Â°Â°ÂµÃ�ÂµÂ¡Â±. But, i didnÂ¡Â¯t expect us to end after 2 days. Early morning when i woke up and about to go bath then to work, i saw her sms. Saying that staying as friends might be better. This sms really spoil my mood for the entire day at work. Although she ask me not to hate her, and i did reply her that i wonÂ¡Â¯t be angry as it was not completely her fault too. I have to stand at her place and understand. Although i say i was not angry at all. But it was all lies. I was completely depressed and sad. For the whole day, i canÂ¡Â¯t even concentrate on my work. Tears just rolled down my cheek. After a few days, i tried very hard to try not to think of it.<br><br>From that time onwards, whenever she is out, i will try not to attend. But this didnÂ¡Â¯t last long. I feel that although i was really very heart broken. But we still can remain as friends. And i did it. We are still friends. And we are back to our normal days. Going out in groups of friends. But, who knows. I did not manage to forget my love for her. I find that i still love her a lot. And with some of my friendÂ¡Â¯s help, on my 18th birthday. She accepted me once again. But this time, we both are prepared. And i feel that we will be quite stable this time. I was really really very very happy on that day. And all my friends are also happy for me. Especially my mum.<br><br>Then, we had a lot happy times together. At 1st we are only going out. Just like stranger like that. People see us also wont know that we are couple. As i donÂ¡Â¯t even dare hold her hand. 1 night, on the way when i was seeing her home, I tried holding her hand, and i even use a very lame but special way which nobody has used it before to hold her hand. I hold her hand and i say Â¡Â°Ã•Ã¢Ã‘Ã¹Ã‹Ã£ÃŠÃ‡Â³Ã”Ã„Ã£ÂµÃ„Â¶Â¹Â¸Â¯Ã‚Ã°Â£Â¿Â¡Â± That night, i was really so happy. First time holding the hand of the girl i love deeply.<br><br>After that, we are getting closer and closer. We meet out frequently. One day, we went shopping at Suntec City. Then, sitting by the esplanade and chit chatting. Enjoying the breeze and the romantic view there. That is the time when we kisses each other on the cheek. I never expect myself to be so fortunate. I was really really very happy to be in love and be loved by her. I feel so blessed.<br>And, very soon, 1 day when she came up to my house. We were watching movie using my laptop. And we had our first kiss on the lips. We were both so shy. Her cheeks were so pinkish, so cute.<br><br>After those happy days together, we were very very close to each other. Seeing each other almost everyday. Many people were so Â¡Â°Ã�Ã›Ã„Â½Â¡Â± when they see us so loving. I was really very happy to see myself happily together with her. And i always think that we will stay together like this forever.<br><br>But, ever since the 3rd month anniversary, i have a feeling that her love for me is depleting. And i will always feel that she is always lying and keeping things from me. And we will have argument quite frequently. Although each argument wont last more than 1 day and we will be okay and fine. I used to tell her not to be so sensitive. But now, i donÂ¡Â¯t know if iÂ¡Â¯m sensitive or my 6th sense is correct. I really donÂ¡Â¯t wish to continue my life like this. I really hate it. I donÂ¡Â¯t know why i suddenly will become like that. My life everyday sucks. IÂ¡Â¯m always thinking about her. And i even think of doing checks on her by keep calling her and asking where she is all that. But i know itÂ¡Â¯s not right to do this. And i even imagine if 1 day i really found out that she lied to me. What will be my reaction be? And what am i going to do about it? I really donÂ¡Â¯t wish to think about this. ItÂ¡Â¯s really hurts my heart whenever i think of it.<br><br>Whenever i am working, i will tend to think of her and the happy days we spent together. When i saw couples coming or walking past the shops. I will tend to look at them. And i will feel very sad. My mind will tell me Â¡Â°how come other couples can be together happily without worries? while i am always encountering with a lot of problems.Â¡Â± But in the end, i will end up telling myself  Â¡Â°I will be happy together with simin too.Â¡Â±<br><br>I know i should not have this type of thinking. Thinking that she will lie to me or whatever. But i just canÂ¡Â¯t help thinking of it. As i really really love her a lot. I canÂ¡Â¯t imagine if 1 day if she were to leave me. What am i going to do ? What will i become like?<br><br>For the past weeks, i never sleep really well. Everyday during work i will feel headache. I feel that iÂ¡Â¯m really not a good boyfriend. Suspecting my own girlfriend. I really feel very bad. I want to say sorry to her. And now i really hope that i could get over it soon. I donÂ¡Â¯t wish to spoil my relationship with her. All i wanna tell her is Â¡Â°I really love her a lot a lot. I canÂ¡Â¯t do without you. I really hope that u can be frank with me in everything. And of course i will also be frank with you in everything. I promise! I will love you forever. Nothing can change my love for you.Â¡Â± And i hope the girl staying by my side for my entire lifetime is Â¡Â®YOUÂ¡Â¯. I really hope we will get over all this problems and remain as loving forever. I promise i will do anything for your sake. I wonÂ¡Â¯t do anything to break yr heart. And i promise i will love you, ONLY YOU.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Bro, tell you the truth I have difficulty reading your post. Mind summarising your problem? But I guess I roughly have an idea what your problem is about. Best thing is why don't you have a deep heart to heart chat with her? Tell her your feelings, what you expect out of the relationship, what the future holds for both of you and so on.. No use bottling up your feelings and losing sleep at nights thinking of the problems over and over again instead of thinking of the SOLUTIONS to your problems. Take a deep breath, relax, and tackle your problem with a stable mind..</div>

Understand that sometimes some things just can't be helped. If she choose to lie to you because she herself wants to, nothing much you can do to stop her probably...<br><br>The worse is when you're actually suspecting her and leading up the break up of things by your own hands...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just one word pal...<br>Learn to trust your gf and have confidence in yourself.<br><br>Don't always see other couples as no worries.<br>Every couple have their own problems and let me ask you..if you quarrel with your gf...will you still go out together and hold each other's hand and smile to each other like there's no problem going on?<br><br>For those you see outside holding hands and talking to each other sweetly, it just happen that there's nothing bad going on between them at that time. I don't think you'll have a chance to see them with problems unless they quarrel in public.<br><br>Don't be overly sensitive and suspecious. It often will lead to breakup if this behaviour is carried out too often. This is a common mistake made by a lot of couples who eventually couldn't take it anymore and choose to end the r/s. If you really love her, learn to trust.</div>
