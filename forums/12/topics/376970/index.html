              <p>Is there anyone in the group who you feel suitable and trust to handover the leadership to? If there is someone you can trust, you can consider handing over the post and do something you like. If not then just hold on to the post.</p>

              <p>apparently,it's my 'friend' who is trying to make me step down as he feels i'm not suitable.furthermore,most people in the group have been influenced against me.</p>
              <p>As for finding someone suitable,it may be a problem.</p>
              <p>Holding on to my post........to me it isn't the best choice,as it doesn't reflect well on me,and my officers will view it as me 'clinging' on to the role'</p>

              <p>Were they the same ppl who chose you for the role earlier?</p>
              <p>If they want you to step down, openly challenge them to find a successor that they can prove will be able to take over and lead well. If they can't then they have no reason to force you to step down and if they can, consider yourself whether or not that person is really suitable.</p>
              <p>What is your main piority? The outcome of the camp or your 'standing' among your fellow commitee? Consider that and make a decision what you should do.</p>

              <p>opportunities like this don't fall at ur feet everyday my friend.</p>
              <p>unless the committee who selected u, decide u're better off stepping down, imo it makes more sense to take up the leadership role. don't back down from it. don't step down from it.</p>
              <p>u may not fly or be super fucking good at it but hey these things are learned through experience. relax and have fun. if u must, focus on getting along with people and things will fall into place with a little planning on ur part. </p>
              <p>about ur friend and his influence, don't sweat the small stuff lah. u can't please the whole world anyway. if u've got to seek approval from every member of the camp, u'll be one hell of a tired man/woman/boy/girl. does what he "feel about ur suitability" hold any weight or any truth anyway?</p>
              <p>if it doesn't, then don't let it get to u. </p>
