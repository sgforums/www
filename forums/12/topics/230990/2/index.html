Hey you are still suffering form anxiety disorder!<br><br>Remember this and always think in this way whenever you are anxious:<br><br>Replace your "bad" anxious thoughts with good, positive or reasonable thoughts.<br><br>1. Some people in this world like me and some people do not like me. Most people do not care.<br><br>2. I will try to be friends with people that like me and I like. I will avoid people I do not like.<br><br>3. It is never as bad as I think, I suffer from anxiety disorder.<br><br>4. In fact it is better that the RO went out openly. Now I know who the idiots are and who the intelligent people are. Those that jump to conclusions about me simply from one RO are just idiots and I will avoid them as much as possible. Those that read the RO and are still my friends are my good friends.<br><br>5. When my good friends are no longer my good friends, I will just look for another friend. There are six billion people in this world. If I cannot find a good friend off-line, then I will find a good friend online.<br><br>6. Even if I have no friends, my family is still with me.<br><br>7. When people avoid me or treat me bad it is not because they read the RO and remembered the RO but is because:<br>a. I do not really know and I will not speculate<br>b. They are just rude, they are brought up that way<br>c. They don't like me, that is all, just as I don't like some people.<br>d. I am not their friend and they do not care about my feelings.<br>e. They do not know that they are hurting my feelings, they are just insensitive people. Sometimes I also hurt others without knowing, I am not a god, but it is no big deal... even if it is because they read the RO it is no big deal, the sun will still rise tomorrow. </div></blockquote>But i do not feel anxious physically.But just that i keep worrying about that issue.It is still anxiety ah?But worrying about this is normal right.Any normal guy whose name is being said related to psychological problem would be worried also.<br><br>Anyway most of my close friends do not know about my anxiety last time.Should i tell them the truth why i got pes E or just keep quiet and find an excuse?<br><br></div>

You need to "see reality" Right now in your head, you are very confused.<br><br>The good news is that, by coming to the forum and talking about it, that can help you! I can see how it might "cure" you if your problem does not become more serious.<br><br>The first think you do is not to trust your own "conclusions".<br><br>Asking questions is very very good. Like the questions you just asked:<br><br>It is still anxiety ah?<br>But worrying about this is normal right?<br>Should i tell them the truth why i got pes E or just keep quiet and find an excuse?<br><br>Drawing your own conclusions like this is bad: "Any normal guy whose name is being said related to psychological problem would be worried also."<br><br>I will now let others answer your questions. What you should observe is how many different answers there are and how different the answers are.</div>

Go take psychological review la.. doesn't mean u are <strong>still</strong> mentally ill. So what u was once mentally ill.. no big deal at all = )<br><br>I also have slight anxiety disorder. I think quite a lot of people also suffer from some sort of anxiety when facing a certain situation. Some don't feel comfortable infront of pple that they don't know or speaking infront of a large number of people etc. aiyea.. just that some don't know how to deal with it.<br><br>The more you are bothered by this matter, the more anxious you will feel. Honestly, just don't get so attached to the situation.<br><br>Probably, their behaviour change is due to other factors. Don't assume too much and end up getting urself some negative state of mind.</div>
