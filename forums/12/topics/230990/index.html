Hey you are still suffering form anxiety disorder!<br><br>Remember this and always think in this way whenever you are anxious:<br><br>Replace your "bad" anxious thoughts with good, positive or reasonable thoughts.<br><br>1. Some people in this world like me and some people do not like me. Most people do not care.<br><br>2. I will try to be friends with people that like me and I like. I will avoid people I do not like.<br><br>3. It is never as bad as I think, I suffer from anxiety disorder.<br><br>4. In fact it is better that the RO went out openly. Now I know who the idiots are and who the intelligent people are. Those that jump to conclusions about me simply from one RO are just idiots and I will avoid them as much as possible. Those that read the RO and are still my friends are my good friends.<br><br>5. When my good friends are no longer my good friends, I will just look for another friend. There are six billion people in this world. If I cannot find a good friend off-line, then I will find a good friend online.<br><br>6. Even if I have no friends, my family is still with me.<br><br>7. When people avoid me or treat me bad it is not because they read the RO and remembered the RO but is because:<br>a. I do not really know and I will not speculate<br>b. They are just rude, they are brought up that way<br>c. They don't like me, that is all, just as I don't like some people.<br>d. I am not their friend and they do not care about my feelings.<br>e. They do not know that they are hurting my feelings, they are just insensitive people. Sometimes I also hurt others without knowing, I am not a god, but it is no big deal... even if it is because they read the RO it is no big deal, the sun will still rise tomorrow. </div></blockquote>What is the difference between anxiety disorder and normal anxious?</div>
