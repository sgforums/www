            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">I have been doing treatments in yunnam haircare since 2002. While I get to hear bad and good views about Yunnam, I still continue my treatments in Yunnam as the treatments are effective to me. My advice to those who are considering whether to come to Yunnam treatment is that you need to consider whether spending more that 10-20k on your hair is worth it to you. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">For me, I had very sensitive scalp (reddish and itchy) so I decided to seek help from Yunnam. However, in the few years of treatment in Yunnam, I heard and talked to many customers. Many thought that they only need to do treatment for one year and they could stop all treatments in Yunnam. But in the end, they regret as they need spend more on their treatment to maintain their hair condition.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">Yunnam’s treatment and products are not cheap. Don't be fooled by their promotion of spending less than a hundred buck for one treatment. One treatment ranges from 150-250 bucks and their package comes in 20 treatments ( about 3000-5000bucks). In the first year of treatment, you are likely to spend more than 10k as you will need to come for treatment at least once a week. In the second year, slightly less than 10k as you will need to come for treatment less frequently ( once a month). </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">I have seen customers stopping due to high cost and returning yunnam to continue in a year time as their hair problem returned after ceasing their treatment in yunnam. In my opinion, Yunnam’s treatments are effective only in controlling hair problem. Once your hair problems are controlled, you need to constantly maintain to prevent your hair problem from returning to haunt you.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">So with the high cost and long-term treatment, my advice is whether you can afford the cost and whether it is worth it. I have seen university students who are still studying seeking help from yunnam and ended up paying installments ( few hundreds per month) to maintain their hair problem. I felt sorry for those students as the reason for them continuing is because they do not wish to see the thousands of dollars savings they spent, go to waste (their hair problem came back again).</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Calibri;">So to those students who are considering whether to seek help from yunnam, I would advice them to seek help from doctors or if they really want to seek help from yunnam, please consider the high cost required.</span></p>

              <p>one of the major causes in order are as follows:</p>
              <p>1) diet and lifestyle , Try to eat as more natural foods as possible , reduce oil and salt intake.  Stop smoking and alcohol, follow  a mediterranean diet, eat as much fruits and vegetables u can. drink distilled water</p>
              <p>2) Shamppos and hair conditioners. Do not use the shampoos with SLS</p>

              <p>first u must determine what kind of hair loss u have.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>2 types</strong></span></p>
              <p>1) if u have genetic hair loss problem, u cant do anything about it unless u willing to take a drug called Propecia , sometimes called finasteride. Its the only one proven to work for thiskind of hair loss. But it foesnt work for everyone. about 75 % have reported its useful. Sor some it stops the hair loss completely, for some it reduces the rate of hair loss, for some it gets worst and for some it doesnt work at all.</p>
              <p><em><span style="color: #ff0000;">Be aware that some people may experience serious negative side effects when using propecia such as loss of erection or sex drive. use with care. </span></em></p>
              <p>2) if u have hair loss, related to stress, sickness, weather or diet, it can be prevented.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Normally  hair loss shows a pattern  which the dermatologist will use to identify.</span></p>

              <p>one more factor is weather, humidity ect. singapore humidity is known to cause or trigger hair loss problems</p>

              <p>its because the weather may influence the growth cycle of the hair. Like:</p>

              <p>When 1/2 of your hair is growing, the other half is dropping. In hot countries, hair grows faster and drops faster too.</p>
              <p>when u go to a cold country it grows slower and drops slower and became synced with the drop cycle, So u have more hair growing at the same time than its dropping.</p>
              <p>but opposite is true too . for some people, cold weather may cause hair loss</p>

              <p>Here's my take so far. Before i go on, I suffered from hair loss due to many factors except genetic inheritance (as all my family members do not have this problem). So to keep things simple and hassle free, i always go to the barber and say get me a crew cut No .1 (the shortest in the range). The new hairstyle has made my life easier and less worrisome about not looking good with balding problem. A basic principle in life is there is always 2 side of the coin - one is the problem, the other is the solution.</p>
              <p>Anyway, i started having hair loss mainly due to stress and the lack of attention to proper diet. Of course, our weather made things worse. All in all, the multitude of factors added to the situation of mine - uncontrollable hair loss. I had wanted to visit Yun Nan or Beijing 101. However, deliberation over the issues and knowing of the fact that there is no free lunch in this world - i decided against it - to avoid the huge costs and also the hassle of never-ending treatment.</p>
              <p>I visited and consulted medical professionals (doctors and specialists - not Traditional Chinese Medicine (aka TCM)) and from a medical science perspective, there is no known permanent cure to hair loss. Medical prescribed as mentioned earlier in this thread will only help to maintain the situation in the best condition that our hormones are able to adjust. As such, medication will maintain the current state of hair loss condition and in some instances slightly improve (meaning more hair growth and less hair loss). However, the medication has to be sustained and cannot be stopped, else the condition will return. There are some known side effects and one of them is the loss of sexual drive (manz.. this is worse than hair loss, and is one reason why i choose not to opt for it.).</p>
              <p>So after gathering of facts and much consderations, I opted for a solution (flip side of the coin) by settling down comfortably with neater hair cut (how messy can it get with crew cut no.1) and without being hassled by maintenance. Anyway, i am almost 40. No big deal as life goes on and I think I am happier given that I have found the solution to my problem.</p>
              <p>Cheers, JY</p>

              <p><br>I stopped my treatment recently. The consultants in Yun nam are very good with their hard selling tactics. Depends on the kind of person you are. Stop going there anymore is one solution.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>They will definitely spend a lot of time persuading you, saying that since you spend so much money on you treatment you should not give up and say that you will suffer hair loss if you discontinue your treatment (no matter what treatment you are doing, they will say there is a possibility that you will suffer hair loss if you follow their recommendation). They will provide alternatives like paying your treatments package with interest free installments like 200 - 300 per appointment. Dont be fooled by the interest free installment, at the end of the day you still pay thousands just for your never ending maintainence treatments.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For me, I finished my remaining treatments and told them I don't want to continue due to high cost and poor customer services of Yunnam. I limit the time they have to persuade me. Just tell them 2 times you dont want to continue due to high cost politely first. At your third time saying your reason, say that's the last time you are repeating your reason, just walk out of the consulting room telling your consultant that you will wait for her at the counter.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>FYI, according to my years of treatments in yunnam, they will ask you to purchase new treatment package way before your current treatment package ends so they have enough time to persuade you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Alternatively, when your consultant asked you to go to consulting room to scan your scalp after your treatment (that's when they will ask you to purchase a new treatment package), just say you are rushing for time today and maybe next time (at your last appointment then tell them).</p>
