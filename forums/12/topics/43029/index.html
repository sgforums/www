U felt it, I SURE he felt it too... but he adamant in maintaining single... got a few possibilities... either he had oredi intentions of ending dis... or hes 1 type who stands to his decision regardless of da result... (such character &amp; point is hard to come by...) &amp; other reasons...<br><br>From wat I noe, wat my frens did... got a few... 1: either be frens wif him (more freedom &amp; can sae anything... no restrictions liao) 2: totally forget him (I tink its harder for gals to do so... gals more emotional...) 3: Give U 2 some time alone to cool down &amp; reflect on dis... (U tink worth it to carry on? or go to da next chapter of yr life?)<br><br>My comments here only give U some options... I m SURE there r other options... but in da END its YOU who decide wat to do... so choose wisely...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkblue;">The question on whether your ex would reconsider the decision, only he knows better than anyone of us here. You should be asking him this. I believe, he is not those wishy-washy type, since he can voice out that he enjoy singlehood now. This also clearly says that he is not afraid of hurting you by saying that. If you want to most true answer to your question, you should ask him directly. Never drag.<br><br>In the matter of break-up, if you feel the world has collapsed and you are no longer you because you have lost your beloved half, then it's a sign that you very much still want this relationship, perhaps it's not a too right in breaking up. On the other hand, if you feel a sense of real relief and can immediate feel that you are enjoying so much of the freedom and space, then a break-up is perhaps the right choice.<br><br>From here, it seems like your ex and you have a different feel on this after the break-up.<br><br>As to the other guy in your life, give you and him more time to realise each other. Don't commit the same mistake again, that's the most important.<br><br>God bless you. </span><br><br><span style="color: violet;">lavender_scent</span><br></div>
