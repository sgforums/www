Afterall, both of you have been in a BGR for 3 years...?<br><br>Like many have suggested here, when a relationship is OVER.. Chances ARE, you won't wanna bring them BACK without VERY VREY GOOD REASONS....<br><br>Likelihood of the guy just lusting after you is HIGH based on a SURFACE ANALYSIS.<br><br>Whatever has happened, it's BETTER that ya learn to let go for your situation.... Mistakes that you've made in your previous relationship? Try to LEARN from them and not commit them in your next relationship....?<br><br>Regards....</div>

So why waiting for your ex?  Likely, both of you will break off again for the same reason.  I know this is very frank (so sorry  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> )  but girls have only that few years of being young.  So don't waste your time.</div>
