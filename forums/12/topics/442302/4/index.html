              <p>My advise is whatever you do, whether you talk it out or not,
              hold the moral high ground so she has less claim from you in
              court.</p>
              <p>If you can prove her infidelity you pay nothing, but if she can
              prove yours it's another matter. And you know Singapore only awards

              All that one can do is hypothesize, anlayse, assume and advice or even offer suggrestions,- the reality is that TS (spouse included) can only relate to what is a reality for him/her. The below exemplfies the predicament of many (me not excluded):
              
              Two prisoners holed up in a cell were looking out into the nite sky ,the first one was delited at the moon's waxing and waning and yet knew he was looking thru the bars of the prison's window cell. the second only saw the bars on the window, get it?
              
              
              As long as TS is not willing to face his fears/???? and not willing to be self-honest - this albatross around his neck will never go away.

              I am of the opinion there is no â€™â€™solutionâ€™â€™ until self-honesty intuits and is communicated or expressed to each other in spite of the fears or ....
              
              Otherwise, a compromise of any sort without reconciling to oneâ€™s own psychological hangovers or emotional stasis is something that would not go away.
              
              The so-called affair â€˜problemâ€™â€™ is an excuse for what is transpiring now. What has been latent has surfaced, and it is anybodyâ€™s guess and to impose or foist onto them what one feels ought to be or should be is unwise? Never mind whether it is true or untrue, but it is opportune time for TS to see that he is facing what he is all about. One can apportion blame or rationalize - reality is what he has been always on the inside.
              
              All relationships look the same; all marriages look the same. It is merely on the surface! One has to grapple and juggle that which has been reduced to a thing (relationship/marriage) and be cognizant of the reality of two human beings who are not entities but either regressing or growing. Whatever it is there is no rite/wrong but the understanding and acknowledgement of eachâ€™â€™s uniqueness. Each's individuality makes all the difference. One has to understand that behind each persona, there is lots of prejudices, bigotry, fears anxieties that dominoes oneâ€™s being. That cannot be ignored and if it is unknown or denied/unacknowledged it is part of oneâ€™s daily psychological/emotional terrain, and understanding makes living easier. It is not necessarily in a relationship marriage, but awash every moment as long as one meets another person.
              
              Ps â€“ A baby is born and it not here for the parents nor for anyone but to be himself/herself and very sadly that is not. What is happening? Parent's attachment to the child is so unhealthy ane worse still misconstrued/interpreted as love.

              <p>So obvious you cannot see meh ? When a marriage lacks passion, it lacks life. Hence it is now dead.</p>
              <p>Few years ago..I know of a very sweet lady who had to divorce her husband due to years of neglect.</p>
              <p>Prior to her divorce,  she once said <strong>" I was never so lonely untill I married my husband".  </strong></p>
              <p>Back then, I didn't understand what she meant, how can a marriage be "lonely" ? Isn't it a union of two people to forge a life long companionship ? Today, I understand what a lot of spouse had to go through when one spouse no longer wants to work on their marriage.</p>
              <p>Complacency - Neglect.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When a marriage that young lacks passion.. it's bound for one destination- Separation.</p>
              <p>While divorce seems like a convenient choice. It will also cause a lot of problems for TS later. Divorce does end an undesirable relationship between adults. But it also means TS will need to relinguish certain rights, being only half parent of his young child.</p>
              <p>I suggest TS should try his best <strong>effort</strong> to woo his wife back.  Salvage the marriage, don't let pride let it go to ruin.</p>

              One feeling lonely has nothiing whatsoever to with marriage or relationship. It has to do with one wanting another to fulfil, one expecting another to live your life for u.
              It is nigh impossible and it is utterly stupid to think so. 
              
              Marriage promises made on a particular time or day, with the passage of time loses its meaning cos it simply is a fiction. The reality is that two persons evolve or regress.
              Marriages are not wrong, what is wrong is to try to find oneself in the marriage or try to exploit the other (or exploiting each other) and sooner there is nothing to exploit anymore.
              When one marries for financial security or social status - one would feel fulfilled but one has to understand that once fulfilled the marriage is no longer relevant. Marriage was a means to one's ends - once the ends are met, what more can one expect...
              
              Loneliness is a state of mind where one does not like oneself and does not like what he/she is faced with. In other words, one has a preconceived notions of what for eg, marriage should be or not be, love should be or  ... expand on it and one would realise it is simply incongruent to reality.
              
              Playing mind-games and rationalizing is cowardice. It is avoiding issues within oneself that were never reconciled.
              
              With regards to TS's predicament - one has so far only heard one side to the melodrama, what about the spouse''s ... It is so very easy to foist one's assumption, hypothesis and conclude. It is folly think that one has to a ''good'' spouse - there is no such thing - it is a fiction and hence the disappointment and misery.
              
              Like I mentioned before, TS has to be self-honest and as to whether the spouse understands, reacts, responds or ignores - there must a be ''reason'' and only TS can make himself available to ....

              <p>The problem here is feelings. For a person to be rebuffed by his spouse and then see her go off with another man, is to receive a strong emotional blow. It is not flattering, but it is natural to feel anger.</p>
              <p>She would also feel the same, if you ignore her and go off with a female colleague.</p>
              <p>Such acts are down right inconsiderate, and it is certainly disrespectful to the other.</p>
              <p>When there is no regard for another, the relationship is dead or half dead.</p>
              <p>Two options. revive the relationship, or terminate it.</p>
              <p>Either option require you both to work together.</p>

              <p>You can try watching for signs or setting traps. Eg.</p>
              <p>1. Remember facts when she tells you in passing. Match them with facts when she tells the same story at a later date.</p>
              <p>2. Sometimes you can ask about these facts, one at a time, gently and subtly.</p>
              <p>Watch her for signs that she is impatient to change the subject, is nervous or hostile, or being outright ridiculous in her explanation.</p>
              <p>3. Most drastic thing you can do is tell her "I know all about it (even when you don't know), go ahead and do it. I don't care as long as you don't outright humiliate me or I might react in a gave and unpredictable way".</p>
              <p>Of course, that will tip her off and she might start taking measures to protect her financial interests.</p>

              <p>Believe me, i tried.</p>
              <p>On our anniversary and her birthday this year, i booked for dinner at restaurants at MBS and Orchard respectively. On both occasions she didn't turn up, i waited for more than 1 hrs and in the end she told me she couldn't make it as she has to finish her work. By the time i went to bed around 1-2am, she was not even home yet.</p>
              <p>On my birthday this year which fell on a saturday, we were supposed to be celebrating at home. I had collected my birthday cake that we booked the day before. She came home late and went out barely half an hour later after singing the birthday songs with our daugther. I saw her left in her colleague's car waiting downstairs. She came home around 4am that night.</p>
              <p>I've suggested we go for family tour together a few times. Each time she told me she's busy. This year she has gone for tour without me once and gone for working trips 6 times to places like Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Hong Kong and Shanghai.</p>

              U can play the old record over and over again, man - the reality is that u suspect and whether u act or not act - matters will never be resolved until both of u are willing to decide what is necessary to ... 
              Stop trying and be and do what is necessary that may free u of this melodrama!
              Ur stance is of holding onto cancelled cheques and validating it , yes, only in your mind. Reality is it is no longer valid. Beware of the pitfalls of mind-games.
