            <div class='col-md body'><p>I am a girl and i disapprove this kind of woman. Actually most girls hate this kind of woman. <br>The thing about the young manager, I bet a few months down the road he will be bedding another woman be it married or not and it will be going on and on.<br><br>So let be teach you to do things to make life hard for your unfaithful cheating wife and the fling dick third party pervert manager. Well, it can be kind of hard to stomach this.<br><br>1) install pin hole cams in your room, video tape or take photos of them bedding each other. <br><br>2)Voice record the confrontation with the third party with your wife with you. Make sure to make it that both of them are the super bad guys and you are the poor victim. Best is you got the video of the guy hit you. Or your wife say bitchy stuff.<br><br>3) Compile all the dirty secrets and print out the pictures and stand at their company door and give it to every employee in their company. (Those less explict one in case you got into trouble) To ruin both of their reputation and either both or the manager will get sack and will be the topic of talks in the company.<br><br>4) I bet you have your wife friends and family contact number. or email. Send them all those pictures and videos. (those less explict one in case you got into trouble)<br><br>5) Treat your daughter better and keep her happy and safe. And tell her a little of whats happen. Children will bound to detect what is going on so it is better to let her know the truth now slowly rather than suddenly. and if she know what is going on and obviously she will chose to go with you when it is time for the custody case. and courts will take the child prefrence into account.<br><br>6) Don't lose your cool when dealing with them and remember to take evidence without them knowing and also, keep your evidence safe and don't do illegal stuff. and remember that woman will be at it again even if cries and say she won't do it again. Got once means got twice.<br>Same goes to man too.<br><br>Gambatte! Fighting! Jia You!<br><br></p></div>

              <p>i'm not so sure what make you think that i had neglected her and
              resented her in the past. It's not only this year that i tried to
              do my part to keep this marriage.</p>
              <p>Our 1st 2 years of marriage was wonderfull. We brought up our
              daugther together. We both played our parts as parents to take care
              of our daugther. She took 1 year off from work after the birth of
              our daughter. I woke up at nights to feed our baby.The 1st year was
              tough but it was also fun and rewarding. As my parents helps to
              take care of our daughter, we still have quite a lot of time to
              ourselves. During our 2nd year of marriage, which was last year, we
              managed  to go for tour together, just the 2 of us, 3 times
              alltogether, to Japan, Hawaii and Australia. We had great times. I
              don't earn much, but last year i still got her a LV bag for our
              anniversary and a Tag Huer watch for her birthday. This year Prada
              bag for her birthday and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jimmy Choo shoe</span> for our anniversary.
              Last year we went for movies together at least 8-9 times, strolling
              on the beach together many times and attended Zouk Out and Xmas
              parties together.</p>
              <p>Things started to changed gradually when she started work with
              this new company early this year. At first she even brought me to
              attend her company functions or outings. That's how i get to know
              many of her colleagues including that guy who i now suspect is
              having affair with her now. For the last few months, things got
              increasingly worse. She comes home later and later and spends more
              and more weekends not at home. Now she doesn't want to go out with
              me even when i asked her.</p>

              hers.</p>
              <p>I realized that since several months ago, she has been spending
              a lot of time with her male colleague. He sends her to work and
              send her home from work everyday. She comes home late every night
              and claims that she needs to work overtime. She also goes out and
              only comes home late at nights or early mornings on weekends.</p>
              <p>She spends little time at home and we seldom have time to talk.
              Her work also requires her to travel overseas frequently and i know
              that on many trips, she went with that colleague.</p>
              <p>I'm at lost now and not sure what to do. Can someone give me

              If u want custody of your daughter, remember that most lawyers are dishonest and promise u wht they know the courts cannot and wont deliver.
              To prove adultery, u need ample proof and evidence and moreover the court will decide whether she is unfit to be a mother or play the role of ....  All talk without irrefutable evidence amounts to nothing. U need to prove that she is unfit to be a mother, adultery is not good enough.
              All said and done, the court gives precedence to the child's welfare and well-being and the whimiscial ego-tripping ways of the two adults are discounted!

              <p>And also, our women charter will alway fight for our rights, and most court will go for the mother if she is able to work and bring her up, so you may be fighting a losing case in the custody of your daughter.</p>
              <p>Like one of my aunty, she chopped her husband lots of money, then go flirt and enjoy herself, got a son, the husband decided to divorce her and get top lawyer to fight for the custody of the son, he said it is a 50- 50% chance, but you know what the judge told him in the first hearing "Mr Kenny Soh, can the court have your evidences in claiming your right to the custody" This sentence alone tells you that even before the court proceed, the son is with the mother, the father job is to get lawyers and fight all the way to get it back.</p>

              Ts made a big mistake and that was of coming out in the open with the spouse and now it is kinda of too late to prove adultery. He could have hired a PI and file for divorce on the gounds of adultery and being a irresponsible parent. That would allow for leveragingng and impact the outcome of the proceedings. 
              
              Now, it does not feel so - yes,Mancha, they would listen, hear and think but this being singapore, kiasuism is awash and the judges would always stick to the rule of law and most probably fall back on precedents. Nothing that is uttered verbally is going to be considered unless incontrovertible proof and irrefutable from any angle is furnished and only then would such evidence be accepted by the courts.
              
              
              Only judges of the High Court or Appelate judges risk creating law anew!
              
              I had an acquaintance and he did his homework - got the PI and sprang a surprise during the preliminary hearing(s), the spuouse relented and gave up sole custody. Before that she was adamant and wanted sole custody.
