              <p>I'm a married man with a 3 years old daughter. </p>
              <p>I suspect that my wife is having an affair with a colleague of hers.</p>
              <p>I realized that since several months ago, she has been spending a lot of time with her male colleague. He sends her to work and send her home from work everyday. She comes home late every night and claims that she needs to work overtime. She also goes out and only comes home late at nights or early mornings on weekends.</p>
              <p>She spends little time at home and we seldom have time to talk. Her work also requires her to travel overseas frequently and i know that on many trips, she went with that colleague.</p>
              <p>I'm at lost now and not sure what to do. Can someone give me some opinion or advice.</p>

              <p>But seriously, if you don't trust her, then you will assume her having an affair, which will in turn sour the r/s, which in return will make her want to have an affair for real to cope with the emotional issues at home...</p>
              <p>If she really did have an affair, then first question is, have you had an affair before in your life? no? seriously? if you never had an affair before, then you can talk to her and progress from there (but you no affair before? swear to god?)... if you had an affair before while still in a r/s, then you can understand where she's coming from.</p>
              <p>I think it's better not to assume. talk to her and let her know your concerns NOW.</p>

              <p>I realized that since several months ago, she has been spending a lot of time with her male colleague. He sends her to work and send her home from work everyday. She comes home late every night and claims that she needs to work overtime. She also goes out and only comes home late at nights or early mornings on weekends.</p>
              <p>She spends little time at home and we seldom have time to talk. Her work also requires her to travel overseas frequently and i know that on many trips, she went with that colleague.</p>
              <p>I'm at lost now and not sure what to do. Can someone give me some opinion or advice.</p>

              <p>was this a sudden change? did she always sms or at least call or email home during her work, over time, be it in singapore or overseas? if she don;t even bother to sms or send constant emails or call to let the family know she is okay then something is seriously wrong. my colleagues all you see venv during work they can spend a minute or two to text home - really it takes lots of discipline. its not like your family got no children now have a dotter aleady she should take it more seriously. anyway its your side of the story we really look forward to your wife's side of the story</p>

              <p>Well with woman, they always cheat. You have a kid and life at home is boring. Quite normal for woman to look for fun else where. Hope you where bright enough for a pre-nup. No that wouldn't have because if you were so bright, she wouldn't dare to!</p>

              Express what u feel, ur fears and be polite and most of all accept what may not resonate with u. 
              If it is true that it is transpiring as u suspect it to be - take it from there.
              
              In my opinion, she is wrong as long as stays in the marriage and does what she does- cos it is disrespectul of that commitment, and of course, herself and u and .... she may choose what she wants to do not do, she has to make a decision to leave or not leave. The same with u.  
              
              Lest is miscontrued, i am not encouraging a split, I am only suggesting that one be clear and decide for what is good and not what is good for u or for her. What is the advice u would give to a friend or faced with a predicament like yours now - do the same!
