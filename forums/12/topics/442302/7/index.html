              <p>You are like any foolish prideful male forumers here. Thinking a
              few Gucci/LV bags and Jimmy Choo shoes or tours to exotic places
              are all it takes to make your wife happy. No, women are more
              complicated than that !</p>
              <p>Think about this, if she is truly set on leaving you, she don't
              need your permission to divorce you. She can go to the lawyer
              office herself and seek a divorce on her own.</p>
              <p>In fact, the sooner she seeks a divorce, the sooner she will be
              released from it all. Why has she not done it yet ?</p>
              <p>In her heart.. she has doubts. Because she know the next ship
              she jumps onto, may turn out a sinking ship too.</p>
              <p>To salvage this ship, you need to be a better man for her. If
              she sees the change in you and see a future.. she will stay. We all
              know.. the pasture is not always greener on the other side.</p>
              <p>The only way it can be greener.. is when the current one is as
              lousy as a pig sty.</p>
              <p>Think about the issues she had been unhappy with in the past,
              figure out how to resolve the problems, not sweep it under the
              carpet.</p>
              <p>Show genuine repentence.. there is still hope.</p>
              <p>She is punishing you right now. Just stay calm. The more angry
              and unhappy you are.. the more vengence she feels.</p>
              <p>The whole marriage had been all about you.. it's time you let
              her take the reign.</p>

              <p>Do not try to make her happy ,give her space etc.She will be back of course after she had all the fun and one day he will leave her(she's a cheap slut to him for fun now :) She will be  back when he leaves her.</p>

              <p>Leave that slut with the guy she is with,divorce don't give her a cent, bang some chicks(this will make life more fun and in perspective) then think of future.

Seems like being a cuckold is a natural part of u!may be she trained you well to be a sissy. reach your hands down to between your legs,hold your balls.Yes your balls, you are the man. And don't ever listen to woman for relationship advice.</p>

              <p>If now you let her have her way, she will file for divorce take the property/money you made working hard when she was fucking than guy. There are many woman in world who will appreciate you mroe than this slut,may be not in SG!</p>

              <p><br>yea i totally agree with you. but the point is that while most of us are offering advices to TS and telling him what to act, some others are not. I do not see how this whole issue of TS equates to a total fault of TS as proclaim by the minority. And while us being 'prideful" guys are trying to help TS, I see some "prideful" species of the other sex trying to do otherwise. Neither do i see how in the issue of any r/s problem, the male has to play the bad role. Society has changed, members of the opposite sex can do the bad role also.</p>
              <p>As i've said, lots of advice already given, TS just needs to act. But i guess for him, this is 1 big and hard step. Talking is all easier than doing it. I can feel the attachement he has for his wife but not all can.</p>

              <p>My marriage is not perfect, we take the good with the bad. Neither of us are perfect. What's important is we are not afraid to admit our faults and do our best to be a better person.</p>

              <p>A woman always seeks a good husband, is the woman good enough for the husband? Some things works 2 ways. No prior evidence to say that TS needs a ass whoop from his wife. You based your assumption on faults of the TS... why not consider the faults of the wife herself? 2 sides to a coin... if thing were that bad, why do a silent rebel on TS while when things were getting bad, TS tried to get into a talk with her.</p>

              <p><br> yea i totally agree with you. but the point is that while most of
              us are offering advices to TS and telling him what to act, some
              others are not. I do not see how this whole issue of TS equates to
              a total fault of TS as proclaim by the minority. And while us being
              'prideful" guys are trying to help TS, I see some "prideful"
              species of the other sex trying to do otherwise. Neither do i see
              how in the issue of any r/s problem, the male has to play the bad
              role. Society has changed, members of the opposite sex can do the
              bad role also.</p>
              <p>As i've said, lots of advice already given, TS just needs to
              act. But i guess for him, this is 1 big and hard step. Talking is
              all easier than doing it. I can feel the attachement he has for his
              wife but not all can.</p>

              <p><br>Just in case you have left out or you may not know. It is a 4 dimensional situation that is happening right now. Not only it involve a 3 dimensional object, it also involve the 4 dimension, which is the time, it takes for such occurance to take place.</p>
              <p>Timespace is a very complicated subject which I do not wish to explain here in the forum.</p>
              <p>If you haven't noticed yet, TS mentioned that it all start to happen around the beginning of this year which she went to a new company. Everything was great prior to that. That is the truth.</p>
