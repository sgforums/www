              <p><br>She's a married woman and should know where to draw the line. If any ah mao ah gao come and woo her, do you thing any married woman will give in? Surely there is some communication issues between the couples.</p>
              <p>Based on my observation, the new guy colleague is wooing her and coated her with tons of sugary promises. Eventually, she gave bought the guy's story. You know, if she really cherish the marriage, she should properly communicate with TS. If she did tried to communicate with TS about a year ago, then it's TS ommision of information.</p>
              <p>There must be something wrong with TS's wife which led to this situation now. Maybe on one ocassion, the wife really did something wrong.... and she is currently being blackmailed by the guy who keep threatening her that she will expose the scandal?</p>
              <p>Anyway, enough of the speculation, it will only add to TS's grief.</p>
              <p>This is for you bro, take some time to read it.</p>

              <p>Glad you brought this up.</p>
              <p>Is she also not in the marriage together, is the daugher not her's too?</p>
              <p>There is also the issue on the part of the male colleague. Why is he not doing anything to stay  out of this troubled marriage. He is not even helping to save the situation. In fact he is compounding it.</p>
              <p>TS will only get back his wife, when the male colleague dump her. Looks like this is not going to happen.</p>
              <p>He is in it together with the TS wife. The wife has found a new love.</p>
              <p>Its only a matter of time, only which party will initiate action first.</p>
              <p>Also what sort of action.</p>
              <p>What TS needs to do is come to a decision.</p>
              <p>A decision is <strong>a statement of intent</strong> plus the<strong> action</strong> for it.</p>
              <p>Hopefully the action is a legal one.</p>

              Has it ever occurred that behind the veil of roles and ... both TS and his spouse have got this thing going on - tacit war of attrition! I m merely assuming but it feels so.
              No one for sure knows (me not excluded) that categorically if TS spouse is having an affair - ti could be anything and that anything can ONLY be resolved if the both communicate.
              It seems not to be happening n moreover, irrefutably is that TS stance belies fear!
              As to what his fears are no one can for sure put a finger on it - only he knows and only being self-honest (not to be confused with honesty) will he come to realise and if possible articulate it to his spouse (if need be) and move on or take measures to unravel the mystery of his spouse's ....

              <p>Again, please do not blame it on us gals, affair takes 2 to clap, you got to blame the guy, who are mostly married too, if he can think well, then he would not had started an affair with a married woman, knowing that it will destroy her family and hurt the childrens in some way.</p>
              <p>But frankly, to tell all of you, affair is actually very fun, it keeps both male and female going, secretive is exciting and privacy is longing. He who betrayed his wife and end up with other people wife is perhap something new and nice, and with today wifes spending more time in office than in home, they are expose to more men, men who are much caring, much higher is social status, much richer, much nice looking or perhap better sex than their husband, there is nothing much to loose. And when both go into affair cheating their spouses, it makes it more loving as both are on a common cause</p>

              <p>i had a talk with my wife last night. It was not a pleasant talk. After i persistently asked, she finally admitted she is having affair with her colleague and it involves sex.

              <p>I asked her why she do this and what i have done wrong to make her do this. She just said sorry to me and that it wasn't my fault. It's just that she had fallen deeply in love with that guy and willing to give up everything just to be with him. She cried too.</p>
              <p>I was extremely sad. I was crushed.  The whole world seems to be tumbling down on me.

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> It must be devastating to have the whole truth thrown into your face. Though having a HTHT was indeed effective in reducing your suspicion to a conclusion, but still, it must be absolutely heartbreaking and painful when the blow was delivered. <br><br>The presence of a third party is concrete; though surely there would be a combination of both push &amp; pull factor/s that helped to generate this unfortunate outcome, I must say that nobody is absolutely the cause. Also, when she appears to be certain that she wants to be with the other man, your stated option was helpless acquiescence. I feel you: having to let your wife go when you discovered that this love wasn't as genuine, almost like false gold with strips of the imitation material flaking out loosely like some cheap goods.    <br><br>The practical component of the divorce will flow in much later; when you move into proceeding, custody and the affidavit of assets and means. However, that does not always make us feel better emotionally. Right now, I hope you could gather some good friends to share with them about your situation so that you have somebody around you for support at least. Or if you feel that you would like individual counselling to sort yourself out, you could PM me and I could direct (refer) you to the necessary resources. (Don't worry it wouldn't be me and I do not need to know your identity at all).    <br><br>Please take good care of yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"><br><br>Cheers<br></p>

              Simply put, one has an idea of what love is and what it should be &amp; add other conditionings from tv, society, parents, friends ---  slowlsy it becomes a mental image in one's mind - it is carried within.
               The mental image of love or ... is superimposed on ....and the moment that image in one's mind concurs with eg, of  what a  tall person, of what a sharp nose, or ... what a man/woman ... should be n is found in another person -  the phenomenon of falling in love happens! 
              It is not reality but a fiction and hence the falling out or the end of this ''love'' cos one was actually living a fiction all along

              <p>You can let it all go to the rubbish dump, or you can try to see if the marriage is salvageable. Since it's easier now that you know what to do to fix it.</p>

              <p>Leave the country for a while, let her take care of your daughter for an extended period of time. Let her know what life is like to be on her own without you.</p>

              <p>Right now, you are being too available for her (and him) .. a convenience. So disappear for a while so that reality can set in for her.</p>
              <p>If you have to, move into your parents' home after you come back from overseas. Tell her you need some space and time to settle your feelings and think about a future without her.</p>
              <p>When you are away, remind her that you still love her, still wants to retire with her. Still appreciate her as a partner and mother of your child. Make her feel wanted again.</p>
              <p>Your wife is now still high from the attention given by that guy. That high will eventually fade... perhaps she will realise how good she had it with you. ( if it is any good at all)</p>
