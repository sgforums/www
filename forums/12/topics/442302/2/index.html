              <p>If it is true....it may be too late....</p>
              <p>It should have been stopped when there were some unhealthy signs.....like....why is her male colleague fetching her every day....I mean once in a while it is understandable especially if it is on the same way.....but every day....and just the 2 of them......I think this is your fault also....you didnt wake up and realize there were some wrong things happening.</p>
              <p>Hmm...</p>
              <p>Why dont you talk to her.</p>
              <p>At first try not to "accuse" her of "definitely" having an affair....because doing this, you will make her become defensive and put her in a cornered position.....Try to do this....say you have a "concern"......feel "uncomfortable" and feel "insecure"...</p>
              <p>So try to do that and communicate to her in that way.</p>
              <p>For her if you talk in this way gently and wisely........it should make her think and reflect...and then she would be having internal considerations on her own......do I want to save my marriage to my husband or not....what should I do because my husband is starting to become unhappy and notice something.....</p>
              <p>So try to do that.</p>

              <p>I'm still thinking of how to confront her like some of you have suggested, As for hiring of PI, i think it's a bit too much right? But i'm taking it into consideration.</p>
              <p>She told me last night that she's going on a working trip to Penang tomorrow. I asked her who's going with her. She said a few colleagues. But i noticed she didn't look at my face when answering that and her answer didn't sound very convincing.</p>

              <p>You need to look her in the eye and say this to her directly in a calm manner.</p>

But probably not accuse her of anything yet else she gets all defensive and nth good comes out of the conversation. If it really comes to a point where u are really highly suspicious, probably time to hire a PI. But i wld rather you have a talk with her first, calmly express your concerns and see how it goes from there.</p></div>

              <p>I am sad to hear your plight. I can imagine the pain and hurt to be betrayed by someone you love. The world is full of unfaithful people who are not satisfied with their spouse.</p>
              <p>In my companies I worked for, I had also seen such colleaugues.</p>
              <p>In the first case, this Malaysian is a sweet and understanding gal who has a Malaysian boyfriend, and their wedding is around the corner. I liked her alot too, but when I knew she was attached, I backed off. Especially when others told me not to waste my time as she is super faithful. But I had seen her together with a China guy very often at work. During a company holiday trip to Genting, both of them often disappeared instead of hanging out with us. When we returned, after a few days later, I when to the back of the company for a snake break and caught them kissing. Although she is not my girlfriend, but I still felt so hurt. Firstly because she previously rejected me and not this Chinese pig. I cannot even compare to  him? And 2nd is that everyone thought she is so faithful but yet this happened.She made me lost faith in relationships.</p>
              <p>The second case is in the company I work for now. This 27 year old Shanghai male colleague is married but always screw around. When another married Shanghai female colleague (abit pretty) joined, they clicked immediately. They went for business trips together and its obvious what will happen.  Many other colleagues said they saw them cuddling in MRT and kissing in quiet places in the company. I feel so sorry for their spouses. I so wish this will not happen to me.</p>
              <p>To TS, I hope you will not take it too hard if she is really screwing the guy. Be strong, for your dotta!</p>

              <p>You coulda be the one to screw her. However, it is wise not to shit where you eat.</p>
              <p>If things go bad.. those two can balek kampong and disappear into their forest and mountains. You being a local has to worry about sustaining your reputation here.</p>
              <p>Go overseas, like these Malaysian and China people..and  the world is your playground. Until your past come back one day to bite you in the butt.</p>
              <p>Do unto others what others do unto you. I'd call up their spouse and gf/bf and tell them the truth.</p>
              <p>When people understand they cannot get away with this kind of behavior they will naturally stop.</p>

              <p>anyway as women modern ones i know they can be more liberal but back to basics no matter what the women charter protects the basic vertue of a wife should still be adhere. occasional business work trips overnite or late is fine. its not like you running some brothel business but every now is like that, and don;t at least let the husband why ind etail really is not only raising people suspicion also signalling a breakdown initiation. i still feel hire PI is better. otherwise teel it straiht to the face. don;t tell me women are snow white so delivate lah, men, if he uphild integrity and remains faithful to the wife, expects teh same no less respect friom the wife.</p>

              <p><br>silly girl like you really no brain - that's why i say need an old uncle like me to marry and guide you along. tell that guy to get a PI first. with evidence that the wife is itchy and made him an infantry man, with evidence go court maybe if the DNA test also found the dotter not hers he cuckoo-ed, then no need to pay her all the what wifey fees this and that and no need to take care of someone else bastard's sons or dotters.</p>
              <p>see the wife true colors. if it is not true that she having affair just some colleague guys hitting hard on her then its itme for the truth to light and the husband go on offensive. the evidence can take that colleague to court - knowing people got husband still wnat to makan - no need angel's girls, my thugs can help you handle also. i summon them from oblivion or skyrim <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Other than the matter about how to prod and ask her........I believe you need to re-evaluate your marriage too.......</p>

              <p>Try to go for family outing on weekends......and sometimes just the 2 of you (minus the daughter)</p>
