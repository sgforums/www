              </p><p class="MsoNormal">My wife had left for Penang yesterday. That male colleague
              of hers came to drive her to the airport. I’m not sure whether he went along.
              She will be there till Friday.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I haven’t got the opportunity to talk to her. I tried on
              Monday night, but she wasn’t paying any attention to my questions as she was
              busy texting on her handphone.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Nowadays , we hardly have much time to talk properly. She
              comes home late every night saying that she needs to work overtime. On
              weekends, she also goes out the whole day after breakfast at home and comes
              home around 9-10pm.  She said her work is
              very stressful and she needs to go out to chill out and relax a bit.  But what about me? I don’t need to relax? How
              about our daughter? Where is her mommy?</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Last month, during the Deepavali period, she went to Taiwan
              for holidays from 22/10/11 to 28/10/11. She claimed that she went with “friends”.  Until now I haven’t seen her holiday photos.
              She said that photos were taken using her friends’ camera!! She carries IPhone
              and brought a Nikon digital SLR there!!</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">It never crossed my mind to have DNA test to check whether I’m
              the biological father of my daughter. I never doubted because I believed that I
              was the only men in her life. We were together for 3 years before we got
              married and she was 3 month pregnant when we went to ROM to register our
              marriage and 5 months pregnant during Chinese wedding dinner. I love my
              daughter very much, and I have no intention to go for DNA test.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I’m feeling very miserable now thinking that she might be
              with that guy in Penang now. I’m worried about hiring PI too. What if it turns
              out that she is not having any affair at all? She’ll be very angry to find out I
              hire a PI to spy on her right? That will make matter worse right?</p>

              U have a choice to ask her and if she persists in her evasiveness hire a PI and that mite resolve yuur suspicions and settle this emotional morass that you seem to be wallowing in. PI are very professional and they would not divulge nor disclose to anyone except to u.
              
              
              As for your daughter, u are being wise. hopefully u love her out of love lah, not neediness, not that she gives u meaning. Being self-honest does make a differnce to one's daily living. 
              
              Some idiots here are so dense, that they are askijng u to for DNA test. Neurosis cannot get better than this.
              
              
              PS  - Intuitively it does feel that your spouse has chosen to remain incommunicado over some sensitive n possibnly explosive issues.

              <p>I'm a married man with a 3 years old daughter. </p>
              <p>I suspect that my wife is having an affair with a colleague of hers.</p>
              <p>I realized that since several months ago, she has been spending a lot of time with her male colleague. He sends her to work and send her home from work everyday. She comes home late every night and claims that she needs to work overtime. She also goes out and only comes home late at nights or early mornings on weekends.</p>
              <p>She spends little time at home and we seldom have time to talk. Her work also requires her to travel overseas frequently and i know that on many trips, she went with that colleague.</p>
              <p>I'm at lost now and not sure what to do. Can someone give me some opinion or advice.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> It must be hurting when you have strong grounds to suspect your wife having an affair with another man, especially when the logical flow of events reinforces the notion of cheating. There are many ways to know if she is having an affair, however, somehow that is still not my primary concern. Be prepared when you decide to pursuit what you probably felt as 'the truth' behind the scene' because what I am concerned about is the aftermath.</p>
              <p>What will happen after you corroborates your suspicion with facts?</p>
              <p>Structurally, the relationship has all factors pointing towards some dire breakdown; nonexistent communication and apt towards an individualistic lifestyle. In fact, the start of the marriage was somewhat 'coerced' - with greater consideration towards the unborn child before marriage.</p>
              <p>You may be ready psychologically and emotionally for your marriage, but this remains a question for her. And albeit she may be ready for the marriage, she might not be ready to be a mother and lead a family-centric life.</p>
              <p>Agreeing to be married does not answer this question; just like pregnancy does not automatic make mothers out of women. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
              <p>***</p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> You are entitled to know the truth that veils behind her seemingly 'busy' lifestyle - but before you go about confronting her and ask honestly (or hire a PI); you might want to assume the worst scenario (which is yes she is cheating on you) and reflect on why this marriage has gone wayward because it would help you to craft out the content to engage a HTHT with her to see if this marriage is still salvageable.</p>
              <p>P.S: A perfectly satisfied woman cannot be seduced; surely there is some unmet needs that is being fulfilled by the other guy. Knowing/confirming that she is seeing/being close (physically or emotionally) to another guy does not provide you the insights of what went wrong with your marriage. </p>
              <p>You know that you have not been talking; make that happen and see how it goes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
              <p>Cheers </p>

              <p>what has my cuckoo bird anything to do with this topic. no doubt we have to be careful. if the husband skill no good the wife should let him know the problem. so that the husband can coordinate and take it slow to please the wife. just dismissing the husband as not good in bed after get married and have kids already really is not a good excuse to make the husband an infantry man outside you know <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> It must be hurting when you have strong
              grounds to suspect your wife having an affair with
              another man, especially when the logical flow of events
              reinforces the notion of cheating. There are many ways to know if
              she is having an affair, however, somehow that is still not my
              primary concern. Be prepared when you decide to pursuit what you
              probably felt as 'the truth' behind the
              scene' because what I am concerned about is the
              aftermath.</p>
              <p>What will happen after you corroborates your suspicion
              with facts?</p>
              <p>Structurally, the relationship has all factors pointing
              towards some dire breakdown; nonexistent communication
              and apt towards an individualistic
              lifestyle. In fact, the start of the marriage was
              somewhat 'coerced' - with greater consideration towards
              the unborn child before marriage.</p>
              <p>You may be ready psychologically and emotionally for
              your marriage, but this remains a question for
              her. And albeit she may be ready for
              the marriage, she might not be ready to be a mother
              and lead a family-centric life.</p>
              <p>Agreeing to be married does not answer this question; just
              like pregnancy does not automatic make mothers out of women.
              <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
              <p>***</p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> You are entitled to know the truth that
              veils behind her seemingly 'busy' lifestyle - but before you go
              about confronting her and ask honestly (or hire a PI);
              you might want to assume the worst scenario (which
              is yes she is cheating on you) and reflect on why this
              marriage has gone wayward because it would help you
              to craft out the content to engage a HTHT with her to see
              if this marriage is still salvageable.</p>
              <p>P.S: A perfectly satisfied woman cannot be seduced; surely there
              is some unmet needs that is being fulfilled by the other guy.
              Knowing/confirming that she is seeing/being close (physically or
              emotionally) to another guy does not provide you
              the insights of what went wrong with your
              marriage. </p>
              <p>You know that you have not been talking; make that happen and
              see how it goes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>Yeah well.....the male colleague again fetching your wife to the airport........is not right man........that is too routine and is too suspicious already.....that is not normal....</p>
              <p>I dont know what other advice I can suggest to you....but from what you described I think if I were you I would suspect something is wrong too.</p>
              <p>Just from the enthusiastic driving and fetching, is not natural and is fishy....</p>
              <p>Maybe you should indeed engage a PI.</p>
              <p>First try to talk to her first and prod gently. See whats the result of that.</p>
              <p>Actually she shouldnt be ignoring you when you talk to her.......next time if she ignores you again, raise your voice a little bit and go closer to her. Otherwise she wouldnt realize and wouldnt notice anything, and take you for granted. You have to do something to change her.</p>
              <p>Actually this is something you have to decide yourself too. If you yourself cannot change, still be passive and accepting, then you cant totally blame your wife, can you ? Because you are giving the feedback that it is acceptable. So you need to decide what you want to do to save your marriage.</p>

              <p>This marriage is done. Kaput, finished.</p>
              <p>No love within, just an empty shell.</p>
              <p>A show, facade - just to make sure the daughter is legit,  not have to face a life of embarrassment in Asia, as a child born out of wedlock.</p>
              <p>This union of TS and that woman is only a piece of paper with signature on it.</p>
              <p>Bonded by obligations , absent essence of love.</p>
              <p>A child from divorce is better than a child out of wedlock , so the asian society dictates. TS has done the right thing, the responsible thing for the daughter.</p>
              <p>His wife probably don't give a shit if/or not she remained in this marriage. TS knows this, hence his reluctance to confront his own wife.</p>
              <p>Her love is no more. TS still love his wife or his daughter more ?</p>
              <p>It is understandable why you dare not rock the boat . Your child is too young. The last thing you want is to have your precious princess call someone else "daddy".</p>
