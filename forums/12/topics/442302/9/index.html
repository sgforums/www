              <p>sometimes i just dun get it... what use is it of now that TS wife jus cries when TS questioned her about the affair. The moment she has decided to seek this so called love from another person, she should have seen this coming. She forsake her marriage and all the love or whatsoever that has lead her to her marriage just becos someone else could fulfill her so called desire to be wanted(assuming that her desire is to be wanted).</p>
              <p>When things went out of hand and a divorce is at stake, even having committed adultery(not sure what exactly constitute adultery, but right now this looks like one) she asks for the custody of the child? No offense to woman but wad kind of nonsense woman is this? 1 yr of knowing a person and she disregards a r/s which took years to build, tore down a marriage commitment and yet still asks for the child's custody? Where does that put TS then? If TS is really that sucky to have not fulfilled her wants, then have she fulfilled TS wants? and if she takes away the custody of the child, what is TS left with then? I believe this woman is just selfish enough to only think of she and herself where her needs out weigh all other issues.</p>
              <p>Is a marriage with someone like this really worthwhile salvaging?</p>

              Some here have suggested that he should not rush into divorce. Yes, it is very commendable. However, TS has to understand this that - as long as he does not RECONCILE to his psychological hangovers of the past and accept what is not and most importantly forgive out of love , not of need, not out of fear.
              
              Forgivint to save the marrriage, forgiving to secure himself, forgiving for the sake of the child - is simply bullshitting onself.
              
              Forgive for the sake of forgiving and without any expectations that the spouse has to behave from now on or in the future.
              
              Hence, in my many postings I will stress the essence of being self-fulfilled (not to be confused with egoic needs/expectations). One cannot give what one does not have. To pretend and the pretense of having (when the reality is that of lacking WITHIN) causes immense suffering. Has all the material acquistions added to the marriage. The latter are utiliites: a human being pulsates, evolves or regresses - these latter is what many seem to overlook and assume that by doing things it will sustain a marriage or .. yes, for a short while but it is simply not sustainable. Marriages dont die, people who are alredy ''dead' are looking for a ''life'' in ........
              
              Otherwise, this fear will permeate, and anxiety will dominoe one's daily living moments

              <p>Let's not be too quick to judge/criticize who is right, who is wrong.  We will never know what really transpired between TS and his wife, moreover, we have only heard one side of the story. </p>
              <p>To divorce or not divorce?  I have seen cheaters who decided to give up their lover and managed to rebuild marriage successfully.  I have also seen couples who opt for divorce and each now living happily with his/her new partner.  It really depends on what works best for the 2 people concerned (everyone's personality and priorities are different).</p>

              <p>Hi friend....I am not sure whether you are still reading this 
                  thread......if you are.....may I suggest some viewpoints for your 
                  consideration.......</p>
              <p>I think you should think long term.....</p>
              <p>Maybe
                   you should take some time off and think carefully and deeply 
                  first.....dont take a rash decision to divorce....especially now since you are still emotional....</p>
              <p>Take a time to calm down and think.</p>
              <p>Because considering 
                  that you two are newly married, your wife is relatively young, and you 
                  already have a daugther.</p>
              <p>Do you want to be a divorcee ? Do you 
                  want your daugther to be split, do you want to be split from your 
                  daugther, and just visit her during some schedules ? Do you want her to 
                  have a step-father and a complicated family environment. This is not 
                  nice for your daugther and also not nice for you.</p>
              <p>Also, is it 
                  really true that your wife is totally not loving you anymore, or is it 
                  just an office fling and she can still be turned around.</p>
              <p>I know it doesnt look that way, and even she herself said she fell in love with him, but you have to judge it.</p>
              <p>I got the impression your wife is just too naive and a bit gullible and not mature yet.</p>
              <p>Maybe you can consider giving her a chance.</p>
              <p>If
                   it is still possible to correct the path, I believe the cost is less 
                  than divorcing. I'm not talking about money cost, but emotional cost.</p>
              <p>Just think about that first......</p>
              <p>Good luck and I wish you the best......</p>
              <p>Ohh yes another thing.....</p>
              <p>You
                   said you met with her fling at the airport...? How did he react..? How 
                  was his face ? Did he pretend to ignore you..? Was he embarassed, or he 
                  didnt even care...?</p>
              <p>If I am you, I think I would go to look for 
                  him and punch him in the face. No need to be scared. No need to worry 
                  you will cause a scene. Find him somewhere and punch him. Dont just talk
                   to your wife only. Another man is invading your life and destroying 
                  your family and stealing your wife. Hey, you have to do something and 
                  fight back. You have to raise the cost to him. How can he do this and 
                  just dont care. You have to know who your enemy is and take action to 
                  deal with him. If you just dont do anything he will walk all over you 
                  and take you as a fool.</p>
              <p>First, go and punch the guy, and second, pause your plan of divorce and rethink the future.</p>
              <p>If
                   you can find the inner strength to maintain your family and try to save
                   your family and your marriage, you have to change some basic things. 
                  First of all, you must demand that your wife resign from there and 
                  change job totally and cut off all contacts with him. You must demand 
                  that she never again come home late in future jobs. All these you have 
                  to talk to your wife.</p>
              <p>Good luck and all the best......</p>

              consideration.......</p>
              <p>I think you should think long term.....</p>
              <p>Maybe you should take some time off and think carefully and
              deeply first.....dont take a rash decision to divorce....because
              considering that you two are newly married, your wife is relatively
              young, and you already have a daugther.</p>
              <p>Do you want to be a divorcee ? Do you want your daugther to be
              split, do you want to be split from your daugther, and just visit
              her during some schedules ? Do you want her to have a step-father
              and a complicated family environment. This is not nice for your
              daugther and also not nice for you.</p>
              <p>Also, is it really true that your wife is totally not loving you
              anymore, or is it just an office fling and she can still be turned
              around.</p>
              <p>I got the impression your wife is just too naive and a bit
              gullible and not mature yet.</p>
              <p>Maybe you can consider giving her a chance.</p>
              <p>If it is still possible to correct the path, I believe the cost
              is less than divorcing. I'm not talking about money cost, but
              emotional cost.</p>
              <p>Just think about that first......</p>
              <p>Good luck and I wish you the best......</p>
              <p>Ohh yes another thing.....</p>
              <p>You said you met with her fling at the airport...? How did he
              react..? How was his face ? Did he pretend to ignore you..? Was he
              embarassed, or he didnt even care...?</p>
              <p>If I am you, I think I would go to look for him and punch him in
              the face. No need to be scared. No need to worry you will cause a
              scene. Find him somewhere and punch him. Dont just talk to your
              wife only. Another man is invading your life and destroying your
              family and stealing your wife. Hey, you have to do something and
              fight back. You have to raise the cost to him. How can he do this
              and just dont care. You have to know who your enemy is and take
              action to deal with him. If you just dont do anything he will walk
              all over you and take you as a fool.</p>
              <p>First, go and punch the guy, and second, pause your plan of
              divorce and rethink the future.</p>
              <p>If you can find the inner strength to maintain your family and
              try to save your family and your marriage, you have to change some
              basic things. First of all, you must demand that your wife resign
              from there and change job totally and cut off all contacts with
              him. You must demand that she never again come home late in future
              jobs. All these you have to talk to your wife.</p>
              <p>Good luck and all the best......</p>
              </div>

              <p>I agree. Go punch that man.. at the work place. Let the higher management know of his unethical behavior.</p>
              <p>Most likely he will get sacked. Then he won't be her manager anymore.</p>

              I cannot beleive what I am reading here lah, this is no way to save a marriage. Only by reconciliation (if both are tenable) is there a possiblitty. Ts's spouse is partly responsible and till that is acknowledged it is unwise to simply blame this other man. 
              Frankly, Ts n his spouse were accidental and it was waiting to happen in the marraige. - if it did not happen now, it would have happened sooner.

              <p>TS wife is being serenaded by that man using COMPANY resources.</p>
              <p>He is also her manager.. it is unethical behavior already.</p>
              <p>Perhaps an annonymous call to the top management will suffice ?</p>

              <p>i think what ts shld probably do now is actions that will get him the custody of child. If a reconcillation is interest, let the wife ask for it first. She choose to give up everything for the sake of love from this new guy. If she wants everything back again, she herself alone mus initiate the reconcillation and mus make an effort to let TS feels that it is possible.</p>
              <p>As for the other guy, probably that can be dealt with later.</p>

              <p>Well.....actually yes, maybe physically attacking him is not wise because of the factor of the law.</p>
              <p>But still you must do something to confront him. Maybe you dont need to physically attack him but threaten him verbally or do something else. I'm serious.</p>
              <p>In any case, take time to cool off and calm down......and dont be too hard on yourself, you didnt do anything wrong.</p>
              <p>If there is something that you did do wrong, if I may say it, is that you were not assertive enough and were too passive. You sleepwalked into it and didnt pay enough attention. When your wife was repeatedly fetched around, you should have noticed something and taken an action then. Once or twice is normal, but repeated fetching is abnormal but yet you still just be accepting and just let it be. And repeated late night coming home, that is also another thing, but again you didnt notice it, or noticed it but didnt confront your wife enough.</p>
              <p>So this should be your lesson, dont be passive, in life you must pay attention to your surroundings and you must take action yourself if you dont want events to spin out of control. From now on whatever decision you take, whether you stay and try to save the marriage or not, you must always remember it, take decisive actions and stand up for yourself.</p>

              To simply shift blame on the supposedly marriage wrecker is deluding oneself. That one was surfaced and any reason to justify is a cop-out. I dont see anything coming out of making the other wrong. Better to look within oneself and unlearn and if need be correct - otherwise, it will happen and even if does not happen - it is merely suppressed.
                  
                  I know of a woman who did that in the neigbourhood - yes, she got her husband back, marriage is intact - so what, it is merely social artifice, all is palpable are two slaves feeding off each other and suffering silently, that is no dignity.
                  
                  To live within the four corners of a document is good, but if it denies what one wants to be or one simply wants out - just be frank, the marriage or relationship may ''fail'' - the person never failed. 
                  To stay in a marriage out of love is good, every edifying, but to stay cos of fear of loss of .. , security, or social respect - is utter stupidity!

              <p>For TS, at least he is blessed that he can take over his green hat, wife of this type are call slut, a disgrace to our womenfolk and the society as a whole. A married woman must be able to stand up for her family, love and care for her spouse and children, not go sleeping with some other men. But too bad, it is over now, TS should then get more evidences, take pictures of them togther, inform the company about their bad culture of having manager going after other people's wife and families. Once confirmed and firm, get a divorce counsellor and give your best shot to take the custody of the child. So, do your homework now, the more evidences you have, recording or pictures, the more chances you will have if you are call upon to fight over the child custody.</p>
              <p>In life, no doubt you may like or love someone and feel sad having to let go, but it could be a blessing in disguise, you can be better without her.</p>
