              dinner at restaurants at MBS and Orchard respectively. On both
              occasions she didn't turn up, i waited for more than 1 hrs and in
              the end she told me she couldn't make it as she has to finish her
              work. By the time i went to bed around 1-2am, she was not even home

              <p>On my birthday this year which fell on a saturday, we were
              supposed to be celebrating at home. I had collected my birthday
              cake that we booked the day before. She came home late and went out
              barely half an hour later after singing the birthday songs with our
              daugther. I saw her left in her colleague's car waiting downstairs.
              She came home around 4am that night.</p>
              <p>I've suggested we go for family tour together a few times. Each
              time she told me she's busy. This year she has gone for tour
              without me once and gone for working trips 6 times to places like
              Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, Hong Kong and Shanghai.</p>

Whatever choice TS makes, it will require both parties to talk, evaluate what went wrong, and based on whatever damage that has been done, can both parties still attempt to revive their feelings for each other.

              <p>This year ? What happened from the day you got into her panties and made her pregnant ?</p>
              <p>Surely there was once passion between you two, else your daughter cannot exist. Along the way, someone stopped caring.</p>
              <p>In any sinking relationship, there comes a point of no return. The defining moment when one partner decides enough is enough of this "rubbish/abuse/neglect". Then the heart shuts down, his/her back turned.</p>
              <p>Your wife must have crossed this threshold a while ago. </p>
              <p>To divorce is only legitimising the existing situation. A paper procedure, nothing more.</p>
              <p>What is your driving force in staying other than for the sake of your daughter ? Is it GUILT ?</p>
              <p>What is it you want ?</p>

              <p>i'm not so sure what make you think that i had neglected her and resented her in the past. It's not only this year that i tried to do my part to keep this marriage.</p>
              <p>Our 1st 2 years of marriage was wonderfull. We brought up our daugther together. We both played our parts as parents to take care of our daugther. She took 1 year off from work after the birth of our daughter. I woke up at nights to feed our baby.The 1st year was tough but it was also fun and rewarding. As my parents helps to take care of our daughter, we still have quite a lot of time to ourselves. During our 2nd year of marriage, which was last year, we managed  to go for tour together, just the 2 of us, 3 times alltogether, to Japan, Hawaii and Australia. We had great times. I don't earn much, but last year i still got her a LV bag for our anniversary and a Tag Huer watch for her birthday. This year Prada bag for her birthday and Jimmy Choo shoe for our anniversary. Last year we went for movies together at least 8-9 times, strolling on the beach together many times and attended Zouk Out and Xmas parties together.</p>
              <p>Things started to changed gradually when she started work with this new company early this year. At first she even brought me to attend her company functions or outings. That's how i get to know many of her colleagues including that guy who i now suspect is having affair with her now. For the last few months, things got increasingly worse. She comes home later and later and spends more and more weekends not at home. Now she doesn't want to go out with me even when i asked her.</p>

              <p>One feeling lonely has nothiing whatsoever to with marriage or
              relationship. It has to do with one wanting another to fulfil, one
              expecting another to live your life for u.<br> It is nigh impossible and it is utterly stupid to think so.</p>
              <p>Marriage promises made on a particular time or day, with the
              passage of time loses its meaning cos it simply is a fiction. The
              reality is that two persons evolve or regress.<br> Marriages are not wrong, what is wrong is to try to find oneself in
              the marriage or try to exploit the other (or exploiting each other)
              and sooner there is nothing to exploit anymore.<br> When one marries for financial security or social status – one
              would feel fulfilled but one has to understand that once fulfilled
              the marriage is no longer relevant. Marriage was a means to one’s
              ends – once the ends are met, what more can one expect…</p>
              <p>Loneliness is a state of mind where one does not like oneself
              and does not like what he/she is faced with. In other words, one
              has a preconceived notions of what for eg, marriage should be or
              not be, love should be or ... expand on it and one would realise it
              is simply incongruent to reality.</p>
              <p>Playing mind-games and rationalizing is cowardice. It is
              avoiding issues within oneself that were never reconciled.</p>
              <p>With regards to TS’s predicament – one has so far only heard one
              side to the melodrama, what about the spouse’’s … It is so very
              easy to foist one’s assumption, hypothesis and conclude. It is
              folly think that one has to a ’’good’’ spouse – there is no such
              thing – it is a fiction and hence the disappointment and
              misery.</p>
              <p>Like I mentioned before, TS has to be self-honest and as to
              whether the spouse understands, reacts, responds or ignores – there
              must a be ’’reason’’ and only TS can make himself available to
              ….</p>

              Ts,
              U can bring her anywhere, buy all the things that u THINK (it is merely an assumption on your part).
              If your spouse was keen on stayin on - she would still communicate (affair or no affair) and try and resolve matters that may enhance the experience of a family. Is that happening? Does this not tell u where your marriage stands now?
              
              From your postings, it is pretty obvious that (honest explicit communication bet the both of u) has not been transpiring and for some reasons (best known to u) u seem to be waiting and waiting - only u know what u are wating for. Your stance belies fear and fear of what - i dont know.

              <p>TS,<br>U can play the old record over and over again, man – the reality is that u suspect and whether u act or not act – matters will never be resolved until both of u are willing to decide what is necessary to …<br>Stop trying and be and do what is necessary that may free u of this melodrama!<br>Ur stance is of holding onto cancelled cheques and validating it , yes, only in your mind. Reality is it is no longer valid. Beware of the pitfalls of mind-games.</p>

              <p>she came back with a Malaysian Airlines flight, reaching Changi Airport around 8.35pm. I went there and saw her walking out of the arrival hall with that male colleague. I went up to her and told her i went to take her home. But she asked me to go back first saying she wanted to go get a drink, and walked away with him. It's 3.20am now and she's not home yet.</p>
