              <p>There is nothing you can do about the past. Whats done is done. No point scolding you or her. Does not matter whose fault.</p>
              <p>There is only the future. </p>
              <p>The obligation is on you to improve your life, and that of your daughter. Don't fall into the trap of maintaining a charade for the sake of you daughter. This would be worse than the divorce.</p>
              <p>You have tried desperately, there is a point when enough is enough.</p>
              <p>The marriage has irretrievablely broken down. She don't have the slightest respect for you. You are hoping against hope. She will turn around only if its advantages to her, then she will discard you again.  </p>
              <p>So make up your mind to dump her now, before you crack, and we read about you in the papers.</p>
              <p>Its difficult, but take one step at a time. Steel yourself and drop into a lawyers office, and go on from there. Make that move, or else you will be here playing that same old song again and again like what Fugazzi said.</p>

              <p>lols... it takes 2 hands to clap... so i wonder wad did ts do wrong such that his wife had to act like this. While marriage might jus be a paper thing, it is still a commitment. There has been no reason yet for his wife to act the way she is.</p>
              <p>Lets try to empathise with him and not ride on his problem nor overly blame him. He needs emotional support and i believe TS is really having a hard time.</p>
              <p>Mancha, haven you know that it is a "all guys fault thingy" in the eyes of some ppl. For every single thing that happened, TS is always at fault, filled with guilt, lack of everything a woman needs. But no one has taken a look at what TS really needs. Hopefully u get wad im trying to say.</p>

              <p>You are like any foolish prideful male forumers here. Thinking a few Gucci/LV bags and Jimmy Choo shoes or tours to exotic places are all it takes to make your wife happy. No, women are more complicated than that !</p>
              <p>Think about this, if she is truly set on leaving you, she don't need your permission to divorce you. She can go to the lawyer office herself and seek a divorce on her own.</p>
              <p>In fact, the sooner she seeks a divorce, the sooner she will be released from it all. Why has she not done it yet ?</p>
              <p>In her heart.. she has doubts. Because she know the next ship she jumps onto, may turn out a sinking ship too.</p>
              <p>To salvage this ship, you need to be a better man for her. If she sees the change in you and see a future.. she will stay. We all know.. the pasture is not always greener on the other side.</p>
              <p>The only way it can be greener.. is when the current one is as lousy as a pig sty.</p>
              <p>Think about the issues she had been unhappy with in the past, figure out how to resolve the problems, not sweep it under the carpet.</p>
              <p>Show genuine repentence.. there is still hope.</p>
              <p>She is punishing you right now. Just stay calm. The more angry and unhappy you are.. the more vengence she feels.</p>
              <p>The whole marriage had been all about you.. it's time you let her take the reign.</p>

              <p>If she is angry or sore at you, she would show it. She is not.</p>
              <p>Anger is an emotion. If she has it, then it augurs well for you, as that emotion is only not a desirable one. It would show she has feelings for you, and she is unhappy about some things. But there is none.</p>
              <p>But no anger. No emotions, thats bad. Not even regard for you.</p>
              <p>When she has no regard for you as a person, her husband, the father of your daughter, then all is lost. It will be a one sided affair on your part.</p>
              <p>You can try to win her back, by romancing her again. You have to honestly ask yourself, will it work. Will it hold.</p>
              <p>You make a statement of intent first, then act on it. The latter part is the most important, otherwise nothing happens, and you will remain in the confused state.</p>

              <p>lols... it takes 2 hands to clap... so i wonder wad did ts do
              wrong such that his wife had to act like this. While marriage might
              jus be a paper thing, it is still a commitment. There has been no
              reason yet for his wife to act the way she is.</p>
              <p>Lets try to empathise with him and not ride on his problem nor
              overly blame him. He needs emotional support and i believe TS is
              really having a hard time.</p>
              <p>Mancha, haven you know that it is a "all guys fault thingy" in
              the eyes of some ppl. For every single thing that happened, TS is
              always at fault, filled with guilt, lack of everything a woman
              needs. But no one has taken a look at what TS really needs.
              Hopefully u get wad im trying to say.</p>

              <p>The relationship has gone beyond the fault finding stage now.</p>
              <p>OK so if it is established that the fault lies here and there. Lets take corrective action. Do you think there will be a reversal? </p>
              <p>TS is dead to her. She don't give a damn to his feelings.</p>
