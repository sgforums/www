              ''some thinkings and heart changes, these are unavoidable....'' this makes sense and to that I would add this  -  to stay in a relationship or marriage out of duty is the biggest betrayal to oneself and another.
              The only thing that could have been done by Ts''s spouse is make it known to Ts or leave the marriage, not stay IN it and mess up. 
              Would a loving person do this?

              <p><br>marriage over is more difficult to handle than going to get married, there is assets in question, $$ in question, wormen charter by the bay, alimony in due, childrens in caring and finally both physical and mental stress to take care off from all directions of bombardment and looks, relatives, parents, in laws, sibling, sibling in laws....so end up, the best is dun marry, once you do not marry, sure got no marriage over case one correct...think wise, alway think out of the playground</p>
