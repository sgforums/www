              He could have hired a PI and file for divorce on the gounds of adultery and being a irresponsible parent. That would allow for leveragingng and impact the outcome of the proceedings.
              
              Ts made a big mistake and that was of coming out in the open with the spouse and now it is kinda of too late to concretize adultery. She would probably acquiesce but it kind of weakens the impact of ... 
              
              
              Now, it does not feel so â€“ yes, judges  would listen, hear and think but this being singapore, kiasuism is awash and the judges would always stick to the rule of law and most probably fall back on precedents. Nothing that is uttered verbally is going to be considered unless if/whem incontrovertible proof that is found to be irrefutable from any angle is furnished and only then would such evidence be accepted by the courts.
              
              Only judges of the High Court or Appelate judges risk creating law anew!
              
              Ps : I had an acquaintance and he did his homework, took preemptive measures before divorce proceedings â€“ got a PI to collate evidence and sprang a surprise during the preliminary hearing(s), the spouse relented and gave up sole custody. Before that she was adamant and wanted sole custody.
              Lawyers most promise u the moon lah - reality is that of simply colleciting exorbitant fees and .....
               Ts, understand that without EVIDENCE (verbal is useless) - the judge would go thru the motion of being sympathetic and eke out justice as prescribed by statutes/precedents. If the child is a toddler - precedence for the well-being and the welfare of the child will cancel out all claims by both parties. 
              One has to factor in the provisions of the Women's Charter and it is a legal minefield!

              <p>Merry Christmas everyone</p>
              <p>I spent Christmas Eve with my wife and daughter today. Had Christmas party at my cousin's house like we did every year. It was nice. My daughter was really happy, she got so many gifts and ate lots of chocolate and icecream.</p>
              <p>We got home around 11pm and she immediately bathed our daughter, make her milk and serenaded her to sleep. That moment actually looked very heart warming...</p>
              <p>Things changed after that. Her bf came over to take her out and i'm being thrown back to reality again! It's almost 5.30am now and i don't think she's coming home tonite.</p>
