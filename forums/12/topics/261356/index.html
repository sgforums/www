And during that time we were merely normal friends until recently I started to be nicer to her and subsequently closer. One point I agree is she has never thought of me in a romantic way. There is a guy who's after her too and all of us hang out together in a group. Nobody in group knows about my confession to her and that guy who is chasing her has the support of my other friends because they know he's chasing her. I can also feel she has more feelings with that guy but I don't understand why she's not with him and why did she consider my proposal. Relationships are so complicated to understand.</div>

She was shocked (for some reason I don't know why when it is obvious that I like her). She says she will give me an answer before she leaves in 2 weeks time. She said that it is too sudden and needs some time to think about it. She's not running away from this confession(I'm quite surprised). We have known each other for many years and it is only recently that I decided to confess to her. We are good friends and we assured each other no matter the answer we would remain as good friends. Both of us are in the 20's. And I am pretty much serious about this relationship.<br><br>So girls, anyone care to enlighten me by what considering means? What should I do during this critical 2 weeks? Both of us were very normal after the confession. There's no avoiding or awkwardness either. I don't know what I should do should the answer be no.</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Love is involuntary; relationship is voluntary<br><br>Cheers</div>
