She was shocked (for some reason I don't know why when it is obvious that I like her). She says she will give me an answer before she leaves in 2 weeks time. She said that it is too sudden and needs some time to think about it. She's not running away from this confession(I'm quite surprised). We have known each other for many years and it is only recently that I decided to confess to her. We are good friends and we assured each other no matter the answer we would remain as good friends. Both of us are in the 20's. And I am pretty much serious about this relationship.<br><br>So girls, anyone care to enlighten me by what considering means? What should I do during this critical 2 weeks? Both of us were very normal after the confession. There's no avoiding or awkwardness either. I don't know what I should do should the answer be no.</div></blockquote>Question: What kind of results are you hoping to gain out of this confession? Where is she going? On a vacation? Going away for good? Going away for studies/work?<br><br>If she meant contemplating a relationship with you, then just cross your fingers and  wait. In the meantime don't pressure her or call her too often. Let her miss you a bit lah...<br><br>This one is called mating game mah. Haiyah...<br><br>My idea:<br>Give her some space lah. Send her an sms 1 week later. Ask her to go out with you.<br><br>You plan romantic date (at night). No need to bring up the confession during the date, let her bring it up. If she doesn't then you keep quiet also. At the end of the date kiss her. She turn her head away you know lor. She don't turn her head away then you know lor. No need words one lah. Sometimes women like 'chong dong' ok. Passion ok.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
