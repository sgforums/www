            <div class='col-md body'>I guess still like her a lot.<br>You wanted her back right?<br><br>What i feel is that, there is still a chance to recover this relationship.<br>Just that, it would take some time.<br><br>Your First Game with her is over...<br>Now you will need to start everything again...<br><br>Stop pestering her with the 'Could you give me another chance?' question... That's irritating. Really. It is irritating because she don't have the answer to give you yet. As you said, she is a person who need time.<br><br>'So when to ask her again?'<br>When the time is right...<br>'When will the time be right?' is now the problem...<br><br>The reason she broke off with you is what her don't like about in this relation.<br>Firstly, you have to chance this thing first.<br>For your case, it's your nonsense. Stop all the stupid nonsense. Hope you already learn how to stop those nonsense after the lesson.<br><br>After, you have to go back everything from the start again. What i feel is that, she still have the feeling for you.<br><br>She maybe very confuse now... Thinking whether should you be given this chance, or to forget about the relationship. She say she will consider it, she mean it.<br><br>"anyways..she told me she had been thinking about what i said..to give me another chance..but when i asked again this morning..it was the same, 'don't waste your time le' ..."<br><br>This part here is that you irritate her make make her have no other answer to reply you. Stop irritating her or she will really force to mean 'don't waste your time le'<br><br>She is feeling awkward now... She don't know how to face you... She will try to avoid you... That will be normal...<br><br>What you can do now til the time to ask her again is to make her awkwardness toward you disappear...<br><br>Make her feel comfortable with you again... Make her happy... Stop your nonsenses...<br><br>You can try to get your relationship better now by treating her like a totally new friend and try to get close to her again...<br><br>She didn't block you on msn is a good thing and still can answer your call is also another good thing... Bring the friendship closer... Stop reminding her about your stupid nonsense...<br><br>Maybe you can still go out together go gai gai... if cannot one on one then in group with other friend, show her concern (don't overdo it or it become another irritating thing...)...<br><br>Hope this will help you.<br>Btw, from what you wrote, i really feel that she still have the feeling for you...<br>Don't give up pal!<br>Also, don't regret whatever path you choose.<br>Choose your path wisely!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The problem lies with you and I'm glad that you know.<br><br>1. You lacked of self-confidence which is very important.<br><br><strong>Please be more confident next time round, a girl won't be with you if she doesn't love you. </strong><br><br>2. In a r/s, TRUST is very important! By nagging at her on how unhappy you were seeing her blog with another guy name you're simply telling her that. I don't trust you and that guy.<br><br><strong>Everyone needs their own circle of friends, you won't want her to do the same to you right? By asking you not to make friend with any girls.</strong><br><br>3. Gifts need not to be expensive.<br><br><strong>You can design your own card and get it print, the most it would only cost $2-$3 or bake your own cookies and put it in a lovely box with some sweets or something, she'll be touched to death! The thing you made is priceless and unique, some girls will appreciate it. Frankly speaking how much can a few stalks of roses cost? Not as if your anniversary falls on Valentine's Day. </strong><br><br>Now the point is will you be able to change for her? If you can, just do your best to try patch things up and make things worked! Good luck and all the best to you.<br></div>
