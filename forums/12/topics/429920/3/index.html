              <p>I know how to solve your problems all at once.</p>
              <p>First of all, there is no star west media group you dipshi t. She most likely works at starmedia singapore since a company in singapore with both star and media in it.</p>
              <p>The address is here:</p>
              <h5><strong>StarMedia Singapore Pte Ltd</strong></h5>

              <p>Go there, stalk her 24/7, get reported by ms seah, get thrown in jail. Then you will finally realize the difference between infatuation and reality. Sian diao, have crush on and in love with is different thing. Also, even if you really love her, you have no chance, so better to go do something else, or find someone else to love.</p>

              <p>That's the weak point of guy, use to hv guys asking to date me, I just said got bf, and they buzz off feeling shy and paiseh. So easy for me.</p>
              <p>Boyfriend do not imply that she must be with him, tho they are in relation, under no legal proceeding are they attached, so she is still free for any one who is interested in her, but of course those wanted her, need to try harder. But if you never try, how you know you cannot make it, up to now, you guys still dun understand why gf left bf and bf left his gf??</p>
              <p>If you examine the issue closely here, most MPs or to be MP candidates are mostly preferred to be married, this will sway unneccesary attention in them and keep both, they and the public to focus on the issue on hand, not wasting time in mingling whether he/she is married or attached. So, for Nicole Rebecca Seah, being young like me, she needs to proclaim she has a bf inorder to evade all relationship question and let those tiko uncles heart die of nature dead. But in reality, is he her true bf, is still questionable, it can be someone acting as her bf to evade all unnecessary tiko uncles like many of you here.</p>

              <p>yeah i agree , its this same thing that happened to me. whenever i dress up in female clothes, the guys always happen to notice me and come to me. but when i wear my menswear back, they always assume that i am not interested in them. if they examine the issue closely here, they would notice i am gay and i am after them.</p>
