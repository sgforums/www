            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... THis is what guys and gals different... If guys been rejected.. some may think that that means over... While gals.. rejection from guys mean CHALLENGE for her... This is why she may even work harder to get ur attention. Maybe just telling her that u dont love her or u already have somebody that u love not enough.. Maybe u should really ignore her... Ignore her Sms, dun pick up her calls.. etc.</div>
