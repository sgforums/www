He might be stress over work as his company is currently facing crisis. Have you think of whether what are the real reasons for working so hard? There's always a motive or reasons behind it.<br>Since both of you have broken off, give yourself sometime to heal. As there's always a saying, "Time heals everything!". Do consider carefully if you want to go into another relationship.</div>
