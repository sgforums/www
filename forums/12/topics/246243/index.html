Scars of hurt would already be etched into hers and your memory. Insecurity issues would be raised more often than before for sure. Will you still feel happy? Certianly not.<br><br><br><br>I'm sure you're regretting not cherishing the moments with her before... And I guess, it's another lesson learnt the hard way.<br><br>What you can do now... is best to stay in minimal contact with this girl. And do attempt to move on when you're ready.
