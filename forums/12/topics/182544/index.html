            <div class='col-md body'>I know all things will end. And it WILL end.<br>I am so sorry. Bye bye my dearest friend. I'm sorry to hurt you so much that we both cried over the phone but with hatred. I am sorry if I torn your heart so badly, it needs an eternity to be patched back.<br>I didn't meant to do it, I swear. It was all an accident. I wasn't thinking. Sorry.<br><br>Remember how we met? It was so...<span style="font-style: italic;">weird</span> Everything was new there and I didn't know a THING. But you guided me. Thanks for that. =]<br><br>Remember how we ended? It was so tragic to the extend we will never be friends again no matter what you or I do to it, unless the magic of God work again to our beautiful friendship.<br><br>Remember how it started? It was bad. Real bad. My attitude sucks and your loyalness sucks. I wanted it to be better, you wanted it to be the same, fearing it will cause scars. Now the deed is done. And no, it isn't better without you. It's sadder and more painful.<br><br>Remember how we cried? It was the cries of our broken hearts. It wailed out everyday. Smiles were on our face when we see our loved ones. But it was fake and forced smile. It wasn't pleasant. It was hard.<br><br>Remember how we made things worst? It was so much more painful, and the agony pierced through our hearts. When we see each other, we couldn't help but feel that helpless feeling and cringed. Quickly walked away so we could cry not in each other presence. It was suffering.<br><br><strong><span style="font-style: italic;">I am so sorry for causing you so much pain. Though we might patch things up one day, this memory will distance us from each other. We will not be that close set of friends anymore. Not ever. Not again. </span></strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Thanks so much for bearing my impatience for all these years. We been angry at each other enough. Why can't we forgive and forget?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

Nothing in this world cannot be solved.. Just that whether you wan it anot.. You know that you make a mistake by yelling at her in public.. Yes you did apologised.. but at that moment she was real hurt.. Times after times.. You both have always been like this.. is this how a friendship should be?<br><br>Wat are friends for?? Friends are someone who stand beside when you needed them most.. whom are the one you trust, knows and likes about.. Be it her weakness or her good..<br><br>I dunno how long this friendship lasted.. but i find is really a pity to end just like that..<br><br>ANyway, you mention that she might be jealous of you being too close to another friend. Are you the only friend she had? Why is she feeling so inferior? Afraid that one day you will leave her in a lurch.. dump her for another friend? Maybe this might be the cause of why both always ended up quarrelling.. She might not want you to know that she's feeling insecure.. Going to your house using internet might be just one excuse to be with you..<br><br>She might become too possessive but she dun know.. She just dun wanna loose a friend like you.. But friends are still friends.. there are limits to it.. i dun really know your friend well or even you well.. but giving the informations you posted.. i believe she's feeling lonely and emptiness.. trying to cover it without letting anyone know.. but then if she dun speak up why she's reacting this way.. you never know..<br><br>Suggest that you have a good talk with her.. find out what's really her problem is.. why is she always acting this way..? You feel guilty cos you feel that you let her down and hurt her.. Maybe you could also voiced out your feelings to her..<br><br>Communications is very important in a friendship or even in any relations..<br><br>Cheers..</div>
