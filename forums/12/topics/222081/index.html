If you two doesn't even communicate much on friendly level or share anything similar, I don't think this feeling developed from knowing her as a person, much more than it stems from your loneliness.<br><br>She is probably friendly and the friendly vibes are easily mistaken as developed feelings for people like you, because you have hardly gotten close (platonic sense) to a lady in that sort of level and when someone first 'reach' there, you will feel 'funny' - like an emotion not felt before and you classify them as Love.<br><br>Allow me not to induce too much negativity in your thoughts for I would encourage you to explore your own feelings... with deep introspection and wisdom. Love is freewill - we should learn to cope with our own emotions and learn them like how toddlers master their first walk. In all our inaugural exploration of emotions, we suddenly feel helpless, walking through in this mysteriously exciting, yet daunting rite of passage.<br><br>P.S: When I was much younger, I had a slight brush with this sort of phenomenon - I was from single-sex school for ten years, but the difference is that I had social network outside school, of both guys and girls. I learned to segment friendliness and attraction.<br><br>Maybe I am spiritually inclined - I sensed vibes from people and over the years, I learn to recognise those vibes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
