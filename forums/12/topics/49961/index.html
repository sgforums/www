Are you saying he totally don't want to have kids? But why? Did he tell you the reason? Something must have happened during his earlier years to have triggered this decision.<br><br>You guys have been together for only abt 1 yr... how old are you?<br><br>Seriously, I think you guys need to have a heart to heart talk. Seems to me, you don't quite know him well enough to talk abt the future... That's how I see the picture, anyway just my 2 cents worth.<br><br></div>

Marriage is between two, for ill or for good, both sticking to each other and growing from it spiritually, emotionally and physically. Love is often in the picture (though not neccessary) and probably a willing and planned thing (again, not neccessary).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Since marriage is between two - having kids or not is not exactly neccessary PROVIDED if both couples have the same mentality. If this preception/viewpoint is clashed - something has to be worked out.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Having kids is great element into the marriage - it brings growth and development to the marriage as well as happiness (though not neccessary, but a child reasonably brought up (personal definition), every parent would feel gald and satisfied.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I suspect there could be other reasons on why he doesn't want kids. Seek and slowly advance into his inner world - you people are only the first year of your relationship. Take your time and concern to understand why is this happening.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Personal experience? Childhood psychology past? External factors? When you have a better picture of this: probably you can repost you question and we can do a better analysis over this.<br><br>P.S (Negative scenario): If there is absolutely nothing that is affecting him over a long course of trying to seek the root of the problem. Either he doesn't want to tell OR he could hold weak faith in the relationship. (Family/immediate family influence?) because having kids is a burden IF things like divorce, etc were to take place. But I wouldn't guess things here and complicate your thinking. Take care lady. Repost once you have a better picture yourself too. Remember take time to know his heart and inner thoughts.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
