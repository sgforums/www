What statistics did you based on to make ur assumption that poly grads are those earning $1.4k job as technician and sales personnel.<br>Mr I-am-from-top-schools-and-earning-big-bucks, I hope you would enlighten us on the above assumptions.<br><br>To address on the topic, I think that it is very common for woman to work across borders. You don't have to see ur bf everyday, telecommunications are so advanced that you just need a small box to stay in communication. A successful story would be from my aunt who is in SIA, getting married with someone whom she has been together with for 6 years. Nothing is impossible.<br></div>

Well well, perhaps Mr High and Mighty here is a White Horse from some top Junior College. Then again, perhaps he just lacks the necessary emotional intelligence.<br><br>I think I can understand what your boyfriend feels. Nowadays, it's not easy to find someone and stay with her. Why don't you sit down and have a good talk with him? Find out exactly why is he so against you being an air stewardess. Of course, you can also persuade him to join you in SIA as an air steward.<br><br>My advice is, go for your dream. Regardless of how much he is against it, if he really loves you, he will still support you in the end, despite it being rather painful for him.</div>
