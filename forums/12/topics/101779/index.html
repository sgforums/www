            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,I hope u ppl here can help me with the problem i am currently having it now. Ok, im a sec skool student currently taking my o levels now..well, today is my maths paper and i dunno how I would fare...sobs...maybe i'll fail..I had never pass my maths before...if I don't,can u give me any option tat I can do?<br><br>ok,but also i have this "love" problem tat is kinda bugging me...well,u see,I have given this guy a letter of confession. I know this guy likes me too because he keeps standing up for me whenever ppl tried to put me down despite the fact it was my fault...(for example I am always absenting from skool and arriving late for lessons,blah blah) , also whenever I have a new hairstyle or I had just trimmed my eyebrows,he would sit one table away from me and start giving me an "observing" look..and,he is always smiling at me for no reason and he had this twinkle in his eye whenever he looks at me...also, he is always giving me a serious look and once,I overheard him toking happily with his frens about me....all this,I had been observing in my own stand and I can conclude he likes me....Well,we didnt really tok to each other cause I am kinda shy and as for him...I think he is too..well,I dunno...<br><br>But because of my tardy behaviour, everyone despised me and they thought I shouldn't deserve him. He is handsome,I got to admit. He has girls going after him,but I guess he didn't give a damn. So,came this rival tat tried to get close to him...I guess she must have tot the same way as my other classmates too and she started going after him...grabbing every opportunity to be with him...by sticking with him and all tat...but he didnt retaliate...I was jealous all this time whenever I saw him with her...I can feel tat he just treats her as a fren (my sixth sense tells me)....well,I was right,because few months after tat, I caught him staring at me with is usual longing look...and so I caught his gaze and we were sort of sending electric currents with each other....given my shy nature,I cut short the eye-contact and just walked away.<br><br>All this period I had been thinking of him and I was neglecting my studies and all tat...well, okok, not mostly cause of him tat i did tat...but because I am just simply lazy. well,*sigh*...so I gave him the letter like last month and I wrote tat he must give me a call at ard 6 on tat day....well,he didn't (it was my hse phone no.) so I was particularly upset..<br><br>Then ard last week,we had our maths paper 1 paper and once again, he was sitting at row 4 and was rite in front of me whereas I was in row 5....ard three tables behind him..there was no girls ard the vinicity and he turned ard and started toking to his fren tat is just behind him...well,once again, at the corner of my eye, I saw him looking striaght at me...so I also caught his gaze...and we started staring at each other...<br><br>But today, I sort of miss him during my weekends...so I decided to wait for him at the MRt today..well,I couldn't catch him because I was deeply absorbed with my maths textbooks...so,ok..I just went straigh to skool....well,after the paper ended, I tried looking at him to make him look at me too...but he didn't...he was constantly toking to his fren behind him and his gaze sort of looking elsewhere but me....haix...tomorrow is my chemistry paper and I noe u peeps would ask me to concentrate on the exams first..well,i noe..but this thing have been bothering me since the starting of skool yr when we first started developing our feelings wif each other....btw,he and my rival had not been together since I given my letter....(in the letter,I wrote it not to show it to anyone..) well,ppl here,pls give me opinions on wat I should do...<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> tomorrow is the last day we took our exams at the same day..for the rest,we will have different time slot.....I sincerely need help<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Twinkle in his eye? You must be madly in love with this guy <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Since you have already given him your letter of confession, it's up to him to make the decision. Why do you still have to be troubled?<br><br>If he likes you, he will definitely take some action.<br><br>If he doesn't like you, just take it as his lost! I'm sure that there are alot of guys who will appreciate you much more than he does.<br><br>There's no point worrying over your O levels now. The thing you should do is to put him at the back of your mind, and focus on the rest of your papers. What's done has been done, no point worrying over the other papers.<br><br>If the worst really happens, and you do fail, here's what I will advise you to do:<br><br>1) Ask yourself if you are REALLY willing to study hard for the next O levels.<br><br>If your answer is 'NO', don't bother to retake. Get a job, or apply for the ITE.<br><br>You retake just to show people that you want a second chance, but you're not making any efforts at all. What for? You're wasting your money and time only. And believe me, ITE is not the end. You still can go to Poly or JC if you work hard enough.<br><br>If your answer is 'YES', go on to the next point.<br><br>2) After the release of the results, go get a part time job. Or go for a holiday if you want.<br><br>3) When next year's O levels is up for registration, sign up as a private candidate.<br><br>4) Two months before the O levels start, quit your job and start revising for your papers.<br><br>Whether you succeed or not, it depends on how much effort you put in. Remember, you have more experience than those who're taking it for the first time. You should be more confident of yourself!<br><br>Hope that helps.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>believe me, it is so much more worth it to concentrate on ur exam right now. I usually behaved otherwise, but after all that had happened in my life, I think it is worthless to worry so much abt a guy. I mean, if he really cares about you, he will let you know. Dun worry abt it. No matter how shy he is, he will still find a way to ask you out or to let you know, if he really likes you. So you just need to wait for him to make the move since you already made yours. Meanwhile, you can use up those time to study for your exams. So if he likes you and make the move, then you will have both world at the same time. You will succeed in your exams, and you will have him. If he couldn't caare less to make the move, your life would be better without him anyway. I am speaking from experience. At least if you dun have him, you will still have good results to be happy about. And you can show it to him dat you dun need him to be able to survive. That is what every girl should do...prove that she can strive for success on her own, not just wasting her time thinking about whether her crush likes her back or not. He will have so much respect for you if you can succeed in your studies. Trust me. I hope you will make the right decision.<br><br>i.c.y</div>
