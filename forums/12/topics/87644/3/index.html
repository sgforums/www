Well.. you jus have to let yourself settle down.. and jus go on.. someday.. when you think of him again.. maybe ti will be "memories"..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>There's nothin with you.. most ppl go thru such phrases.. not only you.. motivate yourself.. to do somethine else.. and not sitting down jus think,, Action must be thinking.. this is jus as good as ppl saying "i love you" but how many meant it?? right?<br><br>Don't worry you'll pull thru and get thru.. well.. i do really hope you can get your queries soon.. at least you know you won't in a dilemia dunno what to do next.. cos the reason he gave isn't much convincing to you.. that's why you keep thinking what's wrong.. what went wrong..  Jus stay cool ok..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
