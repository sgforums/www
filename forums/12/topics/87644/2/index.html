Given the fact that he feels constrain and restricted, maybe I really should learn to let go.<br><br>i really do love him, and it makes me so sad to let go. it is like ripping a part of me away.<br><br>my plans now are to continue with my current life, bury myself in work. I plan to continue to keep in contact maybe thru sms. temporary i may not asked him out yet. (not sure) but keeping in contact, i think thats fine.<br><br>i want to give this relationship another 6 months. during tis 6 months, i mgoing to reflect on what has happended and wat will i do differently next time. What exactly is my problem? it is tooo difficult to let go now mayb after a few months, then the reality will hit me.<br><br>mayb you guys are right, maybe i should let him be for a while to cool off.<br>whatever it is, we all dont know what is the outcome. Hope is only 50% of the chance, and the other 50% of fate......</div></blockquote>It does not matter whether he pays for your car, gives you a CC or what.. These are all not impt at all.. .Both of you have gone through a long time together.. 3 1/2 years is a very very long relationship.. To which, I believe you would have understand him well enough and vice versa.. I guess during this period, there would be sufficient trust and love in you 2.. The break up is NOT due to 1 incident and he suggest that way.. I can 100% tell you that there are other reasons.. And your bf ( or rather ur ex) is using that excuse that night to break up with you.. To put it simply.. He cannot stand it anymore..<br><br>Guilt in this case plays a very very small role in what the guy does.. For example, selling a car just because he breaks up with you.. is something not that you say it now, you can do it.. There are certain things which he needs to take into consideration before he can sell the car.. Maybe he will suffer a lost or what.. That we won't know..<br><br>Like what the others say.. Give each other some times and see how things are getting on.. If fate puts both of you back together, you will be back.. We wish you luck!!</div>

He claimed that he is tired that we are always quarreling. You see, we quarrel and did not talked for 2 weeks.<br>After that when I called him, he told me he want to call it off and wants to be left alone.<br><br>the reason for our quarrel was becoz I did not let him go out on a particular nite. reason being that he has been out for 2 consecutive nites and I was afraid he was too tired. wrong move. he got mad and quarrel with me.<br><br>anyway, it has been a week. i met him last week after he broke the news to me. i was extremely out of control and miserable. i was sick after he broke this news to me. i could not eat and could not sleep and becoz of that i got bad gastrics and boy, felt like dying. he told me we still could be friends..<br><br>he did sms me when he learnt that i did not eat. told me to take my meals.<br>then yesterday he came to my place to take his clothes. he actually did not want to talk but i told him better to talk thru once and for all. i asked him for the real reason, he claimed no more feelings.<br>i asked him if got 3rd party, he said no.<br><br>i jus bought a car and he is helping to finance, so i told him maybe i want to sell the car, he told me to keep it until end of the yr then decide again.<br>our joint acct, he said he is still using it, so will keep until end of the year.<br>if he is really so firm to break up, when leave these open?<br>besides the credit card which he supp to me told me to keep it first, if want to use then use if not then return him if i want.<br><br>i really dun understand, tell me guys, what is he thinking? is he confused?<br>would you shower a luxury gift to your gf 4 month before a breakup. i am thinking, if he doesnt love me, why did he buy such an expensive gift for me for my birthday????<br></div></blockquote>Buying expensive gifts doesn't mean anything...<br><br>He trusted you that's why he letting you having those things that can be in need of.. or can still be used..<br><br>Anyway your problem here is not really something as bad as what i thought.. All these can be revived.. if you have properly planning and ask clearly yourself.. why do you wanna this r/s back??<br><br>Yunhaier has good analysis on your whole situation.. you should talk and realyl find out the real source of what really cuases the whole situation to this break-up.. well i'm sure is not be cos of that small little matter that you dun wan him to go out.. and he got real angry and wanna a break..<br><br>There might be other reasons to it.. that he had to do it.. If you think why did he leaves everything that both of you shared.. like cars.. joint account.. blah blah.. and he says all talked about it till the end of the year.. Maybe you should have a really good talk with him.. and another thing.. if you really wan it back... how do you measure yourself and him.. in this relationship..<br><br>Getting him jus be cos you are too used to him.. or you do really still love him.. Well.. i'm sure that he can't be totally no feelings for you.. COmpromise with each other..

Or maybe he feels guilty or regret that out of anger he voiced out breaking up that's why he reacting strangely?? there are many many reasons to it.. in order to get yourself a clearer picture and he being back to normal again.. both have to resolve the matter.. as such from there.. maybe there;s some misunderstandings to it.. and you guys can be back together.. if not.. still can be as very good friends..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">    You wanna know what he's thinking.. ask.. whatever you said to yourself.. is only how you feel..

As this is the first time, not sure wat to do. I wrote him an email telling him about a stupid incident that happened to me last week, then I told him abt the servicing. I asked him if he was free, if not free then I figure something out myself.<br>He replied and told me he was free and could help me.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">But I felt that his email was very guarded. Like he wants to protect something...not sure what he is thinking. </span><br><br>I think i need ths time too...to seriously think abt what I want.....<br><br></div></blockquote>Respect privacy...<br><br>The other day I just chanced upon my gf's e-mail when she didn't logout properly.. I was asking her, you didn't log off yet? She was like kinda stunned... And quickly checked that I don't open anything and she closed it...<br><br>I think it's only natural that people work this way... I mean some people can be quite open about such, while others might not.. It all depends on the mentality of the person and what's in the e-mail account.. Understand that some secrets might not be of his / her own but of others... Respect that...<br><br>Ultimately I think the point is I trust her... If she deem that it's not appropriate for me to go through her e-mail, I won't...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Why not write an email to him since u can express it better? I mean if you do have the courage, talk it out face to face with him lar.. But you gotta expect some friction that will happen..<br><br>Refering to your earlier post on how long is the long.. In such cases, there are no time frame.. sometimes it can be an hr.. or it can be years.. Whatever the case is, what i can suggest is if you can, email him what you are thinking.. and see in his email if there are any signs of reconciliation..<br><br>If he has really decided to let go of things, i think he would not even response to you.. Take some time lar..<br></div>
