Why he did it you have to ask yourself. Could be over another girl, could be he was the loner type and missed his freedom, could be you too overbearing, could be you like him but dun like those around him so always trying to change him and he resents that. Whatever the reasons only you will know.<br><br>The other reason is more simple, he showers you with gifts because he feels guilty over the breakup and maybe betrayal so this is a way to make up. If you accept then he feels he has 'recompensated' you for it.<br><br>I have experienced this from girls in the past and some of my friends themselves experienced it too.<br><br></div>
