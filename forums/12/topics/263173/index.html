For example :<br>If u are the leader and have the power, whip them... Let them fear of u... But also must be reasonable lah...<br>If u are not the leader and have no power, then, let them be leader... But however, maintain a positive attitube. Maintaining a positive attitube is also a skill... U need to slowly build up relationship with them... Whenever, they make a grave mistake, just warn them... It doesnt matter if there is an open discussion or close discussion, as long as u get yr job done. WHO CARES???<br><br>Then, what makes u think that yr reasoning is right??? What makes u think that they dont think that u r evading THEIR topic??? This are all human managements skills... ---&gt; Experience.<br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Well ah, building up a relationship is right... I have been working at it. And it did help... but it takes time. I'm talking about my dad actually. When you're living together, harmony is very important. You can't say things like "Who cares?" and talk about instiling fear.<br><br>I don't know if my reasoning is right or not, but at least I belong to the majority and he is standing <span style="font-style: italic;">alone</span>.</div>
