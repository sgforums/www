Dare to f.u.c.k around but don't dare to admit? Why must we only blame the guy? Sure, the guy also at fault...but don't you think your frd/you need to shoulder some blame as well? Who ask your frd/you so easily get f.u.c.ked?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I can understand your anger if she was raped. But the fact showed  she wasn't. Pregnant already then come up here and kao pe kao bu, ask advice lah...what to do lah. Why not ask them to post in Bar forum and tell us how shiok the two of them felt while they are f.u.c.king instead? In my opinion, ask the gou nan nu to go and die lah!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>We also try our best to give you advice, you know or not?

Don't look down on us, we are not in the same level! And you still dare to come up here and scold us! So what if we are not able to give you the answer that you desperately want. I know you want us to blame the guy right? But in this kind of situation, it takes the both of them to achieve their f.u.c.king feat. Your frd/you should have taken care of herself and stop having unprotected sex.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Come lah...don't be shy leh, you want money right?

Her blind and irresponsible action of having sex unprotected... it speaks volumes of how little she values herself and also of how short term her perspective on life is!! not good.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Also bec of these reason and other reasons... she thinks that the guy actually is giving her the love that she needed... I dont think so...<br><br>The guy deserves a serious wack over the head  he is one selfish irresponsible assse who does not love his gf one bit.  he is using her as a sexual object for his own pleasure! He treats her worse than a paid escort. why? bec he thinks only of himself and wants everything his own way.  He wants sex and the cheapest and cleanest way to get it is to persuade a girl to be his gf so he can have tons of free sex!  As to the reason why he doesn't use a condom?? I can guess that he's too cheap to use one and also bec he does not like the feeling etc??? all these and other stupid reasons for wat?? risk a pregnancy??? what the hell ... its completely obvious that he is one low life who thinks of nothing but his dick and how to get the most out of the situation!  love her?? what love??  there is no love there just exploitation.<br><br>Both parties are not thinking!  No boundries were set!  If the guy is the same one who was responsible for the 1st preg... gosh... she needs to wake up to this man reallly soon before he does any more harm to her.  if its a different man... she really has some serious issues that she needs to deal with.... before she makes the same stupid mistake with the next guy!!!!.<br><br>Whatever it is that your fren has to do, she has to do! After she has done it, tell her to open her eyes and see that she is being exploited by the very guy who claims to love her!  what love??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>As for herself... she needs help too.  she needs to know what love actually mean!  love does not do that!! She  needs to change the way she view herself and her short term perspective if not when the baby is aborted... the pressure to change and wake up is lost and she may go back to having unprotected sex! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad">  why?? <strong>bec she forgets the pain alrady  </strong><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"> and she may end up repeating it and bec she is only 19!!! and also bec she is only 19 means that unfortunately there are plenty of opp and time to repeat! shhhhhh! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br><strong>Girls... pls pls pls.. from a guy... pls...  dont trade your body for love...no matter how much you crave it and long for it ... no matter how much nice words and actions is done for you.... keep your V or if not at least keep your body for someone who will be with you for the rest of your life not any passing boy who promises you the world but cannot deliver! These type of boys are totally not worth it.. they will surely cause you pain</strong><br><br>This unfortunate situation has already happen.. its the here and now and the tommorrow that she needs to focus on<br><br></div>
