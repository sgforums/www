            <div class='col-md body'>another death sentence made on an innocent unborn life. it's not a piece of tissue - the baby is <strong>a life</strong> the moment it was concieved,<br><br>i agree with bear that this gal is irresponsible. if the gal want to have sex, she is responsible for her own actions. it is really sad that she does not see impact her actions would have on the baby and her future.<br><br>gal, if you firmly believe that abortion is the way out, then for your sake and your future's, please consider this:<br><br><strong>IUD</strong><br><br>- it can be inserted straight after the abortion. failure rate for this is the lowest (less then 0.01%) and once inserted, u don't have to think abt it anymore. all u need to do after that is to do a check up every 3 months or so. the side effects for this would depend on the type of IUD choosen. do ask the doctor/gynae about it.<br><br>i plead the gal to be sensible and do wat is best.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
