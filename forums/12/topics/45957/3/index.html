            <div class='col-md body'>|Uv`-f|UtE-`<br><br>It's entirely my ex's fault: She also say her mum forbids her to have relationship, that our religion clash, and so on.<br><br>I felt open and free when i talk to my current gf. BTW, i was already talking and chatting a lot to my current gf (let's call her Z) when i was together with my ex. U c, my ex likes to talk and have fun or company around her buddy and i did tell her that becos of that i feel neglected. My ex said this: "Aiyah, i noe lah, u tell her(referring to her buddy) urself also lah" I Feel very  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> Over phone cannot talk, face to face also no chance.<br><br>Moreover, when we out together or even together, her buddy will tag along and both of them hand in hand walk happily together, leaving me behind (like i a pervert stalking them).<br><br>initially, i feel that Z was just another female friend that i can talk to as i cant talk to my ex a lot. She's always so attentive to me and we have laughter and joy and all these happen when my ex was around us(we walk as a group often). But 6 mths later, i soon realise that i something's not rite.Y, am i crying throughout the nite? Is she worthit? Wat about Z, we seems to get along together and she's still single. We chat, we discuss homework, we joke over the phone and i practically call her everynite(gf Z).<br><br>Finally, i made a decision as again she turn down my offer to go out with me during the Sch holidays. I broke up with her and felt shaken! but relieved of a heavy burden. And i started dating Z (actually is asking her out, i didnt let her know that i like her or i want to date her, just need her company to go window shopping).<br>Was delighted that she agreed, and we went out everyday, and really have fun, fool around with her(healthy one like hiding at one corner and give her the scare).<br><br>All these while, ex did not contact me.... I didnt feel a thing either... Slowly but surely, i subconsiously started puting my hands around Z on her shoulder sometimes(lke a buddy). She didnt mind. Then i continued with a hand around her waist sometimes and she didnt push it away. And finally i held her hands as we about to cross the road and she didnt qn me after that. (Later when we together, she told me that she was shocked tat i held her shoudler, waist and even her hands, The hand part was really a shock to her but she act normal).<br><br>All this dating ended in a month.... And we were together!Yehhhh..<br><br>So nvm if u neglected him, dump him and find another one.My ex asked me why i never contacted her(after a month from breakup and i was already attached to Z). It's all over....... The guy will find someone new too.<br><br>please heed my advice, drop that guy and let him be with that bandgirl or whatsoever. 'Cos they will haunt him again and again...<br></div>

At least he did not two-timed me..<br>I believe its quite alright to develop a liking for other girls despite the face that he is still attached.. Anyway its onli a small crush..<br>And i did let him down once when i had a crush on a guy in my class last yr..<br>Trust has to be accumulated slowly , since i still choose to be by his side.. He promised to try his best to change for me so i've decided not to gif him up afterall..<br>Thanks a great deal for ur concern ~ However , i'll bear ur words in mind  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

The 'good' point being the reason why the relationship might 'last' longer.... The bad point is though it would drag the duration of your relationship a little longer, it also adds more 'complications' to it....<br><br>The reason why you starting to doubt this relationship... Probably he's having a little of that too...? Just that this is his 1st BGR, so he could probably be a little more 'blind' to what's going on... Or should I say uncertain...? Nonetheless, humans are instinctive creatures by nature... He'll probably figure his way out in time to come... Coupled with his characteristics, chances are pretty high....<br><br>I'm not saying that both of you cannot be together... But both of you would have to organise your thoughts well and derive what you can't get out of a BGR from your LIFE instead... That level of management is certainly no easy task, not to mention that he's someone new to this BGR thing....<br><br>But your thoughts...? Kinda weak too...? The relationship can be described like a chick hatching out of its egg... SOFT SHELL &amp; the IMPULSES eager to break through into the unknown....<br><br>TIME would probably let nature takes its course... It could be avoided... But quite VERY DIFFICULT... Major dependency is HIM &amp; STRATEGY to overcome this... If withholding this relationship, many more challenges would lie ahead for now... It's not that both of you can't be... Just that age range and mentality matters do not favor this relationship for now....<br></div>
