            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe i should elaborate further...<br>A few weeks ago , i smsed my god-sister (She was my bf's bandmate cum schoolmate) ... If i remembered correctly , about one and a half year back , she smsed my bf , telling him that she liked him ... Well , the exact content of the sms , i'm not sure ...In the beginning , i really disliked her ... She knew that we are together , still very loving then , but choosed to confess her feelings for my bf. Back then , i really wondered whats her motive of letting him know , is she going to snatch him away from me or what ... But slowly , i get to know her better and she is that type of friend that won't abandon you and will stand by you , encouraging you when you are facing some difficult problems .... I started to like her as a friend ....<br>Opps , i'm going off point...Back to the topic.She told me that my bf confessed his feelings for another of his bandmate (my god-sis's fren) ... And i was damn pissed off , theres this resentment in me that can't be lifted off easily ..... All along he gave me the impression that he is that type of guy , very faithful and loyal , won't go n flirt around with other girls behind my back , therefore this new discovery really dumped me straight down into the well...<br>Today , while confronting my bf on the phone , i realised that as long as when i'm happy , sweet and loving , he is there for me and loved me as much as i love him ..... but when i'm upset , angry and depressed , he'll leave me on my own to settle the problems alone and his love for me will drop....After that started to develop feelings for some other girls who he thinks r nice....<br>I've put in a lot of efforts in this relationship , trying my best to maintain and improve it. Whenever he is facing some problems , be it in his life or academically , i'll try to encourage and motivate him...When he complained that he is usually very hungry all the time due to lack of insufficient funds for his meals , i bought food and stock up instant noodles for him....When he do not have enough money for movies or some other activites , i'll subsidise the rest of the money...I've done a lot of things for him but he doesn't seems to appreciate everything...All i can say that he is a let-down...<br>And i'm also disappointed  in myself , i noe i can find other guys much better den him (dare to say that my personality is good compared to other gals and i look presentable)....But no matter how hard i try , i can't force myself not to love him anymore....<br></div>

How can you capture a man without his heart?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Next issue - if he betray you once, sort things out and if it is reasonable or you giving him the benefit of the doubt - forgive and move on. HOWEVER - when things happened again - forget about it, this guy ain't appreciative and truthful. Can't bear to do it? Very likely he will continue his act and by then you will be emotionally drained to death.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The choice remains with you - to cry over a long period of time, or end it with a single day/week and be happy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
