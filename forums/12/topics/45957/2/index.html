It will also keep reminding you about how sorry your state is in.<br><br>You should do the opposite instead. You should stand up on your own feet and depend on yourself. Live for yourself and not him! Perhaps it's easier said than done, your mind must be questioning this right now? But, never fret, give yourself time to get over this. But remember don't keep telling yourself that you want to forget this. The more you tell yourself to forget, the more you'll remember every single good memories which will be painful memories. Just live your life as normal and usual.<br><br>Commit yourself in things that you like to engaged in. Catch up with your girlfriends for coffee, gossip or shopping. And gradually, you'll realise you've put him at the back of your mind.<br><br>He's not worth anything from you from the day he went astray. </span><br><br><span style="color: violet;">lavender_scent</span></div>
