The person that really needed help isn't her it's her sister, or sisters. For her what you can do is cheer her up try to let her know, even though family ties are very important, but she can still survive without them. Nothing in this world is indispensable. =)<br><br>This is your second topic, you really should try solving this things by yourself not mainly relying on what people comment. Try and solve the problems on the spot for them. Most of the time they just need you to listen.</div>

You probably can't do much to make your girlfriend's siblings to be pleased with her or to make her parents understand her more unless she is willing to make herself more active or more involved with her own family. Though she felt hurt about what had happened in the past she must also realized that her parents love her still because she is their daughter.<br><br>I feel that you can help her by listening to her and let her expressed whatever she feels about her family and about herself. I think you can also guide her to learn more ways to understand others by asking her to put herself in other people shoes and what, and why they behaved in such a manner. I would do that because I think we all are not perfect and perhaps after seeing the situation that we could cause that situation rather than due to other people, probably we could see things clearer. I think to understand others and those you loved is part of oneself ability to understand oneself too.<br><br>You take good care of her alright.<br><br>With Love,<br>Joe<br><br></div>
