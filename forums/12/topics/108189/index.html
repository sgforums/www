Mum not able cos sometimes she see thing blur. monthly income is less than $1200. So before NS, I work part-time but the pay I need to give my parents for family uses. THen I can only secretly take about 18% of the pay for my own expenses such as mobile bills and food and sometimes need to buy things. I have a gf but then now we are starting to save also. At times I had to borrow money and sell my things oso.<br><br>Now I'm in NS. The pay decrease alot. And now I can only take about 15% of the pay which is too little for me. I had to support family also.  I am beginning to owe mobile bills already. I am planning to see what I can sell also. However, its really very hard for me to think of more solutions. I am cutting down on expenses also. Even now me and my girlfriend sometimes go dutch too. I tried to apply for financial assistance from SAF but its not easy due to the fact that my supervisor is always busy.<br><br>I'm trying to find a job that I can do at home such as data entry but its hard to find such a job.<br><br>I told my parents about this situtation but it seems that there's nothing much they can do too.<br><br>I'm really at a loss.<br><br>Please help.</div>

The skills and free training picked up in the airforce/navy applicable to outside world. Also if SAF setup another airbase or training facility they will send all the support personnel there also. I read sometime back that Senior Aircraft Technician working for SAT or SIA can earn quite good living.<br><br>Had a friend who followed her hubby overseas training when SAF bought new combat platforms. She told us all accomodation &amp; food fully paid for plus got overseas allowance also. Only thing family members not allowed to do was work, so she went for her masters degree ... even that they fully paid.<br><br>she really enjoyed herself.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Right now, get your parents interviewed,  it is troublesome but atleast if successful, it will get you stay out.<br><br>Do some financial planning, see how much you are earning/spending per month. Then do some trimming, some things don't need want just cancel it, or HP can use pre-paid card, etc, etc.<br><br>Bottom line is, you have to do NS, so just tight your belt over this period first.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The best (and most logical idea) would be to approach your superiors. Obviously they can't give out instant cash, but if it's a genuine financial hardship case, I'm sure they will be able to help.<br><br>Once during combat medic course a friend of mine related to me the story of his friend who was having serious financial problems. He approached the CO for help.<br><br>The CO somehow pulled strings, and..... poof! The guy got promoted to corporal. Normally it takes a year before an A Level/Diploma enlistee can become a corporal.<br><br>It's just a slight increase in pay, but every little bit helps.<br><br>Not saying this will happen to you, though.... just saying that approaching your superiors would be the best solution.</div>
