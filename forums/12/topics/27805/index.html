To think that he might still have feelings for you... That he still care for you... You're confused even in your own thoughts... How can you possibly know what's going on in his mind...? Give yourself some time to 'rest' and handle the more important things in your Life like EXAMINATIONS for now...<br><br>The papers for your 'luv test' are not here yet... Shift your mind a bit... And awaits the INSPIRATIONS and new ideas which might be in store for you in the future... Why get stuck when you might have better options in the future..? Don't think about... If you must, ask him to wait... Say you'll have to handle your exams 1st...<br><br>We shall see from there...?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">"I hold my bird in the cage... My broken cage... If birds are meant to fly they'll eventually fly off.... Everyday I look at my beautiful bird... Yet sad... Very afraid that it'll escape through the open edge.... Perhaps I should tie it up...? Perhaps I should remove its feathers...? Then it'll be my bird forever...? But... Never will it be the same bird which was once so beautiful in my eyes.... Everyday I walk pass my cage... Looking at my lovely little bird.... If birds are meant to fly... They'll fly off eventually...."</span></div>
