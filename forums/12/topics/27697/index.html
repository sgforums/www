            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all,<br><br>Jus a bad evening today at orchard rd. There were a group of surveyers on the street doing survey for RCI the Asia Travel Club. The survey questions doesn't mention much on this club. Question like how often you shop at orchard rd? Which shopping centre you like most? What type of credit cards you r holding? What is your monthly income?<br><br>ok after these survey has done. They give you a lucky draw coupon to see what prize you have won. Surprisely i won the top prize 1 wk free accomdation stay sponsor by RCI of a choice of 12 countries. But in order to get this you have to attend a so call 90 mins talk at UOB building next to OG. Don't believe it i end staying there for 3 hours. beside Wasting my shopping times, the most angry part is that they want you to sign up a membership plan cost ard $20k. At first the surveyer say don't worry they are not asking me to pay anything jus need to attend the talk only. In the end i refuse to sign up the plan, wah the so call asshole manager face became black showing me his unhappy attitude and using very sickening words to insult me.<br><br>Oh gosh...wat a day for me...sucks rite. Happily go shopping end up in this shit. In the end i did get the gift from his unwilling manners. I mean wat so great about this top prize nothing is free in this world. Can't be bother i throw away the gift its not worth it. Sorry for writing so many things but i jus want to warn all the brothers and sisters here dun be greedy. Always remember nothings is free....Unless you are a rich people or you travel alots still can consider.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by loso76:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi all,<br><br>Jus a bad evening today at orchard rd. There were a group of surveyers on the street doing survey for RCI the Asia Travel Club. The survey questions doesn't mention much on this club. Question like how often you shop at orchard rd? Which shopping centre you like most? What type of credit cards you r holding? What is your monthly income?<br><br>ok after these survey has done. They give you a lucky draw coupon to see what prize you have won. Surprisely i won the top prize 1 wk free accomdation stay sponsor by RCI of a choice of 12 countries. But in order to get this you have to attend a so call 90 mins talk at UOB building next to OG. Don't believe it i end staying there for 3 hours. beside Wasting my shopping times, the most angry part is that they want you to sign up a membership plan cost ard $20k. At first the surveyer say don't worry they are not asking me to pay anything jus need to attend the talk only. In the end i refuse to sign up the plan, wah the so call asshole manager face became black showing me his unhappy attitude and using very sickening words to insult me.<br><br>Oh gosh...wat a day for me...sucks rite. Happily go shopping end up in this shit. In the end i did get the gift from his unwilling manners. I mean wat so great about this top prize nothing is free in this world. Can't be bother i throw away the gift its not worth it. Sorry for writing so many things but i jus want to warn all the brothers and sisters here dun be greedy. Always remember nothings is free....Unless you are a rich people or you travel alots still can consider.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br></div></blockquote>Hey guys and gals out there,<br><br>THe RCI our friend say here is not good one. Sad to say, My Mum sign out for it and pay for say abt 20K and now trying to sell her memebrship, and after trying to sell it for many mths still no result. So please don't sign up. Also don't believe there is something so good to be won so easily. If there had the money to spent on prize like this in bad econ days, they will keep it for themsleves liao. The only lucky draws are maybe those that advertise till very big in newspaper or on TV</div>
