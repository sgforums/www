It's also understandable to feel sad &amp; alittle guilty BUT the cause of ur frenZ's death is not ur intention &amp; u shouldnt shoulder the blame urself &amp; all the guiltyness.<br>Look outside ur paraidgm, move out &amp; let go the stone from the bottom of ur heart.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, be realistic and don't expect to get over it immediately, even with logical reasoning that its really not your fault (which it really isn't!).  This is because your mind is still in semi-shock mode.<br><br>It takes time for the effects to cool off.  While it is unrealistic to forget it totally (we can't forget history), it would be very possible to let the effects diminish till they become harmless.

What makes me even more sad is the fact that his family doesn't even clean his grave anymore *shakes fist in anger*... can't help but wonder whether I'm the only one that hasn't moved on.</div>
