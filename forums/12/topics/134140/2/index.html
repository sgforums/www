Since that fateful day, that person has never left a day wasting by without doing something he had wanted to do all his life. Watch his favourite movies, travel to exotic places, learn a new language, write a book of personal memoirs, and coming to terms with his religion.<br><br>Life is so fragile. No one knows which day would be his or her very last day on this world. However, everyone knows that when it is his or her time to go, there is nothing in this world that could prevent that from coming to pass.<br><br>Your best friend died because his time was up, and he has been recalled by the Maker from this world to begin another journey in the next. I may sound fatalistic, but I believe even if he had not make the trip to get you your present, he would still have passed on in some other way.<br><br>Don't blame yourself for your best friend's passing, for he would never have wanted his death to be a burden of guilt to the living, especially to you among the ones he had loved. Place him instead inside the deepest recesses of your heart, and keep within the memories of his laughter and cheer as he would have you remember him. Treasure every moment of your life, enrich it, live it to the fullest as if he were still with you. Above all, make his passing meaningful such that, bless his soul wherever he is, he would rejoice and be proud of you.</div>
