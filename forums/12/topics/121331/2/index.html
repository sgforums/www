Whatever you're doing for her now... Sacrifices and everything... Don't have some 'fat hope' that she might just fall for you there after... Don't even think that she actually owes you anything after that... Afterall, she kept REMINDING YOU... <span style="font-style: italic;">"We're only friends...."</span></div></blockquote>you also can feel i doing too much... y she cant...  btw she is 21 im 22.. sometimes she would hint me that she need something den she would says its joking.. wat i think is she wanted me to buy things for her or help her wif a surprise... remember she complaint to me that i used to be very gd to her... always gv her surprises... n when i stop gving her all tis she ask me y... hai... yea i did think before this not nomally a friend will do.. but y she still request many things from me if she thinks that she treated me as friend afterall.. tbe feeling making me like a bf to her yet to her is not... if friend she know herself that things she need cant b asking lots from me... but i feel enjoying it doing for someone i like.. but she dun like... haiya...</div>
