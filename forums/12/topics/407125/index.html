              <p>Hello everyone. Would like to seek your advise.</p>
              <p>Some background about me. I am nearing my 30s and am working in the Govt Sector. The house that i am currently residing in is shared with my mother. I pay for the mortgage while my mum pays for the bills using the revenue from renting the rooms out.</p>
              <p>The problem that i am facing now is that i am in debt. I owe the banks about 20k and am in need of help. I tried to ask my mum to sell the house in order to help me out but she adamantly refuses to do so. She claims that this is her 3rd time buying a house and she will not be able to buy another one from the govt if she sells it away.</p>
              <p>I have lost all interest in my work and at times living as well. But of course i am not going to end my life and be a coward. I have even went to the extent of thinking of running away to another country because i feel so disappointed in myself. I don't really like my job. Took up the job only because of my family situation in the past(mum wanted me to join this line and help her with the financial matters in the past). And being in debt just makes me feel so demoralised. I will be able to settle my debts within a yr based on my salary though and if i am disciplined enough with my expenditure.</p>
              <p>But I am not willing to wait for a year !! I wish to clear off my debts asap and start my life anew. I really do not know how to persuade my mum to sell off the house to help me. It's not as if i will abandon her or whatsoever. I suggested selling off the place and renting out a flat in the meantime (i'll pay for the rental etc). She keeps refusing my suggestions and i am really feeling very vexed about my current situation. I see some of my friends who have financial problems and their parents help them out. This being my own house and i can't even have a say about it?</p>
              <p>Anyone has any suggestions to offer? Filing for bankruptcy is not an option. Thanks.</p>

              <p>well though u will take care of her no matter what but still, selling the house to finance your personal debts is a pretty selfish act. To your mum, that means everything to her. You will make her sad if you do so. You keep asking yourself..what she can do for you. How abt yourself? What can you do for her? And it is only respectful if we as children give in more to our parents than they to us. You are not yet thirty and you have time on your side. What about your mum?</p>
              <p>One year to clear all debts is not very long.  Renting a flat at this age of your mum may make her feel very insecure. May even be a laughing stock if friends and relatives know about it.</p>
              <p>Refrain from comparing too. Every family has its own troubles and is unique. Basis for comparisons are pointless. Start thinking what you can do for your mum if you really love her.That is, if you really love her.</p>
              <p>My 2 cents worth.</p>

              <p>Fire Cracker - I got into debt starting from a Traffic accident that i got into in 2006. Needed about 9k to reduce my vehicle loss (else i would have to declare a total loss for the vehicle) and out of desperation drew it from my credit cards. After that, i started to gamble and my bro's friend bet at my side and lost about 12k of which he didn't clear. I cleared the debt (big lesson learnt) and started to gamble more to reduce my losses. Helping my brother clear his loan shark debts (3 times) also led to my downfall. Basically it was due to my desire to clear my debts in the soonest possible way which in my opinion at that time was to gamble (soccer online betting). I have since stopped gambling for about 7 months but i find myself getting addicted to partying just to stay away from my home. That's a new addiction that i am suffering from currently. I know i need help. Just confused and ashamed to approach anyone therefore seeking for opinions through the forum. And to think that i was the most successful and looked up to by all my relatives and cousins. Just down in the dumps down.</p>

              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>would like to ask....my SO was given a writ of summon and his motoring company is suing him for up to 9k of debts due to late payment and his bike was repossessed. To stop the legal proceedings, the company is asking for 5k in 8 days time before they will allow an installment plan. He is currently working 2 jobs to clear all his debts and he definitely cannot achieve 5k in such a short time.</p>
              <p>His friends and family members are of no use, and I've been helping him little by little every month without my parents knowing. I have a v strict family and I can't help him much financially other than $2-300/month.</p>
              <p>My question is... is there a possible jail term if he goes to court?</p>
              <p>From the above, I informed him of DebtReform and we'll see how that goes..</p>

              <p>asking your mum to sell the house is out of the question, she know what you are up to and she is not stupid.</p>
              <p>the very 1st thing u need to do is to kick off your addiction to partying and be a good boy staying at home watching tv and suck thumb. lol</p>
              <p>20k is not a lot of money and one year is not very long to stick your @ss onto it till the dept is clear.</p>
              <p>there is no easy way out, all u need is discipline and determination. you have to do it yourself cos no one is able to help you.</p>

              <p>Hello everyone. Would like to seek your advise.</p>
              <p>Some background about me. I am nearing my 30s and am working in
                  the Govt Sector. The house that i am currently residing in is
                  shared with my mother. I pay for the mortgage while my mum pays for
                  the bills using the revenue from renting the rooms out.</p>
              <p>The problem that i am facing now is that i am in debt. I owe the
                  banks about 20k and am in need of help. I tried to ask my mum to
                  sell the house in order to help me out but she adamantly refuses to
                  do so. She claims that this is her 3rd time buying a house and she
                  will not be able to buy another one from the govt if she sells it
                  away.</p>
              <p>I have lost all interest in my work and at times living as well.
                  But of course i am not going to end my life and be a coward. I have
                  even went to the extent of thinking of running away to another
                  country because i feel so disappointed in myself. I don't really
                  like my job. Took up the job only because of my family situation in
                  the past(mum wanted me to join this line and help her with the
                  financial matters in the past). And being in debt just makes me
                  feel so demoralised. I will be able to settle my debts within a yr
                  based on my salary though and if i am disciplined enough with my
                  expenditure.</p>
              <p>But I am not willing to wait for a year !! I wish to clear off
                  my debts asap and start my life anew. I really do not know how to
                  persuade my mum to sell off the house to help me. It's not as if i
                  will abandon her or whatsoever. I suggested selling off the place
                  and renting out a flat in the meantime (i'll pay for the rental
                  etc). She keeps refusing my suggestions and i am really feeling
                  very vexed about my current situation. I see some of my friends who
                  have financial problems and their parents help them out. This being
                  my own house and i can't even have a say about it?</p>
              <p>Anyone has any suggestions to offer? Filing for bankruptcy is
                  not an option. Thanks.</p>

              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>would like to ask....my SO was given a writ of summon and his
                  motoring company is suing him for up to 9k of debts due to late
                  payment and his bike was repossessed. To stop the legal
                  proceedings, the company is asking for 5k in 8 days time before
                  they will allow an installment plan. He is currently working 2 jobs
                  to clear all his debts and he definitely cannot achieve 5k in such
                  a short time.</p>
              <p>His friends and family members are of no use, and I've been
                  helping him little by little every month without my parents
                  knowing. I have a v strict family and I can't help him much
                  financially other than $2-300/month.</p>
              <p>My question is... is there a possible jail term if he goes to
                  court?</p>
              <p>From the above, I informed him of DebtReform and we'll see how

              <p>Fire Cracker - I got into debt starting from a Traffic accident
              that i got into in 2006. Needed about 9k to reduce my vehicle loss
              (else i would have to declare a total loss for the
              vehicle) and out of desperation drew it from my credit cards.
              After that, i started to gamble and my bro's friend bet at my side
              and lost about 12k of which he didn't clear. I cleared the debt
              (big lesson learnt) and started to gamble more to reduce my losses.
              Helping my brother clear his loan shark debts (3 times) also
              led to my downfall. Basically it was due to my desire to clear
              my debts in the soonest possible way which in my opinion at that
              time was to gamble (soccer online betting). I have since stopped
              gambling for about 7 months but i find myself getting addicted to
              partying just to stay away from my home. That's a new
              addiction that i am suffering from currently. I know i need
              help. Just confused and ashamed to approach anyone therefore
              seeking for opinions through the forum. And to think that i was the
              most successful and looked up to by all my relatives and cousins.
              Just down in the dumps down.</p>

              <p>20k only want to kill yourself and sell off house. Wat a moron.</p>
              <p>Your mother is correct not to let you sell the house.</p>
              <p>You can't even handle your personal finances properly now, after sell house liao how are you going to come up with the money to get her a roof back ?</p>
              <p>First off, are you done with your gambling and irresponsible partying ? If you are still not a convert, you are hopeless. No advise will save you.</p>
              <p>If you have learnt your lessons from irresponsibility. Then here is hope you can do to dig yourself out of the debt. 20K debt only it's not a big number relatively speaking.</p>
              <p>How much are you earning per month ?  The debt is credit card debt only ? or do you owe loan sharks and friends/family ?</p>
              <p>Come up with a realistic payment plan. Eat humble pie. If you need to seek the lender's help to extend payment period so your monthly payment is smaller , do so.</p>
              <p>Pride and face value is worth nothing during times of crisis.</p>
              <p>DO NOT run away from your debtors, you will incur more losses by running away and avoiding debt calls or collectors.</p>
