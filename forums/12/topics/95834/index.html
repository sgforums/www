How do i know whether am i very deeply in love with someone?

It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easilly angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres."<br><br>Love is also courage and strength, it is not about money, nor is it about status but it is more of a feelings. It is the strength of being able to work together during hard times, the strength of being able to forgive and forget.<br><br>You know you are in love with someone when you care about him/her. As in truly care. You want to stand by him during happiness and sadness, and his/her happiness is of utmost importance to you. Even one smile can make your day seems much brighter...<br><br>For me, love is about giivng. So I dun really care who loves who most in a relationship. As long as we are together, I will give him my best. I dun care whether he gives more or less, but I will feel contented that I have loved with all that I have.<br><br>Just my opinion. Not that I am that experienced hehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br>i.c.y</div>

When u keep thinking about him.. and u just want to be with him..<br><br>What happens if ur partner tells u that he cannot love u as much as u loves him?<br><br>I think there really depends on the situation.

Love is a feeling which attracts you to care for another person. True love will never turn to hate and with love comes happiness.<br><br>Continue to love and care for your loved ones until the day comes when you wake up in the morning and realised that you don't love him anymore. Then you will be eventually released from all the pain that this love has brought you.<br><br>Love doesn't requires any reason to begin and it certainly doesn't require one to end. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HEy... Even if i find another girl... It would most probably be like her.. .. And i doubt i be truely loving her.. I could never forget her... You know how we communicate? We never quarreled.. Cuz we share our feelings through diaries.. Everynight we write out our feelings for each other to share... Therefore there was no miscommunication.. It was beautiful... I dun tink i will ever forgot..</div>
