Its a working world and society, you gotta withstand critics now and then. You cannot just blow off because of something stupid. Imagine this happening in an important meeting?<br>Its because they have stupid comments, that you dont have to give a two shit about them! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
