              Perhaps, what is needed here is to be more circumspect and handle it in a manner that no one comes away feeling ''lousy'' or alienated. He needs empathy more than anything else. Making him wrong is not the way to go lah - it is utterly divisive and moreover when one lives in the same household - it may worsening and strain ...

              <p>What I find to be the most disturbing is the fact that he seem to peep at you or leer at you when you are at the kitchen.</p>
              <p>That means that there is a chance that he might have some sexual thoughts or sexual fantasy about you.</p>
              <p>This means it is rather unsafe for you to stay together with him.</p>
              <p>Regarding masturbating.......I have no comment because in a way it is one's own personal habit and one's own individual business.</p>
              <p>But leering at you, is, something that is affecting you and is no longer a personal issue.</p>
              <p>To me I think it is unacceptable if he has done that, because he has failed to control himself and respect you as a new family member, and it is taboo and forbidden to do that because it can be considered as incest, it is something that is crossing the line. If he takes you as daugther-in-law, he should have 0 sexual thoughts whatsoever.</p>
              <p>So for your case I would be more concerned about your safety and security.</p>
              <p>I think you must find a way to live on your own.</p>
              <p>You can think about this and find a strategy to talk to your husband. I am not sure whether you should be open with him and tell him 100% or whether you should find some other excuse. The choice is yours. But if I am you I would definitely start thinking and pushing in that direction.</p>

              <p>He been seen twice doing it.</p>
