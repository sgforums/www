              <p>Do you know that after 40 plus, woman will lose their ability to give birth. Men will lost their ability to produce sperm at 50 plus. Technically, grandparents are sexless?</p>

              <p>Firstly there is nothing wrong with masturbating, if not done in excess.</p>
              <p>You feel its disgusting, why? Because you see it? OK granted the sight is pornographic. Normal sexual acts if chanced upon is also horrid. If you see your father and mother humping, it is also disgusting. Sexual acts should be done in private. But sometimes, privacy is invaded, inadvertantly. Thats what happened in your case.</p>
              <p>Next time you catch you FIL wanking, just laugh, and say, "You enjoying yourself ah." and close the door. As DIL, please don't assist him in any way.</p>
              <p>Its better than him going to Geylang, or to the aunty next door.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for the response. I tried to post my reply just now but it didn't appear so i gotta retype &amp; try again. I still have respect for my FIL because he's an elderly &amp; he's my hubby's father &amp; he's my FIL. The growing hatred is due to the fact of his indecent exposure of sight &amp; sound over a repeated period of time plus his frequent peeping @ me. This is mentally disturbing. I know its normal to masterbate but its where &amp; how one does it. If there's no balance &amp; ability to manage one's desire &amp; expectation then it can become other people's problem. I disagree that disgusting is to pretend and foist one's morality on others. Privacy is meant to be private for one's sense of feeling hearing seeing speaking &amp; thinking but if there's an exposure then where's the so called privacy. Its like walking being naked in own home yet can be seen by neighbours. That's disgusting! I know that one time or another i won't that. The word hypocrite is too vague &amp; superficial to use in almost every normal situation and it can be better examined. I'm lost @ how am i going to handle this without creating further negative feelings for myself &amp; my family. I'm taking the comments here with open mind &amp; glad to know this place exist for people like me to confide share my thoughts &amp; feelings. It helps to broaden my perspective &amp; options. I can't be moving out because its our new flat we just moved in and yes i admit i wished i don't have to live with my parents inlaw!</div>

              <p>Elder Care center. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> I guess you are full time housewife, correct me if I am wrong.</p>
              <p>Both my parents are working full time, and we decided to enrol my grandmother to elder day care center with transport provided. I'm not too sure about the price, but if money is not a factor, you can try convincing that your FIL will be doing better at the day care center.</p>
              <p>At the day care center, there are many people providing care for the elderly. Most care center have a routine i.e. breakfast, then little masuclar exercise, lunch, tv, etc. Do consider my suggestion, it may help you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>

              <p><br>Yes. My (paternal) grandmother felt much more cheerful after going to the elder care center. For my maternal grandmother, she is also very depressed because nobody attend to her all the time. After my maternal enrol to elder care center, within 1 week, everyone notices her cheerfulness again.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for your suggestion. I was thinking of asking my hubby to talk to my FIL to encourage him to go out mingle with friends &amp; do some group exercise &amp; activities so that he won't be bored &amp; do bored things at home. I'm not sure if this elder care centre works for him... i really wish i will not encounter this again. Its not what i want. It just happened! I'm not a full time housewife. Thankfully! It might not be twice...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Your FILsleep in the masterbed room correct? so naturally he will do that lah, please pity all these old man, there is actually nothing left in them, it took him 8 years to do one masterbed, more longer than olympic. I hope as a DIL, you can also see how to help him when he is doing, then when he finally call for the day, he may give you more of his assets and go peacefully, as for you, not only you gain but also feel filial piety of what you had done for him.</p></div>

              <p>You can help to masturbate him until he is too tired to do any harm to you. Or you can faster finish him off by masturbating him to death.</p>
              <p>I once watch a jap porno, a nurse masturbated a guy until his sperm shot out like jet stream 4 feet up in air.</p>
