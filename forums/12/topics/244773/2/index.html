            <div class='col-md body'>I suffered from what could be depression (or a strong urge to depend and be depended on, but that's a story I won't dwell) once. I don't know if it is true cause I never sought for help, even though my friends all tried to force me to seek a consoller or medical help. Instead i just reasoned it out with myself, a personal battle for 2 long years, and I found reason to carry on: Happiness.<br><br>It is tough (even for me) to put psychological disorders (bipolar, paranoia, depression, mania) as 'medical conditions' since it all deals with the mind, not some bateria or virus, and it is difficult even for the experts to really diagoise such problems, due to their variety and difference from patient to patient.<br><br>I believe in no faith, therefore everything about 'God's help' means little to me. Rather, I believed that my own actions will influence myself, and people around me. In those 2 years of battling and erasing a past, this belief of 'cause and effect' works.<br><br>The largest factor that brings happiness is friends. All you need is for one to smile, a sincere compliment you don't expect, and suddenly the world is a better place. I actively try to do that occasionally (cause complimenting too much makes one sound insincere) and maybe it is karma, but it sometimes get returned.<br><br>If you want to be happy, choose happiness, then make it happen. The choice of happiness is always given to you. You just either don't see it, or don't believe that certain choices can make you happier.<br><br>But also a bit of wisdom: do not expect happiness to drop overnight, nor expect friends to be there all the time for you (they have their own problems as well). Sustained effort will lead to glory eventually, even if it takes years.<br><br>Perhaps even the choice of trying to be happy alone, is good enough.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>from a medical standpt depression is an illness just like heart disease or liver probs etc are. it's due to biochemical imbalances in the brain. so see a doctor if u think u have it.<br><br>definition's quite precise tho, think it's like:<br><br>at least 2 weeks of persistent low mood (VERY low mood) or finding absolute meaningless in life, with other features affecting function like inability to eat or sleep properly, or no ability to enjoy hobbies or activities.<br><br>many have thots of ending it all as well.<br><br>seek psychiatric help if needed.<br><br>a lot of ppl have persistent low mood too which may be helped by counselling. but gotta agree that you have to be willing to be give it a chance and be open about things with other ppl. otherwise, it's not going to be useful..<br><br>all the best.</div>
