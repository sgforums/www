            <div class='col-md body'>haiz...this is my 1st post and i also having some problem. Right now, I juz being too confuse.<br><br>You see, this few weeks,I having some trouble in my r/s. My guy like this gal, and i found out abt this. I was so angry with him that he actually went to date this gal behind my back. Then I told him, I wanna break with him. He cry and finally he let me go. I tot I could let him go but I came to realise, I can't. So two days ltr, I ask for a patch back. He told me he need time to think. So i told him, I can give him time. So that week, I dun call him nor sms him until on sat he sms me, asking whether did i go out anot. I told him yes,I gg out ltr.<br>That night,finally he sms me cos normally he won't not sms me. I am always the one who sms him call him 1st. I was so delighted that he actually sms.<br>So next day, we went to church(every sun), he still talk to me.And he still joke with his family.<br><br>Then in the late afternoon, when we went back to his hse. he started to give me that "pissed off " face. I felt that something is wrong but i did not ask.<br>Until I wanted to go home, he send me home.In his car, I ask him, "are u not happy"He say no. I ask him whether did he have any problem.<br>He did not reply me.<br>I sense something is wrong, but i do not question him further.<br>Upon reaching my home, I ask him again.Iask him whether can he share his problem. He say he is fine, nothing is wrong. He started to get pissed off. Well, I tell him even if he doen't treat me like his gf, at least treat me like a frenz. I scold him, I told him. I really pissed off by his behaviour. He juz refuse to tell me what happen. Den he told me that I can dun bother abt him. He keep telling me how lousy he is. I told him, no, he not lousy at all.<br><br>Why at the same time he giving me hope and at the same time, shatter the hope???<br>Haiz... is he telling me to give up on him.Did i ask too much ques?<br>anyone can tell me what going in a guy mind? Anyone encounter this?<br>I really dunno what to do. Right now, I afraid that he might not sms me again.<br>I really want to give this r/s a chance. But how????</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There can be no excuse for cheating. You can accept his excuses, his behaviour, his tantrums all you want, but you have to ask yourself, is this the relationship you want to be in? He maybe interested in you, he may not, but the only thing you have to answer is, is this how you want to feel, perhaps forever? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's put this simply:<br><br>Does being in a relationship with this guy cause you pain? Think five years into the future - do you think you're going to still be in a relationship with him?<br><br>If the answer's no, then dump him. I know of girls who remain in shaky and strained relationships for no apparent reason, and they're always unhappy. Yet when I ask them why don't they just leave, they say that they're determined to make it work, no matter what. Sounds admirable, but they end up in unhappiness for years.<br><br>My advice to you: don't end up like one of those girls. If you don't think you can make it work, just leave.</div>
