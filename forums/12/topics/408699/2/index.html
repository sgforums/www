              <p>Hi friends,</p>
              <p>A few months ago something happened to me which has greatly affected me and I feel I have trouble letting go of it. Just want to know your opinions and advice.</p>
              <p>To put it simple, this colleague at work at that time insulted my father, who passed away a few years ago due to an incurable illness. He said something like, "your father die never mind". (Note also, I didn't really provoke him, all my other colleagues can vouch for that). Naturally, I got extremely angry, but I did not do anything as I knew I was in uniform. If I were to lash out I knew I would probably get in trouble myself.</p>
              <p>It has already been a few months and well, sad to say, it still affects me. Everytime I think of him or the situation I just get angry.</p>
              <p>A little about me: I can say for sure I am quite an angry person and sometimes angsty even, BUT I am not violent and know how and when to think straight. Heck, I have never gotten into a fight before!</p>
              <p>Anyway yes, this thing still affects me. I've tried to rationalize myself, talk to others, occupy my time, everything! But I still feel lots of anger when the whole thing subconciously flits into my mind. People tell me like I gotta let go; that dumb kid ain't worth your time; fighting no point one etc etc.</p>
              <p>Honestly, sometimes I feel a tinge of regret not punching that fella. I feel that unless I see him PHYSICALLY suffer infront of me, I will never be happy.</p>
              <p>This is probably the first most heartfelt sharing I have done regarding this incident.</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>
              </div>

              <p>Look, it seems that it is alright to insult other people's father at your company. Since he can get away scot free, why don't you in turn insult his mother. Tell him, his mother is so ugly, she is going to die. Then after that you feel a lot better.</p>

              <p>Well to be more specific on the situation, we were all just messing around and teasing each other in good fun. Then he got mad out of nowhere and starting insulting my parents. All of us were like wtf's wrong with you, then he started insulting my dad, so I said, "You know my dad passed away?" And he just said, "your dad die nvm lor"</p>
              <p>Another colleague went to talk to him and tried to make him apologize twice, but he refused.</p>

              <p><br>Hmm....don't allow him to get to you, that will only show how important his opinions meant to you.</p>
              <p>Will you find peace even if you kill him eventually? Like you said he's just a dumb kid, would you find peace in murdering a dumb kid?</p>
              <p>Why didn't you voice out your angry thoughts about him when the situation happened?</p>
              <p>You have lost that opportunity of window to defend for yourself, so make sure you do let him know what you think of him when the next opportunity arises.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Apology are not necessary unless you are a girl. Why not make a mental note to make his life miserable at work?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But it's up to different individual, I would choose to ignore people who aren't important to me and don't waste time associating with people who aren't good enough to be my friend.</p>

              <p>Even till the end of your life, you must be able to tell yourself that you have lived your life in your own way. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p><br>Make sure you react in the same measure of his reaction. If he gets away with what he said to you, this means that you can do the same.</p>
              <p>Whatever it is, don't punch or physically hurt him because that will send you out the door. I have heard of a dumbass front desk hotel worker got drunk during a company party and punched his boss in the face for insulting him. Next day, he is a goner.</p>
