            <div class='col-md body'>Feeling confuse and not sure my feeling now!<br><br>Just few months ago! I have uncondition love for my darling! Love her very deep. But recently know a gal. A dream gal which i always think will exist only in my dream. At the first of exquistence,i find her very quiet ,unappealing and moody lady which virtually i have no positive feeling towards her. After a few more days of communication,we start to have more than just work talk and I saw her smile which is very sweet( a contrasting viewof her cold look  I encounter on the first day).<br><br>She is not as quiet as she appears to be,she can joke with you when u know her more and not as bore as I think! In fact,she is a very caring and gentle lady. Once I accidently injured my hands and bleeds,she use her hand and quickly wipe my dirty blood off without hestitation and ask me for my well-being. Then there is once i was sick and inform her of her situation and i happen to tell her casually that i have a review check up for my illness. She can remember exactly the day before i need to go for review and remind me of it! After a few weeks I will say i was a little touch by her action! A really thoughtful and gentle lady..<br><br>A very well-manner ,sensible lady who will wait for all her know colleage to come before eating as they are all still queuing up! I was a bit surprise and embarrass by her act! I was digging in on my lunch while she sat there quietly and patiently waiting for other colleage(my colleage too) to all gather and sit down for their lunch before starting for her meal! Just like little well-manner children waiting for all the elders to sit first before touching the untensils for food. I was a little uneasy by her act and i too slowly put down my utensil and waits for other to arrive before handling the food. She also eat plainly and never wear branded clothes like her peer. She basically lives simplely. Never club,smoke and no bad habits.<br><br>While her working attitude is all employer likes to employ. She works non-stop from the moment she steps in office to the working time it ends. She is not those who really finds nothing to do,will see down surf the net a while or taking a small coffee break. She just continue to search and asking for work to do,no matter how difficult or tough the task is. She works sensibily by asking questions for every new task given to her. Showing she don works blindly.. She will volunteer to do the works herself and even do works quietly so as not to her so called ' trouble others' . She is those type who will try her best to do everythings herself  and only seek help when impossible to handle that task like carry a 30 kg load. Then she will seek help. She is very courteous and will say thank you all the times after a task is complete and every single help without fail.<br><br>To me,she is just like an angel... She still got which too many virtues to mentions in her! I was like ' Can such gal still possible to exist in this world?'<br><br>Today,I have a fight with my ger over a small issue and have some different views on a matter and she throws tantrum and act like a child. I was quite pissed off and suddenly think whether will we have this kind of incident often after we married. I told myself I don want to get into this kind of misery! Now,I start to consider our r/s liao.But my ger is also a very sweet ger who do many good things for me too which i will never forget!. She is also a very good gal who never club and a homely gal.<br><br>Now i am confused why my consideration of my r/s with my ger is becos my encounter of this super good gal which shaken my unqestionable love for my ger or really becos of the small incident over her tantrum that shaken that my future,like with my ger will be a mistakes! Btw, i still love my ger a lot but I scare future such incident will ruin my life in future?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Is it me changing of heart or not???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i don't mean to sound like i'm more experienced, in fact i'm younger than you.<br><br>but i once had a problem like yours, and what i can say is that deep in your heart, a gf of years will not be easily replaced by a new girl you know recently. yes, in your current stupor, the tides may have changed. you used 2 statements to describe your current gf as compared to the 2 long paragraphs you wrote to praise this new girl. you're infatuated with this new girl, so every bickering with your current gf will be subconsciously blown up as you're unknowingly biased already.<br><br>think about this, i'm sure you've quarrelled with your gf before. think about how you have successfully patched up. but why now, it just seems as if it's the end of the road for the both of you? it's crucial now that you remain objective and be fairer to your gf.<br><br>at the end of the day, you'll realise who you really love. all the best bro.</div>

Give and Take.<br>2. Learn to listen to her side of her story.<br>3. Have faith in your relationship.<br><br>There's no reason why your colleague is brought into the picture, just because your gf doesn't treat you the way you wished her to do so. Friend, if you love your gf unconditionally, such situation shouldn't exist.<br><br>However, you still have a choice to choose the right partner as long as you are still not married. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

As for your gf, maybe she just had a bad day, nobody is perfect. But this is sth that you must learn to solve between the both of you, because to break up and go to another girl, is just running away from the problem.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you must suppress your temptations. i personally dont think you should let your relationship be affected just because you have this dream colleague. every one has their flaws so i think you should learn to accept your gf's flaws if you really love her. im sure your colleague would also have her own flaws except that you havent discover yet so you may think shes like an angel. if your relationship will be shaken by just this colleague i think you and your gf are not strong enough in this relationship. i think youre just impressed by this colleague. let time tell if this actually develops into love, then you dont love your current gf deep enough.</div>
