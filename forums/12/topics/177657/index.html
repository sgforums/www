I truly agree in what they say. As my circumstances, I happen to fond on a girl very seriously in my Church, we pay a lot of attention to one another, chat with each other in msn whenever either one of us online and ask each other out during our leisure. She take notice of me most of the time when I wasn't with her and even sms/call me and ask where am I? and I was like you, thought she likes me and stood a chance with her so I confess to her and guess what she says? She says that she only treat me like a very best of the best friend in her life only, nothing more than that.<br>Not to mention, my heart sink deeply, but what to do? just move on lor....<br>So hard to make a girl fall for you nowadays....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some girls just want you as a good friend. If you think about it, there might be some good girls around that you want to keep as your good friend forever.<br><br>We all know that most relationships won't last (depending on your age, maturity and stability) especially if you're still a teenager. If you're able to see it this way, there might be occasions that you decide to keep her as a friend instead of risk losing her someday.</div>

So i asked her over the fone, whether she knew i was interested in her, and she said so obvious ... haha But then, she came up wif all sort of excuses tat she wasn't ready to be in r/ship etc even though when i said im willing to "wait" a while as long as i know i have a chance ...<br><br>U guys think i should have asked her in person? i sort of regret asking her over the fone leh... would it have made a difference ? ever since she made it clear in a way, she wasnt interested, i stopped calling or msg her n she didnt take initiative to msg me once ..., guess she was only interested in the attention, but somehow i think there's more to it that she didnt want to say ...<br><br>cheers </div></blockquote>bro ask you something you know this gal for only 2 months. Then you want her to be your gf ? err... a bit too fast rite?? she hardly know you ...<br>nvm just treat this as a learning experience...<br><br>is normal to be shy with the gal the you like.. everyone does that.<br>Especailly if is your first few experenice with love.</div>
