              If you take MC once a week, then you working 4 days a week, sure the boss not happy... so it's going to compound the problems... in order to be happy and successful in life, it's vital to do everything the best you can... if you can't do the best (because somehow it's not suitable for you), or if you have done the best but it doesn't hit expectations of that job, then i suppose that job isn't for you.
              
              I find working life so much better than school. In school, I can't skip lessons... in working life, if you have enough money, you can play games everyday and do nothing except sleep...

              <p>I am not too sure how demanding your bosss is. But one thing for sure, in every job, we must keep trying to get the work done. Have you lazed? Did your work slow? Full of mistakes? Did you show respect to others?</p>
              <p>I had been working for over ten years, but up to today, I never enjoyed it. So you can ask how I bear with it? Treat every tasks you have like a computer game. In games, we thrive to complete it no matter how tough the mission is. If game over, then restart. If work overbearing, resign and find a new one. Life goes on.</p>
              <p>Last words is, get used to it cos its going to be forever. Unless you hit a jackpot somewhere...good luck!</p>

              <p>U work like a cambodian. When I wuz there, the cambodian cannot take pressure wan. Little bit pressure, they take MC. More pressure, they quit. THey then go and find another job and ask for more increment. Haiz.</p>
              <p>Taking MC once a week, is very very bad. U working in Singapore, high performance environment, what u expect? Take the challenge. Work one or two more years but if u feel it is too difficult, then its time to find another job. Quitting this early is bad for your CV.</p>
