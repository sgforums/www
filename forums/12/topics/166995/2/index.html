            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I assume you are in your teens now. Dont worry, its completely normal to check out new girls at your age and easier to fall in love. Many teenages usually go for physical appearance (looks) more than characters. As you grow older, your thinking will start to change. By then, characters will be of more priority to you than looks.<br><br>I noticed many teen couples tend to live a world on their own; they spend alot of time together than with their friends. Because of this, I feel that they lose out on alot of things during their young years. Why? Because once you start working full-time, there is no such thing call school holidays. You'll have lesser time to make new friends or catch up with old friends. Therefore, it's good to build lots of friendship among your peers and enjoy new hobbies at your age.<br><br>P/s: Just to remind you that, having sex with someone under 16 yrs old is illegal in Singapore.</div>

(no, its with girlfrens not boys in particular) she finally did it, and im so happy. thought everythin will be cool now. and den, is her sister. she cant take that step and have a slow talk wit her sister lettin noe i exist. her sister knew about me 2yrs ago. and shes damn cool and supportive. but it changed after 2yrs. prolly because she dated a malay(pls dont start a racial dispute) and her sister been against her ever since. n durin this 2yrs, no i didnt have any rship or even dated any girls.....................<br></div></blockquote>It's good that you are serious with her and wanna be with her. But trust me...leave that part till much later maybe another 5-6yrs when you are stable in your career. I very much into seeking true love too but reality still bites and human still change.<br><br>I'm 28 this year and trust be...seen much enough to know that we can't avoid certain points in life and I've personally been through several major changes myself and withness that of my friends. Seemed like unavoidable. The only thing that never change in me is till now I still believe in true love and the one and only person that will be with me till my last breath.<br><br>To ask her to seek freedom from her mum is not a bad thing to ask for but then you have to make sure that she's safe after that time whether she's out with you or with others. This is one commitment you have to be responsible for.<br><br>Your gf is still young and for her case it's natural that her family are more protective of her. A little suggestion here. Instead of asking your gf out and come back later than 7pm, why don't you two take some efforts to go back to her house by 7pm and you can stay there for a while. Once or so maybe can buy some dinner up for everyone if your allowance ($) allows. No need big spread of dishes but a simple meal will do the trick. By going to her house often, you can slowly gain the trust of the family on you and in a way they won't be so worried about your gf since she's at home. But try not to stay alone in the room for too long (especially the initial stage). Stay in the living room and chat with everyone. Think the mum and sis will be quite impressed. And when you gain their trust, once a while you two can maybe go dating outside and come back a bit later. At least by then the family should be able to trust you more.</div>
