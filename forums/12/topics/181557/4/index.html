What you've stated in your above post is a rather 'standard' human's strand of thoughts and study... Especially so in terms of empirical science... SCIENCE, as itself would implies... Probably would be studying on the QUESTION of 'reproduction' than 'love'.... In fact, you should quickly realise that 'love' is hardly a subject of its studies other than the more limited objective forms and definitions... And no no... I'm not saying science is wrong in stating love in those ways... But it's just one form of looking at things... And since 'reproduction' before the 'love' is the central subject of study, the latter is often seen as a 'by-product'.. Thus the question of "Chicken or egg 1st?" And this phenomena has been explicitly seen throughout human's history... How humans used to think of themselves (or Earth) as the central of universe.... Just because they've been studied 1st... (especially in philosophies...) In fact after all these years, though humans have slowly learnt that could be quite a big mistake... They often just repeat the mistake in different ways...<br><br>And it is INDEED TRUE that our 'intelligence' have allowed us to tag more meanings to 'love' these days... And in some cases, yes... Some 'definitive thoughts' are almost largely abused... But coming back to 'intelligence'... Isn't that also what makes you 'realised' today that love could be a evolved instinct of reproduction...? Rather than 'overly tagged' with meanings (common scientific belief), how about 'overly simplifying' of things...? (problem with empirical science studies) Especially during the 'early stages' of studies... Just seems to make things a whole lot simplier now... Doesn't it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Hope you don't take all these discussions too personally... But sometimes to argue under the grounds of 'science', you've got to understand where it all comes from and where can it reach out to....<br><br>And now just a food for thought... Is 'love' really just an evolved instinct from reproduction to be belittled...? Or is it suppose to be an evolved instinct which could be leading us to somewhere further...? Think 'natural selection', 'evolutions', e.t.c.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>Oh... now i see what you mean...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>There should be some sort of "lust" that will trigger you to go after a certain individual.
