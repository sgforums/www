We don't know the way of how we speak, or even how we think. You are used to your friends and I am used to mine. Our own style of speaking and blogging, its different. It is opposing one another.<br>You might ask yourself, why do I have to write these in my blog instead of clarifying things with you personally?<br>Reasons are simple : Because the both of us are hot-tempered and short-tempered. When there is something we want to defence ourselves, we would get really annoyed easily.
