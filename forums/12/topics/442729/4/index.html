              <p>His diploma was for culinary science but after his internship, he feels that it's not for him. Plus the industry rate for just diploma holder is not favorable. He's also not interested in pursuing a degree for this course.</p>
              <p>We thought that probably there'll be more options for him if he sign on for 5 years first. Firstly, he will learn stuff there. Secondly, with money he can study other stuff if he wants to.</p>
