              <p>My boyfriend just enlisted last month and I've been feeling emo cuz I miss the bugger a lot. But I'm worried that I'll annoy him by trying to do too much.
              </p><div><br></div>
              <div>So far, I've been waiting for him for the past book outs then go to his house together so he can wash his clothes and shower. Everytime, I'll help him out a little and if it's a Friday night, he'll send me home after he showers. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I heartpain when he rush to hurry wash clothes and shower so can send me home despite being so tired already. It feels like he wants to make up to me waiting at the bus stop for 2 hours for him to book out?</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div> Would it be better to not wait for him so he won't feel obliged to send me home and he can rest earlier?</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Another thing is, I've been sending him smses frequently while he's in camp and gave him photos and small gifts to bring in. I've also been writing letters but I'm not sure if I should give him those letters . I'm scared he will find them a nuisance since he ever say that he's not the everyday think of gf kind.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Haixx dunno why but my biggest fear is that he will dun wan me anymore during ns. Cuz I'm too annoying.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I dunno what he wants or needs and scared cannot make him feel better after the shit he goes through during training.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Doesn't help that he doesn't seem to miss me much &gt;_&lt; how to not feel insecure??</div>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>My boyfriend just enlisted last month and I've been feeling emo
              cuz I miss the bugger a lot. But I'm worried that I'll annoy him by
              trying to do too much.</p>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>So far, I've been waiting for him for the past book outs then
              go to his house together so he can wash his clothes and shower.
              Everytime, I'll help him out a little and if it's a Friday
              night, he'll send me home after he showers. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I heartpain when he rush to hurry wash clothes and shower so
              can send me home despite being so tired already. It feels like he
              wants to make up to me waiting at the bus stop for 2 hours for him
              to book out?</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div> Would it be better to not wait for him so he won't feel
              obliged to send me home and he can rest earlier?</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Another thing is, I've been sending him smses frequently while
              he's in camp and gave him photos and small gifts to bring in. I've
              also been writing letters but I'm not sure if I should give him
              those letters . I'm scared he will find them a nuisance since
              he ever say that he's not the everyday think of gf kind.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Haixx dunno why but my biggest fear is that he will dun wan me
              anymore during ns. Cuz I'm too annoying.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I dunno what he wants or needs and scared cannot make him feel
              better after the shit he goes through during training.</div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Doesn't help that he doesn't seem to miss me much &gt;_&lt;
              how to not feel insecure??</div>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Recruits dont have much personal time. From morning to night, the whole day is training. The only time that is "free" is when he book out on friday evening, sat, sun. </p>
              <p>Dont stress the guy. And let him disappear for 3 months straight. He will have block leaves after that.</p>

              <p>Firelce: dun think he is TOO worried about that haha... Worried confirm will one but not very. Cuz I'm a bit weird... Our friends keep calling him gay cuz I'm like a guy &gt;&lt; he got weird taste lar.</p>
              <p>Thunderfbolt: Will have to try since usually I'm the chatty one and he listens. But he's been telling me about funny stuff that happens. I think I will give him the letters but must screen them and take out any that seems a bit emo...</p>
              <p>Darkness (cs): oh noes... Jia you!! Dun worry... He say that actually not that bad in T island resort. Except that his ippt keep failin cuz of stupid standing broad jump and he got fear of heights and the road march is super tiring. Dunno if he is trying to reassure me anot but he seems to be havin fun... </p>
              <p>Actually that's why I'm a bit emo also. Cuz when I sms him or call him when he's free, I dun talk about all the stuff that's troubling me but try to make him laugh or encourage him. Before he enlist, he was my confidante and every time he will listen to me and make me feel better. But now I got no one to tell liao... Haixxx.... But I feel happy when he does get cheered up by my nonsense :)</p>
              <p>He's a cheerful guy and he seems to take all the tekan as good training (weird cutie&gt;&lt;) he even thought of RT so that can train more (nearly kicked him when he said that) This one I know he is not fake one. He's too straight to fake this kinda things. He only emo when he barely passed SBJ and when he got road march.</p>
              <p>Haha I hope they can cheer him up in camp :)</p>
              <p>Super heartpain leh. He was coughing and had a bit of flu last night but still send me home. To and fro for him is like 2 hours. By the time he got home last night was alr 12+ and heavy rain. At the moment, finance is not a big issue just that he got no time... Especially since he got his other great love of his life: ygo.</p>
              <p>Hopefully things will change by the end of BMT bah. But he planning to sign on navy. OTL less time for me liao. But I support him lar. Did research and asked my seniors. For his objectives, it's probably a good choice.</p>
              <p>Thanks for the advice :) all the best for ns!!</p>

              <p>Definitely!! The people here are really nice! Some of the other forums I've been to (not gonna name names &gt;&lt;) have really insensitive people.</p>
              <p>Lord dejavu: I'm not too worried about that. He a bit not like a guy in that aspect. Maybe cuz his house almost all females and not much privacy, he doesn't really have a habit of jacking off often. I have to remind him everytime cuz it's not good for his health to build up. </p>
