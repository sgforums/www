              <p>Haixxx he just booked in today.</p>
              <p>I've got another problem. Its not a recent development but has been going on for almost half a year already. It feels like he's not really as into me anymore. We had a cold war because of it a few months ago but we made up. Didn't address the root problem, just pretended it didn't happen. I keep trying not to think about it but it is really bothering me a lot. Of course I didn't mention it to him. He has enough to deal with as it is.</p>
              <p>It's really hard to miss him so much and try to do so much for him when I don't know whether is he serious or not. Even before he enlisted, he seemed so distant. Everytime we met up then, it was always me going to find him, me making the first move, me going out of my way to do something for him.</p>
              <p>Even though I want to see him so badly and am really really happy when I do see him, it really feels like he's just playing along to make me feel good. And its worse when all the things that remind me of him while he's in camp are things he gave me before he started to act weird. When he was thoughtful, sensitive and really caring. Now it feels so one sided.</p>
              <p>Really really depressed cuz there's nothing I can do now. No matter how sad I am, I won't ever tell him until he ORDs. Which is like 5 years. I promised him I'll stay with him until he says he doesn't want me anymore and I'm gonna keep that promise.</p>
              <p>Just need some advice on how to cope with this. Been losing sleep. Really tired from pretending everything is alright.</p>

              <p>Hmm I was worried about that... Bugging him. Normally I just leave msgs like sleep well or jia you sms that dun need reply one. Maybe I should cut down?</p>
              <p>He walks home from the bus stop so I feel that better to walk with him back. I help him with some of his laundry cuz he does it himself and I dunno, chat with him while he's washing so he don't feel sian cuz of his smelly clothes. Just that cuz of sending me home he need to rush and I feel bad. Haixx. </p>
              <p>He washes some of his stuff in camp also. Just that use the washing machine is cleaner. And he don't have much time in camp to wash.</p>
              <p>Ah no... The looking for him part was before the enlistment part. </p>
              <p>Haha he is not like normal guys in that sense... </p>
              <p>Thanks for the input tho :) need to get more opinions.</p>

              <p>Sometimes when my gf ask me things ar.. The reason why I don't want to tell her is because it doesn't change anything even after I tell her. &gt;_&lt;</p>
              <p>But heart-to-heart talk is a whole different story. When my gf and I were heart to heart talking, it's more easier to speak out what's inside the heart. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"> How to HTHT leh? you must find the right environment, without much disturbance, and then chat with him.</p>

              <p>Haixxx he just booked in today.</p>
              <p>I've got another problem. Its not a recent development but has been going on for almost half a year already. It feels like he's not really as into me anymore. We had a cold war because of it a few months ago but we made up. Didn't address the root problem, just pretended it didn't happen. I keep trying not to think about it but it is really bothering me a lot. Of course I didn't mention it to him. He has enough to deal with as it is.</p>
              <p>It's really hard to miss him so much and try to do so much for him when I don't know whether is he serious or not. Even before he enlisted, he seemed so distant. Everytime we met up then, it was always me going to find him, me making the first move, me going out of my way to do something for him.</p>
              <p>Even though I want to see him so badly and am really really happy when I do see him, it really feels like he's just playing along to make me feel good. And its worse when all the things that remind me of him while he's in camp are things he gave me before he started to act weird. When he was thoughtful, sensitive and really caring. Now it feels so one sided.</p>
              <p>Really really depressed cuz there's nothing I can do now. No matter how sad I am, I won't ever tell him until he ORDs. Which is like 5 years. I promised him I'll stay with him until he says he doesn't want me anymore and I'm gonna keep that promise.</p>
              <p>Just need some advice on how to cope with this. Been losing sleep. Really tired from pretending everything is alright.</p>

              <p><br>Well, r/s is nvr fair 1 ma... at times u'll feel you are doing more... at times mayb he'll feel he's doing more.. but since u feel that there's some issue with the r/s. You shld probably find out the root cause and deal with it. While love is unfair, it takes efforts from both sides to make the whole r/s work.</p>

              <p>i think being my gf during my NS time is the worst, so ultimately she left me...</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>During x'mas eve can pak tor suddenly must return back to camp... On standby thorugh the CNY, and worst case, almost 3months never book out during weekend.. the most is just go home on weekday to sleep.. imagine book out on weekday at 9pm and must RTU by 7.30am...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so she suspect i have another gf outside and i bluffing her, she went to ask ard, no others NS in this way.. so ultimately she thinks i am cheating on her and left...</p>
