              <p>It is conditioned by people, if you dun blame the people, blame
              who? govt are also people, they and you created an enviroment that
              really do not suit a human existence, if you look at the stress,
              late marriage or not marrying at all, low birthrates or childless,
              and self thinking leading to individualism rather than
              collectiveness, this is not flavorable place to start a family
              anymore.</p>

              <p>Yes I do feel the pressure of being alive in SG....but are there any better countries out there ? Not likely....we are not AngMo, they can go cheaper AngMo countries to retire...but as an Asian, where can we go ? I still think SG is the best....low crime rate and better and strict laws...We are safe here....otherwise why do you choose SG and not Taiwan? Hahaha! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Go to any places here and there is of no use if your internal mind is not stable. Some, in fact most people in singapore never notice a flower on the park or on the road, people never appreciate it because it is of no value to them, got no time for it and never even bother to notice it. When such society happens, it is dangerous, because they are no more living with the nature, with such life, it is of no use looking for a cheaper place to go and retire, because the mind is not really to appreciate the nature that we came from.</p>
