In fact, I think I'm the same priority as ygo to him lor :( Plus my dad doesn't let me go out on Sundays so that's another half day that cannot see him. Sometimes just wondering if he rmb he got gf anot.</p>
              <p>I think I can count on one hand the number of movies we've seen so far in the 2 years of courtship and dating. We don't see movies much unless it's a martial arts flick haha. But my sis watched puss in boots with her bf ytd and she said it was quite nice. Not sure about guys around this age but my guy was like if wanna watch movie, puss in boots, happy feet or Alvin and the chipmunks. Is he really 20???</p>

              <p>I share with you what I'm looking for in a perfect date~</p>
              <p>Because time is a very crucial factor in both of our life, and we only have limited time together due to her parent imposed curfew, we can only go out for a short while. I think the day starts with a good meal together, followed by a movie, and then walk around the shopping centre <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"> simple date~</p>
              <p>For something more special, I would organize trips to attractions like bird park, zoo or sentosa for a whole day event~ It has been long since we last went to such places already. I totally enjoy taking videos and pictures of us together with animals~</p>
              <p>You been to birdpark? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> I still remember last time we went to birdpark, we fed the birds~ It was totally awesome! with a cup of sugary food on hand, all the birds literally fly towards you <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="icon_eek.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="icon_surprised.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> It was cool and I took a video of it~ i think there were about 5 to 10 birds on your shoulder waiting to be fed. That was totally cool!</p>

              <p>Simple dates are nice. Since we are both rather active people, somewhere quiet to just cuddle after a swim or training is the best.</p>
              <p>I'm in the hospitality industry so places like zoo, sentosa etc become more work related to me. So we hardly go to places like these. The last time I went to bird park was probably on primary school? Super long ago.

              <p><br>I kinda envy your type of r/s where you guys can do sports together.

              <p>An advantage for us is probably cuz we met through aikido. He's my senior and training together is like second nature to us. I'm quite interested in self defense also so he shows me basic grappling and lets me try. For swimming, both of us swim relatively well and he likes to swim. I think most impt is that the sport you wanna do should be a common interest. </p>
              <p>For example, I skate but he has a bad sense of balance and finds it difficult so we don't skate. If both are comfortable and at similar level of proficiency then can try out. Or else one of the two will feel pek cek...</p>
