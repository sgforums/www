And if she does share her own feelings, it may not be something you WANT to hear.<br><br>So.. communication is important in a relationship but being able to HANDLE communication is equally important. Think about what you hope to achieve before you start communicating. Don't get discouraged if it seems difficult, you and a suitable partner, will get better in time <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Practise makes perfect!<br><br>And ... difficulties in communication is a very good indication to whether the person is compatible with you or not.</div>

Then during the talk, try to bring up this issue abt clinginess and see how she feels abt it. Then compromise on a schedule that would make both of you happy, one that will make you feel not neglected and will not make her feel pressured as well bcos of the tot that she has to entertain you everyday.<br><br>After the talk, should she refuse to come back to you, then use this experience to enlighten yourself and prevent yourself from making the same mistake again the next time you go into another r/s.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jeramy:</div><div class="quote_body">yeh, its true, from young my self-esteem was low...so i think that in turn led to my being clingy and insecure..<br><br>how to go about improving??</div></blockquote>Finally you decided to focus on yourself instead of on her. Why I said that? Have you ever thought that the more virtues you cultivate, the better person you are AND more people will appreciate for who and what you are more?<br><br>My post (this particular one only...) is to more or less give some ideas (not telling you ah... its giving pointers...) on how you can improve yourself. Low self-esteem included.<br><br>You can try to ask your close friends, especially those who know you for a long time, what flaws you have. You MUST be OPEN to their criticism. You cannot shun back what they said and only hear what you want to hear. Many people do that and they never grow.<br><br>Never say you are the ugliest, poorest, shortest, skinniest, most stupid, etc, etc. <strong><span style="color: red;">REMEMBER: No human is perfect</span></strong>. They have flaws and they won't show it out that easily unless its pretty obvious.<br><br>Also take note there are less fortunate people trying to survive out there in this world made cruel by humans. Those disabled, mentally challenged, elderly, and others who seemed to be struggling with their lives are doing their best to make out the best with what they have to live in this world. Many of them know how to take life easy as they do NOT expect many things. They live simple and happy. Its something we all can learn from them.<br><br>Try to go out with people who are more joyous, happy, nice and those who gave you very good impressions. These people (even if they have problems of their own) can at least show a positive and influencing side to the people around them. Observe how they act, and learn from them, but try not to imitate them too much, unless you want to be branded a "Mark II" of someone...<br><br>Insecurity is one issue that has a major factor on low self-esteem.<br><br>How do you act when a task is given to you? Say... a project? Do you panic at the deadline given? Or do you fear you may not have enough resources to support your stuffs? Or better, you fear no one is there to lend you a hand when you need it? Take a moment to think how you act when every situation comes to you and then ask your friends how they respond in the same situation.<br><br>It also has to do with your upbringing and the enviornment you were brought up. Families and friends have a huge influence on who you are now. Many of us do not have an ideal family upbringing, but that does not stop us from being the good person we are capable of. It is through self awareness and acknowledgement that we have areas to improve which makes us one step closer to being a good person as a whole.<br><br>There are many others I can talk (or crap) about. I just need a more specific topic to address about. As for what you are going to do with relations to your relationship with the girl: Let her go first. Focus on your own cultivation. You will realise more people want to be with you because you are good natured and have the general wellness and blessings for people around you.<br><br>This not only applies to you, but to all who need to see inside of them and re-evaluate themselves. Me included.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
