Maybe you tell her that she has been neglecting you, she feels like you are putting a lot of pressure on her to always be there by your side, when she has a lot of other things to do in her life.<br><br>So I guess the best thing you can do now is to let her cool down, let her have her space, and meanwhile occupy yourself with anyone and anything that you can think of. Spend more time with your frens and family. And take up a new hobby or anything that will help you to pass your time so that you don't have to think abt her all the time, and make you feel like you are constantly waiting for her to call, etc.<br><br>She will get back to you when she is ready.

Clubbing is normally the worst place to start. School is better. Join activities in your poly or JC or uni. Proven useful. Always start as friends. Don't rush in. Unless you're dead sure she feels the same way as you.<br><br>Haha... I hit the jackpot when I pillioned my gf (now wife) and I held her hands (I admit it was a big risk) when she placed her hands on my fuel tank few years back. But the fact is I knew her as my classmates about 10 years before that time.<br><br>Some of the worst places are<br><br>(1) Pubs, disco - Complicated places, complicated people<br>(2) Churches - Church is a place of worship. Not for finding girls. Churches who propagande or allow the impression where you can find lotsa girls inside are not churches.<br>(3) work place - Don't eat &amp; shit at the same place<br><br>Some of the best places are<br><br>(1) School - Wide variety of choice, very easy to start off as friends and know each other better first.<br>(2) Friend's friend (social outings) - I dunno how but I know many guy/gal friends had successful marriages through this channel.<br><br>But getting a girl and maintaining the girl is just as hard as each other. If you're not careful you may end up in break ups. Or if you get the wrong girl you're also getting yourself into slow poison.<br><br>All the best to the guys to find the right girl!</div>

If not you can concentrate more on your studies and to the friends that you've neglected.

[b]Communication</strong> between a couple was the key.<br><br>Yesterday, I told my gf that I felt she was neglecting me over the past few weeks on the phone. Throughout the conversation, I never once pointed the blame at her, and stated again and again that I'm just letting her know my feelings.<br><br>My tone was calm and composed, and never did I flare up or whatever, I was as normal as I can be.<br><br>In the end? Her reaction?<br><br>She just told me she agrees with me that she had been neglecting me, and that it was <strong>ALL HER FAULT</strong>. I said I told her all that not to find fault with her or what. Nobody is right or wrong in a relationship.<br><br>Then she stated again she feels guilty, and again and again keep emphasizing its <strong>ALL HER FAULT</strong>. <strong>ALL HER FAULT</strong>. It has nothing to do with me. Its <strong>HER FAULT</strong>.<br><br>Finally, she gave me the one time jialat-jialat -&gt;<br><br><span style="color: red;"><strong>I NEED SOME TIME TO THINK ABOUT US</strong></span><br><br>Yes man.

There is so much narcissism in your thoughts that love to you probably divide itself between having and losing it. Losing a relationship doesn't mean you lose all your chips - it only means you have lost some chips in one bet.<br><br>If it happens three times, chances are, the problem lies with you. Remember, the women you meet are variables - you are the constant. If all three variables face the same issues, you must evolve if you desire to see changes.<br><br>I do not encourage partners to be overly emotional and clingy (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces).
