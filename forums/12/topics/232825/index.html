When i reach there she is still not home. So i waited till 1 before giving her another call. This time round a guy pick up and ask me what i want and who i am. I was so shock, thought i had call the wrong number but worse still she finally answer and was in a drunk state. I ask her where she is and who she is with.... She refuse to tell me and only say dat her good friends dawn is with her<br><br>So i cont asking if she is going to come home and she say yes she will and soon.... I waited from 1am to 5 am for her my heart has never thump so fast b4 and worse still her friend dawn whom is staying above her is being send back by my gf ex.... So i question dawn whether my gf is with her ex now or not? I kinda like give up on any other thoughts and hope that she will be fine. however her friend shun all my question and say she will be fine.<br><br>Finally she returns at around 530 and never bother to explain anything to me. i'm so confuse and my mentally going crazy now. We have been staying together for 1 year and i put in my best to give her what every i can. but just a small tiff and her runaway outside with her ex make me feel really insecure.<br><br>Should i trust her again or should i leave it to fate and leave her. I bet another incident like this i will go crazy. I really hate the thoughts of going thru another torture times like last nite. Maybe she jus want to have fun while my thoughts of marrying her is so strong. I'm 26 and she is 24 . Should i not put everything into 1 relationship?

The small tiff was probably the sparkle which resulted in her "disappearance " today where she decided to seek solace in her friends.<br><br>Find an appropriate chance a few days later to talk things out with her... try to understand what was it that caused such a drastic (somewhat drastic since it's only a small tiff) reaction on her part and also let her know how worried u've been because of her disappearance...<br><br>In the meantime, try not to be overly-emotional and overwhelmed by this incident... i know it's darn hard, but it's important to keep ur cool now.</div>

She left without informing you?? Isn't that very rude? Hello? You still went back to look for her?  What you should have done is not call her at all. Leave her alone. What kind of rude person is that? And she is 24 ? She is very mature really.<br><br>Don't bother to ask her anything. You should have just ask her to stay with her ex all the way till the end of time. What kind of person is she? Is she always like this?<br><br>Let me tell you something. If being attached to you now gives you a lot of trouble, marrying her is many times worse.<br><br>Calm down seriously.<br><br>doko</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your gf have some serious attitude problems man.<br><br>Drank with a guy and said she's with her best friend? Wtf as if u could believe her. Her best friend could have just answer saying she's fine so as to cover ur gf's ass. Who knows what had happen that night drunk, first person who pick up the phone is a guy not her nor her best friend and the person sending her back is her ex?<br><br>So you can now safetly think nothing happen between her and her ex. that night. Ya right which man will not take the chance and get fresh with a girl that drunk? So chivalrous? Ya right... letting her drink so much and didn't call you to pick her up? Sound funny? Should they help you get together and settle the quarrel or whatever thats troubling the both of you.<br><br>But what i want isn't a break up, don't tell me you came here to ask if you should. If so don't even brother posting the topic. Get to the point about it. Confront her and tell her what you feel, tell her that what she did make you feel queasy.<br><br>And if she shows that she doesn't even brother or she leaves again? That shows that she doesnt' even care how you feel. Is that respect? Are you sure you want a relationship with someone who doesn't care? Think about it before doing anything stupid with your priceless wedding ring. Don't give it to the worst person you could give it to.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you're already 26, should be looking at a serious relationship. unfortunately, your gf isn't....before you have too much vested in this, i do suggest you bail out....getting drunk and in the presence of her ex, it's not something you want to be dealing with, especially in marriage.....one other criterion i would recommend you consider is how your family and the prospective partner get along, it's important but many youngsters these days neglect to factor in.....after the courtship, all the lovey dovey feeling will be secondary, a happy union is one where you can have all your loved ones getting along harmoniously...i've seen enough friends who hitched up with good looking gals only to regret after marrying them....my ex-boss is a nice guy but the wife is terrible, refused to visit his mother and kept his kids away too....even at dinner functions, she will pull a lemon face and embarrassed him in front of us.....and she is very pretty....but we're disgusted.....</div>

No. she shouldn't have made you worry like that. but other than that....<br><br>WHAT DID SHE DO? do you know exactly? for all you know, she might just have drank too much with friends she know and trust...<br><br>My advice is,<br><br>If you really love her, and treasure this relationship,<br><br>wait for her to clear her head... then try to talk to her...<br><br>find out what really happened, what she was really bothered about...<br><br>when that is addressed, tell her how you feel... how worried you were.. and how important she is to you.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by CoupdeGras:</div><div class="quote_body">             Yesterday afternoon had a small tiff with my gf at dobbyghaut. Just as we were about to take our dinner she left without informing me. Call her a number of times and she dun bother to reply any calls i make to her. I told myself maybe she needs some time to cool down and intend to look for her at around 12 at her house. When i reach there she is still not home. So i waited till 1 before giving her another call. This time round a guy pick up and ask me what i want and who i am. I was so shock, thought i had call the wrong number but worse still she finally answer and was in a drunk state. I ask her where she is and who she is with.... She refuse to tell me and only say dat her good friends dawn is with her<br><br>So i cont asking if she is going to come home and she say yes she will and soon.... I waited from 1am to 5 am for her my heart has never thump so fast b4 and worse still her friend dawn whom is staying above her is being send back by my gf ex.... So i question dawn whether my gf is with her ex now or not? I kinda like give up on any other thoughts and hope that she will be fine. however her friend shun all my question and say she will be fine.<br><br>Finally she returns at around 530 and never bother to explain anything to me. i'm so confuse and my mentally going crazy now. We have been staying together for 1 year and i put in my best to give her what every i can. but just a small tiff and her runaway outside with her ex make me feel really insecure.<br><br>Should i trust her again or should i leave it to fate and leave her. I bet another incident like this i will go crazy. I really hate the thoughts of going thru another torture times like last nite. Maybe she jus want to have fun while my thoughts of marrying her is so strong. I'm 26 and she is 24 . Should i not put everything into 1 relationship? When i was driving just now i almost know into a cab.... i am so lost...</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Your girlfriend seemed to encounter difficulty in handling her emotions. I wouldn't know how 'small' your tiff is, but if she has always been resolving her own inner conflicts by drowning herself with booze and alcohol, it's a worrying trend. Runaway with ex kinda complicates this whole thing as well?<br><br>How come the ex is still in the picture? Maybe you could explain the 'grey-area' relationship between them?<br><br>People indulging in alcohol in this manner usually display tendency of an avoidance archetype personality in love. Neptune rules alcohol and at the same time... delusion.<br><br>Have you spoken to her previously with regards to this issue?<br><br>And lastly, does your 'tiff' actually belong to a bigger problem?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
