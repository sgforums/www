Some people do not get into relationships because they don't want to de-mean the meaning of love, and also because they want to make sure they fall in love with a special person. The people here may also believe that being in many relationships, also mean giving bits and pieces of their heart away.<br>In the end, they may end up with only 25% of their heart to the special one they love, while the other 75% belongs to the other girls who has been in his life.<br>(Love is very important to me, i cannot and will not fall in love with a girl just because she's pretty.)<br><br>3.

            <div class='col-md body'>I will only get into a relationship if I feel something special for that person. Not because I am lonely, not because everyone else around me is already behaving like husbands and wives...those are not and will never be my reason. When I say that three magical words to that person, I want to know it deep within myself, that I really do mean it. I don't want to know that I say it just because I want companion. Yea, it is a practical reasn, but for me, it kinda cheapens the true meaning of love.<br><br>People said I am too idealistic. There has been many who said I am too stubborn and stupid for my own good. But I can never go against my own principles just bcos I want to have someone with me.<br><br>i.c.y</div>
