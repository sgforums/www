              <p>hi all</p>
              <p>im very stressed and miserable at my new job</p>
              <p>first , i dont blend in or fit into the work place. The colleagues are nice, but i dont have much to talk to them, they have their own clique while i seem to stick out like a sore thumb</p>
              <p>secondly, i dislike the job and suspect that i may not be capable or competent to perform the job</p>
              <p>thirdly, i hate every single second of the job. while im at work, i feel constantly stressed,troubled and very tensed and nervous. i am extremely depressed</p>
              <p>fourly, as a result of the above mentioned factors, im suicidal, going to work everyday is a living hell and im very extremely uphappy about it and feeling very demoralised and drained and low self-confidence because i feel that i suck at work compared to my colleagues</p>
              <p>i don't know how long i can take it, i have been at it for five months</p>
              <p>but i would rather just drop dead suddenly than to stay on the job. i am even thinking of ways to kill myself. and hav taken some self-destructive actions like binging on food.</p>
              <p>i have tried to talk to my colleagues but they just simply dont click or willing to be my friends. I tried to like the job and learn it well with a positive attitude but it just doesnt suits or interest me and i dont think i am capable enough to handle the tasks.</p>
              <p>please advice</p>

              <p>in my opinion getting a job which u feel motivated about and having nice wrking enviornment such as collegues are impt for long term job commitment</p>
              <p>u might want to try carrying on for another mth. if u still feel depressed better quit and find another job for the time being. (unless u are in need of money)</p>

              <p>maybe ur mental framework needs some readjusting. A lot of the negative stuff is prob due to ur own imagination. When new at work, it's always normal to feel like a little "out of their cliques". Slowly, if u try to knw them, really sincere to gel with them, of cos they will warm up to u.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>u need a lot of changes to ur mental framework dude.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #800080;">If you think it there way, you will continue to behave there way as if you are a sore thumb but you are not in reality. : )</span></p>
              <p>secondly, i dislike the job and suspect that i may not be capable or competent to perform the job</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800080;">We learnt when we make mistakes. We accumulate experiences and acquire the necessary knowledge when we know how to pick ourselves up again and again.</span></p>
              <p>thirdly, i hate every single second of the job. while im at work, i feel constantly stressed,troubled and very tensed and nervous. i am extremely depressed</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800080;">Yoga, breathing and visualization exercise battle anxiety. Just do whatever you can and improve along the way. Have realistic expectation that meet accordingly to your current capabilities. </span></p>
              <p>fourly, as a result of the above mentioned factors, im suicidal, going to work everyday is a living hell and im very extremely uphappy about it and feeling very demoralised and drained and low self-confidence because i feel that i suck at work compared to my colleagues</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800080;">There is this learning curve - there will be a lowest point but slowly things will start to pick up as you accumulate experiences and skills to get the job done. Other than comparing yourself with others, why not try to learn the secrets of success from your colleagues instead?</span>  </p>
              <p>i don't know how long i can take it, i have been at it for five months</p>
              <p>but i would rather just drop dead suddenly than to stay on the job. i am even thinking of ways to kill myself. and hav taken some self-destructive actions like binging on food.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800080;">Don't be silly to kill yourself over a job. -_- You have other important things and meaningful things to do in life.  </span></p>
              <p>i have tried to talk to my colleagues but they just simply dont click or willing to be my friends. I tried to like the job and learn it well with a positive attitude but it just doesnt suits or interest me and i dont think i am capable enough to handle the tasks.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #800080;">If you really don't like the job, start looking for another. You are only 5 months old to the job- i think you can stay on for few months. Maybe things will get better?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800080;">Everyday is a brand new day and fill with new possibilities- even at work. </span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #800080;">Best Regards.</span></p>

              <p>The reason why you feel bad is because not only are your co-workers better than you, they are also nice to you too. Despite the fact that you don't click with them, look on the bright side, they won't be firing arrows at you anytime soon.</p>
              <p>If you truly want to stand out, then work harder than everyone else. That will be your forte, if you truly desire to have one. You will regret it later though, after everyone stop being nice to you and start firing arrows at you.</p>
              <p>Okay, seriously speaking, are you cash-strapped or is unable to find another job? You are free to job-hop if you really find this job unsuitable for you. Most importantly, ask yourself, what job do you really want to have? Don't just quit this job without an aim or a target, you will just repeat the cycle again when you land yourself another random job.</p>
