              <p>Okay I am not even sure whether I was scammed, or this was a mix-up, or some other scenario, as the problem has not been solved.</p>
              <p>The comic shop that I go to, (it sells comics imported from america, there are only a few of these in Singapore) serves its customers in this method. They upload the weekly comics on their website on teusday, the customers e-mail the titles they want along with their membership number,(membership must be paid for) and the comics arrive at the shop the following thursday. The members then go and collect the comics and pay for them. The friendly shop owner told me that I can even come back a few months later and collect them. I have been sending my orders since about june but did not collect them since I had to spend time to prepare for my examination.</p>
              <p>My examinations ended, but I did not go buy the comics yet. I still sent the orders though. In one email I recieved, the shop owner said "<span style="font-size: medium;">YOU HAVE A LOT TO COLLECT. WHEN ARE YOU COMING???? " (copied and pasted from the email) Then i thought it was about time I collected the comics. So on the 4th of this month (November), which was a teusday, I went to buy them. What happens now gets weird.</span></p>
              <p>I went to the comic shop, and checked all my comics (which they had held on to for me). <strong>ALL I ORDERED WAS THERE AND THERE WERE NO COMICS THAT I DID NOT ASK FOR.  </strong>The overall bill was more then $400 and I tried to pay by nets, but i was rejected since the daily withdrawal limit was $200 and I did not know that.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/BoxedEmoticonSet/confused.png" alt="confused.png">  So, they were kind enough to let me take home a number of comics to read, and then I would bring cash money and pay for them. I decided to return on thursday.</p>
              <p>On the 6th, I brought cash money, and purchased the comics. They did not count the total again, since they had counted it on teusday, so I paid them $400+ and took the bags of comics home. When I went home, I checked the comics and guess what? <strong>SOME COMICS WERE MISSING, AND THERE WERE A FEW COMICS I DID NOT ORDER.  </strong>I emailed them to inform them, they said nothing could have gone wrong and told me to re check. Obviously something had been mixed up. The comics that i did not order had cardboard backing, something they used for the comics which they kept in the shop. hmmm.... What did they do with my comics during the interval between these two times i visited their shop?</p>
              <p>They told me that <strong>THERE WAS NO PERMENANT ORDER RECORD SO THE REASON I DID NOT GET THE COMICS WAS BECAUSE I DID NOT SEND THE TITLE IN THE EMAIL.</strong>  hmm. Why would they delete the emails from their customers? I Feel so damn cheated. I told them about everything and the instructions they gave me were, Return the comics I did not order, and send in a list of comics that were missing (list of comics i did not order according to them.) and buy it from them. WTF man. I paid for the comics and then did not recieve it. I lost more than 100 or 200 dollars sia.</p>
              <p>What must I do?</p>
              <p>What would you do?</p>
              <p>Do I have to inform anyone like the police?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Well, they did offer that you can return the comics mah... so what's the issue? The issue is that you cannot pay full in the first place and thus collect on 2 occassion and now you never check before leaving the place and you bite them like they deserve it as it was your mistake as a consumer.</p></div>
