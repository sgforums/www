            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Jonathen,<br><br>For your case, I don't really see a need to express anything as yet. Show her that you like to talk to her by smsing or calling her, by asking her out, and it doesn't only have to be dinner followed by movies and a stroll down the river.<br><br>I don't know if you're a student or working class, but if it's convenient you could join her for lunch, or a tea/coffee break during the day. During the weekend we all have to run errands, paying bills, buying odds and ends, and such errands are usually more fun if you go with a friend. Why not ask her along in a casual way? "I need to buy a book in clementi later, wanna come with me?"<br><br>I feel there isn't a need to go all out expressing your feelings (which by the way are still pretty raw, since, I assume, you don't know her all that well yet) in a blaze of glory. You enjoy seeing and talking to her, and she needs time to get used to being with you. When things develop further, and depending on the situation, you can TELL her that you will be meeting her, instead of asking. "You finish giving tuition at 9pm right? Ok, I'll wait for you at your student's block."<br><br>Of course all this can only develop if she let's you. If she doesn't, she's either not very comfortable with you, or that she is getting the idea that you're interested in her but she's not.<br><br>I think it's sometimes more interesting for the girl to guess what your intentions are. You can go as far as telling her something as stupid (or cute) as "It's been 15 hours 43mins and 14secs since I last spoke to you. That's just too long!" and keep her guessing whether you're flirting with her, or really missing her.<br><br>And if I may be daring enough to say this, keep her wondering. Yes, you're chasing her, but make it such that it makes her chase the answers to whether you really like her. Sometimes a girl may not like a guy, but she wants to know if he does or not. If she doesn't know, she will still wanna try to find out, even if she doesn't like you. Girls have their egos too! And when she tries to find out, she may end up falling for you.<br><br>I think that's all I can think of for now, besides sleep. Good luck.<br><br>By the way, it's that how you spell your name?
