            <div class='col-md body'>I noticed that most of u pple like to talk crap and nonsense in almost any thread. not to offend anyone, but some of the tips which u guys give and explaining weight lost is real nonsense! Do not teach someone wrong stuff juz because u dun know anything about losing weight or any other matter. Be responsible, u are suppose to contribute intellectually in a forum, not reply with all those stupid smilies and faces etc.<br><br>Ok about losing weight. First of all. U have to identify your body type. There are 3 distinct somatotypes - body types. They are:<br><br>Ectomorph: This type of pple are easily known as 'hard-gainers'. They are very skinny, little muscle mass, usually of longer but skinnier frame. These pple are blessed with high metabolism which makes them gain weight - put on fat very hard. So they can gorge alot and still remain the same. Course they have their disadvantages, which is another matter<br><br>Mesomorph: This pple are considered the most blessed of all. They are more built for muscles, usually lean, strongest of the 3 body types. Their body is more prone to putting on muscles rather than fat.<br><br>Endomorph: This grp is considered the worse of all 3. They have short musculature, round face, wide hips, and heavy fat storage which means low metabolism. This kind of pple are usually chubby and fleshy due to their low metabolism. Meaning they put on weight easily and it usually goes to the stomach for guys and hips for ladies.<br><br>Having demonstrated all 3 body types, i would like to add in that most pple are not strictly grped into 1 of the 3 but are more of a combination of both. And having known which body type u come from requires a diff type of exercise plan/diet, whether its for bodybuilding or for losing weight.<br><br>Most important thing u gotta know is u only put on weight IF u consume more calories than what your body expands on the avg per day. For a lady she would require roughly 2000-2500 cal, while for a man, he would require 2500 - 3000 cal. This is considering all the avg activites a sedentary man/woman would do. So if you take in the same no. of calories as your body requires on the avg per day. You wun put on weight. Simple as that! NOT THAT CARBO OR RICE MAKES U FAT!! Someone said that in a thread. The reason why u put on fat overtime is cause over the past few days/weeks/months, on the avg, u have been consuming more calories than what your body needs, so any excess calories would be converted to fat, this is REGARDLESS WHETHER THOSE EXTRA CALORIES COME FROM CARB, PROTEIN OR FAT.<br><br>It isn't difficult to lose weight, its the consistency, determination of that person which would determine your goal. I mean, this is true for everything in life, how much a goal means to you would determine how much effort u would put in rite? So if u really wanna shed those extra pounds to look more sexier, and u badly want that goal, u would put in more effort!<br><br>There are just a few simple steps to take to make sure that attaining your goal of fitting in that old jeans possible! Here is a few:<br><br>1) Most important!!! Contrary to what most gullible pple say: NVR EVER EVER STARVE!!! Our human body is built for defence and if u starve it, it would only slower your metabolism to counter-act the starving mode it is experiencing. What you should do is eat 4-6 meals, i know u all think its crazy.. haha! BUT, eat 4-6 low-calorie meals. U space your meals out, eat lesser proportion. Eat to feel not hungry, not full. The main thing is at the end of the day, your calorie consumption is less than what your body needs.<br><br>2) Drink only plain water. Dun talk sweet drinks or alcohol at all! U only need water!<br><br>3) Be responsible for what u eat, select healthier choices of food when u eat. Go for more soup based food. Leave out the gravy, curry , extra flavourings... Yes, no fast foods! You can feel real full eating some food which has low calorie value. No kidding! Did u know that all those Nasi Bryani, Chicken, beef bryani have a median calorie value of 700 cal? haha! Think twice!<br><br>4) Choose a reasonable cardio workout with slight resistance training exercise. Cardio meaning an exercise which keeps the heart beat elavated consistently for a period of time, eg: jogging, swimming, cycling etc. Resistance training are exercises which strengthen your muscles like weight training, push-ups, pull-ups, crunchs, star jumps. These are exercises which are target mainly for strengthening a certain muscle grp. Maintain your cardio workout weekly, doing it 3-4 times a week for 30-45 mins per session. Add resistance training maybe after the cardio workout? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>5) The initial weight loss would be fast. But it will slow down after a while due to your body's defences which kicks in to prevent you from losing weight. This is natural, be persistent wih your workout/diet and overtime u can lose weight.<br><br>Remember nvr ever to let your body feel hungry. U will feel sluggish and weak once your blood sugar lvl drops too low, u can faint too in extreme cases. If hungry, snack on fruits or plain DIGESTIVE Biscuits. They are filling with low calorie value. Only 72 Cal per biscuit.<br>Good luck to all those who wanna lose weight. What i have juz said covers the basic aspects of weight loss. Over time, if i have some new points, i would add in! Do feel free to ask me any qn if u have any.<br><br>Good luck to all!<br><br>Your Fitness Enthusiast</div>
