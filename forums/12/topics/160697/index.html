            <div class='col-md body'>it is good that u have a goal in life. Ask yourself, if u are willing to go all the way to achieve ur dream of going into mass comm/optometry? do not go into a JC just for the sake of going Uni. I made that mistake a few years back. Even though I am in Uni now, I sometimes wonder what might have been had I chosen the Poly route.<br><br>Failing ur O-level is no big deal. What is important is if u are going to recover from that? Or are u just going to let that defeat u?</div>

If you have difficulty with a particular subject or even with studying techniques and memorising stuff, post it here and I'm sure someone can help you.

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Everyone is gifted in different ways. You may not have discovered what your natural gifts/talents are (and weaknesses too). Maybe your teacher/mentor can help you. Take Britney Spears for instance. She may be last academically in her class but she's tops in singing.<br><br>When you're young, often you don't know what you really like to do/become.<br>So the onset is primarily trial and error. Expose yourself to do different things so you/your mentor can gauge what you really like and are good at. For example, some really like to sing, some swimming, some soccer, some modelling, some like to taste and cook, some like fashion and/or jewelry design, some like to draw/paint/craft, some like to study scientifically, some like to think business, some like to interact and deal with people (teaching, PR), etc.<br><br>Once you've tried different things and can identify say 3 areas that caught your passion and interest, learn them well. It'll build your self-confidence.<br>Not doing well in one thing doesn't mean you should lose self-confidence completely. Take time to discover.<br><br>As you move from Os to anywhere (poly, pre-U or U eventually), the one thing they're (school, employer) going to look for in you is what's your passion in. Is it just good grades and nothing else outside it or good-enough grades with other fond interests (sports, art, music, business, etc).<br><br>No one is a failure just because he/she failed to do something well. You may have some hidden talent waiting to be discovered and developed that far surpasses everyone else in your class, if not the whole of Singapore.<br><br></div>

So if there are 7 subjects, I take only 6.<br>Doing so frees up my time for the other 6 so I can be more confident in preparing and getting a better grade. Struggling to study and sit for the 7th subject (and knowing the outcome could just be marginal performance) could make me panic and affect my confidence in the other 6 subjects.<br><br>Of course, you don't drop English or Chinese (or any core subjects). History, geography are quite useless imo.<br><br>The weakest subject will be the weakest link to your overall results so might as well leave it out of the picture.<br><br>In preparation, consider having a buddy-buddy studying, motivation and testing system.  Your buddy tests, motivates and guide you in your study and vice versa. Self-motivation is never easy. We need a helping hand once in a while.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

Set a day and exact hour and simulate testing yourself taking a past-year exam paper for x hours.<br><br>The second time (3 days later) you do it again, take one Brands Essence of Chicken the night before and half an hour before the simulated exam starts.<br>If can, take American Ginseng too (those sold in loose shreds and cheaper also can. wash,chop some and pour boiling water into a cup and drink). On "exam" day, carry some (washed and dried b4 hand) (best chopped) and suck on it if can while you're doing the past-year exam paper.  I presume you can chew/eat during exam.<br><br></div>
