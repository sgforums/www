Thats because you feel so sad when he/she vanished away from your life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Love is gamble in which people always see it as either you win or you lose. When you lose a relation, and kept the good memories and reflect upon the lessons - you actually gain something isn't it? So you should be happy because you still gain from losing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Analogy: When I gamble with my old secondary friends during usual gambling gathering - whether I lose or win, it doesn't really matter - sure, I will hope to win, but the main thing is that everyone enjoying the process of playing cards and laughing over corny remarks over the table.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: To love and win is the best thing - to love and lose is the <strong>next </strong>best thing.<br><br>Cheers</div>

Why are all these things happening? How much can a person take?<br><br>I have read many of you guys' posting. Mostly involved hurt and pain. By guys and girls. There are so many things that we have no control over. Things that have not turn out the way we want them to be.<br><br>When you are deeply in love with someone, then suddenly the love from your partner is no longer there. No longer sure of the relationship. What can be more worse?<br><br>If someone has lied to you about seeing someone and had even slept with that someone, can anyone accept that? Can you ever trust her again? Will you want this relationship back? This thing is going to haunt you for a very very long time... How can anybody do such a hurting thing to an individual? Those who are in my shoes will know how it feels. It's worse than dying. Somehow dying doesn't seem so painful anymore. Your world will collapse, you will be scarred. When all the lies are being exposed and uncovered, you will realise how fearful it is that humans can't be trusted anymore. Your belief crushed.<br><br>Suddenly this place isn't such a happy place anymore. Heart will be overwhelm by resentment, anguish, depression. How much can a man take? I can put my hand on my heart and say that I gave her everything I could possibly give and more. What have I done to deserve this?......</div></blockquote>Well perhaps that someone did it on impulsive moment.. after that realise that it was a mistake... and hence e reason telling you...<br><br>so u ought to go think abt it.. dun just dismiss from ur heart..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Then i must say that you are a lucky guy indeed. Cos both of you are not married yet and do not have a child. Can you imagine it will be even worse when that happen and then you found out that she is not truth to you. Sure you have given her everything that is all within your reach if i am not wrong. And i know it is hard to take back all the love that you have given her. But by turning all of it into hated and resentment, you still show that you are still loving her. Cos without love there will be no hate. You must tell yourself that the person that you know now no longer deserve your emotions anymore. She does not have a place in your heart anymore. Stop making others around you suffer because of such person. Instead transfer all your love for her to those around you and those who needs it. You will find that as time goes by, you have become a happier person that her. This is all i can say. Think through it carefully.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
