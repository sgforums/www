It's the pride thing, you know what I'm saying?<br><br>And if we "show" our feeling too much, you gals will think we are too sensertive and weak, and rather dump us for a "stronger" guy. Am I not right?<br><br>And speaking of which, gals are too sensertive and "expect" us to know what they are thinking.<br><br>e.g. gal crying away, guy asked "Why? What's wrong?", gal said,"You should know!!" guy reacted, "huh!?!?"<br><br>We men are not psyhics by the way. Anything you feel wrong or dont like, just spill/pour/smack/slap/slam/dump/shout/scream it out at our faces, don't worry about hurting us or anything. So... no crying please, we understand the common language of human civilizisation, not some 3 year old who can't understand a word. So... please ladies... be more understanding.<br><br>Please don't feel offended, ladies, I'm just "speaking" on the behalf of all men.

Somehow they don't seem to care or feel guilty abt  things like us girls. No offense, but sometimes i wonder if u guys really have feelings. The only time i seem to be able to see a wide variety of emotions openly shown by guys is during soccer matches or probably during sex.

            <div class='col-md body'>well, one of the reasons is <strong>EGO</strong>...anyway, read a research before; proved tt guys generally <strong>less</strong> sensitive, and <strong>more</strong> self-centred in BGR or marriage, thinking <strong>more for himself </strong>than for both parties unlike gals.<br><br>tt's probably the reason why ppl say guys are different <strong>before and after </strong> getting into the relationship...<br><br>...and fr observation, some gals seem to have noticed and tired of this very fact, so they are doing the same thing onto their guys...getting even... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, when i said guys dun seem to have feelings , i didn't mean i expect u guys to sit ard and cry like most of u claim us girls always do! *lolz* i just asked because i notice that guys seem to get over bad relationships real fast and move on, they somehow or rather are less prone to mental breakdowns, they somehow dun feel upset or worried when u dun call them for a couple of days...unlike us..or rather me.. i always wonder what happened and worry a lil when my boyfriend doesn't call me for more than 4 days. well thats all... no intention of upsetting anyone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
