One good example is shopping. Girls would rather window shop around until they are satisfied before purchasing the items they want (or even changing their mind to another item), comparing to guys, who goes straight for the items they have in mind. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Your boyfriend doesn't call you to inform you about his current status is BECAUSE it seemed inpractical to him to call <strong>since he is alright, well and healthy</strong>. It's link back to the prior theory above because there isn't any practical purpose, while girls don't mind calling just to hear his voices, etc. Of course, when he don't call, the girl (you), picked up the message as something is wrong and you panic. Generally, in love relationship, the girl normally message the guy more throughout the whole relationship if you were to calulate every single sms sent.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Guys get over relationship better? Not so. Usually the four signs that have problem getting over relationship are:<br><br>Leo<br>Scorpio<br>Aquarius<br>Taurus<br><br>Of course, the real people who have problem getting over relationship are people who have alot of fixed sign in their birth chart, but of course, that's another topic, another question altogether. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Somehow they don't seem to care or feel guilty abt  things like us girls. No offense, but sometimes i wonder if u guys really have feelings. The only time i seem to be able to see a wide variety of emotions openly shown by guys is during soccer matches or probably during sex. Well, feel free to criticise ;P</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>generalizations won't help. just girls are often complaining guys don't understand them, the opposite is just as true.<br><br>guys are emotional also; like what some had already said - guys rarely show their excitement, sadness, interest - only a handful do. besides this doesn't just apply to asian culture but most cultures. when guys are upset or depressed, many simply act okay bearing many things within, move on with their lives even when they're crumbling inside. when excited, to play cool, guys might just be cool and observe, hiding their excitement.</div>
