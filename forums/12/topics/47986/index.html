In fact guys also go for pretty gals too..... then did guys give chance to those ugly gals? It is a fair world! however, in a true love relationship, be it the couple r mature or nt, both parties wont reali mind each other looks. Is looks extremely impt in a realationship? those average look also can. Give a quick think, if ur partner good looking but he/she are those unfaithful, unreasonable and got many bad points etc, will u still continued the relationship?</div>
