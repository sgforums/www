You both are bounded by a very personal problem of hers. Somehow when you advance, its like two step foward and one step back - wastage of energy, focus, time and resource. She couldn't open her heart to you:<br><br>Psychological love reason: didn't reached that level of emotional closeness required for her to pour out her unique problems like a best friend.<br><br>Spiritual love reason: If she want to handle it alone - it would takes years and toils on her, emotionally, mentally and physically. If she is enlightened to release that burden to someone who is <strong>willing</strong> to share them, lighten them and probably eliminate them - this problem is like a seed in winter, when the harsh season is over, the seeds grows from where it was planted and gradually something good will be grown from it.<br><br>There will be rain before the rainbow appears. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>So what now? Good career opportunity coming in your way? See how cute this works - this opportunity WOULD be the catalysis to end this stagnant situation once and for all - either you move on better in your career, or you gain a new love, though fighting hard to banish whatever problem she is facing.<br><br>It signal a time to make good decision - neither one of the route is bad. A big however would be once you have chosen that path, there isn't any turning back.<br><br>Advice? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Its good to let her know about this, however there is this very big taboo way of expressing it and I am going to give an example below.<br><br><strong>'I got something to tell you.'<br><br>'Yes?'<br><br>'my company informed me that i hav been shorlisted to go usa for a 2yr stint... do you think I should go</strong>?'<br><br>By saying such things, she will rather you go BECAUSE generally speaking, she wouldn't want to hold you back from a better future. (Especially she is merely a friend). You have to weigh your words carefully and emphasise NOT about the overseas opportunity, rather will she be willing to share her problems with you and begn the first step because you may not have the chance anymore in the future. Make use of this to get closer emotionally and build greater bonds. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Ok, I am playing deceptive. If it succeeded - just tell your boss saying that you want to back out without the need to let her know. Don't let her know until you finally got her as a gf and chose a good day to reveal it (Example: 99 days after being together, 1 year anniversary, etc). Of course, If she still remain the same (keeping things to yourself, etc), you still have chance to update me here in Sgforum Aunt Agony about your current situation and we could discuss it again.<br><br>Only if you know you have tried and still things doesn't go your way - you can look forward to your career in US.<br><br>P.S: Doesn't mean losing out this US opportunity means you can't get a good future - you can still succeed if you work hard in your career for yourself and the ones you love. (You wish to give a better life don't you?), but if you lose this chance with this girl, it may be the last chance it ever comes to you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

We are playing a game where <strong>staying put in singapore is to assist her and lift her out of her problems</strong>. (Its about SHE giving you this chance to help herself) One big however is that she doesn't want to lift her hands out help and what we have to do before the deadline is to induce that out.<br><br>She has strong personality, someone who refuse to share problems with others because she sees the problem as something personal and why-should-she-trouble-others thinking. You have to play carefully - do not expressed/show/demonstrate words/action/behavior that suggested her inability to handle it alone - the emphasise has to be I-want-to-be-there-to-fight-<strong>with</strong>-you. To achieve that, you have have to satisy other factors before the real objective is met. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If she is drained physically - do things that could recuperate her energy faster and happier. (Massage her shoulder, get her fav food, etc).<br><br>If she is drained emotionally - do things that could remind her that she is not alone to fight this problem (write card, do things affecting the cognative structure - feelings)<br><br>In simple, let her recover fast and pick herself up whenever she is drained. Without her realising consciously, you are already helping her against her problems. Little things that shows your concern goes a long way, not in impressing her, but as in a strong firm non-verbal language to demonstrate your care. This will improve your bonds with her and allow her to gradually open up to you, which will reach our objective. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

I explained to her and tell her "at least U must give me an answer, how can U leave me in the cold?..she keeps mum<br><br>Enough is enough, this gal just can't think and she can only remember her past "nice experiences" with her EXs.....Go to her Exs lor if they can give her happiness......Those guys might married liao and might forget who is her liao.............Si Bei Sian.........<br><br>I believed your gal's problem is about her family right?<br>The gal that I knew is troubled by her bad experiences with guys in the past + her complicated family problems<br><br>Well.....go to USA will be a better choice for U<br><br>1. Will U wait for a gal who cannot give U an answer?<br>2. Even if U stay back, Do U think U can win her over?<br><br>For me, my answers to the 2 questions are, I will not wait and I know once a gal had made up her mind, chances are that it is FINAL and unless something special happened.<br><br>Anything else to discuss?<br></div>
