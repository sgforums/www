            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I need some advice here. The situation is like this... I got to know a guy from a 3 days trip organised by my friends.<br><br>Initially, I just treated him as a friend... but as times goes on, I found that I grew to like him. During the trip, he asked me whether I like watching movies, I said 'yes'. Then he suggested that next time we could watch movies or go drinking coffee together.<br><br>The next day, he called me but my line was engaged as I was toking on the phone. Thus, he called my friend to find out why he couldn't get through and he got my icq no. from my friend. The following day, (which is last Wednesday), he called me and we chatted for a while. He asked me to join him and his friends for a meal during the weekend but I refused cos I had to study for a major test this week.<br><br>Since that phone call last Wednesday, I have not heard from him since, and I hardly see him online in icq. I was thinking that probably he is just treating me as a friend only.... I felt foolish but still, I would really like to know about how he felt towards me.. But at the same time, I knew that probably, I will never get the answer.<br><br>In your opinion, how can I get him out of my mind? (Cos, I do not wish to be hanging on to a 'friendship' that's not going to work and moreover, I wish to concentrate on my studies at this critical point in time).<br><br>[This message has been edited by autumn (edited 13 April 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it seems to be a gd sign that he keeps asking u out. i think u shouldn't be too shy, at least call him? a call certainly does not mean that u like him.. if it really have that meaning, then he has already called u, meaning that he likes u!!~ well, that is still just an assumption.. i think u should keep staying contact wif him, sms him, email him or call him etc.<br><br>all e best!~</div>
