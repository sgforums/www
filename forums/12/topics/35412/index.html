Why bother so much about whether he will or will not come back to you as you could and *have to* leave everything to fate?<br><br>As your habour those thoughts, your heart will revert back to original status and all your effort in trying to diminish this liking is not achieve - instead a period of sadness and hurt when memories rekindled.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You so *sure* the missing is about him and not because there is no longer somebody there that you could depend on? People don't like to change - especially when relation has gone for so long and now reality is like forcing you to adapt.

Why bother so much about whether he will or will not come back to you as you could and *have to* leave everything to fate?<br><br>As your habour those thoughts, your heart will revert back to original status and all your effort in trying to diminish this liking is not achieve - instead a period of sadness and hurt when memories rekindled.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You so *sure* the missing is about him and not because there is no longer somebody there that you could depend on? People don't like to change - especially when relation has gone for so long and now reality is like forcing you to adapt. This missing is very likely the fear/uncomfortability/stress, etc that moving on *alone* in life brings. You miss all these stabilities and security.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Therefore all these factors doesn't = to him alone that creates that missing.<br><br>P.S: When people say you have to fight for your own happiness - it refers to situation where you may have did nothing and this advice is trying to get them to do something. The thing is that you did all you can and it still this relation is gone - this saying isn't applicable to you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>For so long already - I can tell you, your bf is already moving far ahead of you and probably he won't even be thinking of you than his work, possible crush, new interest, new friends, etc. If you don't drop the idea of being together with him again and just throw everything to fate *WITHOUT* expecting a miracle to happen, you will just remain there in that circle.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Singlish Advice: *Aiya, if future together than together lor... you think so much about the future for what? Possiblility of future being together is also quite low, then what for you ponder so much also.
