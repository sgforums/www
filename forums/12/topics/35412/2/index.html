            <div class='col-md body'>i am in this situation now.. whereby she dun appreciate me but i'm still holding on . i was hoping one day she'll come round but like i said never regret wht u did no matter how things turned out. i am prepared to give up even a simple platonic friendship if things turned sour. if she dun appreciate the things what i did as a bf then she won't even appreciate me as a fren. thus i would rather not have a fren like her to hurt and haunt me for the rest of my life.. may sound harsh but i would be better off with ppl who acknowledge my effort than giving me attitude most of the time.<br>the decision is up to you.. an advice dun make the same mistake like what i'm doing now. i love her too much to see her throw her life away.<br>i am not a saint, i'm just a nobody who loves her that much to go thru all this suffering which may not have a happy ending.</div>
