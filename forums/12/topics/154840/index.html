            <div class='col-md body'>background: We used to be in the same sch and claz... but sadly we separated into different sch after graduating. I seldom tok to her, I seldom tok to anyone. Its only last year that I got her number I started SMSing her by sending forward msgs... and gd nights... she does reply frequently...<br><br>How do I ask her out? I already asked her out several times but...<br><br>1st time was during New Year, she didn't reply.<br><br>2nd time was during the 1st Monday of June holidays, she didn't reply, I did some investigations and found out she was camping the day before.<br><br>3rd time was during the 1st Sunday of June holidays, I shouldn't have asked on that day, she had her usual extra lessons on that day as usual and its not like I dunno it... she replied "She had lessons"<br><br>4th time was after Mid Year, she didn't reply again, but she forwarded me "cheer up" message on the following Monday.<br><br>5th time was right after her prelims, She said she was not free.<br><br>And i dun even get to see her at all... cos we are in different sch and hav no chance to meet...<br><br>Maybe now is not the time for her since A Levels starts in 6 weeks time... I wished I knew her schedule... but I noe from the looks of thing... she may be just lying to me that she is busy.... But I realli can't do without her... I need help, teach me how to woo her... get close to her... just dun tell me to giv up okay?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To Bot<br><br>You seem to have so much inside information about herÂ…surely itÂ’s not difficult to know when you can Â“accidentallyÂ” bump into her one day rite? IÂ’m assuming you know her well enough for her not to mistake you for a stalker hor.<br><br>Try not to Â“bumpÂ” into her outside her school when she is with her matesÂ…because if you do so, you will have the extra task of trying to isolate her from the crowd. I donÂ’t think you have the confidence to pull that off at this point of time.<br><br>Approach her when she is aloneÂ… make eye contact straight away.<br>Tell her in a serious and polite manner (you are intruding her privacy when you make an approach, so be polite)<br><br>Â“I know itÂ’s probably not a good time for this, we are all busy with our studies right now, but whatever I do in my life, I give a 100% so that I will not have any regrets afterwardsÂ”<br><br>Pause at this point, let her digest what you said and maintain eye contact, Â“I know of [insert name of a place] where we can relax after the exams, I would like to take you there. It would be fun. Would you be interested?Â”<br><br>Maintain eye contact throughout the conversation. She might not give you a direct answer but from her eyes and her body language, you should be able to tell whether she is interested at all.<br><br>Most importantly, there is no need to Â“vomitÂ” your emotions all over the place by telling her how much you like herÂ…she already knew. If she is really interested, she will make things easy for you.<br><br>If you get rejected, move on and donÂ’t dwell on what happened. The problem does not lie in you. You have tried your best and done your part so that you will not have any regrets about the matter. You can jolly well feel proud of yourself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Instead of asking her out on that day itself, ask which day she is free, that you two can go out together. If this way she tell you everyday she is busy, then what she is trying to say is really too obvious liao right?<br><br>Are you also having your 'A' levels?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Big Bot,<br><br>If Not for your last sentence, I would've asked you to give up.  However, I'm kinda disturbed by your claims of Not being able to live without her.  How much do you know about her as a person, &amp; as a gf?  Chances are, whilst you may THINK you do, you don't.  I might be wrong, but until you've been in a relationship with a person, it's unlikely you'll know exactly what kinda gf she's gonna be.<br><br>Still, if you're determined to be persistent, perhaps you should take note of timing when it comes to asking her for a date.  As you've noted, it's close to her A's, she's Not likely to go on a date with you if she has her priorities straight.  Afterall, she's still young, &amp; there's plenty of time for her to go dating after she's made it to the uni/faculty of her choice.<br><br>You may wanna wait till after the A's, particularly if she's confident that she's done well.  Try &amp; ask her out then?  You may wanna tell her you've bought tickets to a movie, but your friend couldn't make it at the last min. &amp; you thought perhaps she'd be nice enough to help you out so your $ wouldn't be wasted.<br><br>If she still rejects your advances, then perhaps you might want to take the hint.  You would still wanna preserve some form of friendship, rather than have her spell it out clearly to you what she thinks.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Big Bot:</div><div class="quote_body">background: We used to be in the same sch and claz... but sadly we separated into different sch after graduating. I seldom tok to her, I seldom tok to anyone. Its only last year that I got her number I started SMSing her by sending forward msgs... and gd nights... she does reply frequently...<br><br>How do I ask her out? I already asked her out several times but...<br><br>1st time was during New Year, she didn't reply.<br><br>2nd time was during the 1st Monday of June holidays, she didn't reply, I did some investigations and found out she was camping the day before.<br><br>3rd time was during the 1st Sunday of June holidays, I shouldn't have asked on that day, she had her usual extra lessons on that day as usual and its not like I dunno it... she replied "She had lessons"<br><br>4th time was after Mid Year, she didn't reply again, but she forwarded me "cheer up" message on the following Monday.<br><br>5th time was right after her prelims, She said she was not free.<br><br>And i dun even get to see her at all... cos we are in different sch and hav no chance to meet...<br><br>Maybe now is not the time for her since A Levels starts in 6 weeks time... I wished I knew her schedule... but I noe from the looks of thing... she may be just lying to me that she is busy.... But I realli can't do without her... I need help, teach me how to woo her... get close to her... just dun tell me to giv up okay?<br></div></blockquote></div>

Is she your first target? u seems so tougue tied when u chat with her.<br><br>5) Image<br><br>how did she view you when u 2 meet in school?
