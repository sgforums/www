            <div class='col-md body'>You see ah boy... if you really want a direct answer from her, call her directly and ask. Don't just sms lah! I am a girl, and I know that calling and sms-ing makes alot of difference.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>However, this girl doesn't seem to be really interested in you it seems.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  So maybe my advice to you is to ask one more time via the phone... and tell her also that you wish to proceed further as friends.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Do not be shy lah!

Was it always on sms that you all chat on? if you haven even tried talking to her on the  phone, she maybe having the fear that in reality you all may have nothing to chat about.<br><br>Try chit chatting on the phone and make each other comfortable with talking first and understand what the interests and hobbies she do then try asking her out bah.</div>
