              <p>Don't forget to cry whenever you have reached your emotional threshold, it is necessary cos it's the only way for you to unload this emotional baggage you have been carrying for her.</p>
              <p>Crying isn't a sign of weakness, we cry because we feel love for others and it enables us to grow emotionally...and it's not the same as aging naturally.</p>
              <p>Is she taking up a huge percentage of your emotional life right now? It is not healthy for you to allow her to take up a huge percentage of your emotional life, and I'm sure you would've realised this. Try to slowly reduce her stake in your emotional life, be it 50% to 35% to 25% to 15% to 10% or even lesser. It won't be difficult for you to do that because...everytime you had to carry her emotional baggage, it doesn't makes you like her even more...it just slowly kills off the love you had for her initially. Perhaps right now she's is nothing more than an emotional burden to you, do you think so?</p>
              <p>Be there for her as a friend and care for her if you still like her, no point in being there for her when you don't like her anymore. And it's alright to let go when it's time for you to leave. Because if you refused to let go of her because of all the "true love" things you have been telling your friends about, then you will only end up making yourselves miserable and bitter and feeling worse than dying.</p>
              <p>Love isn't about giving up and neither it is about holding on. Love is all about giving and serving. Are you prepared to embark down on this path of love? You might not find the happiness that you seeked so badly at the end of the path, but there is a chance that you will find happiness within yourself and people will want to love you because they also wanted to seek the happiness in you.</p>
              <p>I won't tell you the really bad part after this...cos you will find that your life will be meaningless.</p>

              <p>Just because she doesn't know.. does not means she should remain so.</p>
              <p>You are not doing her a favor by tolerating her.</p>
              <p>If she thinks it's ok to do it to you.. (a good friend).. she will think it's ok to do it to other people around her too. And so you are enabling her bad behavior which will in turn fuel her anti-social problem.</p>
              <p>Inter-personal relationship skills are acquired , not inborn.</p>
              <p>Usually those with adverse family backgrounds are the ones who acquires humility easier than those living a sheltered life.</p>

              <p>"<em>Been helping this friend with her relationship problems. I think she's taking me for granted. Always listen to her woes and be there when she feels down. <span style="color: #ff0000;">I'm getting tired of her throwing her temper at me. I don't want to do this anymore. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">But yet i think it's quite bad to leave her alone now especially when everything is lousy for her</span>. What should i do?</em></p>
              <p>The  problem lies within you. By what authority do you appoint yourself  as responsible for this girl's happiness?  In other words, who ask you?</p>
              <p>Do the girl a favour, tell her off. Tell her it is her choice. She can choose, to wallow in sorrow, or fly like a swallow. Its her choice to snap out of it, or not.</p>
              <p>You, let her be. Unless you yourself chooses not to. Then don't complain.</p>
