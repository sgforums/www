            <div class='col-md body'>My own opinion:<br><br>Dress up to look better than appropriate and dress up for occasions are different things. Its not whether you wear shorts or slippers to formal events. Its more like how you dress and present yourself to others. In this case, i believe "vainpotedness' meaning presenting oneself to others, by looking better, which involves the fine selections of clothes and accesories, if necessary. Do you wear shorts to a restaurant? Do hawker centres have rules saying that you can't eat there because you're in a suit and tie? Imagine this scenario, you have some feelings for this girl and there's a group outing and she would be going. How would you dress? More to the occasion or more to present yourself better?<br><br>I don't see how RainbowPrincess "thinks very highly of herself". Can you list some examples? I mean i've read other threads in AA and she seems to help almost everyone who post some problems there.
