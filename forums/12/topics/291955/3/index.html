I was hoping you don't take offence to my reply as it wasn't directed at you.<br><br>But as in the situation you mentioned, I've also explained that if the girl really loves her bf, she will not jeopardise herself in any situations which may be detrimental to her relationship with her bf. By getting drunk with another guy, it goes to prove her commitment into her relationship with her bf. Her bf on the other hand also has his responsibilities to stay sober to take care of his gf. While his friend also shouldn't get drunk and does something that's going to hurt the friendship with his friend.<br><br>Intoxication. A sure excuse to commit atrocities.
