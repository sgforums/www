              <p>Missus,</p>
              <p>OK, so you're a scatterbrain or ditzy. How long have you been like this ?</p>
              <p>Are you always like this only when both of you have fights ?</p>
              <p>Or do you become this way whenever you have too much things on your mind ?</p>
              <p>It's unlikely you are like this every minute of you life..else it be a miracle you actually survived till adulthood.</p>
              <p>Your husband probably didn't mind your ditziness during courtship, he probably thinks you were "cute", "innocent" and requires his "knightly help".</p>
              <p>But now that you are his wife, his expectation is different.</p>
              <p>You will become the mother of his children,  the one to take care of his needs when he can no longer take care of himself,  the one he needs to RELY on during his times of need.</p>
              <p>But can he be confident of a ditzy, scatterbrain if his life depends on it ? NO WAY.</p>
              <p>What you do today is a sign of things to come ( that's what he is fearful of).</p>
              <p>Your promises holds no water, because I'm sure you've promised him before to change, but didn't. He is tired of your "failures", anybody will.</p>
              <p>You cannot expect him to change his perception of you, but you can do what you can to earn his confidence.</p>
              <p>Rationalize first, be prudent, think things through, consider the consequences.</p>
              <p>When your brain starts to space out again.. STOP what you are doing and take a deep breath before you make ANY decision/action.</p>
              <p>If you still can't handle it yourself, go and talk to a psychologist.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              <p>i had a pair of free tickets to Gold Class movie this evening and had arranged to watch it with hubby 2 wks ago. all today I assumed that it was at Great World.We had a mini fight earlier in the day but patched up, then just before going out, we had a mini fight again which made me angry. So my mind was distracted.</p>
              <p>He told to check my email to confirm the time and venue and I did, but was distracted when I was in my mailbox. In my mind i was pretty sure that it was at great world. When i was downstairs and got into the car, he once again asked whether I was sure of the venue. Anyway when we arrived,the venue was wrong. I called my contact and found out that it was the wrong cinema. He was soo angry that he refused to speak to me and wanted to go back immediately. He said I wasted his time, energy and he said what made him most furious is how such things keep on happening for the past 2 years and he had told me to check and asked me whether I was sure of the venue and how I actually had the hp no. of the guy I could have just easily called the person before we left.</p>
              <p>I pleaded with him and tried to placate him but he refused to listen, he even told me to make my own plans for the next day (Sun) even though I had taken leave on Sun to spend the day with him..</p>
              <p>I kept trying to pacify him but he would not budge. I cried and cried my eyes out. He told me that he is sick of me always screwing up in my life, and he said i am irresponsible which causes screw ups like this and that I'm always giving him trouble and when I tried to pacify him asking him to forgive me and not be angry anymore, he kept telling me to f*** off repeatedly.. I cried and cried and my eyes were completely swollen..I told him I would never screw up again,</p>
              <p>What should i do? I feel so heartbroken. I feel like a most useless piece of junk. I dun think i deserve him or deserve any happiness. I feel God didnt make me so incompetent and such a screw up.</p>

              <p><br>Put in more effort and thought when it comes to things like this the next time. You should do without negative thoughts like you don't deserve him and etc - the union of 2 individuals isn't by any coincidence, and I personally feel that for small issues like this there really isn't a need for one to beg the other for forgiveness.</p>
              <p>But really, please make it a point to be more prudent with such matters in the future, apologies are just words.. Show some actions! The thing with screw ups like this is that when it happens in a series, people would certainly get annoyed.</p>
              <p>You guys are married for 2 years and have been together for god knows how long, surely you know what are the things that would make him ticked, and avoid them. Don't be so negative about things already, tomorrow when he's awake and in a better mood, take your time to talk to him.</p>

              <p>u had gold class tickets n made the trip out. even if u were a muddle head, got the wrong cinema n missed the show... could've easily bought tickets n watched another show. he's either irritated at u over the slightest thing or looking to pick a fight. there r bigger issues that triggered his overreaction. imo he overreacted. </p>
              <p>granted he didn't just suffer a bad day at work n all else was fine until the night out n the blunder, his anger was uncalled for - mountain made out of a mole hill. ur crying may have made it worse but still, it's not acceptable to tell a woman to fuck off when she is still crying. must've taken quite a lot from both sides to get to this point. </p>

              <p>it's not easy to keep a marriage going n iron out the differences on a daily basis. takes a lot of strength n hard work, staying power to keep going. by reading ur last thread u r a good wife, have more belief in urself. u doubt urself far too often. i hope all goes well for u the next morning. or at least kiss n make up. if he turns u down for the kissing and making up bit even after u tried to pacify him, counselling is the way to go. something is clearly amiss. </p>
              <p>if he's still ignoring u tomorrow, do watch zombieland i hear it is good. have a snigger or laugh, take ur mind off things. gold class tickets n knock urself out. </p>
              <p>life is so damn short, don't spend too much time being trapped in unhappiness. </p>

              <p>actually I don't even support PAP that much but just to piss you off, i'm GOING TO (confirmed 100%) to vote for them. btw you may like to know that my IC is still registered under my parents' home- an opposite area and my new home is a contested PAP area so I can always declare new add to the voting station. Unlike you, I ALWAYS get to vote every GE. In fact I have a choice of voting to make the opposite area less opposition and the contested PAP area more PAP, depending on my mood.</p>
              <p>The most ironic thing abt this is that u can crap here about PAP all you want, but you most likely end up living in a walkover area and have no vote whereas I'm going to vote against your cause just to piss you off. I'd jolly make sure PAP will rule forever, just to piss ppl like you to the grave. Migration is not an option, as no one wants junk that's why you're stuck in SG trolling online abt PAP to ppl who dun give a damn abt PAP and while u are trolling in misery, everyone else including PAP is very happy. How much more of a Loser can you get?</p>

              <p>How do you know? what can I do to not infuriate him? I try as well, but honestly, he has a bad temper too and tend to over-react and have a HUGE reaction to my alleged 'mistakes'. When I asked him last night why he had to have a reaction that was disproportionate to my 'crime', he said that he doesn't tink his reaction was disproportionate and claimed that that's why I don't change because I feel so self-righteous about his reaction. I think he is the sort of person who likes to punish the people he loves, when he feels angry. So maybe the way he's treating me when angered is his way of punishing me.</p>

              <p>Since he is a private person with big ego. Then go for a counsellor outside the church and your social circle. Be discreet,  never discuss it between your friends and family.</p>
              <p>Since he refuse to go, you can go alone, but let him know that you are  resolved to change. After a few sessions, when he sees some "improvements" on your part.. he will be more willing to participate and be supportive of your quest to be a better person.</p>

              <p>After a fight or event of unhappiness, remove yourself from his presence. Find yourself a little "me corner". Perhaps a little cafe or a bench in the park to let your brain "sweat it out". After you have internally dealt with the "problems", then you go back and <strong>focus</strong> on the family needs.</p>
              <p>When you cannot function properly, yet insist on "helping out", you become a burden.</p>
              <p>Quit apologising repeatedly. You only need to say sorry ONCE. What is important after "sorry".. is what you <strong>do</strong> ( not say )  for damage control, and prevent the same "thoughtless-ness" from happening again. If you have to paste stickers all over the house to remind you, do it. IF you need to put a daily reminder alarm on your digital calender, do it.</p>

If he alrdy knew ur faults before marriage, if he really loves you, he should continue to accept you the way you are. to continuously ask u to fuck off is a sign that he could already be sick of you. both of u should sign up for a counselling service.</p></div>

              <p>Obviously your ditziness is not "out of control".</p>
              <p>You are able to be less of a scatterbrain at work, because there are serious repercussions for your mistakes.</p>
              <p>Now that your marriage is at stake, I'm pretty sure you have the will power to reign in your ditziness, yes ?</p>

              <p>Yes TS... sometimes it will really pisses a person off because of something so simple and yet you could do it wrongly. Further more you have been doing it for so many years, and this might have really pisses your hubby off.</p>
              <p>I understand how your hubby felt, because my gf is also quite "imcompetent" in accomplishing something which i think its really really easy. Sometimes it really pisses me off to the max!!</p>
              <p>Anyway, i think its better for you to focus on what you are doing everytime. Be positive and have confidence in what you are doing. Do no be distracted easily, and when you want to do something, do it well, do it smart, and others can wait!!</p>
              <p>You better stop your incompetence if you want to salvage your marriage, because I can tell you, sometimes it really pisses a person off, because of you not getting a simple thing done.</p>
