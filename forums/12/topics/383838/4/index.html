              <p>oh please not everyone is a slavedriver like you who disregards human rights! I think employers who make their maids wash their cars are bad enough! you think your measly monthly $350 pay to them gives you the right to send them all over town to run errands?! what a jerk.</p>

              <p>thank you to all who kindly offered me advice and comfort.</p>
              <p>the next day, i think he realised that he had overreacted and he
              came into the room and patched up with me. I can't quite rem but
              not sure if he might have even apologized to me.after that, we went
              out and met his friends for lunch, which was the original plan
              anyway. had lots of fun.</p>
              <p>we fight rather often, but lately due to the busy-ness of our
              work and him feeling very tired from work a lot (and so sleeping
              early when he's back) we fight less.</p>
              <p>anyway christmas is coming and I am <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hopeful</span> that we will have a
              nice christmas. he has suggested that I book us a nice festive meal
              outside in a nice place so we can spend christmas eating nice stuff
              together.</p>
              <p>my unhappiness at work is causing me more pain actually, not my
              marriage.</p>

              <p>Hi TheMissus,</p>
              <p>It is good to hear that your relationship is slightly improving, hopefully it will continue that way. Anyway, may I kindly enquire what problems are you facing at work?</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
