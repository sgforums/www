              <p>mr FRUSTRATED</p>
              <p>Continued to love your son as a parent should. I think your son has also been struggling to come to acceptance about his orientation. That's why, for the past few years he has been avoiding coming back to Singapore. No matter whether he is heterosexual or homosexual, he is still your son.</p>
              <p>One of my wife's uncle is a gay ( not the girly but normal man) and he always bring his partner to our family gathering. Hey, it is one of those gathering with my in laws, aunts (his sister)  and uncle (his brother)  when we just enjoy it without discriminating his sexual preference. Sometime we even joke how my uncle is jealous about his partner looking at other guy.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Hence, think about is it better to have a unfillial heterosexual son or a fillial homosexual son?</p>

              <p>Hi...</p>
              <p>First I am sympathetic about your predicament....</p>
              <p>In my humble opinion...</p>
              <p>I understand that this is very tough and difficult to accept....</p>
              <p>But maybe...after you have the heart-to-heart talk with him....and after you observe him for some time....maybe you can come to conclusion about whether this is truely his real person.....</p>
              <p>Why I said that.......</p>
              <p>I think previously you didnt expect or suspect that he was gay....</p>
              <p>So either this is a recent phenomenon (a youth experimentation thing), or indeed his inner true self surfacing......</p>
              <p>In my opinion....if this is really his inner true self....and if this is "who he is" as a person and as a human being.....sometimes....as a parent and as a loved one, we just have to accept it and still love him and still support him.......regardless of whatever or whoever this person become or do / did.</p>
              <p>I understand this is very hard for you.</p>
              <p>Maybe this is another tough thing as a parent.</p>
              <p>I wish you all the best.</p>

              How is pedophilia the same as homosexuality?
              Pedophilia is taking advantage of children who cannot consent, being gay is between consenting adults. Also not anyone's business.

              <p><br>How is pedophilia the same as homosexuality? Pedophilia is taking advantage of children who cannot consent, being gay is between consenting adults. Also not anyone's business.</p>

              <p>I don't understand whats the big hoo haa about Sgforums parents here "fear" their children turn into homosexuals. What's so scary about it? Are you scared that they couldn't carry on your family name? Scared that they will bring about AIDS? Scared that they cannot give you chubby grandchildren to play with?? </p>
              <p>I have a cousin who is gay, and I find it perfectly acceptable. He didn't choose who is he, just like how some of you here didn't choose to like the opposite sex. Its purely natural for these people. As for the above, heterosexuals have AIDS too, maybe you all should start fearing that your sons visit Geylang instead. The above fears that I could think of and have mention, its all just the selfish thoughts of parents. Why conform your child into somebody you wish for. </p>
              <p>TS, since you already suspect that your son is gay, why not ask him about it? Do not be too aggressive as you might get the honest answer that you are looking for. Be proud of him no matter who he is. Embrace him and let him know that you are always there for him. I think thats the best that a parent can do for their kids. Remember, you didn't give birth to a son made of plasticine to mould him into what YOU want. </p>
              <p>If my child is gay, I would accept him. No matter what. Even if my sister or brother (real life, currently living) tells me that they are gay, I would also wish them all the best and hope  my parents accept. There are people out there who truly accept homosexuals, and not just some netizens masquerading as people who only knows how to comfort others when they didnt experience it before. </p>

              <p>Dear TS ,</p>
              <p>A word of advise.....If you still want to have a relationship with your Son. Than accept who he is. You have done honorably as a Father. Let him Grow up. Set him Free.</p>
              <p>Your son will eventually come to respect you even more as a Father.  </p>
