              <p>I have two sons, one son still here and the eldest I sent him to Australia to study at a university there. He has been there for 5 years. However the past two years my eldest son refuse to come back for the holidays, his reason is that he has a lot of extracurricular activities and he wants to go for summer school. I suspected that he was hiding something.</p>
              <p>Then recently, I receive the surprising news from my nephew who is also studying at the same university as my eldest son. My nephew tells me that my son is officially going out with a fellow Australian university male student. My nephew has seen both of them hold hands and kiss each other on the lips. I heard that my son has even joined the LBGT rights group at the university.</p>
              <p>Although we now live in the modern times and we have to accept trends in society, I have trouble accepting my son's sexual orientation. He never strike me as a gay because all the while at school he is popular and he likes to get involve in sports activities. I don't know what I am going to say to him when he comes back after completing his final year. I have given him everything he wants, the degree he wanted to pursue. I love my son dearly but I find it hard to accept the fact that he is gay. I want to hear his side of his reason but it tears my heart to see my son become like this. I am not against gays but if any of you readers out there got a son and he turn Gay, how wouldyou feel? I always wanted my own grandkids, want to see my son have his own family but now I am saddened that he has decided to take a very odd path.</p>
              <p>He will come back next June, and I will be ready to sit down with him heart to heart talk.</p>

              <p>heart to heart....he might not even give u that chance. And he may want to stay on in aust to work. Some people are bisexual, they can accept males and females. Which orientation is he? If he is pure gay at heart, that is....no interest in women...then you may have a hard time. You cant change one's sexual orientation as much as you can't change a straight person.</p>
              <p>Whatever it is...i think for a young adult like me....perhaps the same for him...we don't want our parents to run our lives. Perhaps facilitation is what a parent in your shoes may do at best.</p>

              To the Thread Starter, if he is really your son and you want the best for him, let him choose to live his own life and choose his own happiness. By not accepting him for what he is, you might be compounding his misery (on top of those from social stigma).
              
              I am not gay but I feel sorry for those who are gay or lesbian to have to face the starring looks and social stigma just because they are different.

              <p>well. its modern times as you have said it. So live and let live.</p>
              <p>If I made you choose between 2 case. One your son is a gangster. Another your son is a gay. Which one do you choose?</p>
              <p>Its 2010. You are frustrated because you have been close minded all the while. THe problem does not really lie in your son. Its lies in you. YOu have been living in the cave. Welcome to the real world.</p>
              <p>Its hard to accept , if my family members turn out to be gay, but well..... at the end of the day, you would look back at your anger and frustration and think how come you don't think its a big deal anymore?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>From your letter, I am hearing a lot of "I want him to be this", "I want him to do that", "I want him to have this and that because it is the best for him". Since when did your son's life became your life? Are you using him to lead  life you never had? Or are you using him to repeat the life that you had because you thought it was perfect and flawless and hence, he should do the same as you? Maybe you should ask yourself what are you really so frightened about him being gay. Is it social norms? Or could it be that subconciously, you associate gay with AIDS? You have to really dig deep inside yourself before you go confront your son because it seems that he knows what he wants and what he doesn't,  but you are the one who don't know your own fears well enough. From the look of it, you are causing all the troubles for yourself, not your son. Personally, I know there are tons of men (both professialue collar) out there who are married with children, but they secretly have male lovers or continue to have gay sex with male prostitutes or other men they meet at work or at play. Is this what you want for your future daughter-in-law and your grandchildren simply because he listened to your request so as to be fillial? Parents can be so self-fish but the tragedy is they always think they want the best for their children, without even asking them what they want...</p></div>

              <p>now before more of you sanctimonious dicks get onto your "moral" high horsies.</p>
              <p>why don't you guys dig deep and imagine if this happens to you (assuming, of course, that you're normal, straight, and have a fruitful marriage, if you're a swinger for the other team too then that's another story, your opinion would be naturally coloured and biased)</p>
              <p>Imagine one of your sons outing himself and declaring a preference for the dung tube to the honey pot. Imagine him bringing back a boyfriend instead of a girlfriend.</p>
              <p>Yeah, sure, it's easy to act liberal and open minded and tell someone else to open his mind, after all, it's not your kid here. I find this similar to those yellow ribbon projects thingy; Gays, like ex-convicts, are most easily acceptable if found in someone elses' family, not yours.</p>
              <p>So sod off yah, if you're not showing some sympathies here. I see a man who've tried his best to provide for his son everything that he's wanted, an expensive overseas education, letting him do his own thing and pursue his own degree of interest. This is a father who loves his son dearly, he is NOT a selfish dad ! Notice that even now, he's not even confronted his son yet ? Who's calling him selfish again ?</p>
              <p>And for those who've told this man off, how many of you are brokebackers, really ?</p>
