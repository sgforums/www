              <p>I suspect that the reason why your son have an change in lesbian attribute is due to exposing of "unhealthy" media which is not surprised since Australia is an liberial society. One of the best illustration of this phenomena around the glode would be "Naruto" which is another vulgar and gay <span id="hotword"><span id="hotword" style="cursor: default; background-color: transparent;">garbage.It is not surprised that in Singapore our youth after reading this uncouth work, they start to form friendship bond of "369" and go rampage in Bt Panjang !!!</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span style="cursor: default; background-color: transparent;">Sadly it is just part of society fault that they allow this kind of boorish media to have an bad influence in our community, therefore our advise is if you want to change your son, you have to voice out your concern of crude exposure :</span></span></p>

              <p>Imagine one of your sons outing himself and declaring a preference for the dung tube to the honey pot. Imagine him bringing back a boyfriend instead of a girlfriend.</p>

              <p>So sod off yah, if you're not showing some sympathies here. I see a man who've tried his best to provide for his son everything that he's wanted, an expensive overseas education, letting him do his own thing and pursue his own degree of interest. This is a father who loves his son dearly, he is NOT a selfish dad ! Notice that even now, he's not even confronted his son yet ? Who's calling him selfish again ?</p>

              <p><br>I very agree with Fatum, everyone's got their own opinion but when dealing with a situation when one's son has become a homosexual orientated person, it is not an easy issue to deal with.</p>
              <p>The insensitive brokebackers doesn't seem to know how TS feels like if one day their son bring along their blackie boyfriend and say "Hi dad, this is my boyfriend, we have been going out for 3 years, we share the same bed and we cook for each other". I am sure the insensitive brokebackers will surely say it in a smartass way that they can take it and they will accept whatever their son does so as long it is not against the law. See one day, if these brokebackers get into this situation, they probably die of a heart attack, so don't be so rash and harsh to judge TS, you haven't been thru his situation. From the sound of it the TS is not being unforgiving to his son, reading his thread, it sounds like he wants to understand how his son feel and wants to know how he can solve the problem without chasing his son away.</p>
              <p>I emphatise with TS and hope that the situation can be amicably solved.</p>

              <p>i think the parents worries are not on their son turning gay, but rather, their hope of having a grandson to carry on will be gone. My answer to it, will be adoption</p>
              <p>And since our education system and way of bringing up kids today produces more gays, I may have to open a adoption business, got lots of indo, viet, philippines etc etc childrens waiting to be adopted.</p>

              <p>TS, your son did not "turn" gay. He was always gay.</p>
              <p>Don't listen to the garbage spouted by some ignorant bumpkins here about him being "influenced by a liberal society" in Australia. It's true that Australia is much more liberal, human and accepting of alternative lifestyles than Singapore but your son did not "turn gay" because of his environment. He <strong>HAS ALWAYS</strong> been gay and was born gay.</p>
              <p>There are many gays in Singapore who never stepped out of Singapore for their studies like toads in the well stuck here in this little insignificant island that even a 3rd world country like Indonesia despises as a "little dot". I know many gays in NS, some of them were my men, and most of them are now in NUS and NTU. In fact NUS dumping ground arts and social science and NTU communication studies are full of gays. The gayest guy I met in Singapore who wears women's panties under his no.4 uniform and walks with an exaggerated wiggle is from NTU. I can even PM you his name and you can check him out in facebook. LOL!</p>
              <p>A westernised liberal education has very strong student activism and encourages its students to speak up and be unafraid of having opposing views to the mainstream, this is why your son had the chance to participate in the LGBT rights movement in his university. This made him more confident as a person, gay or straight and feel less restricted and muzzled about the person that he is.<br><br>If he was stuck in Singapore, he'd still be gay but will either end up 1) committing suicide or 2) struggling with low self esteem and denial for many years before he finally has the courage to come to terms with his gayness or 3) still gay but a gay country bumpkin or 4) all of the above.</p>

              <p>i think the parents worries are not on their son turning gay, but rather, their hope of having a grandson to carry on will be gone. My answer to it, will be adoption</p>
              <p>And since our education system and way of bringing up kids today produces more gays, I may have to open a adoption business, got lots of indo, viet, philippines etc etc childrens waiting to be adopted.</p>
              <p>In my pub, there are also gays, two by two coming in for some drinks, and most of them are very proud of themselves, tou tou like this, so I use to nick them as Tou Gays.</p>

              <p><br>True, every parents love to have their son carry on their family line. And not totally cut off by becoming a gay sleeping with negro boyfriend and imagine the horror of being f(*&amp;K backside everynite.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Asian due value our culture and family. We need to have generations after generations. Just like Lee and Lee.</p>

              <p>The insensitive brokebackers doesn't seem to know how TS feels like if one day their son bring along their blackie boyfriend and say "Hi dad, this is my boyfriend, we have been going out for 3 years, we share the same bed and we cook for each other". I am sure the insensitive brokebackers will surely say it in a smartass way that they can take it and they will accept whatever their son does so as long it is not against the law. See one day, if these brokebackers get into this situation, they probably die of a heart attack.</p>
