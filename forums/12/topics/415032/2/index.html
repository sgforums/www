              <p>why don't you guys dig deep and imagine if this happens to you (assuming, of course, that you're normal, straight, and have a fruitful marriage, if you're a swinger for the other team too then that's another story, your opinion would be naturally coloured and biased)</p>
              <p>Imagine one of your sons outing himself and declaring a preference for the dung tube to the honey pot. Imagine him bringing back a boyfriend instead of a girlfriend.</p>
              <p>Yeah, sure, it's easy to act liberal and open minded and tell someone else to open his mind, after all, it's not your kid here. I find this similar to those yellow ribbon projects thingy; Gays, like ex-convicts, are most easily acceptable if found in someone elses' family, not yours.</p>
              <p>So sod off yah, if you're not showing some sympathies here. I see a man who've tried his best to provide for his son everything that he's wanted, an expensive overseas education, letting him do his own thing and pursue his own degree of interest. This is a father who loves his son dearly, he is NOT a selfish dad ! Notice that even now, he's not even confronted his son yet ? Who's calling him selfish again ?</p>

              With all due respect, you really need to reexamine some of the presumptions you have of homosexuals. Especially when the title of your post is "my son turned gay". No one actually turns gay, or straight. Sexual orientation is inborn. Hence I am going to presume that you mean he came out. 
              Coming out would no doubt have been hard on your son, so i think you need to help him understand himself and the feelings he has. It is difficult to come to terms about your son's sexual orientation and especially due to the social stigma that surrounds him, but remember you are his family, and the closest person he has, and to push him away and not accept him as he is would be cruel.
              I am sorry that you may not have the grandchildren that you wanted from your eldest, but you have to realise that he is who he is and forcing him into a marriage would just end with unhappiness for him and his wife. As you are essentially forcing him into a sham of a marriage. At the very least allow him to be with who he loves. 
              Good luck and hope that the talk you have with him is productive.

              <p>I agree it hard to accept your son situation. If you are not liberal in the first place and have not been into such issue in the first place, then such an incident will come as a shock to you.</p>
              <p>But ultimately you should slowly come to accept that being gay is not a crime or something to be ashamed off. At the end of the day, gay or not gay, your son is a human being. The only thing you should ask for a human being is whether he is a good human or a bad human. That should be your concern.</p>
              <p>when you are old and dying, what is the wishes for your kids? That they are safe, sound and good humans, is not it?</p>

              <p>Just curious, I've seen a guy whose behaviour is sissy but he
              loves to see long hair girls. Is he considered a gay or what ? I'm
              very ignorant , what does one mean by gay ? Is it a guy who behaves
              like girl and dates guy ? Then what about the guy who behaves like
              guy but dates a sissy guy who behaves like girl, what should we
              call him ?</p>

              <p>Sissies are not necessarily gay. There are manly and even straight-acting gays out there.</p>

I know it's hard to accept this because our purpose on this earth is to survive and replicate. S&amp;R. Now that the "R" is complicated, i understand how it feels. But because we are humans we are able to adapt and see things from a diff point of view. So try seeing things from a diff point of view and try understanding your son by putting yourself in his shoes. Don't reprimand him during the heart to heart talk because it will only make him detest you. Wish you the best.</p></div>

              <p>I have two sons, one son still here and the eldest I sent him to
                      Australia to study at a university there. He has been there for 5
                      years. However the past two years my eldest son refuse to come back
                      for the holidays, his reason is that he has a lot of
                      extracurricular activities and he wants to go for summer school. I
                      suspected that he was hiding something.</p>
              <p>Then recently, I receive the surprising news from my nephew who
                      is also studying at the same university as my eldest son. My nephew
                      tells me that my son is officially going out with a fellow
                      Australian university male student. My nephew has seen both of them
                      hold hands and kiss each other on the lips. I heard that my son has
                      even joined the LBGT rights group at the university.</p>
              <p>Although we now live in the modern times and we have to accept
                      trends in society, I have trouble accepting my son's sexual
                      orientation. He never strike me as a gay because all the while at
                      school he is popular and he likes to get involve in sports
                      activities. I don't know what I am going to say to him when he
                      comes back after completing his final year. I have given him
                      everything he wants, the degree he wanted to pursue. I love my son
                      dearly but I find it hard to accept the fact that he is gay. I want
                      to hear his side of his reason but it tears my heart to see my son
                      become like this. I am not against gays but if any of you readers
                      out there got a son and he turn Gay, how wouldyou feel? I always
                      wanted my own grandkids, want to see my son have his own family but
                      now I am saddened that he has decided to take a very odd path.</p>
              <p>He will come back next June, and I will be ready to sit down
                      with him heart to heart talk.</p>

              <p>There are, and have been, gay sportsmen. Those who've come out include Justin Fashanu (football) and Gareth Thomas (rugby).</p>
              <p>I don't know what your relationship with your elder son was like when he was younger. However, try to let go. He is his own man now and he has chose to act on his orientation. I'm sure he will repay your love in other ways, or pay it forward. You had hopes that he'll sire grandchildren but that's not among his priorities. (However, in some countries gay couples are allowed to adopt children so you never know, and you have your other son who may prefer women)</p>
              <p>It's difficult for a lot of people to accept a gay child or sibling, and it will remain so for you for a long time until you get used to it. He may still be living in fear of getting disowned. Try and introduce the topic subtly the next time you contact him. For now you have to reach out to him and make it known that you still love him, that he is accepted and that you'll try to make his partner feel welcome.</p>
              <p>Unlike what some groups would have you believe, your son cannot be "made straight" again unless he wants to. He'll only resent any efforts to make him get into relationships that he doesn't want.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>TS i empathize with you.  your son turning gay is totally unexpected and this shatters your expectations and dream for him.  nevertheless like the other forumnites mentioned, a person's sexual orientation cannot be forced.  while gradually coming to terms with it, gain knowledge in this area to help yourself understand.  acceptance will take some time.  be kind to yourself and your son in the process.</p></div>
