Why is it always so ironic? Why is it when I want something, it always run away? Why is it so hard to find someone to love?<br><br>Why is it so hard to woo someone when it gets older? I have decided to ask her out purely as friends and she accepted the first date without any hesitation. After the first date, I find her a very nice lady but right now I have asked her out 2 times and both times got those "see how" first reply.<br><br>What have I done that have gone wrong? Why all these years my luck with girls are so bad? So many girls yet none stayed. Am I only suitable yo be good friends and not a lover? In the past, it was not like that. I had 3 gfs before and ever since the last one when I decided to settle down I could not find anyone.<br><br>I have socially active and I join many activities and talk to many girls yet the most I can go is being friends. I am not ugly nor anti-social yet sometimes I find my friendliness taken for granted. When I care too much, nothing seems to work out. But when I become a bastard, I get what I want. Why is life so ironic?<br><br>In work, I always thought I would get a job where I would meet a good boss who saw potential in me. I don't consider myself stupid but yet all I get a job was simply an average paid job with no growth potential. Yet some of my peers who are academically lousier than me get a higher paid job than me. And worst of all I get a boss that is a joker and a job environment that emphasise on papers.<br><br>All I want is a simple and happy life but why am I getting the opposite? Is it really so difficult to find love in this materialistic country?</div></blockquote>Emo writing skills not bad sia.<br>Keep up the good work.</div>

The truth is you cannot try to install your form of mentality into others... And MOST women usually won't just 'try 1st'....

Shows how little he understand gals, but not surprising, from his self-absorbed post.<br><br>The first date is already the trial. The fact is - if a girl can't even stand the guy  after the first date, I'm sure she would rather spend her weekends alone than get nauseated by "trying" out the guy further.    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
