              <p>You said that she took the phone out of your mommas bag right? That is a criminal offence. Okay do you mind if I share one of my maid stories?I shall proceed.</p>
              <p>About 6 months ago, my mother hired a maid.(indonesian)  According to the agency, she was 'experienced' as they claimed. they said she has 14 years working experiance in saudi arabia.  When she came here to work in the house, She did not even have the basic skills that make up a domestic worker. When she irons clothes, she deliberately sets the thermostat to low then iron, so that she can do ironing instead of washing dishes etc. when my mother asked her a question, she did not answer. she just stared. Then one day my mother could not take it. she called the agency and told them to take back the maid. The agency then talked to the maid and told my mom that she would want to stay.  The next day, at about noon, the maid ran from the house. my mom wanted to call the police, but then the agency said they must wait a while. The next day, we found out that the maid went to the indonesian embassy. Then she gave false reports about my family. The blasted agency probably  instructed the maid to do this, if not, the maid would have left earlier right? why would she leave right after talking to the agent? We also found out that the maid sought 'advice' from her  other maid buddies. The agency said the only thing to do is to send the maid back to indonesia, WITH MY MOTHER PAYING FOR HER TICKETS. My mother was not stupid.She said that until the maid provides   an apology letter for making those false accusitions, she will not pay for her tickets.   ( Oh, and the stupid maid forgot her passport, she left it at my house)It took 3 months for the apology letter to be recieved. And my mother was ready to pay the 3 months levy, even though the maid was at the embassy. In the end, my mom sent an email to MOM and then did not have to pay for the levy. Moral: Maids suck, their agencies are bigger asses.</p>
