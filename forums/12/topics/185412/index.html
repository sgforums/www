He grew up without saving enough to buy condoms and that's the reason why he never wears one. Your best friend is blind and dumb to allow her bf to not at least wear contraceptives and if she gets pregnant then tell her to post in Aunt Agony forums where i'll<br>b!tchslap her and say the same thing to all those losers who have sex and whine about in Aunt Agony when they or their partner's get pregnant.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmmmmmmmm....you guys are not taught this stuff in school?? there is actually a pretty high chance of getting pregnant by pre-cum! it all depends on each individual person ofcourse,,,but yes...there are large chances!!<br><br>its always better to be safe than sorry.<br><br>but i know personally,you dont always think to carry condoms on you,right?<br>not everyone does!<br><br>but thats when the girl,and or the guy should be on some form of contraception if they dont wish to be parents.<br><br>ive seen a lot of friends lives be ruined(not that children are a bad thing) from getting pregnant when they are young,or not ready for children,and its not good.a child is a life long commitment....unless ur going to murder it ofcourse(abortion).....but if u get pregnant,then you should be responsible for your actions and look after tehe child. after all....its not the childs fault you werent smart enough to use protection.</div>
