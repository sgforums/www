Both are from SP.<br><br>So.. i intend to further my studies in pursue of my degree. However, I did very badly for my diploma in electroonics but managed to get a GPA of 3.4 for my adv dip (Part Time).<br><br>Ok, so here's the problem. I got accepted by Uni of Western Aus and school starts in Feb, but going over there seriously is going to cost alot and since I just ORD-ed, I have no savings of that amount and will require my parents to support me through the years.<br><br>Now I'm asking if I should wait till July to try applying for local uni, NUS, NTU or SMU<br><br>OR<br><br>Should I just go for the Feb intake in Aus ?<br><br>Thanks!

Such as President of Student Council, help to form a new club etc?<br><br>2)Have u ever represented Singapore in any sports/games/tournaments and won medals?<br><br>3)Do u do volunteer work such as helping out at old folks home, children's home at your OWN FREE TIME(not those school ask u go then u go type)<br><br>4)Do u have any talents(play classical music, play violin etc)<br><br>Reason I am asking all these is because although ur GPA is quite ok, it makes u no different from the others. What u need is something that can make u stand out from the rest. Remember, there are thousands fighting for that coveted spot at 1 of the 3 Big Unis, and there are competitions from JCs, Polys as well as those from overseas. You must be able to prove that u are different from the rest.<br><br>Ask urself this: Are u willing to risk the possiblity that u may not make the cut for any of the 3 unis in Singapore, and then possibly spend 2008 working rathering than studying as u wait for the new school term to start(I am guessing there's only 1 intake a year?) in Aussie at 2009. That's the thing u should ask urself.</div>
