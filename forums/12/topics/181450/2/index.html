            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by newcomer:</div><div class="quote_body">Very agreeable. But one thing I do not agree with you. That is honesty. What women really want to hear are positive stuffs. Anything that suggests even an iota of negative things about her will make her feel less good. If you're gonna tell her you're dating other women, be prepared... I mean she might turn into one paranoid gf.</div></blockquote>hi there, that's true that women want to feel like they are the most important thing only but because we humans increasingly want the things we cannot have and less want the things which are infront of us. It's a partly psychological and physiological effect (in terms of releasing more pheromones).<br><br>Anyway for me, I believe in honesty right from the start. And today, i did tell my girl that i'm seeing other girls. We had a good lunch together at IKEA, talked alot, laughed alot n even shared n ice cream n finally I just told her calmly. My situation is slightly different cause she has a bf currently but they are undergoing some issues on their part. I'm taking a passive role to show her what i can offer her n my affection for her in a gentle way which is not too overbearing.<br><br>I do not want myself to be a rebound target. So I want her to break off with her bf, ensure she's stable n finally we try to get together. But i dun deny I want her more, but because I'm in a disadvantageous position. I've to use such a method in a way to let her know that I wun always be there for her n that if there are other girls who love me n treasure me better, i'll just go off with them.<br><br>The basic rule still applies, if not gf/bf.. i believe can date multiple pple. As long as not together, she has no right/control over u. If she gets paranoid n cannot take it... I believe it's better not to even have her as a gf. The r/s in future will be a wreck. I believe in trust and that one must believe that the other party will always act in best interests of both parties</div>
