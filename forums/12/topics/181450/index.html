I am going to tell my no.1 girl that I'm seeing other pple but I want to reassure her that it's not because i dun like her or what. But it's not fair to the other girls who want to get to know me better.<br><br>The simple rule is, as long as you are not attached, it's fine to DATE more than 1 girl. You are simply finding out more about the kind of rite girl you want and it puts your mind in the correct perspective.<br><br>What I mean is, usually when we date a girl and we really like her alot, it keeps out mind focused on her. It's good and not good. Not good because u do not become objective and are unable to see any flaws.

Anything that suggests even an iota of negative things about her will make her feel less good. If you're gonna tell her you're dating other women, be prepared... I mean she might turn into one paranoid gf.</div>
