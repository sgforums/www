It takes 2 hands to clap. What is there to hold on in this relationship? He has already proclaimed to you that "he doesnt love you as much as before". This is reality and the truth always hurts, learn to accept it and some things are never meant to be, no matter how good they have been in the beginning and the best solution for such things is to learn to let go.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in a relationship, i think it is always important to stay true to yourself. Before u make any decision.. do think carefully what u hold dear in this relatinship..whether it is worth cherisihing.<br><br>Unless u have given it your best effort..u will regret it in the future. When u start another (if u do). this present one will come back to haunt you.<br><br>I myself is having problems...my wife says she doesn't love me anymore..7 years into the marriage. There is no point in blaming cos it takes 2 hands to clap, the fundamental is have u exhuasted all possibilities...whether or not i decide to leave and move on...it would be when i have TRIED my very best to salvage. Then, i will not regret, as i know that i have given it my best shot.<br><br>For me, it could take weeks, months or even years. But ultimately, when your heart and mind are able to think on the same frequency... you would be very CLEAR on what u need to do.</div>
