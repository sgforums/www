              <p>I was raised by my mother since I was born. My family owns many resorts, hotels and golf courses in Asia. When I was a teenager, she explained to me about my fathers wish that I can take over his legacy and started grooming me to be trained in managing business as well as becoming a professional golf player. I never once wondered how she managed to give birth to me at such an old age as our age gap is 47.</p>
              <p>Her health deteriorated and she passed away last year at 75. I then took on the title of chairman of my family's group of companies. I was having hard times coping and with the help of my late mothers secretary, I managed to perform my duties well. Fast forward one year, the secretary who worked for dad before, then worked for mom invited me for a private vacation during one of our business trips.</p>
              <p>She then told me something very shocking. That she is actually my biological mother! All these years, my mother was kept in the dark under the impression that the secretary was only a surrogate mother. </p>

              <p>My late mother engaged her to give birth to me because she couldn't conceive. She did not want to tell me about it because she treasured me too much as her only daughter. The truth is, she was deceived by the evil secretary who proceeded with the surrogacy arrangements and then aborted my mom's child, then quickly had another child with her husband. That child happens to be me. After hearing all that, my heart sank. After all, I can't initiate legal actions because the surrogacy happened in a hospital in Indonesia which had already closed down. All the evidence had been destroyed.</p>
              <p>At first I don't believe her words, but she forced me to go for DNA testing and our DNA really matched. I really don't want my family fortune to go to her and her other children. She had planned this all along by working for my dad when he was still around. Knowing how corrupt the Indonesian government was at that time, she might even have killed my dad to spark this. </p>
              <p>Thinking about the past, she has also been trying desperately to introduce her son to me. I wanted to sack her but she threatened me that she will expose this whole incident to the media. Because our company has a strong image, we can't afford to have such bad publicity. What can I do in this case?</p>

              <h1>Welcome to Screenwriters Association (Singapore)</h1>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The Screenwriters Association of Singapore -- or SAS for short -- is a
                   volunteer organisation founded in May 2000 to support the Singapore 
                  film and television industries and to promote the craft of 
                  screenwriting.</p>
              <p>Our members include independent producers, talented young filmmakers,
                   students, and aspiring and professional writers. These are people who 
                  desire to make a difference here as we shape the fledgling screen 
                  industry in Singapore.</p>
              <h2>Vision</h2>
              <blockquote><span style="font-family: HelveticaLTLight; font-size: small;">
              <p>To raise the status and professionalism of screenwriters
               by emphasizing the importance of content development as the blueprint 
              for tv, films and online media. In forming strategic partnerships with 
              industry players, we will advocate best industry practices and nurture 
              screenwriting as a profession by creating opportunities to showcase 
              work, to upgrade skills, to collaborate and network.</p>
              </span></blockquote>
              <h2>Short History</h2>
              <blockquote><span style="font-family: HelveticaLTLight; font-size: small;">
              <p>The <strong>Screenwriters Association of Singapore </strong>was
               founded in May 2000 with a view to provide opportunities for aspiring 
              screenwriters to meet up to workshop stories. The early years were 
              focussed on organising seminars for writers to hone their craft.</p>
              <p>The Association flew in Hollywood’s most wanted 
              scriptwriting guru for the famous Robert McKee Story Seminar in 2003. 
              The Association also hosted a series of other masterclassworkshops – 
              including one by Christine Olsen, acclaimed writer and co-producer of 
              Rabbit-Proof Fence.</p>
              <p>Apart
               from organising networking events, the Association has organised a 
              Pitching Clinic to teach young people how to pitch their stories to 
              producers and investors, as well as a talk on the art and craft of 
              selling a screenplay and the legalities involved in the process.</p>

My lawyer strongly advised an out of court settlement due to the complicity of the situation. But she is after my most prized assets, this is easily worth 8 digits sum in sgd. If I gave it to her, I will have let down my late family members who paved my way to success.
