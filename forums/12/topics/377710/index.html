              <p>I dunno if I can use the word hate, but I cannot stand the sight and sound of my mom. she is in her early 70s, stubborn, talks loud and is not a hygienic person. she embarrased me when I was young and she could not keep secrets. I have learned my lesson, not to tell her anything, less my relatives and her friends know about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>when she cooks, the kitchen is a mess after that. you can see rice, meat and dunno what shit on the floor.  the sink is also likewise, with rice, vege or some meat lying around.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dun like to talk to her, cos she talked loudly (as if quarrelling), nag and nag at dunno what shit. she go complain to relatives that I am not telling her anything and my relatives came to ask me, how come your mom does not know what you are doing. why should I, after what I was embarrased as a child. she once said, I want to know what you are thinking and I was like wtf. what arrogance and thinking was that. you do not tell me anything about yourself, except for the old grandmother stories.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have no feelings for her no more cos I have had it, from teens to adulthood. when she come home, I go back to my bedroom and turn on the tv volume loud. why I buy a tv in my room so that I dun have to see her in the living room anymore.</p>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>I do emphatize with u - however, i would suggest that accepting her for what she is as opposed to wishing, wanting or desiring her to be .... add on, is simply unworkable .</p>
              <p>Frankly, it is not going to happen. Why endure when u can accept and let-go.</p>
              <p>As for the past, it is dead - u holding onto it in your 'head' is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">weighing u</span> down. It is accumulated emotional poison - now its baggage - both <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">emotional as well as psychological</span></strong>. Let-go is  a stance i would encourage.</p>
              <p>Of course, u would wonder and probably utter - it is easy to suggest, offer opinions or advice.</p>
              <p>Please, understand this - when u hate someone/sth - it binds u, when u accept it frees u. Of course, it presupposes that u are open, receptive n amenable to change(s) <span style="text-decoration: underline;">within u first</span>.</p>

              <p>as for her habit of looking out the window to see where u're going, i think it's common lah. my mom does it all the time too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>i don't think it's issue of DNA or kinship, imo it's mostly our reaction to them. if we can simply let it pass, don't get too affected by it, or learn to filter out some of their nagging (very important), life will be easier.</p>

              <p>I hope she leaves me alone, but the problem is she wont. If she leave me alone to live my life, I wont bother or hate her so much. her wierd habits are driving me crazy. when she nag, oh my god.</p>
              <p>I dun talk to her, also dun visiting CNY. when she comes home, I just go into my room watching tv or surfing web.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She can give her possessions to anyone, I dun care who she gives, just leave me alone in peace will do. Yes I am unfilial. I dun really like her when I was young. all the years of nagging and wierd habits drove me to loathe her. sometimes I look upon those children who are on good terms with their mom and I envy them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes the hate is consuming so much and I also dun feel good about myself. Just now over dunno what fark, she nag and nag outside and I have to go out and have some peace and I just came back home. the problem is, she bother me and I dun. I dun even talk to her anymore.</p>

              <p>ya its not easy to get along with your old folks from the previous generations, especially when they were born during the world war 2 era. usually they are not higly educated and properly brought up, not to mention every humans have their own wierd little habits that others may find it disgusting.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>probably it would be good to move out if you cannot get along with her. I dun think you are alone in this and there are many children estranged from their parents. usually the feud begun when the child were young and were mistreated or abused by their parents.</p>
