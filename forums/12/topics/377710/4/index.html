              <p>Who are you to dis-like your mom alot and not wanting to see her?</p>
              <p>My mom is no different from yours, unreasonable, nag alot. Embarrassing me alot because im the only child, even my relatives and friends make fun of me saying im a mommy's boy. She does things like serving me water infront of my friends, everytime something goes missing or wrong she starts being whiny and unreasonable maybe even to the extend of accussing me. She have no educational background, sometimes she will keep asking me how to spell this and that, it gets abit annoying.</p>
              <p>Now let me give you a bloody wake up call. MY mom is still human, she isnt perfect, she has her flaws. Like all moms they have embarrassed us, make us angry and there is a generation gap and sometimes alot of misunderstandings. <strong>BUT LIKE MOST MOMS, INCLUDING YOURS, THEY DIDNT DISOWN YOU, SELL YOU AWAY, KILLED YOU OR STARVE YOU TO DEATH, STILL GIVE YOU YOUR OWN ROOM, STILL COOK FOR YOU, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">STILL CARE ABOUT YOU</span></strong>.</p>
              <p>I got angry with my mom when she embarrassed me in public, but she was the one who saved me from a school public canning. I got angry with my mom for annoying me and asking me why i always sit infront of my computer, but she was the one who sat beside me and took care of me when i was down with lung infection and high fever. I got angry with my mom when she does stupid things which pisses me off, but she was the one who cooks or buy lunch for me everytime i feel hungry and lazy.</p>
              <p><br>You are 30 years old. After your mom raised you, feed you, give you your own room. You cant appreciate, you probably never even remember or even cared about the things she had done for you, things normal friends would <strong>NEVER</strong> do for you. When you are the one in serious trouble, your family including your mom would be the ones who would stand by you till the last moments.</p>
              <p>It's time you start thinking and stop bitching, if you want some space for yourself then do something for yourself and move out, instead of leeching under your mom's roof and spitting at the hand which fed you.</p>
              <p>I really pity your mom. One day you will know, when your mom is gone you will live in regret for not appreciating what your mom has done for you.</p>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>Your mother is an excuse - she is made a scapegoat for what u are. As long as u don't accept u can run away from her and go anywhere - the next time around - it could be your spouse, your boss -</p>
              <p>What has surface is what u are INSIDE - that is all. To perpetuate ignorance is to stick to one's veiws and opinions beliefs - it a refuge for the unthinking, unintelligent. Life is a flux and all change and only change is permanent.</p>
              <p>The question is whether one is growing up (maturing) or one is simply aging (growing old). Ts , it is for u to be self-honest and accept or ignore and think that ' u are rite' .Whatever it is, it is ur trip and ur predicament.</p>
