              <p>yes basically what the doctor said is the brain chemical inbalances in the brain like a short circuit. there are no known cure for it.</p>
              <p>there are lots of bad thoughts in the mind at every one moment. You have to do something, like maybe washing your hands, or make a sound to make the bad thoughts go away. when i was younger, I washed my hands for a long time. now I dun. checking is another symptoms of OCD. checking as in, your lock the door already, but you wonder if you have indeed lock the door and then check the doorknob if you have lock the door. sometimes you have wash the dishes cleanly, but you reckon its not yet washed thoroughly and continue to wash them for some time. I have tried to brush these thoughts away, to no avail. I even told myself its irrational thoughts, but somehow you just cant stop it.</p>

              <p>the psychiatrist I saw last time was quite well known. he even appeared on tv show in the late 90s. seeing him is useless lar. he basically put his stethoscope and hear my heartbeat. then he presribed medication for me, thats all. everytime I went to see him is the same thing. no discussion whatsoever with the cause and so on or even asking about my childhood days or life in general. I even asked him if there is a cure and he didnt replied me.</p>

              <p>omg what kind of psychiatrist is that. no different seeing a GP, go in there hear your heartbeat and then prescribe you with medications.</p>
              <p>did he even offered you the type of treaments available or discussed what condition you are suffering or even asked you questions? our doctors in singapore really lack in communication these days.</p>

              <p>He may ask you general questions and you may or may not be comfy with it. Do not let such things distract you. Talk to him about this, if it really affects or discomforts you. Or you may change doctor.</p>

Seriously, sometimes we may not always understand the things that our <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://www.todaysmotherhood.com/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">parents</span></a> </span>do, but it's most probably done out of kind intentions. I can empathise with your situation, but then again, nobody's perfect. Be grateful that she still cares enough to nag, though I am sure it's a tiresome thing to hear the same thing over and over again everyday and live with her daily mess. If it's really not tolerable, you may want to consider moving out. You might see things differently when she's not by your side. :) Give her the support she needs, while at the same time, giving yourself some space. Communication and understanding will help too.</p></div>

              <p>Love and hate often comes together, contradictingly. Seriously,
              sometimes we may not always understand the things that our
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.todaysmotherhood.com/"><span style="color: #0000ff;">parents</span></a></span> do, but it's most
              probably done out of kind intentions. I can empathise with your
              situation, but then again, nobody's perfect. Be grateful that she
              still cares enough to nag, though I am sure it's a tiresome thing
              to hear the same thing over and over again everyday and live with
              her daily mess. If it's really not tolerable, you may want to
              consider moving out. You might see things differently when she's
              not by your side. :) Give her the support she needs, while at the
              same time, giving yourself some space. Communication and
              understanding will help too.</p>

              <p>I dunno if I can use the word hate, but I cannot stand the sight and sound of my mom. she is in her early 70s, stubborn, talks loud and is not a hygienic person. she embarrased me when I was young and she could not keep secrets. I have learned my lesson, not to tell her anything, less my relatives and her friends know about it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>when she cooks, the kitchen is a mess after that. you can see rice, meat and dunno what shit on the floor.  the sink is also likewise, with rice, vege or some meat lying around.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dun like to talk to her, cos she talked loudly (as if quarrelling), nag and nag at dunno what shit. she go complain to relatives that I am not telling her anything and my relatives came to ask me, how come your mom does not know what you are doing. why should I, after what I was embarrased as a child. she once said, I want to know what you are thinking and I was like wtf. what arrogance and thinking was that. you do not tell me anything about yourself, except for the old grandmother stories.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have no feelings for her no more cos I have had it, from teens to adulthood. when she come home, I go back to my bedroom and turn on the tv volume loud. why I buy a tv in my room so that I dun have to see her in the living room anymore.</p>

              <p><br>Please be more tolerance towards your own parents. Do not forget that you do not choose your parent, so never deny their existence for as long as you are alive.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Every single cells in your body comes from your parents no matter how much differences you may have inside your mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Be grateful that you are still blessed with parents compared to many unfortunate children around the world who didn't even have the opportunity to know and be with their parents. And many more out there who realised they are unable to buy more time for their own parents no matter how much money they have in this world.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What you needed to learn is to open up your heart and accept your parents for who they are. You can have different personalities, but you cannot deny your own parents no matter what happens.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How would your future spouse and family, relatives and friends, employers and children, think about you if you can even deny your own parents?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just because you happens to have friends who feels or made you feels that it is right for you to judge and condemns your parents now that you're smarter and more successful than them, doesn't change your heartless actions from wrong into right.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Untidy-ness and nagging are just habits derived from lifestyles. It is undeniable that your parents would still love you and accept you for who you are, despite the fact that you have heartlessly denied them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Keeping grudges and calculative with your parents is really just a childish behaviour, and you should grow up and become a better person than who you are now ... before it is too late and your behaviour becomes irreversible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I believe you can become alot better person with excellent behaviour than who you are now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't you wished to look back at your past in your future and laughed about how silly you were in your past?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You can do it if you would focus and believe in your own goodness, because I believe they would erase and decontaminate your past and you would grow to become a better and happier person which your parents would be proud of you for as long as you lived.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good Luck and Believe in your own goodness. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Buddy boy, it's her house and her rules.  If you don't like it, get out.  You're in your 30's fer Chrissake - grow up and get your own life instead of whinging and bitching to a bunch of strangers about momma.</p>
              <p>On top of that, momma's awful, sister's going the same way and the psychiatrist isn't up to your professional standards.  Looks to me like everybody else is to blame for your woes and you're just pure as the friggin' driven snow.</p>

              <p>A lot of forumites ask you the same question ' Why haven't you move out?" But seems like you avoid answering this particular question.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you hate your mother so much and already in your 30s then shift out! Wait! let me guess you don't have the financial capability to move out or else you would have already and wouldn't just wallow in this self-inflicted agony and complain. Face fact! You still need her to give you a roof over your head so suck it up! Don't talk big if you can't take care of yourself. And at the age of 30 something you still can't get your life in order then something is definitely wrong with your thinking and mentality. Immature. Don't everything blame on your mother. You also has a part to play in shaping your own life too.</p>
              <p>You came across as someone without backbone to me. Only know how to complain but not taking the effort to change your life and preferred to just throw the blame on your mother. But the problem is, you don't want to change. You just want to complain and push the blame on someone else so you would look pitiful. Frankly, it's up to each individual to change. No one can change you. Lots of people who are in worse situation than you yet can turn their life around so why couldn't you?</p>
              <p>Do you think by coming to a public forum to air your dirty linen in the public will solve your situation? I'm quite sure you would have complain this a thousand time to your 'friends' as well if you do have any at all. So, be a man and wake the hell up instead of complaining!</p>
