            <div class='col-md body'>I thought i should have written this earlier this month, but i just wish to comfirm everything before i even attempt to account this out. The story below is about my buddy and his current gf.<br><br>A month ago, my friend Jack(not his real name) asked me about the online game i was currently playing. We played the game few months ago, but because of some personal problems, he decided to quit the game for good. Anyway, in the end he join back into the game.<br><br>Everything was fine until he talks to this girl Rose(not her real name, dont wanna poison u guys with her real name) online. Rose played the same online game with us, she was too in the same guild(something like team). She was formerly one of the guild member's gf. Sort of in good terms with rose and her ex-bf. But things were not going well for them, and soon around early may they broke off.<br><br>Initially, Jack and Rose were just normal friends because around late week of may, Rose befriend a new "Trial bf" - Tim. Tim is the leader of our guild. But i know him well, he is not that kind of guy who would play around. Eventually he admit Rose constant msn + calling him made him feel special and he wanted to become rose's bf.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guys are pathetic. Once a girl get close and cosy with you, you will submit to her tenderness. Well, i was once pathetic too, luckily i got a gf now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </span><br><br>Well, after a week or so Jack asked me to follow her go meet Rose. Ok, i admit i am curious about how Rose looks like as we all know thru the online game. But i dont really care as i already got gf. So after much persuasion, i followed him to meet her. Rose was a pleasent girl. Abit plum, but have a sweet face.<br><br>Soon after 1 new week, Jack told me he is now steadying with Rose and i was like "WTF???" Rose barely broke up less then a month, and before him was Tim and Jack barely knew her for 2 weeks?? Well, love is blind. Things are pretty much smooth going until few days later, rose's ex bf Alex called her saying he miss her. But she ensure to Jack that she wouldnt go back to him.<br><br>One night, from Jack i realise Rose admits that she is actually still with Alex(they patched up). Its call <strong>TWO-TIMING</strong> if you guys dont know. I was really mad. She created different stories to the 2 guys, and in the end both are mesmerized by her. In the end both realize she 2 timed them yet they never give up. Initially i was really confused by their actions but i realized Rose is a kind of girl who seeks attention from guys.<br><br>Things she usually do are like : Everyday msn guys, request phone chat, smses, meet out and act cute. Like wad i mention, guys are really easy target for girls who knows how to manupulate them. E.g. If a "sweet looking" girl everyday msn u, gameonline talk to u, request chat,  send u cute pictures of herself and request meeting u, will u not be bewildered?<br><br>From my frens, i realise she actually "hooked" over 5 people in the online game. Aged between 15 to 24, all infected by her. I wouldnt say she used underhand method to hook them, but what really makes me boil are the things she does. "Duo qing" is ok, but to create lies to cheat and decieve, i think its a farking big sin. And, she is a christian i would expect her to be more matured and wouldnt do such stuff, but she does not cheat once, not twice, but all the time! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>I thought things are gonna be over last week but Alex told me that Rose sms him saying she still misses him and wanna get back together, and jack heard from rose, alex always call to say he miss rose. Well, confusing aint it? Something tells me Alex is lying too, but that's not important. Its just the 2-timng accident which boils me deep down to the core and want to expose it to everyone.

Anyway if she is this kinda of person, consider it lesson learnt.... i'm sure if she did it to me, i might also fall into that sorta 'trap'... but after that, i will know the true person that she is and avoid her... there is no need for ill-feelings to linger... just move on....<br><br>in your words.... she's a slut... so move on... why would you want to continue thinking about a person like her...... anyway that's just my two-cents... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> no worries mate...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by SoonKeong:<br><strong>I thought i should have written this earlier this month, but i just wish to comfirm everything before i even attempt to account this out. The story below is about my buddy and his current gf.<br><br>A month ago, my friend Jack(not his real name) asked me about the online game i was currently playing. We played the game few months ago, but because of some personal problems, he decided to quit the game for good. Anyway, in the end he join back into the game.<br><br>Everything was fine until he talks to this girl Rose(not her real name, dont wanna poison u guys with her real name) online. Rose played the same online game with us, she was too in the same guild(something like team). She was formerly one of the guild member's gf. Sort of in good terms with rose and her ex-bf. But things were not going well for them, and soon around early may they broke off.<br><br>Initially, Jack and Rose were just normal friends because around late week of may, Rose befriend a new "Trial bf" - Tim. Tim is the leader of our guild. But i know him well, he is not that kind of guy who would play around. Eventually he admit Rose constant msn + calling him made him feel special and he wanted to become rose's bf.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Guys are pathetic. Once a girl get close and cosy with you, you will submit to her tenderness. Well, i was once pathetic too, luckily i got a gf now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> </span><br><br>Well, after a week or so Jack asked me to follow her go meet Rose. Ok, i admit i am curious about how Rose looks like as we all know thru the online game. But i dont really care as i already got gf. So after much persuasion, i followed him to meet her. Rose was a pleasent girl. Abit plum, but have a sweet face.<br><br>Soon after 1 new week, Jack told me he is now steadying with Rose and i was like "WTF???" Rose barely broke up less then a month, and before him was Tim and Jack barely knew her for 2 weeks?? Well, love is blind. Things are pretty much smooth going until few days later, rose's ex bf Alex called her saying he miss her. But she ensure to Jack that she wouldnt go back to him.<br><br>One night, from Jack i realise Rose admits that she is actually still with Alex(they patched up). Its call [b]TWO-TIMING</strong> if you guys dont know. I was really mad. She created different stories to the 2 guys, and in the end both are mesmerized by her. In the end both realize she 2 timed them yet they never give up. Initially i was really confused by their actions but i realized Rose is a kind of girl who seeks attention from guys.<br><br>Things she usually do are like : Everyday msn guys, request phone chat, smses, meet out and act cute. Like wad i mention, guys are really easy target for girls who knows how to manupulate them. E.g. If a "sweet looking" girl everyday msn u, gameonline talk to u, request chat,  send u cute pictures of herself and request meeting u, will u not be bewildered?<br><br>From my frens, i realise she actually "hooked" over 5 people in the online game. Aged between 15 to 24, all infected by her. I wouldnt say she used underhand method to hook them, but what really makes me boil are the things she does. "Duo qing" is ok, but to create lies to cheat and decieve, i think its a farking big sin. And, she is a christian i would expect her to be more matured and wouldnt do such stuff, but she does not cheat once, not twice, but all the time! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>I thought things are gonna be over last week but Alex told me that Rose sms him saying she still misses him and wanna get back together, and jack heard from rose, alex always call to say he miss rose. Well, confusing aint it? Something tells me Alex is lying too, but that's not important. Its just the 2-timng accident which boils me deep down to the core and want to expose it to everyone. Hope you guys dont met with such a slut.<br><br>Sorry to wrote such long pose and thanks for listening.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> [/b]</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Welcome to the real world?<br><br>P.S: BTW, Art of Seduction is not really a myth. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

No point trying to go back and think he can change the lady's mindset till she like him only. I guess this kind of lady will have her own retribution... maybe one day get AIDS or maybe finally settle and love a guy but the guy is a Jerk... get her preg and leave her.. who knows.<br><br>Anyway i guess the issue is not the future on how she suffers but how to pull and wake up your good frenz~</div>
