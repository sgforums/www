              <p>Hello forummers,</p>
              <p>I need to know if I can make small claims in Singapore. The situation is abit complicated. I paid for my exgf to go slimming at London Weight Management last year and the amount costs up to 10k. we initially agreed to pay the monthly about half the amount each month. Initially she lost a few kg. She recently broke up with me and we are out of contact, although she claimed that she will continue to pay me about half the amount until about 4k. She said I didn't appreciate her, which was untrue as she use this reason to justify the breakup, she was maybe not interested in the relationship although i eventually didnt mind mind if she had stayed overweight. her bmi is 37, which is why i signed her up for london. She never really finished the program, forgo the rest of the treatment and i ended up paying credit of up to 8500. 2000 dollars down from the original package price because she decided to end it prematurely. Although she claims she will pay, the problem is she is always out of a job and switching jobs so it is difficult for her to make the monthly payment. I am worried if she decides not to pay at all. How can I ensure that I won't lose the money which she had initially agreed to help me pay. (about half the total amount)</p>

              <p>Can Sue. There is such a thing as Oral contracts too. Thou people would most probably question your intention to create a legal relation...seems like you did it out of love......</p>
              <p>Black and white helps but oral contracts exists too. Anyway way whos idea was it to send her to london weight management? Yours or hers?</p>
              <p>Can you remember the terms of agreement you made with her? How much she should pay etc etc and why did those terms come about? Because Oral terms are harder to prove, it would be good if you could give a logical situation that leads to the agreed terms you made with her..</p>
              <p>You suffered a detriment while she gained a benefit. Make sure you get her weight loss progression report and the receipt. This would show that she benefitted from the program and also did the weight loss help her? Like was she a much happier confident person when she lost some weight? Was she healtier etc etc...</p>
              <p>Best thing to do now is to get her to write you an I owe you with the previously agreed terms. Don't jump the gun yet.</p>

              <p>i did it out of love. i cared enough because her bmi is 37 and that might have adverse health effects on her. i couldnt just tell her to workout in the gym. she is quite self conscious and her legs are too heavy to be doing jogging. i thought it was a good jumpstart for her, to help her. i didnt mind that much that she is fat but i thought it will do better for her in job interviews and make good first imprssion (at the time she was having difficulty looking for another job) i didnt mind going out with her in public. in fact i dont expect her to look like a supermodel, just withn healthier range. cuz i dont mind being in relationship with her. throughout the time i known her i had loved her and i still do love her after we broke up. breaking up wasnt easy for me. we had an oral agreement regarding the payment as only through credit she can take up the program. and i keep track of each month's payment. she only paid the first 2 months during the relationship and i allowed for her to postpone the next few mnths due to financial difficulty on her side. unfortunately she decides to break up with me for anoher guy who doesnt mind her being fat. i was more concern for her health and trying to give her a better life.</p>
              <p>she has no job currently. she says she will pay but im not confident. im just asking if there is a small claim in case she decides to disappear. but of course, i dotnt want to make her life any difficult. at the same tme, my life is also difficult. i just want to ensure that she cooperates eventhough we are no longer together.</p>

              her and i still do love her after we broke up. breaking up wasnt
              easy for me. we had an oral agreement regarding the payment as
              only through credit she can take up the program. and i keep track
              of each month's payment. she only paid the first 2 months during
              the relationship and i allowed for her to postpone the next
              few mnths due to financial difficulty on her side. unfortunately
              she decides to break up with me for anoher guy who doesnt mind her
              being fat. i was more concern for her health and trying to give her
              a better life.</p>
              <p>she has no job currently. she says she will pay but im not
              confident. im just asking if there is a small claim in case she
              decides to disappear. but of course, i dotnt want to make her life
              any difficult. at the same tme, my life is also difficult. i just
              want to ensure that she cooperates eventhough we are no longer
              together.</p>
