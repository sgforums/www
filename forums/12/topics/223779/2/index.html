I mean, that's your life, right? Like I said in my previous post, if you want to continue to have as much "meat" as you want, which is to keep getting laid as your hobby, then so be it. What Im saying is that there is more to life than just getting laid, than just getting more meat in your definition. Again, your focus in life is still women, not yourself. But if that's your life, Im not going to stop you.<br><br>You know what? The girl also likes it. She is also using you if you have casual sex with her. You are also her toyboy. I know, you want to enjoy as many girls as you want. That's your aim. But don't bring back unwanted pregnancies or sexually-transmitted diseases. Don't regret it.<br><br>When the girl likes you for you, for who you really are, what is your personality like, your way of doing things, she is going to follow you for the rest of your life, provided you don't try to control her and be possessive. The love is already there. You don't need those stupid tactics anymore. That's why I say enjoy the process of making female friends and don't have any aim in mind, ironically, you will be much more attractive when you don't have that aim.<br><br>Say what you will, my stand is clear.<br><br>doko</div>
