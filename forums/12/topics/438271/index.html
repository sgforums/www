              <p>My sister is going through a painful divorce now.  Not only did the husband commit adultery, he was practically absent from the children's life for the last several years. During the divorce, not only was my sister working hard to take care of the children emotionally and financially.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What caused me most concern was that the court granted the husband 4 days access weekly to the kids out of the blue even though in the past he only saw them every other week.  This has turned their lives upside down as now, instead of a stable weekly routine, they are now tired and morally confused.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The husband has intention to continue to work in China, remarry in China and wants to reduce the amount of money he gives in support of the children.  All this while he tries to appear like a 'good father' in front of the children.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How do you deal with this ?</p>

              <p>i can nvr understand why someone who didn't want much to do with others (kids in this case) suddenly change their mind after a decision in a court. Unless there were issues with the other party.</p>

              Your sister could have overlooked this - if ONLY she had furnished (with photos and irrefutable evidence attesting to his so-called adultery) prior to the divorce in the fmaily courts - he would have never not got access.
              
              Understand this lah, all that can be disputed in courts will be cancelled out as long as one furnished incontrovertible proof of what one utters or claims.
              
              Otherwise, all these wishing and wanting is waste of energy and utter folly.

              <p>the judge is really smart. obviously he knew that the husband doesnt really want to maintain contact with children or care for them, but in giving such a sentence, he is actually forcing the husband to meet his children. well if he doesnt do so, your sister could appeal and show evidence to court that he hasnt been doing so, and then get full custody and more alimony from him. by that time, the children would be older and also know that their father dont care about them. the children could also speak up to the judge during the appeal, and your sister would win by a larger margin.</p>
              <p>in such a situation, dont be confused. look further down the road.</p>
