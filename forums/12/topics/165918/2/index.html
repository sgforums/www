(Though I wouldn't support the idea of dropping out) Do let the university know of your reason of needing to drop out (if that happens). One way to do that is to talk to a counsellor in NUS (at Yusof Ishak House, I think) if you move on to the university. In fact, I strongly encourage you to do that. For all you know, there would be fresh perspectives that you can take on and then be able to move on with balancing studies, work and family. Also, going through the counsellor for NUS would even provide you with options of possible help that you can receive from the university.<br></div>
