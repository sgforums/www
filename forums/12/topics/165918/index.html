            <div class='col-md body'>hope you can get financial assistance or can work part time (eg give tuition) to see you through NUS. It's a waste to give up the opportunity to go to NUS.  Bite the bullet for a few years, at least you will not regret later that you didn't go to the Uni. Paper is quite important in our society. After you come out to work, you can support your sister better. When you go to Uni, she will still be in K1 K2 and pri 1, expenses still not so high, so hope your family can manage some how.</div>

If i am not wrong, u should be 22 or 23 bah.<br><br>Although the current situation is unfornate for u, My advise to you is that you weight ur priority first.<br><br>1.  Study<br>2.  Work<br>3.  Family<br>4.  Leisure.<br><br>which one matters to u most?  and which one can u afford to give up now?<br><br>Leisure<br>Its something u cannot afford right now.. so tat is definately not an issue now..  ..<br><br>u have time ahead of u.. All these can come later in life.. although u might enjoy life a bit later than ur mates, tat is..<br><br>Study<br>i understand u got ur own dreams, desires etc.. everyone have dreams of a high life, pretty gf, etc.. But unfortunately for u, all these will come at a cost.. to urself.. ur family tat is..<br><br>As u calculated earlier, no matter what loan u take, end of the day, u be owing a whole lot of money.<br><br>I believe ur parents should have money woes by now.. is it necessary to add on to it?<br><br>If you really have the interest to study.. u can always work for a few years first.. save enough money.. then go study..<br><br>or else..a scholarship is the only way for u to be able to study, give a bit of money to ur family etc.<br><br>In the event u cant get a scholarship.. well i suggest u start working first..<br><br>Family.<br>Your family is not well off. Ur sis is only a 4 yr old kid.  Since ur dad might not be around much longer, i think as his child, or only son, u should try to make life more comfortable for him before he leaves.. As you say, tis time might not be long to come, and he have slogged all his life for the family.  I think he deserve something better than to work until his last days?<br><br>Another consideration is that how ur mum and dad really feel about the situation?  And how is ur mum going to cope in the future?  Ur whole family is under tremenous stress.. it is better not to add on to it.. im sure that  u probably feel the same stress, but someone must be strong to lead the family through this.<br><br>But u know the problems, in ur heart, u should know what to give up.. what to do first..<br><br>Life is a long path.. as long as u live.. there are a lot of things  u can do, strive for, work towards to.. cheer up~<br><br>rdgs~<br>bin~<br><br>..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sign on with SAF is a great idea! also find ways to mortage your home and use that money to refinance. Singapore also has a good stock market. You might also want to study and look into that to learn how to reinvest your money. if you have a hdb flat that you have paid off on. you might consider mortage or downgrade and invest your money in higher yield bonds. Even though in your situation, you can invest in high-risk high yield bonds or portfolio, from your writing style, it seems like you don't like to take risks.<br><br>I would suggest low risk bonds or funds that would give you a steady return until your financial situatation stablises with a more permanent job. then you can slowly diversify your portfolio or refinance your new downgraded home.<br><br>Another option is to downgrade your home and move into a cheaper HDB flat at lousier location. housing prices are down for now. you might get a good deal. Wait 5-6 years and when the market is up sell and then buy another one. This always helps, but its a long term investment plan.<br><br>To solve your short term finances, go for the low risk bonds or funds and mortgaging your home are some of the financial choices you can make. check out yahoo finance or www.fool.com or www.etrade.com are good websites that you can learn for free how to reinvest your money.

            <div class='col-md body'>Nothing is absolute - that's what I always believe. Hence, no decision is a perfectly good decision anyway.<br><br>Firstly, follow what your heart tells you. Honestly, I am for the idea that you get a job and help with the family first. You will still get to move on with life. Suggesting this because I sensed that this seems a better option for you.<br><br><strong>BUT</strong> it is important that you keep the option of furthering your studies. While working, you can still do some part-time degree courses in the evenings, which usually would allow you to complete over a longer period of time (say, 4 years) of your choice.<br><br>However, if your heart is actually telling you that you should continue with NUS (which means I misinterpreted the direction your heart is facing) then you should really go ahead. Somehow it would still work out well. There are people out there in worse-off situations than you are in, and they managed nevertheless with their sheer determination and perseverance.<br><br>Finally, I suggest you base your decisions on your priorities in life (materialism should <strong>not</strong> embed in any of your priorities); don't base your decisions by only your sense of responsiblites.</div>
