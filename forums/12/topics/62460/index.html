            <div class='col-md body'>well, maybe I cannot help you, as like many said it's up to you will yourself out... but I got a suggestion... instead of just sitting in front of a computer, why not work something out with a computer, since you like computers so much?? If you're more interested in it than your studies... or choose something that you like to do... like a friend of mine who did not make it pass the 'N's as well, told me about his inspiration to pick up hair styling.. it's a trade... and when it's a skill you can make it big one day too than just staring at the screen doing nothing...<br><br>Com'on manz.. we can only give advise and suggestions.. that is our help to you.. you want to pick it up or not it's another thing. the food is on the table, I can't force you to eat if you don't want... be strong... stand up and be ready to take on the challenge...</div>

Who wants a guy who, like you said: <strong>... life is so screwed up,no friends to talk to ,all day only computer.and now the one i love doesnt seem to give a damn abt me. </strong> Think about this, even if she does accept your proposal to be together in a relationship - what makes you think that your attitude can help to maintain your own relationship?
