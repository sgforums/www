              <p>I have experienced what TS did b4. Once, i organsed a 21st birthday party at changi. Most of my friends lived in the west. Out of 65, 50+ came. I would suggest since TS has already ordered the food, just go ahead with the party. Take it as an opportunity to differentiate true friends from hi-bye friends. I wouldn't blame those who didn't come as they prioritize other things than u. Do the same to them as everyone is different. The worst are those who claim will come but in the end pang seh. Do the same to them in the future too. They aen't worth to be called 'friends' at all.</p>

              <p><br>To ironpeasant&gt; I think TS's problem is more severe than yours...For a birthday in Changi, you had an attendance of at least 77%, and more so they are willing to travel the entire island...</p>
              <p>Good advice. Always remember the adage, <em>do unto others what others do unto you</em>. They pangseh you, you pangseh them BACK. Oh, and being the generous folks we are, make that double the pangseh we dole out.</p>

              <p>Well, it's my birthday soon, tomorrow actually and I organised a gathering at changi chalet. I thought it would be very easy to invite ppl, come gather gather but all mostly I ask, I get half hearted response. Some don't even reply to sms at all. I ordered 180bucks worth of food from online but now,I feel like reducing the amount of food as not many ppl will turn up but I dont think the online food store will allow? I hope they would if not it will be a waste.</p>
              <p>What the hell is wrong with people. One of my close friend said she had to go to church and therfore can't attend but before that,she promised that she will try very hard not to PS me again. But deep down inside I know,if anything that has anything to do with her church, she will choose it. Another matter is my classmates, not a very united class after all. Before that there was a mass email, asking for gathering and I thought perhaps it would be great,convinent for them to use the chalet but those people in charge of gathering the troops, they did so half heartedly while asking me to relax, chill den last min half done. If they cant gather do it well, dun promise me, dun ask me to relax in the first place, I hate tat kind of "bochap" attitude in people.</p>
              <p>What is depressing is the image of me celebrating alone,crying myself to sleep on my birthday. I feel no love. :'(</p>
              <p>I think this is god's punishment for me. When I was young, I was a bad kid, I stole money during primary sch. Haiz, but I never did that again and that guilt kept haunting me. This lonesome life and the tough path in my love life has got me contemplating what is there to live for?</p>

              <p>Happy Birthday to you friend.</p>
              <p>How old are you by the way?</p>
              <p>I'm 26 this year and my experience tells me that, as you grow up, it's like that one, everyone will have their own plans and commitments.</p>
              <p>I have always only celebrate my birthday with my parents, buy a small cake, that's it, I don't believe in inviting friends. Because I was afraid that it will turn out like what you are going to face too. Buck up. In fact, as a buddhist myself, birthday is a day to remind us the kindness of our mothers who bring deliver us into this world. The pain that mothers went through were never be able to comprehend by men.</p>
              <p>So instead of wasting time and money on people like what you're facing now, might as well show more appreciation to your mother, your parents, your family, for giving you the proper environment to grow up in.</p>
              <p>This year, beside my brother, a counsin, a long time no contact pri sch friend and my gf who sms me happy bday, not a single so-called 'brothers' during my sec sch did sms me. I dare claim that I remember all their bdays. Anyway who cares?</p>
              <p>Treasure the ones around you. Let this be a growing experience. Nothing to cry about it anyway.</p>
              <p>Make a birthday resolution. Be strong.</p>
              <p>Take care/</p>

              <p>Well, it's my birthday soon, tomorrow actually and I organised a gathering at changi chalet. I thought it would be very easy to invite ppl, come gather gather but all mostly I ask, I get half hearted response. Some don't even reply to sms at all. I ordered 180bucks worth of food from online but now,I feel like reducing the amount of food as not many ppl will turn up but I dont think the online food store will allow? I hope they would if not it will be a waste.</p>
              <p>What the hell is wrong with people. One of my close friend said she had to go to church and therfore can't attend but before that,she promised that she will try very hard not to PS me again. But deep down inside I know,if anything that has anything to do with her church, she will choose it. Another matter is my classmates, not a very united class after all. Before that there was a mass email, asking for gathering and I thought perhaps it would be great,convinent for them to use the chalet but those people in charge of gathering the troops, they did so half heartedly while asking me to relax, chill den last min half done. If they cant gather do it well, dun promise me, dun ask me to relax in the first place, I hate tat kind of "bochap" attitude in people.</p>
              <p>What is depressing is the image of me celebrating alone,crying myself to sleep on my birthday. I feel no love. :'(</p>
              <p>I think this is god's punishment for me. When I was young, I was a bad kid, I stole money during primary sch. Haiz, but I never did that again and that guilt kept haunting me. This lonesome life and the tough path in my love life has got me contemplating what is there to live for?</p>
