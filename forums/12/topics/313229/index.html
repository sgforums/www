              <p>Well, it's my birthday soon, tomorrow actually and I organised a gathering at changi chalet. I thought it would be very easy to invite ppl, come gather gather but all mostly I ask, I get half hearted response. Some don't even reply to sms at all. I ordered 180bucks worth of food from online but now,I feel like reducing the amount of food as not many ppl will turn up but I dont think the online food store will allow? I hope they would if not it will be a waste.</p>
              <p>What the hell is wrong with people. One of my close friend said she had to go to church and therfore can't attend but before that,she promised that she will try very hard not to PS me again. But deep down inside I know,if anything that has anything to do with her church, she will choose it. Another matter is my classmates, not a very united class after all. Before that there was a mass email, asking for gathering and I thought perhaps it would be great,convinent for them to use the chalet but those people in charge of gathering the troops, they did so half heartedly while asking me to relax, chill den last min half done. If they cant gather do it well, dun promise me, dun ask me to relax in the first place, I hate tat kind of "bochap" attitude in people.</p>
              <p>What is depressing is the image of me celebrating alone,crying myself to sleep on my birthday. I feel no love. :'(</p>
              <p>I think this is god's punishment for me. When I was young, I was a bad kid, I stole money during primary sch. Haiz, but I never did that again and that guilt kept haunting me. This lonesome life and the tough path in my love life has got me contemplating what is there to live for?</p>

              <p>Who you stole money from ?</p>
              <p>You wanna get out of this guilty life ?</p>
              <p>I suggest you seek out that person you stole from.. and admit to him/her what you did.. ask that person for forgiveness.</p>
              <p>Thereafter , use not this same excuse for your pathetic choices. For it is no longer a valid one.</p>
              <p>Think about how to make yourself happy.. when you expect others to always make you happy.. you will lead a life constantly dissapointed by the people around you.</p>

              <p>A few comments:</p>
              <p>1. Inviting is easy, <em>actually</em> getting them to come is another. If people are not close to you, they may not prioritize your invitation, i.e. if something deemed more important or 'fun' comes up, your b-day party will be the bridesmaid and play the second fiddle.</p>
              <p>2. A 'close' friend who chooses church over you. Not once, but <em>always</em>. Get the irony? If she were close, she would have sacrificed her church stuff <em>for once</em>. You may view her as close but she may not think so. Think of a one-sided relationship. Please review on how close you two actually are and whether she still deserves the 'closeness'.</p>
              <p>3. When organising a birthday party, get close friends and NOT workmates / classmates / people who you see often due to circumstances (e.g. same class / office). These people don't really care much about you, unlike close pals, as evidenced in their 'bo-chap' manner of assisting your party. Also, invite <em>only</em> <em>close friends</em> and NOT all your classmates, especially those you're not close to. Give yourself a sense of 'exclusivity' and don't appear to be some 'desperado' trying to boost his party attendance. A smaller <em>but closer</em> party is sometimes better...</p>
              <p>4. Please don't blame your misfortunes on the fact that you stole money when you were younger. I hope you have repented from the misdeed. Anyway, I've seen my fair share of people who are bad (i.e. backstabbers, cheaters, hypocrites) who still are <em>successful</em>  in many things, including getting many people to attend their b-day party. The world is unfair. With or without God.</p>
              <p>5. Don't worry about celebrating your birthday alone. We all do that. I do that too. You're not alone in this. Sometimes, we are too preoccupied with how many pals in our Facebook account, how large is the attendance for our b-day party, that we forgot to be happy with OURSELVES. If no one wants to attend your party, so be it. Celebrate it on your own then. And ENJOY about it. (By the way, your family? Are they invited?)</p>
              <p>6. Now you have learnt the hard truth of your pals' about-turn, give them a taste of their own medicine. They don't attend your party? Snub theirs then. They screw up your invitation and party admin? Jolly well reciprocate, mate! They never took your b-day seriously, so why should you take them seriously and worry about them? Worry about them not loving you? Live your own life. For you are born alone and you shall die alone. Like the other 6 billion folks out there...</p>

              <p>Merry B'day.</p>
              <p>Agree with most of the advice here. Do something that you will enjoy, with or without others.</p>
              <p>It is a sad thing to rely on others for your own happiness. Doesn't mean you should be selfish.</p>
              <p>Its like if you wanna eat, gotta learn to fish. Not wait for someone to give it to you. But you can find someone who is willing to teach you. Next time you can pass it forward too to someone else who needs that skill.</p>
              <p>Just nice its a new year in your life, you should think about it. Grow into a more capable person rather than a needier one. But most of all enjoy your day, you sound like you have years of youth ahead.</p>

              <p>1. Inviting is easy, <em>actually</em> getting them to come is another. If people are not close to you, they may not prioritize your invitation, i.e. if something deemed more important or 'fun' comes up, your b-day party will be the bridesmaid and play the second fiddle.</p>
              <p>2. A 'close' friend who chooses church over you. Not once, but <em>always</em>. Get the irony? If she were close, she would have sacrificed her church stuff <em>for once</em>. You may view her as close but she may not think so. Think of a one-sided relationship. Please review on how close you two actually are and whether she still deserves the 'closeness'.</p>
              <p>3. When organising a birthday party, get close friends and NOT workmates / classmates / people who you see often due to circumstances (e.g. same class / office). These people don't really care much about you, unlike close pals, as evidenced in their 'bo-chap' manner of assisting your party. Also, invite <em>only</em> <em>close friends</em> and NOT all your classmates, especially those you're not close to. Give yourself a sense of 'exclusivity' and don't appear to be some 'desperado' trying to boost his party attendance. A smaller <em>but closer</em> party is sometimes better...</p>
              <p>4. Please don't blame your misfortunes on the fact that you stole money when you were younger. I hope you have repented from the misdeed. Anyway, I've seen my fair share of people who are bad (i.e. backstabbers, cheaters, hypocrites) who still are <em>successful</em>  in many things, including getting many people to attend their b-day party. The world is unfair. With or without God.</p>
              <p>5. Don't worry about celebrating your birthday alone. We all do that. I do that too. You're not alone in this. Sometimes, we are too preoccupied with how many pals in our Facebook account, how large is the attendance for our b-day party, that we forgot to be happy with OURSELVES. If no one wants to attend your party, so be it. Celebrate it on your own then. And ENJOY about it. (By the way, your family? Are they invited?)</p>
              <p>6. Now you have learnt the hard truth of your pals' about-turn, give them a taste of their own medicine. They don't attend your party? Snub theirs then. They screw up your invitation and party admin? Jolly well reciprocate, mate! They never took your b-day seriously, so why should you take them seriously and worry about them? Worry about them not loving you? Live your own life. For you are born alone and you shall die alone. Like the other 6 billion folks out there...</p>

              <p>Well, it's my birthday soon, tomorrow actually and I organised a gathering at changi chalet. I thought it would be very easy to invite ppl, come gather gather but all mostly I ask, I get half hearted response. Some don't even reply to sms at all. I ordered 180bucks worth of food from online but now,I feel like reducing the amount of food as not many ppl will turn up but I dont think the online food store will allow? I hope they would if not it will be a waste.</p>

              <p><br>Not easy. Becuz your class might not be that unified in the first place. In addition the date, the time and meeting location might not be so ideal for some people. Hey today is a weekday,and don't they have to work or study ? There are many reasons why people can't go for your party and it is clearly not becuz of you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Confirm the attendance,and roughly guage the amount of food to order. Enjoy your birthday with your family and loved ones. It is much more meaningful to celebrate your hatch day with your family and your closer clique. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ahh stealing money is totally irrelevant to this birthday issue. I don't see why you link it as an punishment from God. As long as you know you are wrong, make a mistakes and don't commit stealing again. It is okay.You will be forgiven.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I have experienced what TS did b4. Once, i organsed a 21st birthday party at changi. Most of my friends lived in the west. Out of 65, 50+ came. I would suggest since TS has already ordered the food, just go ahead with the party. Take it as an opportunity to differentiate true friends from hi-bye friends. I wouldn't blame those who didn't come as they prioritize other things than u. Do the same to them as everyone is different. The worst are those who claim will come but in the end pang seh. Do the same to them in the future too. They aen't worth to be called 'friends' at all.</p></div>
