The company he is working for is MLM - on a personal note: I feel that MLM company talk far too much (con, create illusion) to bring people in and the promise of making big bucks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The husband is drawn to it BECAUSE he wants to prove to his wife he can make his own decision and have good result.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Reality sinks in: He has failed and is now suffering from the consequence of tactless &amp; irrational move he made.<br><br>The art of communication is bringing across your message, bury it deep into the other person's mind, while maintaining all other variables. Felt that his wife is trying to prove his worthless and probably his own character flaws (pampered, sheltered, etc)- this shows that the way she is bringing her message across isn't very effective.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Both have to learn:<br><br>I) He shouldn't be intimidated by her wife's qualification/career because if he does - why marry her in the first place? He has to <strong>release that ego </strong>of his and learn to be appreciative of the wife's positive quality/points. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>II) Wife has to learn to watch that ego of his - learn to influence him in a way that he doesn't find it offensive yet he is willing to accept your way/idea/preception of doing things. She cannot use degrading terms even when quarreling with him and must, at all times, put him as equal (nothing more, nothing less.)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S (Interesting note): Men with better qualified wife would normally (psychological effect) win their wife in bed, since they can't fight with them in their career.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The refusal to support husband monetarily, it looks to me, serves the purpose of part teaching, &amp; part punishment.  The wife is upset about what the husband did, and resentful at the way he turned out to be.  So she takes it out on him by being vengeful.<br><br>Revenge is sweet and she can indulge in it if it makes her feel better, but only until then, because it doesn't solve anything.<br><br>She should recognise that he is now working a regular job and give him credit for it.  Habits need time to change.  And that we all make mistakes, no one is infallible.  Where to look for second chances but from our loved ones?<br><br>I believe that few changes can be made from external impetus, but in this case it seems necessary that the man learns and changes, so her intention is correct.  However her tactic isn't working, and only makes the husband more bitter and defensive against any other influence.<br><br>When it comes to advice, especially from women, most men "eat soft, don't eat hard".  To change him, she has to gain his trust first.  If he feels judged critically by her &amp; there's a barrier, nothing she does will move him.  So she should adopt a sympathetic attitude towards him and not focus on money / work issues all the time.<br><br>Meanwhile she should decide how much is she willing to support him financially and emotionally, and stick to it.  It is fair for her to set a limit to her contribution, there is nothing to apologise about.<br><br>Then sit down &amp; agree on some realistic objectives and work together with him towards the goals.  I do not agree that love is unconditional.  There is only so much sh|t one person can put up with; any relationship works only with effort from both sides.  Tell him plainly that this stress is ruining the marriage and that both of them should work on some changes before rifts are irreparable.<br><br>The first focus should be that he becomes self-sufficient and not need handouts.  Hoping to build a nest egg together is too ambitious; take it calmly in baby steps.  Make compromises on both sides, just to get things started.</div>
