Unless she doesn't love him anymore or her heart has died...which I dun think so rite...otherwise y is she still with him and gave him so much support despite her own advice.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the wife is upset. She just wants her husband to learn the lesson the hard way. At least she is helping him out a little. The point is i dont think that he should used up the savings but if the wife supported him when he did that, then she cant bitch about it.</div>
