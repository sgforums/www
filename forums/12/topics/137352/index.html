Each of the letter of the beginning of the poem spells her name and also the words I LOVE YOU. It isntly likely for someone to put this up to show ppl when they have no feelings for the person.<br><br>MY fren told me she was touched but to her it doesnt mean anyhting else. She also said it was sweet.<br><br>I was just wondering how guys and girls see this touched thing differently. If someone wana chase u, he will have to do sth to touch u or woo u over. In that case, feeling touched means giving a chance and accepting?? Strange of my fren to contradict this thinking.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Being touched by someone doesn't neccesarily mean liking a person. If someone is sweet and nice to you, and u dun feel touched then it also says alot about you as a person. It's natural to be touched by nice gestures. But when someone is touched by another, it usually means that that someone has a pretty good impression of the one who has touched him or her.</div>
