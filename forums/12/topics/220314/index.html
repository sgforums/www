            <div class='col-md body'>obviously she don't like you.  so what say you cut her some slack and let go?  I know its hard, been through such situation myself (rejection).<br><br>remember, she's isn't the one for you and its just that you have not met the right one.  occupy yourself with things, exercise, activities so that you are not wandering off and start thinking.<br><br>avoid places that she hangs out, and avoid contact where possible.  what she is doing is clearly, finding you instrusive and sending you a clear message that she do not like you.<br><br>a relationship is happy with two consenting parties, its not when one party is not consenting or unhappy.  so if you love her, let her go.  its hard, its tough, its easier said than done.  But you are man, chins up, time will heal.</div>
