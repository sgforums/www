              <p>  From what i know generally we have to work for at least 3 days to have any payment else is no pay . Electrocuting is part and parcel of any technical work , i myself have been electrocuted by 240v 3 times within half an hour and one of my colleague was burnt on his hand when he rest his hand onto a hot soldering iron  . That is part of work in the outside world . You never say in detail why they sack you perhaps you did some damage to their machines or systems . Just a short in the circuitry or wires can cause some major damage to any electrical or electronics system .</p>
              <p>      In any case there is no such things as fairness in this world , i joined a famouse company in sg specialising in photocopy machines and was forced to quit by my own manager for " wasting their time " . But the thing was when this manager took over this particular dept , nine existing staff either resign or was forced to resigned . And after i resigned , soon the other new staff belonging to my batch also forced to resign . The last one was fortunately transferred to other tech dept . Then i heard the GM of the entire tech dept transfer this manager to planning dept and that manager was soon also resign on his own . I call this retribution although me and my other fellow batch of newbies was unfairly forced to resigned .</p>

              <p>Hmm, i think RE is like v cheating.... get u a job, den u got to pay them $50 plus 7% gst. Den on top of that if u kanna confirm by the company, the company will pay them money too. I got bad exp with Personage and this RE job agency. I tink job hunters should go to GMP.No contract, and u need not pay them intro fees.They will get the fees from the company.</p>

              <p>Was your timesheet signed on your last day of work?  If you have all the signed timesheets with the company stamp by, you can produce these as proof and approach MOM for help.   </p>
              <p>Or simply call, Recruit express to threaten them you want to report them to MOM if you still don;t receive you pay.     I ever did that to one agency and in no time I was paid.</p>

              <p>Recently, I got a packer job through an agent from Recruit
              Express. However, midway, i was fired by the supervisor. The next
              day, the agent called me and asked why i quit. I clearly explained
              to her that i was fired. She said she would call me back. And after
              a few weeks, there wasnt a call from the company or her. I also
              didnt received my pay. So, i called up the agent and asked her why
              hasnt my pay been deposited into my account?<br> <br> To my dismay, she balantly said, " oh? you quit what, of cause nv
              pay u money" . And once again, i told her that i DID not quit. I
              was fired. But she insisted that i resigned.<br> <br> (Because i have to pay them $$$ if i resigned, on the other hand,
              if i was fired, i do not need to pay them a single cent)<br> <br> And also, i was almost electrocuted at least 3 times during my job.
              I told the agent and still nothing was done to resolve the
              issue.<br> <br> <br> Dear forumers, can you please advice me on how to go about claiming
              my pay? Do i have to go SCT ? or even ministry of
              manpower?</p>

              <p>CASE will be your best fren.</p>
              <p>Bring the story up to the newspapers then if it's published, good luck, they might even give you additional compensation on top of your salary to stop all you from telling them more details about the company thus their biz will slide down temporary.</p>
