              <p>today an incident triggered another issue.</p>
              <p>I was supposed to have lunch with my mum and sis, so i ask her to join along, she declined, upon reaching home i asked my mum where we going and she said that we will be changing it to dinner. (now my mum recently designated sunday to be "family day" mainly because my sister suggested it and that i was spending less and less time with my family, yesterday for example, i went out with my gf the whole day and spent the night at her house.)</p>
              <p>but my mum said that we will be having dinner at home instead of going out. Now i made plans with her to bring her to somewhere for dinner after going lunch with my family so i told her we can go out in the afternoon then go dinner with my family at my house but she said in her own words" don't need, i don't feel like seeing you. Need some space. You wasted my sunday and i could have gone out with other people or used my time more wisely"</p>
              <p>Now, power struggle analysis time. How to convince her to think in my shoes?</p>

              <p>Isn't it strange how mothers/family starts wanting to spend more time with you AFTER you found a woman you want to love and spend your life time with ?</p>
              <p>If your sis wants to spend her sunday with the family, that's her priviledge.</p>
              <p>But if you prefer to spend say Monday or Wednesday with your family, that's your priviledge.Your sis don't have to do so if she don't want to either.</p>
              <p>Grow some backbones and decide for YOURSELF what you truly want. Stop letting others rule your life dude.</p>
              <p>OK. So you plan your whole schedule according to your mom's whims and fancy ?</p>
              <p>No dude, if your mom told you before it's gonna be lunch.. and you have made plans to go dinner with your gf, you stick with dinner with your girlfriend. In other words you stick with your original schedule.</p>
              <p>Your mom wants to change last minute, then tell her.. sorry you've already got something else planned out... your family won't starve without you at the dinner table . Understand ?</p>
              <p>And vice versa.. if you already made plans for your family ahead of time, and your gf wants you to "change" your schedule to yield to her time, tell her NO, because <strong>a promise is a promise</strong>. You are a person with integrity. That's how you earn respect.</p>
              <p>The reason why she gets pissed is this.. both of you made plans. She has her expectations of how that sunday is gonna be like for her. And yes, she needs to plan her time too.. she does have a life too.. and it ain't gonna revolve around your/your mom's indecisions.</p>
              <p>You keep flip flopping because your mom wants this your mom wants that.. hello.. why don't you go marry your mom then?</p>
              <p>Dude, you keep carrying on trying to please everyone.. your relationship ain't gonna last very long anyway.</p>
              <p>So yes, like what MOST of the forumers here says.. it's time to dump her.. BEFORE she dumps you.</p>
              <p>Think about it.</p>

              <p>By your nick, i guess you're 28 this year.<br>&gt; You have to ask yourself "Is she the lady for you"?<br>&gt;You want to marry her? Confirm liao? Cannot get anyone better?</p>
              <p>Some females love to see ppl jammed over her.<br>It may be because of she know that you cannot lose her, that why her wing become stronger everyday.</p>
              <p>Want her think in your view got many factors de.<br>1)If she is mature enough, she will not like that.<br>2)She might be all along a pampered girl thus she reacted like that.<br>3)Some people take others for granted.(Guys &amp; Ladies also same)<br>4)Some ppl charactor are like that.<br><br>If you are ok with her actions, her time to time mood, her never pass through brain talking, then good luck.</p>
              <p>If you think back, is she the same all along when you first with her? or did something happen that trigger all this issues? Or did she have some unsolvable issue that is stressing her?</p>
              <p>If i'm you, i just pay her by her own medicine. She can do it, why you cannot? But you have to be prepared to leave the lady if sh*t happens. Dun get softhearted, be a player, you gotta control your emotions. After a few time, you will be very "tahan" to this type of things.</p>
              <p>Good Luck.</p>
