This will "refill" the flames with oil <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> .<br><br>Anyway im just a 23 year old guy but i do have elder brothers that married at your age... but ask yourselves this .... when we were young,we always trying to do crazy things right???why? its fun...its wild. So try again to do those things...i know u are married/working and possible have less time with family... but a "little" investment in time will bring long way in marriage.<br><br>Good Luck...and try to update us on your situation</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi all,<br><br>just pondering over whats been said<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>i think its a case of having the cake and wanting to eat it too. life's just full of chocos yadayada... qn is: to be selfish or not to be. (if anyones getting the drift)<br><br>yeah but i reckon tt everything is alright if one chooses not to CROSS the line.<br><br>what i wanted to point out is:<br><br>1) in life maybe nothings perfect. if you find someone who can communicate w you on the utmost level, have great sex, compliments your character completely, then good on you cos you found a perfect partner. grab on to him/her for your dear lives, but that aint the case for me. i will work on the expectation bit but i guess its my life.<br><br>2) love is something so damn abstract. u cant explain it, let alone label it. who is to say what is, or what is not, love? and love can exist on many different levels... sheesh... better not comment too much on it cos i sure as hell am not an expert (otherwise i wont be here lamenting right?)<br><br>3) commitment: take it seriously. its your basic responsibility as a human being. or at least it is dictated by society.<br><br>i think we primates arent built for monogamy. but rules bind us to be so. end of the day, long as you claim all responsibility for your actions, i think everyones got a right to live your own life.<br><br>pparker out.</div>
