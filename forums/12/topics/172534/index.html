            <div class='col-md body'>today was my 2nd day of school and i encountered some problems and conflicts already. true enuf it concerns my disgusting form teacher along with a few other black sheep teachers around. i really hate them to the core. arent teachers supposed to be caring, forgiving and not force students to do stuff? after today i learnt to hate my ugly form teacher even more then before..<br><br>this morn i entered my sch just on time and a fuking china man PE teacher stopped me and a few of my schmates while walking into the sch compund. the reason being, according to HIS WATCH it shows the time supposed to report. he called us to stand in a corner and 5 mins later the bell rang. even i voiced out my concern and told him we arent late he still did not care and demanded we stay in position while asking a dumb councillor to book us. sad thing, he took us for PE today and he KNOWS my height and weight. sheeesh. fuking unreasonable..<br><br>during assembly our self appointed dm kept emphasizing on checking attire and stuff. my picky and fussy form teacher who is also extremly hideous to add on,.. told me to CUT/do something to my hair Yesterday AND today despite me having told her i already DID. i pity our new classmates that joined us. i suffered with this wh0rehead for one year already and had enuf. about the hair i had it reverted back on new years eve JUST to prepare myself for sch but to my dismay i still got scolded by the bich. to think i spent a hefty sum of money already it just makes me feel like giving her a tight slap.<br><br>i have it recolured black but there are still some parts with are undone. PLUS i removed my hair extensions and cut off some of the layering done before. still i use hair spray on the first day as i thought the brown color is still obseravablt and she told me tomorrow dont come with it i said fine. today i really din and she demanded i go do something TODAY. go to hell man. she thinks i am very rich.<br><br>i still can see certain teachers keep targeting me thou i thought they should forget about the past as it is a new year. our school councillors are also a wicked lot. they do watever they like without getting scolded and are basically treated as gods by teachers and command us. that is why most ppl dont respect them.<br><br>thank god i am not retained or else i will have to bear with this shiit for another year. my A levels are at stake if i dont work hard enuf so im quite in deep shiet now. first day was not as bad as i thought, but today is the absolute worst day ever. that is why i rushed back home today...<br><br>i hope these pplp have their fair share of well deserved punishment soon for being the meanest grp of ppl i ve ever seen on this damned planet</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No use going against the teachers. They always think they are right...<br><br>My school has a tiny amount of unreasonable teachers so its alright for me. But what I cannot stand is the way they run the school.<br><br>Starting from last year July, HOD started kpkb about the high costs of printing worksheets and notes. Ration paper to the point that teachers have to BUY their own papers to print. Another way is the students PAY for their worksheets. One point to note is the printing of all these papers should be included in the school fees, which is around $20.<br><br>THIS YEAR, they started kpkb-ing again. HOD says paper are cheap stuff (But they still rationing it) and said that the INK is more expensive. KNN la!!! Now even if teachers have paper and want to print also have to pay for ink. Dunno what the HOD doing. As if the teachers don't have problems to worry about...<br><br>All the talk about saving money... MY FOOT AR! Built fountain (Its sponsored, but the plant decorations are not), got tons of statues, huge colourful balls, all for NOTHING. Just decoration. Kao... Not to mention those paintings on the wall as well. Dunno spend how much on decorations yet last year EOY examinations the teachers wanted to save money, decided to cut back on printing notes for students.<br><br>Sorry, back to you. Just concentrate on your studies. Scold and curse your teachers behind their backs (Don't let them find out la...) together with your friends. Friends wil help you pull through all these obstacles <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
