            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by xinyi!:</div><div class="quote_body">today was my 2nd day of school and i encountered some problems and conflicts already. true enuf it concerns my disgusting form teacher along with a few other black sheep teachers around. i really hate them to the core. arent teachers supposed to be caring, forgiving and not force students to do stuff? after today i learnt to hate my ugly form teacher even more then before..<br><br>this morn i entered my sch just on time and a fuking china man PE teacher stopped me and a few of my schmates while walking into the sch compund. the reason being, according to HIS WATCH it shows the time supposed to report. he called us to stand in a corner and 5 mins later the bell rang. even i voiced out my concern and told him we arent late he still did not care and demanded we stay in position while asking a dumb councillor to book us. sad thing, he took us for PE today and he KNOWS my height and weight. sheeesh. fuking unreasonable..<br><br>during assembly our self appointed dm kept emphasizing on checking attire and stuff. my picky and fussy form teacher who is also extremly hideous to add on,.. told me to CUT/do something to my hair Yesterday AND today despite me having told her i already DID. i pity our new classmates that joined us. i suffered with this wh0rehead for one year already and had enuf. about the hair i had it reverted back on new years eve JUST to prepare myself for sch but to my dismay i still got scolded by the bich. to think i spent a hefty sum of money already it just makes me feel like giving her a tight slap.<br><br>i have it recolured black but there are still some parts with are undone. PLUS i removed my hair extensions and cut off some of the layering done before. still i use hair spray on the first day as i thought the brown color is still obseravablt and she told me tomorrow dont come with it i said fine. today i really din and she demanded i go do something TODAY. go to hell man. she thinks i am very rich.<br><br>i still can see certain teachers keep targeting me thou i thought they should forget about the past as it is a new year. our school councillors are also a wicked lot. they do watever they like without getting scolded and are basically treated as gods by teachers and command us. that is why most ppl dont respect them.<br><br>thank god i am not retained or else i will have to bear with this shiit for another year. my A levels are at stake if i dont work hard enuf so im quite in deep shiet now. first day was not as bad as i thought, but today is the absolute worst day ever. that is why i rushed back home today...<br><br>i hope these pplp have their fair share of well deserved punishment soon for being the meanest grp of ppl i ve ever seen on this damned planet</div></blockquote>hey gal, everybody's doing their job.<br><br>u've got to understand that everyone of us has our part to play in this society. as a teacher, they have to make sure that the students obey the school rules, and make sure that the class do well in their exams. Basically, teachers have their fair share of burdens too, not only the students. Don't forget, the principal is above the teachers. He/she is like the boss, so if the teachers aren't performing, they may be transfered or even lose their job.<br><br>as a student, ur part is to obey the rules. because it is set by the school and is the system of the country to have such rules in school. also, not mentioning, to do well in all ur subjects and excell in school.<br><br>in conclusion, u just cannot blame certain teachers for being harsh, for they are not perfect. also, they can't please everybody like u and me. some of them may not have wad it takes to be diplomatic enuff but they may be good in some other areas, who knows..<br><br>so, i would like to add that blaming and hating others is not the way to live ur life. why make urself so unhappy and miserable? just do wad u can right now and in all things do ur best. and be a responsible person. that, is good enuff.</div>

They always think they are right...<br><br>My school has a tiny amount of unreasonable teachers so its alright for me. But what I cannot stand is the way they run the school.<br><br>Starting from last year July, HOD started kpkb about the high costs of printing worksheets and notes.

One point to note is the printing of all these papers should be included in the school fees, which is around $20.<br><br>THIS YEAR, they started kpkb-ing again. HOD says paper are cheap stuff (But they still rationing it) and said that the INK is more expensive. KNN la!!! Now even if teachers have paper and want to print also have to pay for ink.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm here's my input. What I can say is working as a teacher is not an easy task. Like regarding assessments, a teacher doesn't just teach one class, he/she teaches 3-4 classes. If each student is given 3pages of homework, guess how many pages the teacher has to mark? A class of 40 is 120 pages of work, 4classes is 480 pages!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> Imagine going through 480 pages of work everyday. What if it's composition writing? 160 stories to read through and correct? It's a tedious job.<br><br>A teacher's job scope is not just limited to teaching. They participate in alot of administration work like in charge of various CCAs. With the CCA HoD pressing down on them, they have to use their already meager time to liase with the CCA coaches, collect coach fees, book locations for CCA usage, manage with the attendance etc. There's a lot of work to do.<br><br>Every year a grade is given to each teacher by the school panel. The grading is dependent on the performance of the teacher throughout the year term. It will affect the amount of bonus the teacher will get, he/her ranking and it's like an assessment on whether he/she is able to cope on tutoring the current level or not. Sad to say often complaints from parents are taken into consideration too. Those who work with teachers in the school environment will often hear how bad the complaints from parents are. "I feel that my daughter is not receiving enough homework and because of this I have to hire a home tutor to give her more" is one of the most common complaints<br><br>Hmm, enough ranting. I'm going out of topic.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br>Do have some empathy on your teachers and lecturers. It's not easy to control a class of 40 unique individuals who each have their own thinking and opinions. Sometimes it's just that it happens that you are the most unique out of the lot and the teacher just happens to take notice of you. Teachers have a  set timing to deliver the content they are supposed to teach. It wouldn't be good if the teacher spends more time correcting the students than to teach lesson proper and at the end of year exams the lessons are not covered right? They still have to answer to your parents.</div>
