Pretty or not - their biogical system is very similar to ours. To be honest, if women can seek men based on their financial capacity, it is not wrong for men to also seek women base on looks and age. On the other hand, it is acknowledge that it is unfair to only judge women on looks alone. No need to be super model pretty, just suit your needs is good enough. Men do have every right to judge on looks - so as long as they don't go overboard. Pretty girls not necessary Snow White character. Many of them got attitude problem and high maintenance. Good heart is also important. Having said this, it doesn't mean the girl not pretty means her character is very good. I have seen some ugly girls have very bad malicious intent. Never believe those Snow White stories. So always look for a girl with good looks (not necessarily too good) and good character and oh! also good in-laws.</p></div>

              <p>An Aussie guy friend said to me once that Asian women are very pretty... BUT, the minute they open their mouths, he wants to run away!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  It's true cause I've noticed it myself - some women may be pretty, but they are crude, loud and very ah lian.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>This topic is pretty shallow.  I won't consider it 'love' if physical beauty is the #1 criteria.  It sounds more like lust to me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>BTW, you choose others, others will have to want to select you too! </p>
              <p>Also, as a person ages, they will not resemble what they look like now.  So, if you marry a pretty person, and she becomes fat and dumpy and no longer bothers to groom herself after marriage and kids, are you going to stop loving her?</p>

              <p>Wait till you french kiss them, after dinner then you can really
              smell their sambal petai breath, then you can also taste the
              food stuck between her teeth, vice versa she can taste the food
              stuck between your teeth too. Pretty or not - their biogical system
              is very similar to ours. To be honest, if women can seek men based
              on their financial capacity, it is not wrong for men to also seek
              women base on looks and age. On the other hand, it is acknowledge
              that it is unfair to only judge women on looks alone. No need to be
              super model pretty, just suit your needs is good enough. Men do
              have every right to judge on looks - so as long as they don't go
              overboard. Pretty girls not necessary Snow White character. Many of
              them got attitude problem and high maintenance. Good heart is also
              important. Having said this, it doesn't mean the girl not pretty
              means her character is very good. I have seen some ugly girls have
              very bad malicious intent. Never believe those Snow White stories.
              So always look for a girl with good looks (not necessarily too
              good) and good character and oh! also good in-laws.</p>

              <p>As I have said, the gal also demands jsut as high std, it is only fair that the guys also seek what they want. I am not here to comment about myself but on the overall subject here. I got a guy friend who is earning peanuts as a tennis instructer and part time pastor but his beautiful eurasian wife is a big time manager with an MNC. So why not? It can work. Some women see the virtue in the guy's heart.</p>

              <p>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and love is always blind. One man's blood is another man's poison. :]  Looks may cause the initial attraction and leave an impression but it is inner beauty that will last and find true love.</p>
              <p>Physical appearance is not everything and "ugly" people have as much right to fall in love as any beautiful people.  Don't be surprised if you see amongst your friends that the first to be married is not the best looking one.</p>
