              <p>I don't think any counseling advise here would help you. You can't handle your Thai wife. And she knows it, and blatantly disregard you. You can't do anything. You don't have the character to command her respect or even fear.</p>
              <p>Don't think any more, divorce her. Don't hope, and don't catch at slight  improvements to defer divorce. She has no respect for you. Do not believe her promises to change. She will only be discreet in future.</p>
              <p>Don't be too hard on yourself, we all make mistakes, frequently that mistake is in the choice of ones spouse.</p>

              <p><br>That moment had passed.  Why ask this qn when we already have the answer?  She had already admitted having another man.  And the reason why she is staying out late is obviously cos of that man.  What else you want her to say?</p>

              <p>I think it is still not late to make her realize how important she is to you if you still want this marriage to work. Since you have held out for so long, no point not trying another effort convincing your feelings you have for her.</p>
              <p>No point wasting your effort in confronting the other guy, when what you care is your wife. You should let her know that what the both of you here is sealed and concrete and that you would want to spend the rest of your life with her. Forget about the past mistakes that the both of you might have, but try and make her realize that she would be sorry if she wants to call it quits on you. Remember it is her that you want.</p>
              <p>I don't know how your feelings and situation is for her and the r/s. But if the both of you would still want to continue then you should step up and consult some professional counselling. Start off anew.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, let go if it for the better of the both of you.</p>
