              <p>In life, we must not take these harsh times and challenges as "too late". I see life as a strife for excellence no matter how imperfect as I may be. Simply because I just love myself to the core to ill-afford to hurt people around me.</p>

              <p>A relationship is about 2 people.  Not you alone in a relationship.  Even if you 'never think it is too late', you need your partner to feel that way towards you too.  Love CANNOT be one-sided.</p>

              <p>Your post here is rather contradictory. I mean what about the hours after dinner - where did they hang out till the wee hours of the morning? And what you gather is another story, what is she going to do with this 3rd party? What is this 3rd party going to do? Continue seeing your wife and initiating?  Somehow, I find that you're either witholding or really incredible. Is this your version of being fair? Are you still treating this rather lightly?</p>

              <p>I don't think she loves you enough, or is mature enough to understand that when you love someone, you don't want your partner to worry about you, or be left alone on special occasions?</p>
              <p>Or maybe she's just enjoying her own financial freedom and trying to have as much fun as possible?</p>
              <p>But I think she married you because of your money and now that she has started working, couldn't care less about you. Cuz she has her own money to spend liao.</p>

              <p>Why don't you start charging that guy by the hour while she's at it ?</p>
              <p>That way, at least you are getting some payback while she's enjoying herself with another guy.</p>
