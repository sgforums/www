            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I hv a very stupid question 2 ask here. I'm a 30 yrs old guy married for 4 yrs.. She's 3 yrs younger.. Until recently my wife has not been working since we're married.. She's a Thai n I'm a Singaporean. After she's started working 2 yrs ago, she started 2 go out with her friends 2 clubing.. Everything seems fine, but problem is she didn't ask me along most of the time.. Maybe once every 10 trips &amp; only after I've insisted 2 tag along.. In fact we used 2 go out during our courtship..<br>She's out almost twice or trice every month. Visiting clubs like MOS, Clinic &amp; St James Power Station.. Returning only after 4.. Several time even until 6 in the morning.. I trust her as she's always out with her gal friends..<br>I just wanna ask if this is a normal thing..? Shd I stop her or just let her b..?<br>Thanks for the time..</div>

Have an open talk about it. It seems that the only time that you 2 are spending together is at home. Not very healthy.<br><br>Do something that can spice up the marriage. Something like dating her again, surprise her with a small gift. There are means and ways to spice things up, find one that suits both ur lifestyle and ur pocket.<br><br>I guess she still wanna enjoy her life since she is only 27.

She knows tat she wrong <span style="color: red;">but she said she'll not stop as tis is her charactor n she'll not change..</span><br>Wat am I gonna do with her..?</div></blockquote>I always hate it when some1 say that their character will not change..its ok if she go clubbing 2/3 times a month but waht did she do when shes at home? spend time alone and ignoring her hubby ? this is just ridiculous.<br><br>why dont she change this habit and spend more time with you ? i really dun understand.. is clubbing more important than her love one ? Is this true love? TO leave your loved one alone and you go to enjoy urself ?<br><br>I cant accept this.. if i were u, i see no point of continuing this marriage.. marrige couple are suppossed to be happy.. not like this.. its not like this.<br><br>honestly, if she is my wife and behaving like this, i really do and will sacrifice her even if i really love her.. Love is not about everything.. Love is about both of u.. not only bcuz of her.. This is so one-sided way...</div>
