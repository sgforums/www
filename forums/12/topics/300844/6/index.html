              <p>TS is only relating to what has happened to his wife. No where in his entire post was there another side of the story. Isn't this very one-sided. I m sure there are some more things between them. Remember no one likes to be term as a loose and cheap character especially the ladies.</p>
              <p>Just for your sake, in any r/s there are bound to have quarrels and fights. Somehow, there will be some outstanding and unresolved accounts. How do you think they are unresolved? Well, let's take your self assumption and take for granted attitude to begin with, a lot of times we just aren't bothered with the minute details and just simply skim the surface and assume that all would be well. Well, that is not the way with matters of the heart and though there may be various ways looking and approaching it - we need to be particular and ever conscious to working out a solution together and resolve it for good.</p>
              <p>As I can assure you to stray is simply not an overnight affair, it is an accumulation of dissatisfaction, frustrations, disappointments and anger. And do you think for 1 single moment that it could be resolved so easily. It would require painstaking efforts and conviction to make things come around. Let me ask you this: Do you think that TS has never once neglected his wife? What about the times when he has been nothing but a chauvinist? What about the cultural differences? What about the times when they quarreled? Did he lay hands on her? Do you think TS is blameless there? Did he chose to be with his brothers over her, in her time of need? Did he miss out on being a good husband? Is there any financial problems between them? For them to be married and not have children till now is also questionable. Why is the wife on Facebook and MSN if their r/s is firm and that he is still the one she adored when she pledged herself to him? Does TS ever brood about his past r/s with his ex? Does TS takes his wife's efforts i.e. household chores, cleaning, cooking and what not, for granted? Criticise when things go bad and never a praise when she has done well. Does TS have some bad habits which time and again failed to change? Huh, you just make it sound so simple here and make things seemingly here and there - I wouldn't even dare to call this as objective and open minded.</p>
              <p>Remember, ppl don't like to air their dirty laundry and would certainly overlook their faults most of the time when the problem arise and hit them real hard on the face.</p>
              <p>As I have emphasized from the beginning, we are unaware what is actually happening within their marriage and only TS would be able to answer that himself. We can only offer some views and opinions and let him go on from there, what he chooses to do is really his. So, if he still treasure this marriage then he will need to work on it together with his wife. If not, then leave and break up.</p>

              <p>TS is only relating to what has happened to his wife. No where in his entire post was there another side of the story. Isn't this very one-sided. I m sure there are some more things between them. Remember no one likes to be term as a loose and cheap character especially the ladies.</p>
              <p>Just for your sake, in any r/s there are bound to have quarrels and fights. Somehow, there will be some outstanding and unresolved accounts. How do you think they are unresolved? Well, let's take your self assumption and take for granted attitude to begin with, a lot of times we just aren't bothered with the minute details and just simply skim the surface and assume that all would be well. Well, that is not the way with matters of the heart and though there may be various ways looking and approaching it - we need to be particular and ever conscious to working out a solution together and resolve it for good.</p>
              <p>As I can assure you to stray is simply not an overnight affair, it is an accumulation of dissatisfaction, frustrations, disappointments and anger. And do you think for 1 single moment that it could be resolved so easily. It would require painstaking efforts and conviction to make things come around. Let me ask you this: Do you think that TS has never once neglected his wife? What about the times when he has been nothing but a chauvinist? What about the cultural differences? What about the times when they quarreled? Did he lay hands on her? Do you think TS is blameless there? Did he chose to be with his brothers over her, in her time of need? Did he miss out on being a good husband? Is there any financial problems between them? For them to be married and not have children till now is also questionable. Why is the wife on Facebook and MSN if their r/s is firm and that he is still the one she adored when she pledged herself to him? Does TS ever brood about his past r/s with his ex? Does TS takes his wife's efforts i.e. household chores, cleaning, cooking and what not, for granted? Criticise when things go bad and never a praise when she has done well. Does TS have some bad habits which time and again failed to change? Huh, you just make it sound so simple here and make things seemingly here and there - I wouldn't even dare to call this as objective and open minded.</p>
              <p>Remember, ppl don't like to air their dirty laundry and would certainly overlook their faults most of the time when the problem arise and hit them real hard on the face.</p>
              <p>As I have emphasized from the beginning, we are unaware what is actually happening within their marriage and only TS would be able to answer that himself. We can only offer some views and opinions and let him go on from there, what he chooses to do is really his. So, if he still treasure this marriage then he will need to work on it together with his wife. If not, then leave and break up.</p>

              <p>Those many questions of yours should be answered by TS himself. Too many questions left unanswered and we all cannot assume what is the answer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, different opinions from both of us. WE never know the real story if TS is hiding something and put the blame on the wife. Since TS himself doesnt reply to his own thread, i guess let him settle himself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If TS is really serious bout this, he would have always look in his own thread and explain everything clearly so we can offer some advices.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I dont think there's a need to discuss the history of their r/s. PLus, the wife admitted shes having affair with a guy. A divorce would be final decision. The real problem here is that both of TS and his wife lack of communication which leads to failure in r/s.</p>

              <p>On the contrary, IMO these are the questions we should have helped TS to ponder and us to consider as we give our views. Also, before we cast our judgement about his wife having more fun than him. One can't help to perceive her as the cheap and loose character a.k.a the tramp. So what if she has a husband? If he is half the time ignorant and not fufilling his part as a husband, then wouldn't that  equate as not having a husband at all. Wouldn't she feel as termed by you in your  previous post "lonely and need attention".</p>
              <p>Yes, I do agree that all of us have different views and opinions if we really want to help then it would be better if we could be more objective and not add fuel to fire. Remember we are all here to help, so do have a heart.</p>

              <p>TS.. I am not married but attached before several times.. and what I can say is that if a person can be seeing someone else or whatever kinda relationship your wife is having with this guy.. she has lost interest in your relationship.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Maybe you can forgive her.. maybe she wants to try again with you.. but if she is not keen to try at all.. and you have no kids so one less reason to stay together.. you should try to move on and divorce her. chang-tong-bu-ru-duan-tong... but its easier said than done lah..</p>

              <p>In life, we must not take these harsh times and challenges as "too late". I see life as a strife for excellence no matter how imperfect as I may be. Simply because I just love myself to the core to ill-afford to hurt people around me.</p>
