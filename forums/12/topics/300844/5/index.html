              <p>i think that when one decides to get married, he/she should already more or less have considered what responsibilities she/he will be expected of her/him. in this case, i feel that your wife is being irresponsible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>since she's having an affair with someone else, i think that it's time to let go. she didn't respect you enough even before the affair started. so i really don't think she's worth it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>however, if you feel that things have not hit a dead end yet, go consult a marriage counsellor before going for a divorce.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my two cents worth.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>if it is a no to all the above then i think u might want to consider ending this relationship then hanging onto it.</p>

              <p>Jo,</p>
              <p>Divorce is not about fault finding, it is about a marriage breaking down.  TS is helpless, (sorry), against his wife. I don't think TS should continue in a marriage like that. His wife has no regard (respect) towards him. Her blatan in your face, - a 'that's the way I am', and involvement with another man, - a 'so what', says it all.  It does not matter whose fault it is.</p>
              <p>Its would be the same for a wife, to consider divorce when the husband shows no respect to her.</p>

              <p><br>I think that is pretty obvious since TS has chosen to take it out on that guy rather than sorting it out with his wife.  But i think he is fighting a losing war since, like what mancha said, his wife has utter disdegard for him.  In any relationship, when there is lack of respect and this turns into disregard, it is a gone case.</p>

              <p>A wife is NOT a property.  A wife is a human, with own thinking and free will.  She has her own judgement and decision to work on the marriage or not, or stray or not to stray.   With free will, comes responsibility too.  Even is it is that guy who courted/'seduced' her, she had the choice to reject him.  But if one chooses to go along in an adultery, he/she should take up the responsibility of his/her action.  Stop shirking responsibility by pushing all the blame to third parties.  For all you know, many third parties in this world are victims too, cos alot of married people (man or woman) actually outrightly lie to others tat they are not married.</p>

As I have said before, we do not really know what is actually happening in their marriage and I do believe that the husband is at fault too and if he can say that he is not at fault then all I can say that he failed to see the speck in his eye when he is trying to remove a splinter from another's eye.

              <p>If you are telling me it is a difficult task to stray, i seriously urge you to argue no more but quickly check out the statistics of divorcing cases due to straying partners.  The world is full of temptations, my dear.</p>
              <p>I am not fault finding.  But i believe in taking up responsibilities of one's action.  If there is no problem in TS' marriage, could the 3rd party have 'penetrated' into it?  Therefore i urge TS to stop blaming others but  re-examine his marriage first.  What good would it do to TS' marriage to 'confront' the 3rd party? </p>

              <p>blu sky, I think you have misread. My lines are to TS and his partner and it is not 3rd party related and / or has anything to do with it.</p>
              <p>Also, I did persuade TS not to waste his efforts looking for the 3rd party. Are you missing out on me here?</p>

              <p>Why some1 ended up straying with another partner?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its becuz they simply let other partner to flirt with them and play around. Its not bout what problem that occurs in a r/s. Its all about how they think and solve any problem in r/s.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TS's wife to me are just not worth for TS to be with any longer. She did it once. and she will do it again. History will just repeat itself to some ppl</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> TS should just know its not the problem with the 3rd Party, its only her wife herself doin this stuff. Could any man flirt her if she is hard-hearted and loyal ? Cmon...</p>

              <p>This kind of situation should happen only once, not to be repeated, and certainly not repeatedly. Each occurance is a humiliation on the husband by the wife. No party to a marriage should be subjected to this. I see no end to this. The wife as already said so. TS can only drink. Divorce better. For both sides.</p>

              <p>I think it is still not late to make her realize how important
              she is to you if you still want this marriage to work. Since you
              have held out for so long, no point not trying another effort
              convincing your feelings you have for her.</p>
              <p>No point wasting your effort in confronting the other guy, when
              what you care is your wife. You should let her know that what the
              both of you here is sealed and concrete and that you would want to
              spend the rest of your life with her. Forget about the past
              mistakes that the both of you might have, but try and make her
              realize that she would be sorry if she wants to call it quits on
              you. Remember it is her that you want.</p>
              <p>I don't know how your feelings and situation is for her and the
              r/s. But if the both of you would still want to continue then you
              should step up and consult some professional counselling. Start off
              anew.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, let go if it for the better of the both of you.</p>
