She might still love him but just too obsess with her own individual life.

Make her stay away from her routine habit.. if this goes well, this will certainly reduce her addiction but of course it will take a long time bcuz its ADDICTION..<br><br>Thats wht i think... if TS really worried, it wont be a problem to hire some1 to follow her and see her action.. if she really betray u behind your back, i know u are certain of wat you should do.<br><br></div>

Ok, stupid statement but my point is, were the both of you ready psychologically and financially?<br><br>How did you meet her? In a pub? At work? The point is, what was the chemistry that got you two together? Sex? Novelty? What?<br><br>What were you doing whenever you were with her when she did allow you to follow along? Sitting in one corner drinking alone? Speaking in thai to her frens? What?<br><br>Is she a Thai Chinese or pure Thai? How do you two communicate? Body language only or broken English? Can you speak Thai?<br><br>Is she well-groomed and fashionable? How about you? If she is attractive with her clothes on, are you? If not, are you keeping up?<br><br>What are the common things that got you two together? Movies? Pubbing? Shopping? Eating? Or family planning? What do you see in her? Have you met her parents? Are you able to talk to them?<br><br>How did you proposed to her? She proposed to you? Why did you proposed to her?  What was your motivation then? To take care of her forever? To support her in what ever she does? Are you doing that now? What about her? Why would she marry you? Cos you were sweet? Cos you can take care of her? What?<br><br>Try to guess what she sees in her partying lifestyle. Why her friends? Cos they are fun? Are they single and available? Or married? Are they the same people she parties with every time? If they are single, are they fashionable? Financially free?<br><br>What do you two do for a living? Is she a housewife? What if you cut off the purse string? If you do not party with her, maybe you can offer to send/pick her up?<br><br>Communication takes 2 to work. What stops you at the 4th sentence? What did you two talk about 4 years ago when you were practically living together? How long were you two living together before marriage? How much do you know about her? How much she knows about you?<br><br>Should you hire a PI? Why? If your wife is unfaithful, do you need a PI to tell you that? If she is truly partying with her gal frens only, you think your marriage is not on the rocks?<br><br>Every thing here is like a jig-saw puzzle. Answers the questions and evaluate your marriage, yourself, your wife. We are outsiders and have no responsibilities for you and your wife. How stupid does it sound if a netizen asks you to divorce your wife and you bloody hell actually do it!!! You are her bf for gawd-knows-how-many-days and husband for 4 years. IF you cannot tell what went wrong, then I think I know the answer....<br><br>Think...smarter.<br></div>
