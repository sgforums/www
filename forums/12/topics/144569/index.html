            <div class='col-md body'>I've found that the reason why I broke up with my ex was due to a simple act of miscommunication. I've been doing some thinking and I think this was the main reason why we broke off.

            <div class='col-md body'>Before I start , I would like you all  to be in the mind of a 17 year old teen who knows nuts about being in a relationship...<br><br>It all started when for 2 weeks she did not contact me. Apparently she did not top up her hicard. She did not tell me anything about being "away" for quite sometime. So obviously I was freaking worried. I told myself to calm down which I evantually did for the first week , come the 2nd week of communicardo , paranoia somehow took control of me. I just could not contact her in anyway possible (Her parents would kill me if I called her house). So when I finally managed to contact her through by calling her home and asked her what happened , she said that she was bombarded by school projects and has no time to contact me , let alone even top up her hicard. Then she said she wanna break because she wanted to concentrate on her studies. I was hesitant at first but eventually gave in because I respected her decision....<br><br>2 weeks later , I got a sms from her. She asked whether we could talk on the phone and so we did. She started being hostile towards me for whatever reason she had. She's always picking on events which happened to me and make it into a big matter. For example , I hated my ex manager who screwed me upside down for not serving the prawn sauce at a wedding function ( I was working part time banquet at that time). I hated him to the core and as such , I often cursed and sweared at him in front of my friends. Such a matter like this , she would say I don't know how to face challenges and stuff..saying I'm inmature for saying profanities at my ex boss blar blar blar. I mean , it's my own personal problem , it has nothing to do with her. She just wanted to find fault with my own personal problems at that point in time. She also said that <strong>SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE WOULD NOT ABLE TO CONTACT ME FOR A FEW WEEKS AS SHE HAS LOTS OF PROJECTS TO DO</strong> but the thing here is that I swear I don't remember she telling me anything about her not being able to contact me because of her projects. Then she come and say I don't respect her decision concerning her studies because I told her before we were together that studies are important blar blar blar. But she did not tell me anything about she being super busy with her projects so much so that she could not contact me for a few weeks. So how was I suppose to know that she was bombarded by her school projects.<br><br>Throughout the entire conversation , she was finding faults with my own personal problems and shouting at me at the same time. I though maybe she freaking stress with her projects that she wants to vent her frustration at me. Now that I don't mind because I found out her true colours and went through some rough times before we ended up together. I did not go looking for another girl just because I found out that she can be hot tempered at times but just decided to love her for what she really is. I mean no one is perfect , everyone has flaws and I accepted her for what she really is. Seriously I don't mind she venting her frustrations on me instead of venting it on someone else which might get into trouble.<br><br>The thing here is , 3 months on and she's still the same , well according to her friend.<br><br>So is it possible given the necessary circumstances for us to be together again? I'm not asking for us to patch up immediately but rather start off a fresh as friends again before proceeding on to the next level....<br><br>I admit some of my acts may seem immature or stupid in a sense but then again , It's a learning process in life.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

You sound pretty mature for a 17-year-old.<br><br>Based on your side of the story, it does sound like your ex-girlfriend can be quite temperamental. Temperamental people are usually not easy to get along with, but she must have some pretty attractive qualities for which you are willing to put up with her flaws and accept her for what she is.<br><br>From your analysis, you do seem to have a good grasp of understanding her character and you may have shown a basic level of trust when she went somewhat incommunicado for more than a week. However, both your accounts did not really touch on how you actually broke up. It may be a touchy topic, but was it she or you who initiated the break-up? Or was there any explicit mention of "break-up" at all -- are you two just going through this "cold war" phase? Such details might help us (as well as yourself) understand the situation better.<br><br>One more thing: About yourself. It is understandable if you flared up as well when facing her outbursts leading to the break-up, but are you a temperamental person like her too? Did your dates often end up in unhappy fights before the break-up? Suppose you got back together again, do you think you could keep yourself in check this time, and not fight with her when she flares up again?<br><br>All in all, it is usually not difficult for ex-lovers to come together again, <span style="font-style: italic;">per se</span> -- all both parties needed to do was to recapture the emotions that brought them together in the first place. BUT the problem lies in answering:<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Why</span> they broke up,<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Why</span> they should come back together after splitting, and<br><span style="font-style: italic;">Why</span> history wouldn't repeat itself and they wouldn't split again.<br><br>I may be wrong, but for now I'd say it is finding these three answers that makes the whole process of patching up so difficult.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>seems like she really is just veting her frustrations in you. if you can tolerate that (probably for the rest of your life), then i'd say go ahead man. a girl will display her worst in front of a guy she trusts cos she knows wadever she does, she will not lose him... although i'm not clearly sure it is so in her case... but if it is, the breakup is a glitch. go by your instincts mate...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Even b4 I read what FeowFeow wrote, I was thinking: hmm...your gf probably realised that (a) she shd concentrate on her studies first, get her priorities right, and (b) maybe you seem to her as not mature in certain ways, ways which are important to her.<br><br>I think it's not good to call her at this stage when she's stressed from all the projects and stuff, maybe later, when both have time to cool down and think about it.

But she did flare up before we got together as well as during the aftermath of the breakup. When she flares up , seriously I don't flare at her back and if that ever happened , It only last for a while. Sadness seems to consume more of me instead of anger. I don't know why but everytime she flares up , I get deeply hurt and stuff like that. I can say that I have a "weak heart". She did mention about breaking up before , which happened about a week before the communicardo period. It was during this period that I suddenly sensed that she was slowly swaying away from me. Then I told her we're not spending enough time together and I make it a rule not to go out with her on weekdays cause she has her school work to worry about. After a while the feeling of wanting to break up faded away from her and she was regretted saying that to me.<br><br>Feowfeow -<br><br>Don't worry I did not find your reply harsh in anyway. In fact , I was hoping for the replies to be "balanced". As I've said in my last post , I've made some immature acts and I regretted it. I just told her I screwed up at work and chances are I'm gonna get sacked by my manager and true enough it really happen. She somehow saw my ranting on my blog that's why. Yes , I can assure you I don't just go around blaming her for everything , I do look at myself internally sometimes and examine my faults. I made some mistakes and I truely acknowledge them.<br><br>It's been 3 months since we last broke up let alone even get to see her. Her birthday is coming , so yeah I'm currently thinking of what to get for her. Get her back as a friend first , no hurries.<br><br>Basically the reason why I was attracted to her was because of her simple mindset towards live AT HER AGE. She dresses simply , leads a simple life etc. She does not wear makeup when I'm with her neither does she bring me go shopping with her for clothes. I would call her a plain jane.<br><br>In actual fact , I would prefer Plain Janes as compared to Sofisticated Susans. Although shopping for clothes and wearing makeup is nothing wrong but doing it everytime we meet , It can really turn me off. Maybe it's because I believe in natural beauty...lol<br><br>I'm not the kinda guy who goes for looks considering the fact she does not have the looks but the heart. To sum it all up , Plain Janes appeal to me which in my personal opinion , it's very hard to find in Singapore nowadays but then again maybe I'm wrong...<br><br>For all I know , say 2-3 years down the road , she becomes the direct opposite of a Plain Jane , then I've got nothing to say.....maybe I'll just learn to accept her for what she truely is if the time ever comes....</div>

Maybe both of you are not ready for a relationship yet -- relationships involve more than just mutual attraction.

In fact, such and other similar remarks have been known to cause bitter fights and even break-ups.<br><br>Bite your tongue whenever you think you're going to make that Freudian slip in front of her. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
