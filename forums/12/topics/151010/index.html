            <div class='col-md body'>I won't lie to you.... physically, you're weak. Like triton, I'm 1.70m/63kg... though I don't have any plans to bulk up.<br><br>Anyway, just remember that physical weakness is not a true measure of weakness, regardless of what people may tell you. I used to be 1.70m/53kg... and my dad always used to scold me and look down on me for being weak whenever I got bullied.<br><br>You are only weak when you choose to listen to people who tell you that physical weakness is something to be ashamed of. Physically, yes, you're weak, but I don't look down on you for that. Besides, you can always bulk up and go into strength training to be physically stronger.<br><br>God bless.... and good luck.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by t88:</div><div class="quote_body">its not that 25 is a limit i set upon myself. its when my arms starts to become really soft and wobbly. i have never done pushups in my life until i entered JC where the pe teachers make us do 30 at a go. In secondary school we never had to do pushups. When i first entered in Jan, i could barely do 10. Slowly, i pogressed but i have been stuck on 25. everytime i try to do the 26, my arms will just collaspe n make me fall onto the hot floor.</div></blockquote>well like u just said,u can only do 10 when u first started and progressed to 25.It is normal.Just like bodybuilders who will hit a plateau too and do not see much improvement at times,but pushing on and continuing with hard training will see the body react after some time to grow itself.<br><br>I am not sure how the army is now but in my time,during bmt it was one for all,and all for one,one person who cannot do what the trainer requested will result in the whole platoon kenna punished as well.So usually people will try not to sabo the whole platoon and try extra hard to go beyond what they will usually do if they are the do the exercise by themselves.Team spirit will push you harder than u think that u are capable of</div>
