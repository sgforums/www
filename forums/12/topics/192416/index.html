I really don't quite get parts of your post...<br><br>Anyway... From the impression of your post.. I think you really should at least maintain a certain level of communication with your project mates... It's not just about 'gum' or not comfortable... It's MINIMUM JOB REQUIREMENT... If you work in a GROUP, MINIMUM COMMUNICATIONS MUST be there... Are you a MALE? If you are and have already SERVED your NS, you should easily understand what I mean....<br><br>The part where ya skipped your afternoon lesson to do your FYP... Did you expect them to do the project at the same time while you're doing your FYP...? (This part I can't quite understand from your post...) From what I see, you might see yourself as doing a 'sacrifice' for the team... But they might not be thinking the same way? That they could be doing the project while you're not...?<br><br>Another thing... Never quite mind if they didn't call you or anything... From what I see, you've already got a communication problem going on with them... And such communication break down usually goes both ways... With that kinda communication going on, the MacDonald's thingy shouldn't have came as a surprise at all...?<br><br>You can go ahead and BLAME the whole team.. But my personal advice for you is not to make yourself a 'public enemy'... Otherwise it would just be so simple... May it be guy 'A', 'B', 'C' or 'D'.... Any of them who's not on good terms with you can easily get you into enough trouble....<br><br>Btw, what is the 'lesson' for..? For your project...? Would your replacement of your lesson with FYP caused a bad impression on them?</div>

Maybe that they like me label me as someone hard to work with ( for whatever reasons ). <span style="color: blue;">I still think i need to identitfy people who have the tendency to betray and people who do not have the right work ethics or integrity so that in the future i know who i can choose to work with right?... </span><br><br>i do not want to be the leader cos i know i do not have the time to commit to such a task. It's saddening me when the rest do not want to help to step up and foster bondings. Perhaps they do have their own reasons.<br><br>I just want to be myself. Anyway as i have said i do not know them when i was put into the group. Perhaps i need to do some small talks to foster bodnings which i tried but i didn't really like to talk for idle talk sake cos it is just not me. Maybe im not suit for the business world.<br><br>I think it's a matter of choice whether i want to stick to my own individuality or compromise in situation. In this case, i don't wise to compromise on people who i have to double msn, call and sms but in the end i still did for the overall situation sake. The above event which u don't get happen only in the first few days of the project.<br><br>It's their actions that make me label them but that does not mean i will stick to this label all the time. people do change over times.</div></blockquote>Just a few words of reminder for those in blue.... As much as you can choose and pick on people, people can do the same to you... Ultimately.. It's often those without 'bonding' with the others who is gonna lose out, unless you're their superior....?<br><br>And as told time and again... There's no 'perfect human' in this world... Chances are you'll just have to learn to work with all sorts of people rather than to get to choose who you wanna work with...<br><br>Good luck?</div>
