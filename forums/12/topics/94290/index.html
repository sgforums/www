And it is something which u are dam headache abt... Guess what.. I think if you choose A or B.. You are both wrong..<br><br>1) Although you are kept woman.. Do you think its good abt it? You can argue your way through that its good blah blah blah... But search ur heart deep down.. He is a married man... Why on earth do you wanna break people up IF he is happily married? He may or may not be rich.. That is beside the point.. You don't wish to be labelled a fcuker who tries to break up a happy family? Even IF he divorce his wife one day and come with you.. What will his family members and frens think? If you don wish to spare a thought for yourself.. Spare a thought for him and his frens.. Dunno abt you.. But i do believe in retributions...<br><br>2) Regarding B who is younger than you.. Do you think it is good for you to stay with him and leads to no where when you 2 are attached? In both your long statements.. it seems like you "are looking for some one who has the $$ to give you the pleasure that you want...<br><br>Conclusion...

            <div class='col-md body'>What would you do if you find yourself to be losing passion in everything you do? You don't really care about work or studies. You have no dreams, no strong desires or any ambition of any kind. You can't confide in your family members and you have no close friends. And you realize that you don't really care about any 1 in the depth of your heart. Sometime you wish you can just drop everything and just live on a mountaintop by yourself. The world could end and its just something that happens, so what if we all perish!<br><br>Yet strangly you are not sucidal nor really depressed just kind of not seeing any points in life. You can be friendly to strangers yet you don't regards people around you as friends, just people who are around until another group replace them. You are accused of not being sincere to friends but what is being sincere like? You can be helpful, nice and friendly becos its the right thing to do not cos you feel anything? These are just some radom thoughts and feelings I have sometimes, is it normal for a person to think of all these?</div>
