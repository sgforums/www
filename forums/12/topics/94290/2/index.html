A knows i tok to B.... A is B's fren, colleague and boss.... A warned me abt toking abt him to B.. cos he dun wan B to know dat much... cos A is B's boss anyway.. so its not wise to let his staff to know dat his boss is having an affair right?..so ok i cant tell B.. cos am warned against it.<br><br>2. I decide to keep the truth from B too.. cos it would hurt him to know dat the so call bf i have is his fren, colleague and boss... he would feel shit dat his boss got the woman he love and oso gets to order him ard for work...and he cant do anything<br><br>3. am only trying to protect B.... meant to tell him abt it slowly.. and i think he stalked his own boss...... and find out dat my so call bf is his boss...and i have told him earlier not to probe anymore when he had a hunch dat my so call bf is his boss...<br><br>yes i have lied.. but it was not w the intention to hurt.. it was w the intention from not letting him to hurt even further...and i have apologise and admitted my wrong..<br><br>u know life is such a big joke.. dat i have to go thru and thru again and again till am damn tired.... when my marriage failed.... i was hoping for my ex to come back and praying for him to be back again every waking day of mine.. till one day i decide to seal up all my feelings and accept dat.. yeah i wont find love anymore... and i take whatever dat comes along.. like affair.. i dun go ONS...A was my first affair after my divorce... although i know he not gg to give me a future.. but hey.. heck care.. as long theres someone caring... why care abt future.. when future hurts too.. so i take it as it goes and enjoy every moment of it... now .. am not really the vixen here... A kept me in dark abt his marital status.. till i have to learn it from frens... so i just carry on acting dumb and be happy....<br><br>Then comes B... told him the above stuff... he persuade me to leave.. and i told him reasons as abovementioned... den suddenly he says he care when i told him to mind his own biz... told B.. i cant trust anymore.. well. he prove to me everyday dat he is worth trusting... till one day.. i decide to open up to him.. and come out from my shell... opening up is not easy cos the memories of the past keep flooding back....i have tried my best too.... i nvr want to or try to lead anyone ard.. and now.. the coldness of this cold war is freezing me up... *shiverssss.... kinda like slowly getting frost bite and dying off<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Duffy:<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Actually I din wanted to reply at all as this topic belongs to IcyBoi.<br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Your first marriage affects you tremendously and you know it. Like all other problems, I see issues during your BGR relationship with your ex-husband right into the day when you were proclaim man and woman during your first marriage. There are bound to be things that wasn't made right and your attitude towards love changed drastically with the fall of your once love.<br><br>A came when you needed to fill some form of void within your cracked emotional structure. He cannot commit and you as well - for a mutual benefit, you two came together. <strong>Remember, its for benefit and not for love</strong>. I understand the thingy behind the pampering, yet you are not looking at his hefty cash. <strong>Woman in their first love loved their lover, in all others, they loved love.</strong> (Pai seh, forced to use this again <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> ) You enter the contract with the stated clauses, there is no way you could turn the table and alter it. Ironically, when you are tired of a relationship without commitment, you actually exercise subconscious reaction of a gf to a bf's flippant behavior.<br><br>Your turning point came when B arrived into your life. Your drained relationship eventually crave for some form of substantial stability, in which B showed the following qualities. You fell for him, not for the similiar reasons why you came together with A.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>You showed terribly strong sign of delusion, probably the result of your failed marriage.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Duffy:</div><div class="quote_body">A was my first affair after my divorce... although i know he not gg to give me a future.. but hey.. heck care.. as long theres someone caring... why care abt future.. when future hurts too.. so i take it as it goes and enjoy every moment of it... now .. am not really the vixen here... A kept me in dark abt his marital status.. till i have to learn it from frens... so i just carry on acting dumb and be happy....   </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> And this sign is demonstrated into the bonds between you and B. Remember Enron and how it got busted? Deception in relationship, regardless of how good intention you have, never fail the shatter and weaken bonds between one another. A man in love is able to accept you for who you are, but <strong>rarely</strong>, he is able to accept conscious lies.<br><br>You wanna trust, yet you are working opposite of it. You want commitment, but on the other hand, you can't give. If you were to let your first marriage bring you down and let looming depression and negativity ruin you - <strong>no man would be suitable for the issue doesn't lies with them, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it lies with WHOM you chose to value-add into your love life.</span></strong> Think about it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
