Its made worse by your lack of sleep.  And you have too much free time.<br><br>Give yourself a day. Go for a good haircut, facial or massage. drink lots of water and cut down your meals to something lighter.  Cut fruits &amp; yogurt is a good choice or a soupy chicken soup.<br><br>practise deep breathing, meditation before you sleep.  play some light spiritual music of your religion before you sleep.  keep mind empty.<br><br>Sleep.<br><br>Once you are better. Bring your mother out to a good breakfast and some shopping for her to anything she chooses.<br><br>Chat with her about the old days and possibly ask about where your Nanny is buried.  maybe bring her there and get a bunch of flowers there.<br><br>Letting means facing your guilt and learning to compensate.</div>
