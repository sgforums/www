Since you have been together for so long, surely you'd at least talk about it right?  If marriage has never crossed your mind after 4 years, it just means that there's something about this relationship that you're not sure about.<br><br>That could be one of the reasons why your gf wants to break up.... may be she simply feels that there's no future for the relationship.<br><br>How was your relationship with your gf for the past 4 years?

If a guy doesn't like you anymore, will you still like him ? Remember the guy is bent on leaving you.<br><br>doko</div></blockquote>Doko,<br><br>Men and women approach relationship differently.<br>You need to understand and accept the differences in the way we handle relationships.<br><br>It is perhaps true, men can be more ruthless, more heartless, very determined when it comes to breaking up.<br><br>But woman are not. Because we are not men.<br>Unless, she caught them cheating, caught them doing stuffs which are detrimental to trust.<br>Unless TS did some really sheettyy things to her. Like neglect, abuse, repeated lies.<br>Then yes, her heart will be hardened.<br><br>But attitude could means TS just likes to go logger head with her.<br>He could be too stubborn.<br>He could be too invasive into her privacy.<br>These, unless she complained several times and yet he refused to change.<br>Then perhaps she might call for a break.<br>However, as long as TS agrees to change.. it can be salvaged.<br><br></div>
