Whether u like it or not... it is his and her. It is never his only and it is never her only. And his or her problem is usually something that cannot be changed by oneself and that is what we call fate.<br><br>1st thing u need to understand -<br>A boy love girl relationship cannot be formularised into a simple equation that works for all. For example : Faithful + loving = long relationship.<br>This equation will change as time, age, society change. But generally, the equation will be less complex as her age increases.<br><br>The thoughts of a schooling girl and thoughts of a working girl is obviously different. If u love her, u just need to let her go and let her find a better one that she wants to find. Saying: "Bu(4) zai(4) hu(1) tian(1) chang(2) di(4) jiu(3), Zhi(1) zai(4) hu(1) cheng(2) jin(1) yong(2) you(2)" Nothing is forever that is why memories or what u have last time is a treasure.<br><br>"If a man can let go any love, he is not even worth for the love at the first place. "<br>Starting it is like a chain attached between boy and girl.<br>When the girl happy, the boy will be happy<br>When the boy sad, the girl will be sad<br>As years passed, the chain grow longer and longer<br>But once any party break the chain, the other party have to withstand the burden of the rest of the chain. And the weight of the chain depends on the lenght of years.<br>No1 is asking u to cut off the rest of the chain. If u want, u can always take on the burden of this chain. And in time, u will get used to it and be stronger.<br>And that is what we called "experience"<br><br>And lastly, I m sorry for u...</div>

She came from KL to singapore to work just because of me. <span style="color: red;">she don't have any friends or relatives here and i feels so touched by what she did for me. I believe she is not happy living in singapore and somehow, she begin to detest me... and now she having a good future working in a good company. She started to complain that we cannot get along. I don't know why.. it is so strange. It like started out of sudden (i really dun understand gals).. </span><br>Yesterday we had argument, she wanted to leave me once and all.. it really hurts me..<br><br>I am a faithful man to her. when i used to be in NS. i often take leave to go KL just to look for her, hide a love letter in her room when i going back to SG.<br><br>I bought rose bouquet at her school and wait for her school to end at KL..<br><br>i even rush to KL just to fix her computer for one day because she need to submit her FYP.<br><br>I just love her too much that infact, i went deep to her privacy.. now all she want to be friend with me.. i can't accept the fact that how come after 4years, she now then telling me she can't stand my attitude.. what is this? shouldn't relationship should give and take? </div></blockquote>From what u written here,sounds like all of a sudden she found a good company and start to know more of people and becoming smarter. She might have know some colleagues who are very nice guy and become interested in her. Cos the changes sound very sudden,right? Seriously ,her love for u might be moved or weaken by the new discoveries. And plus the double blow of yr intrusion into her privacy make her make up her mind abt breaking up this r/s!<br><br>As what many say,respect a woman. Trust her and let her handle her own things. U learn a valuable lesson abt showing respect for yr other half.<br>U also need to learn another lesson abt able let go if needed to but at the same time,to have a life of yr own. Yr life shall not completely revolved around her. It is good to let yr parnter to become part of yr life but not completely.<br><br>Learn from lesson and tell yrself if u have give yr best shot for this r/s. Even it ended on bad note. U will have no regret and still able to walk with yr head high! Let the next gal have the fortunate to share the remaining happiness with u.<br><br></div>
