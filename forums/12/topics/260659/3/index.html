All were quiet and assuming.<br><br>And when the signs are certain, it's all too late.<br><br>You have to understand that everything happens for a reason - surely a relationship would also cease to exist if there are 'conditions' suffice for 'death' to occur. Though we can't reverse time to undo our errors, but at the 'point of death', you can perform an 'autopsy' on your relationship in order to determine the underlying cause/s.<br><br>Seriously, when relationships only have the length of relationship to boast, sometimes, that may be the only thing positive about the relationships. Like a scavenging ghoul, yes it does 'appear alive', but inside, it's pretty much inane and unwholesome, fueled by the crackling of some unholy energy that does not belong to the natural essence of life.<br><br>If love was life itself, then human is the perfect embodiment of what a good relationship would be. To remove the love in the relationship is akin to removing life from a human - nothing but a walking dead.<br><br>You are too accustomed in your comfort zone. Sure, you have to compromise in any relationships, but when that becomes a convenient excuse not to strive for self evolution towards enlightenment and the better of oneself, it's truly only an excuse. A lazy one in fact.<br><br>You mentioned that it's because you care that's why you conducted checks on her?<br><br>Or is it because you are insecure that's why checks are needed? <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Or should I say you probably only initiate things that subconsciously seek to appease or benefit your emotional state?      </strong></span><br><br>You ended your statement by claiming that guys are technically more faithful than woman. Actually, you are implying that what you did is right and needs no amendments, surreptitiously shifting blames to women as a whole.<br><br>Perhaps when you decide to practice humility and humbly learn what Love wants of you, you will one day understand why your woman left. Remember, everything happens for a reason - this is of no exception.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
