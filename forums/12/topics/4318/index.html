            <div class='col-md body'>I've met a guy recently, he is a colleage(going no to be anymore), well, there's a lot of things that he has said has made me so...confuse.<br><br>We were actually jus strangers, until abt 2 months back, becoz he jus join the company not so long along. We get to know each other better because of my attachment student, he was telling me that he thinks that my student is very sweet, very cute, so when ever he saw me, he jus ask me abt her. And our friendship started from there.....<br><br>He was the only colleage that I have in the company who met me up in the middle of the nite jus for a drink or a talk, kinda of funny ..i dunno why. There was once when we were having a drink, I ask him if he is really interestedin my attachment student, and he giva me a straight NO, coz she is too naive for him (she is 20 and he is 28, and I'm 22) So I ask him what kind of ger appeals to him, and he told me that she must be a chinese(i forgot to mention that he is an Indian Muslim), must look sweet to him, but not neccessary to be pretty, must have long hair, and most preferably a cantonese....now, this makes me suspicious, because, I fit in all the bill, except I dunno whether I look sweet to him or not... And whenever we talk, we always seems to be flirting. I'm very confused, because when we were in the company, we would pretend that we dunno each other very well, coz we, or rather me was afraid that the tongue would get wagging if we get too close.<br><br>And now, I start to get irritated whenever he ask me abt the student, which is very often, because I do't really like the student very much too, but he jus doesn't seems to get the clue, even when i answer him "What bisness issit of mine?? Dunnno how to go and ask her urself ar, dun ask me abt her okay?!"....geeze....I'm so fierce!<br><br>Last nite, we have actually arrange to go for a midnite show, and in the last min, he call off becoz of some reasons which i'm not going to say here. When he call me, I was with my other friends, and one of them, a he, was trying to repair his bike, so he made a lot of noise in the background. Then he ask me, where was I, what was i doing, and when I say :"My friend, he is repairing his bike", he's voice immediately changed! "Oh, a guy har..." it was like, did i hear a note of jealousy?? I know not. so I clarify with him that there were other ppl around too...and immediately he relax. Then..in a voice I have never heard from him, very gentle, he told me that he was sorry that he could not make it and ask for the appointment to be shifted to wed, and he tell me to save that show for him, dun watch with other people...<br><br>Arrgghh....Can u guys tell me, jus what is going on in his mind?? Guys, u guys know what GUYS think rite?? Tell me....<br><br>------------------<br><br>LOVE?

But the misunderstanding lies in, he forgot that u were beside him at that pt of time. Just slip of the mind. And u know that guys always like to flirt ard wif pretty girls.. On the other hand, for a girl, I'm sure u expect to be the centre of attention from any guy that ask u out rite?? This is natural too.. In this case, both of u juz dun see eye to eye at that moment of time. Everything is due to the nature of the 2 different gender. Can't really blame him.. Neither can he be angry wif u for walking out on him...<br><br>think try explaining to him... and he will understand ur reaction that day.. and he will forget abt the matter..

Imagine, when I called him on his hp to have his wife answer the phone?? My degree of shockness level?!? Thanks god then I'm clear minded enough to stay calm and state my position...lucky I have got my $$ back...and he is a real whim..throughout the whole issue of his wife trying the transfer the money back to my account, he dare not come to the phone and speak to me even when I insist to talk to me....nvm then I'll be glad not to even hear his voice again....mind him not to ever call me again, if not, i'll scold him UPSIDE DOWN!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>------------------<br><br>LOVE?

If he doesn't leave you alone and still tries to insinuate himself on to you, go to your boss and accuse him of sexual harassment. That should get rid of that piece of turd!!</div>
