            <div class='col-md body'>I have something to ask you guys...<br>I have this penpal and she's from HongKong, we've been writing to each to other for the past 4 years. Frequency I would say 1 month once. My gf knew of this, and for the past few years, I let her see my letter because I have nothing to hide. Recently, my gf been giving me headache, saying, why must I write letter only to her, why cannot write to her. I told her saying that, "because we can meet each other, and even if we don't, I call up to talk about everything"<br>Yea, everything, till she don't realise that it becomes a norm to her, and that she complained I wrote stuffs that she even don't know. What is this..I let her see the letter, nothing much one could write in a letter right? How bout the times we been together going out, she said other than the normal things we talk about, there's nothing special to say? Yea, maybe we are together for 5yrs plus, it's a NORM to her.<br>Is it due to the fact I'm going to meet my penpal soon (with my family for a tour at the same time)and that my gf can't go. I didn't say she cannot go, it she who keep on thinking I don't want to let go. What is all this nonsense....driving me mad. I don't feel appreciated at, all the things I accomodate to her, giving in to her. Help her this help her that, she got problem, I'm there, but in the end what I do I get, problems from her.

Man are still man. Jealousy hits by first degree situations, not anywhere further.<br><br>If I found twenty dollars on the floor, I would have pick it up without hestitation and place it in my wallet, without thinking if the person who lose it, will need it for emergency because it seemed not too big of a sum.<br><br>Like you, who doesn't feel that it's too much of a problem to be transparent. It's good to remain open with each other, but I don't see a need to show her on my initiated accord unless she wants to go through them. You keep triggering this first degree situations, which served as grounds for her mental and emotional poison to seep through and produce jealousy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>All you need is one time show and that's it. The rest leave it to trust. If she want to re-check again, can, but it goes to show how much trust she has in you and this relationship, therefore unless your relationship is already shaky - usually, this wouldn't happen if she has basic respect for space and freedom.<br><br>Cheers</div>

WHO IS A PENPAL?<br>Why is it that you have to write love letters to your girlfriend? This is not.. the 18th century. You can take a bus/cab/walk and meet her face to face. Or even better email.<br><br>I think she is being unreasonable. Like a lot of the girlfriends of friends here that i know.. They don't like it that their boyfriends play on the xbox. What harm is there if it is something that he enjoys? Even if my boyfriends said he is going to the strip joint with the boys, i'd be like ok.. do you want to be picked up? Because he drops me off when i want to go out with my friends without him. Being possessive doesn't equate to love. It equate to jealousy.</div>

From the way I see it, she's either pretty young or she's behaving rather childishly... You should give her a little guidance...

So wat if she's a girl?  It doesn't mean I love her, I love u, &amp; if I din love u, I wldn't haf shown u the letters I'd written in order to reassure u &amp; let u trust me.<br><br>2.  I've done other thgs to the best of my abilities to assure u of my love.  Wat r u jealous abt?<br><br>3.  It's Not my fault tt u can't join me on the trip, I'm Not going there specifically to see her.  I juz happen to be going on a tour to HK, &amp; since I'm there, there's Nothg wrong wif catching up wif a fren.<br><br>Her perspective:<br><br>1.  I noe she's only a fren &amp; ur penpal, but I can't help feeling jealous cosh I'm a woman, &amp; No woman likes to share her guy (meaning, romantically).<br><br>2.  I noe I meet u ev. day, but tt doesn't mean I dowan to hear tt u love only me once in a while.  And altho I noe I meet u ev. day &amp; tt u love me, it doesn't hurt for u to pamper me once in a while by writing somethg to me, even if it's juz a card.<br><br>3.  I keep thinking tt u wanna go on the trip cosh u wanna see her, despite u going wif ur folkz, cosh I'm woman, &amp; I can't help feeling jealous.<br><br>Having finished tt, here's wat u can do:<br><br>Meet her for a heart-to-heart &amp; explain the different perspectives tt haf caused the misunderstanding.  Address her fears (remember:  She's only behaving so unreasonably cosh she loves u &amp; is terrified of losing u) &amp; reassure her of ur love.<br><br>Perhaps having been together for so long, both of u haf taken thgs for granted.  Tok this out, &amp; try to come up wif ways together for both of u to re-inject the spark tt has gone missing in ur r'ship.<br><br>Instead of juz meeting ev. day, why Not arrange to go on a special date?  It doesn't hafta be a special occasion, juz go on a date simply because : )  Whether it's a candlelit dinner (@ a restaurant or prepared by both of u wld be great) complete wif a nice card, or a nite @ the movies followed by supper &amp; discussion of the farnie thgs in the movie, it all depends on u.  Shower her wif more love &amp; attn, cosh it seems tt she wld lurve to be pampered by u : )<br><br>The r'ship has been going on for 5 yrs, does it mean enuff to u to wan to make it work?  If so, do try to tok thgs out wif ur girl nicely &amp; calmly.  U'll be surprised @ how happee she might be after : )<br><br>Gd luck!<br><br>RP<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sonic_seed:</div><div class="quote_body">I have something to ask you guys...<br>I have this penpal and she's from HongKong, we've been writing to each to other for the past 4 years. Frequency I would say 1 month once. My gf knew of this, and for the past few years, I let her see my letter because I have nothing to hide. Recently, my gf been giving me headache, saying, why must I write letter only to her, why cannot write to her. I told her saying that, "because we can meet each other, and even if we don't, I call up to talk about everything"<br>Yea, everything, till she don't realise that it becomes a norm to her, and that she complained I wrote stuffs that she even don't know. What is this..I let her see the letter, nothing much one could write in a letter right? How bout the times we been together going out, she said other than the normal things we talk about, there's nothing special to say? Yea, maybe we are together for 5yrs plus, it's a NORM to her.<br>Is it due to the fact I'm going to meet my penpal soon (with my family for a tour at the same time)and that my gf can't go. I didn't say she cannot go, it she who keep on thinking I don't want to let go. What is all this nonsense....driving me mad. I don't feel appreciated at, all the things I accomodate to her, giving in to her. Help her this help her that, she got problem, I'm there, but in the end what I do I get, problems from her. Guys and gals, please give me some advice...I feel sad now...<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
