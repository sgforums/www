              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;    ">I had tried using my debit card to pay for the bill at around 2 to 3 am on 23rd of February and the card was experiencing problem. I had asked the merchant to try utilizing the card again but nevertheless, the card had failed me again. I was very upset in regards to the situation and embarrassments that I experienced when it was my birthday and my debit card failed me. Imagine the embarrassments that you would feel if your debit card failed you in settling the bill which you know you have sufficient amount in the bank to pay for it. I called in to demand for an explanation for the failure of the card after the bill was settled by other means.</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 12pt; "></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman','serif'; font-size: 12pt; "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;    ">I admit I was very rude and agitated during the call but what I got from the other end of call was craps and silence. The reason that the duty supervisor or manager was that the system was under maintenance during this timing and that the merchant was instructed to call the bank if such error had occurred. Apparently, there were no procedures that were passed down to the merchant that I was at the time of the incident or perhaps, all merchant had not been equipped with such knowledge. Disappointed by the reasons, I request a better answer from someone of higher authority.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;    "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;    ">I was contacted by DBS/POSB call center again but they gave me the same reasons with no assurance that such incidents would not happened again. In fact, they should be glad that they did not promise that.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;    "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;    ">Yesterday, 6<sup>th</sup> of March, the same incident happened to me. I called in again and asked why is there no backup system in place to actually prevent such incidents to happen especially it had happened before and to me as well. I was told that all cards were rendered useless in the time frame and I am not the only one. I am utterly speechless for the 2 times bad experiences within a period of less than 14 days and no satisfying answers or actions were taken.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;    "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;    ">Come this Monday, I would be going down to the bank to terminate the cards I had and change back to my old nets card. I do find that it is pointless in having the cards when the bank simply do not care about the consumer and let them strangled in such situation while not offering help at all. Imagine if you were overseas and that is your only mode of payment left when it happened.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;    "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;    ">I do not see the reason why I should be paying this type of customer service and experiences. Diners, Citibank, UOB had not failed me before. Why should a bank that is established in my country be the one who give me such embarrassing experience and crappy reasons?</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;    "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;    ">My only advice to the existing card holders, please use your card during this time frame (2 to 3am) if you expect to be humiliated by the bank. There will be no backup system going to be in place despite numerous feedbacks to ensure that card utilisation would not be affected by the maintenance that is going on daily during the time frame.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;    "> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;    ">Maybe it is just POSB card. I never did have any problem when I was using a DBS debit card in the past. This reminds of an incident a few years back when my friend’s POSB debit card was declined while my DBS debit card went through. Perhaps that was a double standard all along in this establishment.</span></p>
