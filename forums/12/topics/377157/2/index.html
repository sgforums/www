              <p>Love does not come easy or without obstacles.</p>
              <p>How many relationships will you want to fail when each time you run away from obstacles?</p>
              <p>Ultimately, it is your life, and you will have to consider if you truly love the girl. If you do, then any obstacles you face is worth goining thru, and when you succeed, so much the feelings and experience you gain, and the more you will treasure your love and be treasured.</p>
              <p>1.Parents love their kids, this is an undeniable fact, and will do anything to protect them. Rather than to comment on the 'wall' you face, criticise and judge them on their 'rules', firstly, find out the roots of such 'rules'.</p>
              <p>Just like your own country, there will be the dissatisfied, who would rather criticise than to offer solutions. Some worse, will talk with a sweet mask with sweet lips and honeyed words to change others peception about one's country, without offering credible solutions</p>
              <p>Rules are only guidelines, and not cast in stone. If you can present a better solution, I am sure her parents will listen to you and let you try out any change if necessary, but first you must prove yourself worthy of their trust.</p>
              <p>There must be a reason for the 2 years wait. If you can find out the root reason why, and with intelligence, patience and worthy actions, you will be able to convince that it is not necessary.</p>
              <p>But if their arguements are solid, then what is 2 years to see the sincerity in you if you truly love? After all, love is eternal.</p>
              <p>2. Romance and love should go together. It is about building strong relationships and ties, whereby both families can be joined in your union. There is no need to separate families.</p>
              <p>I do find her parents strange, but again, no 2 persons think alike. You will need to discover the roots of such behaviour. Is it because of race, religion and language, etc? The older generation do not think like us, for they had not been taught the bonds we this generation are taught and built with.</p>
              <p>If there are any discriminations or ignorances, then it is your duty to correct it with patience and time. It will not happen overnight, but over time, by your sincerity and integrity.</p>
              <p>Do simple acts, - such as giving gifts to her family side, such as cakes, sweets, etc. Arrange both sides of parents and relatives to join in safe activities, such as national health runs or jogs, so that they may met and get to know one another better.</p>
              <p>Face to fac efforts often can help bridge  differences, and you will be the best bridge. Communications is the most important factor in any relationship. As you are an educated man, it isnt all about money, but what you do with your education that gets you respected as a man.</p>
              <p>Be not a quitter, or a liar, or a con person with a hidden agenda. Rather, use that knowledge aquired to make the world a better place, beginning with your very own family that you will be building up soon.</p>
              <p>As long as you tried, and really did your best, others will understand and respect you. But to walk away, I say again - how many obstacles will you run away from, or pour sour grapes over them?</p>
              <p>Good luck. I sincerly wish you all the best and may you succeed in your efforts. It's your life, a precious and worthy one, not because you are educated, but because you have found your love and can love in return, capable of doing what it take to protect that love.</p>

              <p>I have to disagree with this. No matter what TS's gf mother shouldn't restrict her daughter from visiting TS family and expect TS to always go to his gf's house for dinner every week.</p>
              <p>To top it off, his gf's mother don't even allow his gf to celebrate TS's parent birthday. What the F is this? TS (or his parent) doesn't deserve this.</p>
              <p>Definitely not all mothers are like that which is unreasonable. I don't see this as mother doting her child but mother trying to control her child's partner.</p>

              <p>unless u can change her mum..... isnt it more of u accepting the mum demand or request, no matter how unreasonable they may seem?</p>
              <p>so why dun spent more time and effort getting into the good book of the mum and make thing better rather then wasting time thinking how unfair or unreasonable the mum is? who knows, thing might turn for the better once ts get along well with mum?</p>

              <p>TS's parents is TS's parent, they are not the gf's parent ( not even parent in-law yet). So why must the gf be obligated to behave like a wife already ?</p>
              <p>If they already officially engaged or married , then it is ofcors unreasonable for TS's mom to behave so.</p>
              <p>Her mom is alredy very kind to let TS spend time with her family during family dinners. If he don't want to go , nobody is forcing him.</p>

              <p>now she is just following what mommy says. this kinda potential mother in law...nv support you nvm, but if married le, most likely will divorce cause of her sowing discord.</p>

              <p>Your gal friend's mum is entitled to say or think what she wants to. In fact, she is projecting her idea of what is 'good/ bad' and it is her predicament. She is <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">in</span></strong>secure lar, hence the projection.</p>
              <p>By paying attention or feeling anxious as to what she thinks of u - u have already forgone your rite to exist as u are. U have made her predicament yours! She is pushing your buttons!</p>
              <p>U may get a job that pays handsome $$$ - however, there is no guarantee. Same goes with house, car n even ur gal friend. All these are merely props - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">quantative</span>.  Anxiety is going to be the mainstay of your daily thoughts cos it is dependency on something(s) that can be lost. There are no guarantees.</p>
              <p>However, what u invest <span style="text-decoration: underline;">INside</span> of u - is something that will never be lost - it is an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">immeasurable quality</span></p>
              <p>Today it could be job, what next?</p>
              <p>In my opinion, what is transpiring bet u and your gal friend is 'trading' which is far from love. Only the word love or erroneously interpreted as love. </p>
              <p>Of course, if $$$, job,security ... add on, is what is of utmost importance to u and the other - so be it. Just<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> being honest</span> and most all looking at it (things) as it(they) REALLY makes a big difference.</p>
              <p>ps - one who is secure within - may have the money, house, care ... but the difference is that in the eventually of sth going 'bad/wrong' one has the strength WITHIN n would not collapse. In fact, one has the ability to respond to all kinds of .... and yet come away a 'winner'</p>

              <p>the thing is , does her parents know your family background. and how long have u been together?  but personally i think is the case of she look u no up, think that her girl be with you is a waste. so prove otherwise, and probably she will loosen up. but in the case where the mom is impossible... then good luck</p>
