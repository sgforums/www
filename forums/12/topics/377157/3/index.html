              <p>hey guys, thanks for all the replies..</p>
              <p>for those of you who think that getting a job is a problem for me, i guess i should just explain my situation..</p>
              <p>i'm a degree holder with Hons and just returned from the US. i could have simply work in my father's office and get a salary that i believe, is more than what some may earn in 3 months... but i want to start on my own, rather then depending on my father.</p>
              <p>I am not ranting, grumbling, about my gf mother. I am just asking for opinions and advices and whether anyone is going through the same problem as me.. and if they are, maybe they could give me some advice. please read my post carefully, before flamming me.</p>
              <p>anyway, there are really some very useful and meaningful replies. i guess for now, I shall just hold on, endure it through... wait a little longer before i make a decision.</p>
              <p>thanks for all the replies....</p>
              <p>cheers~</p>

              <p>Dude, you have a family business which you could have
                      contributed and benefited from, yet you choose to bum around
                      "waiting" for the right opportunity.</p>
              <p>Just because the business belongs to your family doesn't mean
                      you should collect salary and shake legs.</p>
              <p>All the more you need to work hard for the family business that
                      had been the source of your financial support while you studied
                      overseas. When opportunity comes a knocking.. you can always branch
                      out and expand your capabilities.</p>

                      choices, make your character "questionable".</p>

              <p>Of cos China will catch up with the US due to its population size and foreign reserves. But it has not. For now and for at least another 15 years. Just because China will become a super power like the US in the distant future does not negate US's standing. Here's a clue for you.The US has been a super power since the late 1880s, but its power did not become so pronounced until it won the WWII and with that it surpassed the UK. <strong>Yet US's ascension did not stop Britain from remaining one of the world's super powers.</strong></p>
              <p>Second, the Chinese people are an extremely pragmatic and practical lot. They do not adopt an insular stance, unlike the French who staunchly refuse to speak the English language. Today as with the last 50 years, the Chinese diaspora have been furiously migrating. The mainland Chinese today also think nothing of learning the English language, because they think its the way.</p>
              <p>Finally, and this is the most pertinent point. You seem to see the growth of China as your (SG) own, and used it to earn points against the US and for SG. Do you think China = SG? Hahahah. Of cos not. The Chinese are among the most cunning of people, even more so than the Americans, and there's no way they see themselves inferior to Singaporeans or even see Singapore as their equal. In fact they know they are superior.</p>
              <p>So if you think you can ride on China's wave?...think again. We can, only as a benchwarmer. Using the power of another country to claim it's ours.. not logical<strong> at all. <br></strong></p>
              <p>Do you think just because China is powerful means its Singapore's
                                              credit that you'll bring it into this conversation? What a joke! What
                                              has X becoming as powerful as Y got to do with you? You are neither X
                                              nor Y!You wanna compare the kind of endowment we're talking
                                              about? Go and find out the endowment of US's top universities, before

              <p>You're right to bring China in this conversation as we discuss the degree mills of SG. In the short time since China opened its economy, its universities have surpassed the rest to be Asia's top universities. Beijing, Fudan, Jiaotong are among Asia's best, with China's CIEB business school named the top (at post grad level of cos) business school of Asia, following which are Hong Kong University then Indian University of Technology.</p>
              <p>In the short time in which they opened up their economy (since the 80s), China sent someone to the moon. What has Singapore achieved?</p>
              <p>SG universities enjoy boasting and running lame ass and laughable marketing and promotional exercises in newspapers, bus stops, on TV and on buses..no Nobel laurate, no Putlitzer prize winner, no Booker prize winner. Why is this so? Must be the degree mills that churn out rubbish year after year.. all 18,000 pieces of them. hahaha</p>
              <p>Its common knowledge lah. If the degree mills here were of any use, why would the Government send their top brains overseas? Duh.</p>

              <p>I have addressed your question above. You can take the time to read slowly. If you dun understand, read again. And again.<br><br>I have no interest in engaging the common universities of the west. <br><br>As I said earlier, but you fail to understand, the reason people ridicule degree mills is because they think they're one of the big boys. They have earned nothing and achieved nothing. So its truly funny for people in the know.<br><br>There can be no top university in Singapore. The concept of that is a logical impossibility. Because they are all state universities and there are only 3.<br><br>The reason why there are top universities in world powers, even France and Japan, is because they have MANY MANY universities. <br><br>In the US, there are Ivy Leagues, Chicago, MIT and Stanford - these are private colleges - because there are hundreds and thousands of universities that are NOT top, enabling the best to be top. How do you have something that is TOP, when you have only ONE (group) taking in EVERYONE in the population (as obliged)??!</p>
              <p>The Singapore universities are at best on par with the low tier state (public) universities in the US, paling in comparison to TOP state universities like Berkeley in UC, UT and Wisconsin Madison.  With the lower segment of rubbish in the SG universities eg NTU engineering, NUS arts, on par with the average Community College in the US.<br><br>Let's just say, even if Berkeley break wind, its smelly wind is superior and smarter than the valedictorian of the 3 degree mills hahaha.<br><br>Have you heard of Berkeley? Have you heard of the Manhattan Project that was led by a team of Berkeley scientists, with involvement of scientists from Chicago University and UIUC? Manhattan Project 'invented' the first Atomic Bomb in the world that won WW2 for the allies. Please.. go read up and find out what the world is like.. outside your TINY RED DOT;  and come back to claim that your degree mills are 'world class' or produce trash or gold.<br><br>US power is driven partially by the achievements in academia and research of its elite institutions, which resulted in the success of its pop culture exports. China may rise, you have not PROVEN that the US will wane. Are you a soothsayer now?? <br><br>Next, the social and economic might of a country is not the only variable to the success of its universities and vice versa. How do you convince us that even if US were to wane, which you cannot prove as anything beyond a wishful speculation on your part, it has any impact on the standing of its universities? Then why is Singapore so successful economically, but its universities so lousy then and which have achieved nothing?? <br><br>That's because we sent our top brains overseas, rightfully so. To the best. <br><br>The US federal debt is a very old and longstanding thing that's happened since the early 1980s. Get with the programme!! Where have you been? It's not new!! I thought NUS was bad. I didn't know it was that bad.<br><br>The US has always adopted this fiscal policy, BY INTENTION. And the lovely and ingenious thing is, it never needs to pay the debt because with what they borrowed (which is how they, or people generally, haha, incur a debt), they are generating the world's economy. That's the beauty of it!!!!</p>

              <p>i'm not so sure Sim's still a multi millionaire. Do read the news.</p>
              <p>For every one diploma holder who "didn't go to university" at all like
                                      Sim who became an entrepreneur with some measure of success, no doubt
                                      in this case, a has-been, there are billions more from the Europe, US
                                      and parts of Asia that went to elite schools.</p>
              <p>There are far more entrepreneurs who enrolled or graduated from elite colleges like Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates and Steve Jobs and Warren Buffett and Donald Trump, George Soros and Jim Rogers (who lives in SG now because of our lovely country) and even locally, the Lee Foundation's Lee Seng Gee who attended Penn even though he's now in his 80s and that was almost 60 years ago, when Asian students in the western elite colleges were few and far between. Today, tycoons here from the Khoos, Kwoks and Kwees to Banyan Tree's Ho Kwon Peng (despite being the 'chancellor' of SMU, LOL!) send their children overseas ONLY.</p>
              <p>Top colleges do not only produce investment bankers and government scholars, heirs and heiresses or Prince William. Please don't depend on hearsay from the water cooler under your rock as your primary source of knowledge. Wah.. ivy league. Investment bank. scholar. Can ONLY be investment banker. govt scholar. YES.  All cats are black.</p>
