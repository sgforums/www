              <p>I doubt the relationship will last long and based on the point I highlighted, I also doubt your gf knows what you are going through. This is my assumption - I think your gf currently think what her mother is doing is actually right/fair.</p>
              <p>Like what others say 'Like mother, Like daughter' think twice about this relationship. Do you think you can handle the pressure from her mother and your gf?</p>

              <p>hi guys... thanks for all your replies. Appreciate all the feedback you guys posted... thanks !!! XIE XIE!!</p>
              <p>acutally my gf does kinda noe what i am going through. i explained to her many times.. she thought of writing a letter to my parents ,to explain her situation... but i told her, why bother? how my parents will feel?</p>
              <p> she doesnt side with her mother all the time... but everytime her mother talk to her behind my back, she start to go crazy, and act funny....  sometimes, i really think that the reason why my relationship so bad with her, is because of her mother.</p>
              <p>for eg, looking for a job... now the job market not very good. initally, she will be super supportive, motivating me...giving me moral support.... but recently, her mother start to talk rubbish behind my back... ask her why i wasting time at home not getting job... why find job so hard... after brain-washing, she come and quarrel with me, say that i not finding the job hard enough. Seriously, pissing me off so much...</p>
              <p>But i know she can be very sweet, and be a nice gf... she doesnt cook, but she actually bought a cook book, and tried to cook for me many times. when i sick, she wants to travel to my void deck just to see me, but cant go up my house... if she isnt such a sweet gf, i wouldnt be having such a big headache...</p>
              <p>but i know one thing, her mother, seriously screw up...really no way can communicate with her...</p>
              <p>so bros, what do you think i should do???</p>

              <p>Just wondering guys, whether you guys have go steady with a gal
              whose mother is from hell...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>well, my current gf's mother is seriously from hell! lots of
              rules, lots of obligation, always talking bad behind my bad...</p>
              <p>1) i am not allowed to bring my gf home to my house to meet my
              parents. Reason she give is because her family is more
              "traditional" . can only meet my parents after her daughter go
              dating with me for more then 2 years. BUT, i must go their house
              every week to eat dinner so they can know me better.</p>
              <p>2) i live in the east, gf live in west. 2 months into the
              relationship, the mother warn me, if i ever marry her daughter, i
              must buy house in the west. she got one daughter and one son only,
              cant bear to leave the daughter. I am only son in my family, but I
              must leave the east, to live in the west... my parents cannot live
              with me in future, scared they bully her duaghter...</p>
              <p>3) currently unemployed because just graduated... Looking
              for job for 1month plus nia, in front of me keep smiling, behind my
              back keep bad mouthing me infront of gf. say why i everyday at home
              nothing to do.... why dont find work? work drop from sky? make me
              and gf quarrel non-stop everyday...</p>
              <p>4) must celebrate gf father and mother, brother, grandmother
              birthday. but my gf cannot even wish my parents happy birthday or
              even talk on the phone...</p>
              <p>so any bro's out there that is suffering as much as me? or worst
              then me? anyone in the same situation as me? any advice?</p>

              <p>Her mother treat you like this is because...You slacker , no income, no job, no nothing.</p>
              <p>If you are a successful man, her mother will be more than willing to let her precious dotter be with you.</p>
              <p>Her mother knows her dotter is a nice girl and deserve someone else who can really take care of her and provide for her.</p>
              <p>Giving her dotter to you is like putting a delicate flower on a piece of cow dung.</p>
              <p>All mothers behave the same if the guy not up to standard.</p>
              <p>So, don't blame her mother for the way she treats you. Because all mothers are like that one. OK ? Good.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I have to agree with Jojobeach on this...the main reason why the mother in law treat u this way is becoz simply put it....u are not financial independent......u dun even have a decent salary to begin with, u can't even afford urself....most likely asking ur own parents for money......which mum-in-law would want to give blessings to this relationship??? If you are successful in life....i am sure it would be the mum-in-law sucking up to u....this is a realistic world we live in.......Instead of whinning here.....u should just try to get a job.....be it a part time job as a waiter or watever...show her mum in law u are working ur way up......</p></div>

              <p>i would say seriously consider ending this one....the gf is sweet and nice cos' she's in the romance mode now....after marriage it's a whole new ball game....and with a constant nag by her side, it's hard to see how she'd not be influence...this is not just a protective mother, you got to see her as an over-bearing mother in law...</p>
              <p>...imagine she's already pinning you down to where you can live, what you can do and how you do this and that...bolt while you can...courtship usually does not mirror married life...the last thing you want is to be caught in between your family and the wife...i can forsee whenever your side plans for a gethering, the mil will object....so be prepared spending your reunion dinners, first cny visits with her family....you have seen the future, what more do you need?...best wishes..</p>
