You should be worrying if you don't feel a thing at all because it says alot of your definition of this current relationship. Since illness and alignment is a factor that is beyond our control, what we should be doing right now is remain stable, get your facts right first before jumping into silly conclusion and pray (if you have any religion).<br><br>P.S: Popping pills can't help her at all - do something more constructive. As least even if you freaking go to temple/church and pray is so much better? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
