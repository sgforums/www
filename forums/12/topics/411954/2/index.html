              <p>Generally, employers are not interested to employ job seekers who are without jobs for long.  Even if job seekers hold part-time, temp or contract jobs they are also not happy about it.     If the job seekers are holding permanent jobs, they will also keep probing why the job seekers want to leave the present employment. </p>
              <p>To sum it up, there are far too many bloody employers who love to indulge making things difficult for job seekers.  This is inclusive of the govt employers/HR personnel.</p>

              <p><br>Generally, the environment for job seekers is very harsh.  The employing parties be their private or govt are trying their best to make things very difficult.    I have a friend who studied the HR course did mention that some employers adopt the provoking method in interviewing.   </p>
              <p>But anyway, I suspect some do more than the provoking style.     EVen if genuine reasons and answers are given they still go on to continuously/unreasonably probe and annoy the interviewees especially local companies.</p>
              <p>To add on, the govt here are not protective over the people by not setting any or insufficient guidelines on discrimination.   </p>

              <p>This happen partially because our govt is too laxed on employment interview.   Little is done to protect the job seekers and employees.</p>
              <p>That company you went for interview really has bad image to have all these 3 people as their staff.  </p>
              <p>All sorts of things can happen during interview.  I had a bitch interviewed me and she ceased the opportunity using interview session to vent her frustrations that she had over her colleague.  Instead of interviewing me, she repeatedly poured out her problems and frustrations and expected me to side her when I don't even know what exactly was happening.    Can tell she herself is a problem and giving others problem.    Basically, she has very bad or no interpersonal relationship skills.  Anyway, she is not fit to be interviewing anyone.  </p>

              <p>This is the time to open your mind to the fullest, and keep your options open as wide as possible, to be receptive to new opportunities. If you've been trying for a long time, without success, on your current path, it could be a sign to you, that you may want to consider other more suitable paths for you.</p>
              <p>Choosing a similar path, simply to show non-handicapped people that you're equally capable, if not better, won't serve you well, in the long-term, as you'll just be controlled by your Self-Ego. You can realise your full potential and true capability, by taking other paths that are more fulfilling to you. Our society is too one-way-tracked. I'm sure you'll be able to find the path that you like best.</p>
              <p>A physical handicap may seem impossible to overcome by those who have no such experience. But being able to overcome the handicap could allow you to develop other strengths which non-handicapped people are unable to.</p>

              <p>by opening the singapore labour market to foreigners, the govt is giving businesses plenty of choices.  businesses being profit-driven, of course will choose the easy way out by employing cheaper foreign labour.  meantime, govt keeps persuading you that foreigners are NECESSARY and GOOD for you and me.</p>

              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Let me share with you my job interview experiences. Ive been interviewed by company like DHL,EPSON.GUARDIAN PHARMACY,SINGAPORE CHANGI HOSPITAL,OCBC,MANGO but non of them wanted me to be part of the company. Indeed, they are a well-known company.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>First of all I felt sad as they really looked down on me due to my handicapped looked which i encounter since young. I don't understand why that matters to them. Afterall they should looked upon talent and employ those who they believe can contribute to the company. Secondly, I don't know how's my future will be like. There is  once CDC told me to go to newton to take up front desk courses. When I came there i was interviewed, and she told me that my physical constraints is a major concern to her. She said it was impossible to get a job as a front desk as they want normal people. When she told me off like dat, i felt really sad. To me, as long as you can do that job, it doesnt matter whether u are a handicapped or a normal people. But for me, I judged myself as a normal people who lead a normal live and i went to a neighbourhood school. I dont understand why they don't want to employed people like me.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>I also get negative  feedback while interviewed @ DHL in Eunos area. She told me can u count? Can u see numbers? And so on and on . She asked me stupid questions and I felt really insulted. She should not ask me questions like that. It's really unprofessional and insulting.While interviewing me, she wears a shades. Is that some kind of a joke or what?</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Even i interviewed @ OCBC near Lau Pa Sat, they said that I have a very good communcation skills but then they rejected me due to my physical look. And for Guardian, they pranked me twice. They promised me that i had  an interview with them and didn't called me back. Few weeks later they called me and said a specifc date to come down to interview. E same thg happen to me. They promised but never kept promises.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>I feel like giving up my life until i saw this woman who is bald. She suffers from cancer but works as a receptionist cum admin asst in 1 of a company in payalebar. I wonder why a woman like her can get a job while i can't. Nothing is Impossible. Even if people looked down on me, there's  noway it's gonna stop me from finding job. Each day imm strong enough to face these obstacles. I have nothing to be ashamed off. That's really special about me that noone understands. As long as I can do what other normal people can do, Im really happy &amp; feels proud of myself.</strong></span></p>

              <p>You apply for jobs at varied companies like <span style="color: #000000;">DHL, EPSON,,GUARDIAN PHARMACY, SINGAPORE CHANGI HOSPITAL, OCBC, MANGO, what is the skill or expertise that you have?</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">You will be wasting their time if you say are willing to do anything.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">If you are applying in response to an advertisement, do you fulfil the requirements they ask for? If you don't fit the bill, you be in for another dissapointment. Employers don't know you until turn up infront of them. And then you need to impress them. But first you must have their requirements, or least some of it.</span></p>
              <p>An attitude of I am handicap have pity on me is sure to fail.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">The above applies to all job seekers, able bodies or challenged.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">For you, (although you have not specified your handicap) you must acknowledge your physical constrains, and how it would relate to the company you intend to work for. e.g. Some company premises are not wheel chair friendly. Some have fast paced work environment. </span></p>
              <p>Firstly, what are your skills, what can you do?  Anyone wanting to help you would ask you this first. What can <strong>you contribute</strong> to the company?</p>
              <p>Secondly, you must get someone or some organization to help you get a foot into the company. Cold call and response to advertisement are the most difficult way to get a job.</p>
