              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Let me share with you my job interview experiences. Ive been interviewed by company like DHL,EPSON.GUARDIAN PHARMACY,SINGAPORE CHANGI HOSPITAL,OCBC,MANGO but non of them wanted me to be part of the company. Indeed, they are a well-known company. </strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>First of all I felt sad as they really looked down on me due to my handicapped looked which i encounter since young. I don't understand why that matters to them. Afterall they should looked upon talent and employ those who they believe can contribute to the company. Secondly, I don't know how's my future will be like. There is  once CDC told me to go to newton to take up front desk courses. When I came there i was interviewed, and she told me that my physical constraints is a major concern to her. She said it was impossible to get a job as a front desk as they want normal people. When she told me off like dat, i felt really sad. To me, as long as you can do that job, it doesnt matter whether u are a handicapped or a normal people. But for me, I judged myself as a normal people who lead a normal live and i went to a neighbourhood school. I dont understand why they don't want to employed people like me.</strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong> I also get negative  feedback while interviewed @ DHL in Eunos area. She told me can u count? Can u see numbers? And so on and on . She asked me stupid questions and I felt really insulted. She should not ask me questions like that. It's really unprofessional and insulting.While interviewing me, she wears a shades. Is that some kind of a joke or what? </strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>Even i interviewed @ OCBC near Lau Pa Sat, they said that I have a very good communcation skills but then they rejected me due to my physical look. And for Guardian, they pranked me twice. They promised me that i had  an interview with them and didn't called me back. Few weeks later they called me and said a specifc date to come down to interview. E same thg happen to me. They promised but never kept promises. </strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>I feel like giving up my life until i saw this woman who is bald. She suffers from cancer but works as a receptionist cum admin asst in 1 of a company in payalebar. I wonder why a woman like her can get a job while i can't. Nothing is Impossible. Even if people looked down on me, there's  noway it's gonna stop me from finding job. Each day imm strong enough to face these obstacles. I have nothing to be ashamed off. That's really special about me that noone understands. As long as I can do what other normal people can do, Im really happy &amp; feels proud of myself.</strong></span></p>

              <p>Ok Heres the deal, I just came back from aust 7 months ago after completing my degree(i also worked as a manager for 6months there)</p>
              <p>And since coming back I have only been called up for interviews like 3times.</p>
              <p>The problem doesnt lie with you or me, Its lie with our Fark up goverment who are working for the corporations instead for its citizens, The more Cheap labour they bring in, the more fuck up we become.</p>
              <p>A businessman is almost always greedy, all he believes in is making Money money money!! And since the goverment allows almost any tom dick or harry to come here and earn 1k for a supervisor post, he will get hired b4 you or me do!</p>

              <p>You haven't mention what exactly is your handicap? We may not be able to help you nor give you feedback because we don't know exactly what is your handicap and cannot ascertain if the companies are really discriminating you. You mention you have physical constraints, what exactly is it? I can't help you if I do not know exactly is causing your physical constraints.</p>
              <p>I symphathize with you but let me give you some word of encouragement that there are others like you who have done better than normal people. I once know a guy who came in to work as a Senior Manager at Fraser &amp; Neave and he has physical disabilities, I am not sure what you call it, he needs crutches and his legs bend awkwardly as he walks. Another of my friend, he works in IT department at a multi national oil company but he has walking disabilities, he wears braces (like Forest Gump) and needs crutches. He has been there for over 10 years. So don't give up, there are people like you who has excel in what they do.</p>
              <p>Perhaps there are channels such as complains to proper govt depts about your problem. If you are suffering from a physical handicap then you should sign yourself with the relevant NGOs that support respective disabled people and they may be able to help you with your case or even help you to get a better job.</p>
              <p>Since its been already a year, you should lower down your expectations and start applying for less popular employers. Experience is important and may be stepping stone for you to get better jobs and more prominent employers the next time.</p>

              <p>MPs will only refer Singaporeans to CDC for help.   Those who have sought help getting jobs from CDC have negative experiences with them.   They are a bunch of idiots, arrogant toads like the PAP who refuse to put themselves in the shoes of the  job seekers who are facing problems  and  these arrogant and heartless toads are ever ready to blacklist and condemn job seekers.  </p>

              <p>Generally, employers are not interested to employ job seekers who are without jobs for long.  Even if job seekers hold part-time, temp or contract jobs they are also not happy about it.     If the job seekers are holding permanent jobs, they will also keep probing why the job seekers want to leave the present employment. </p>
              <p>To sum it up, there are far too many bloody employers who love to indulge making things difficult for job seekers.  This is inclusive of the govt employers/HR personnel.</p>
