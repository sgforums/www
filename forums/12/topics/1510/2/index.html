            <div class='col-md body'>I've got an advice here my friend; besides trying to have more control over your stress and anxiety problems, try eating more small meals instead of three big meals. Have like 6 small meals everyday; that will help in digestion and you won't have unfinished food. Maybe a bite every now and then between classes...<br><br>But remember, NEVER skip your breakfast, and try to eat healthy food for those small meals instead of snacks or sweet stuffs... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Is it just a few colleagues or everyone leh?<br><br>Last time, when I was working b4 going overseas to study, I also face some probs with a few colleagues, but not everyone, hehe... maybe it's due to personality differences I think.

And that medication do help me to feel/think better. But I don't want to be TOO dependent on medication, so trying hard to cope without it.<br><br>Secondly is I always concentrate in my WORK performance that I failed to understand PEOPLE also matters. But I prefer to be alone most times, kind of need to put in effort here already.<br><br>That time before seeing psychiatrist, I did see my family doctor often for my stress problem. Then I went to seek help from a counsellor, after hearing my problems, she advised me to see psychiatrist IMMEDIATELY! Actually I already have problems since 22 but I am not awared.
