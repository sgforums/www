Sometimes, I don't really feel like continuing with my studies, as I seem to have so much problems... but at the same time, as this is my last semester, I just hope to complete my studies soon and return to Singapore...<br><br>Do you have any advice as to how I could curb my acute hunger and also to relieve my study stress?<br><br>[This message has been edited by autumn (edited 02 March 2002).]</div>

Either as a DIRECT relate or a PSYCHOLOGICAL problem....<br>TRY to ADHERE your 3 meals to PROPER FIXED TIMING of the day... While you're having your 3 meals, always TRY to as much as you can... Make them ENJOYABLE and a RELAXING MOMENT while you're dining... Just ENJOY your food and have a DEFINED TIME SCOPE for your meal such that other things shouldn't come to your mind, disturb you or interfere with it.... For ADDITIONAL supplements, as you have mentioned that you usually cannot finish your meal... Try having biscuits or light snacks if that's the case... If the problem of not finishing your meal is dominant during your 3 MAIN MEALS... Try taking up a regular exercise or sports... And IF POSSIBLE, try to arrange it in the MORNING or just before the meal which you have MOST DIFFICULTY in finishing...<br><br>Considering the FACT that you would be finishing your semester SOON, I find it a PITY if you give up at this moment too?<br>For you to reduce down your STRESS LEVEL....<br><br>1. TRY to have ADEQUATE and FIXED sleeping hours so that you can have more efficient study hours later in the day and also helps regulate your body so that you can cope with STRESS better...<br><br>2. TRY to take up AT LEAST one sports. Try to make it something which you enjoy doing and having it with FIXED ROUTINE throughout the week. You can also arrange for it to be conducted with friends or people who you enjoy being with if you want to....<br><br>3. TRY to take up AT LEAST a hobby or interest. Allocate yourself some time (Try to get FIXED amount of time ALLOCATED for your activity) to do something which is RELAXING or you just simply enjoy doing... Maybe it be just taking a stroll, just sitting down enjoying scenery or people watching... Let yourself BREATHE...<br><br>Though it's a COMMON MENTALITY that TIME should be EMPHASIZED on STUDIES while you're doing HEAVY STUDY TERMS... And REALISED that TIME is NEVER ENOUGH... But what you're studying would normally take SO MUCH MORE learning and reading up in later points of your life.... While recognising that STUDIES is a MAJOR part of your life right now, DON'T neglect your OWN LIFE... Maintaining your body and life in RIGHT BALANCE would help you cope with stress BETTER... In terms giving you BETTER HEALTH, healthier MENTALITY and a MORE POSITIVE approach to things... Which would GREATLY BENEFIT you for your EXAMS and help keep you in ONE PIECE when you're back in SINGAPORE... LEARN to ENJOY the things you do and ULTIMATELY... LIFE...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> I WISH YOU LUCK?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for your replies. Just a little update on my case:<br><br>This afternoon I went to see the doctor at my uni after lesson and found out the reason --- it is due to anxiety or stress that I am experiencing. I was given some medication and was told by the doctor to consult her again 1 mth later if my symptom still persist.<br><br>Well, I do feel that I m giving myself too much stress lately ever since school term started. But at the same time, I couldn't stop myself from not worrying abt certain things... Oh well, I think life has to go on for me, I just have to endure... btw, I think I have another prob again... maybe I will post it in another topic someday. Heh heh, seems that I am a very problematic person and I felt very paiseh posting my probs here...<br><br>[This message has been edited by autumn (edited 07 March 2002).]</div>
