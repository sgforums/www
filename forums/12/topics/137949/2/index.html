So basically my life is virtual, i don't have a real life.<br><br>What should i do? </div></blockquote>ok the pimple thing is easy to take care of... alittle care by washing ur face more... using better pimple creams it should clear up.<br><br>as for not having life outside the chat forums... instead of spending all ur tine in front of the screen, take part in more ECAs  and join in in more gp activities. be more outspoken.<br><br>I was like u in sec sch. but just b4 starting poly, i made a concious effort to be more outgoing. and talk more... soon when u find the right group of friends u'll feel comfortable enough.<br><br>making friends is easy but the easy part is being hi-bye friends... ppl that u smile to and say hi but not more then the 'weather' type talk.<br>making friends who'll stay by ur side when u are in trouble, or are troubled. is not easy. but they all start at the same point. u'll have to make the first move and put in lots of effort.<br><br>Believe me when i tell u making friends is the easy part. keeping friends, staying in touch when u all have ur own seperate lives and activities to take care of is the HARD part!!!<br><br>but nothing is impossible. the fruits of all these hard work is deliciously sweet!!!!<br><br>try harder.... remember they may be just as shy, and desperately looking for a friend as u.<br></div>
