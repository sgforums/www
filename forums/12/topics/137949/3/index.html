(I think, therefore I am.)<br>- Rene Descartes</span><br><br>You think it is, therefore it is.<br><br>This was this episode from the recent "An Eye For A Guy 2" series that I just happened to catch on TV. There was this guy who had given the girl lots of little meaningful gifts throughout the series and he even drew her a pencil sketch portrait. The girl would probably have let him gone on the show if he had not been over-humble and downplayed himself as "just an average guy". Her parting words to him was "I've never thought of you as average till you said you were average."<br><br>I know the show is tacky entertainment, and probably not a credible reference, but think about this: If you were a girl and a guy who liked you kept harping about how pathetic his life was, how would you take it? Would you want to be with someone who is confident of himself and able to provide you with security, or with someone who considers himself pathetic and predicts (self-fulfillingly) he'd never win your heart?<br><br>One would never gain confidence and respect from others if one does not have any confidence and respect in oneself.<br><br>Rise and smell the flowers out there, kid.
