            <div class='col-md body'>"The man who was death" I think the general message here is to take part in activities that will bring you out of your house... anythin like gym, interest classes like photography, drawing... ANYTHING that can bring u our of your house and into a gp (preferably among the same age gp)<br><br>As you said u are only 17 (so young!!!) just got out of secondary? going to poly? jc? ite? whatever. join in their Freshment Orientation activities.. camps, outings...etc join in their clubs... soon u'll find urself surrounded by familiar faces all smiling and stopping to chat.<br><br>However this only increases ur number of Hi-Bye friends... to make good friends u must make effort. call them up to organise outings... smile more ask about their lives... tell them about yours... smile and make jokes... smile....<br><br>Bottom line... smile more.... learn to like yourself. when you like who you are, ppl can see it. and like and be drawn towards u (provided u don't like urself till u become arrogant!) and LET Nature take it's course.... it takes time to bond with someone... the more u force it the less likely it'll happen.<br><br>Making time for friends is a difficult task. but most friends are worth the trouble!!!<br><br>PM Me if u like to talk<br></div>

I once lived for hatred, i even believed that humans are there to hurt each other. even the greatest love of all , mother love is flawed, let alone friends' love.<br><br>if i am not wrong there is a theory that mention love can be subsituted. if you lack of one area of love, you can compenstated it with another area.<br><br>Example if you don have any love for relationship, you can compenstated by loving your family more. That is why a few years back where there are cases wher young girls look for love outside as the family is unable to provide them.<br><br>by the way, your life will always be pathetic if you keep thinking this way, surf more forum and you will find that you are not alone.<br><br>CHEERS man!! to Suffering!!</div>
