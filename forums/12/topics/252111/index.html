            <div class='col-md body'>as many have probaly emphasized the importance of practise for maths, what are you waiting for? the cow to jump over the moon?<br><br>you sit here and whine and fearing your friend would overtake you and you don't wanna do anything about it. do you ever pay attention in class? if you do did you clarify your doubts with your teachers/friends?<br><br>what i can advise you is <strong>practise more for maths</strong>. do it now rather than later. it will be too late. i assume you're taking your O's this year? its may now still have time if you really wanna push yourself. be a geek for 5months+ and you'll be thanking god for the outcome of your results rather than posting another thread whining on how badly you did and probaly have thoughts of attempting suicide.<br><br>as for SS you could try to spot questions. spot the chapters that would probaly have a higher possibility of coming out. concentrate more on them. as for the rest have a rough idea of it.<br>(Not really recommended for those who suck at spotting questions and those who don't do their "homework" by finding out questions tt came out from previous years)<br><br>and last but not least, good luck  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When you are practicing you math, you are actually exposing yourself to a wider range of question that could be asked on a single topic.<br><br>There are more than 101 way to ask a question, but it's wheather did you know the correct steps of answering the question.<br><br>Maths is like a skill, if you didn't practice, i'll turn rusty. Keep adding Oil, don't let it rust. Try to spent at least 30~60 minute a day tackling some maths questions.<br><br>Do it slowly, and steadily.<br><br>Although Mid-Year exams are important, but the ultimate goal is to do well for your O Level. Nevermind if you didn't do well for Mid-Year Exam, remember that the ultimate goal is O Level. DON'T be disheartened by your friends' comment, you must keep your mindset positive at all time.<br><br>Even though you may have some disappointment on your grades, but make that be your lesson learned. Never never make the same mistake twice, this is what my maths teacher told me.<br><br>When you faced a very challenging maths question, challenge yourself to see if you can solve the problem or not. If you got the wrong answer, then try again. If wrong, then maybe you can seek help from your teacher or your peers. Perhaps you can post the questions here at sgForums and everybody will help you.<br><br>Remember this, Energizer's slogan is "Never say Die".<br><br>What's the point of mastery every chapter in Mid-Year and when O Levels comes you forget everything? Learning should not be rush, and learning to be exciting and explorable. It must trigger your inner self to seek for the answers, rather than being 'forced' to look for answer.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>While last-minute mugging can get you through the earlier stages of one's education, this is not my recommended mode of study for tertiary level. That you have found yourself short in handling your exams is a good indicator of your inadequacy. Good that you have discovered this early coz it means you have time and opportunity to change your study strategy.<br><br>The key to handling tertiary studies is consistency and regular studies. Seting aside time to revise your work everyday will be the best. And the best thing about this is that if you do it on a daily basis, you don't have to study for hours! In fact a few minutes per subject will be sufficient coz you do it everyday! Just go through the topics covered in the lecture &amp; tutorial each day to make sure you understand them. You don't have to master them. At least make sure you can follow them. Intensify your revision only nearer the exams so you can focus more fully on them. The key is : FAIL TO PREPARE, PREPAR TO FAIL! Good luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
