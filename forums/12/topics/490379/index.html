              <p>Ok so I've just started in a new school and found out that one of the girls in my class was staying at the block next to mine. As such,  we've been going to school together.....</p>
              <p>Recently i started to feel that maybe she doesn't want to go to school with me anymore.... Like if I don't ask her when she's leaving her house she'll just leave for school alone without me... There are a few other things she did which made me feel like i'm a bother to her.</p>
              <p>However, when we are together I feel that we are really hitting it off... there's laughter... endless common topics to talk about and never had an awkward silence before.</p>
              <p>So..... what I really want to know is:</p>
              <p>How do I tell her that if she wants me to leave her alone and she rather travel alone, It's ok, I wont be offended one bit and that i respect her decision 100%? I just want to know how she truely feel and I don't want to be that pest bothering her every morning.</p>
              <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
              <p>(Ps: I post in this forum because i think girls are more sensitive to other people's feelings and since it's concerning a girl's feelings now, I think it's best to ask here!)</p>

              <p>Just ask if going to school together is a pain lor</p>
              <p>usually girls dont mind waiting to go to sch with friends, cuz most of us dun like to be alone de, unless</p>
              <p>1) the waiting time is too long ( whether ure always late or u take craplong to get out or shes just early)</p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">2) she cant wait to get to sch ( for friends crush schoolwork whatever)</span></p>
              <p>3) secretly she doesnt like u but doesnt want to show ( got one trust me)</p>
              <p>4) shes having insecurities on her part ( like u now lor)</p>
              <p>sometimes the signs u get from her might be misleading whether on whose part.</p>
              <p>only sure way is to ask. If she say she doesnt mind but then u still cant shake this feeling off then is her prob ardy. </p>
              <p>Play it cool or not if she rly no prob with u, the one feeling bad will be her cuz she realises what u think of her( unless she the rly loud kinda girl) welp dk if this helps</p>

              <p>idk but maybe the next time she have to wait for you, be like "hey sorry i am late! i feel v bad making you wait, do u mind it?? would you prefer going school alone?it's ok if u want ah i feel very burden leh"</p>
              <p>#itried</p>
              <p>yeah but personally i would get annoyed having to wait lah like what if u make me late man??or like miss the bus j cos wait for u?? </p>
              <p>and when im annoyed i would try to show it very obviously yet not directly like her i.e basically leaving alone unless asked (if i reject when asked, it's kinda expressing it directly which i won't but if never ask then it's not my problem PLUS u'll notice it so i get my 'revenge')</p>
              <p>PS. Annoyed doesn't mean i dislike you, it only last a certain period and it's because of certain actions you do</p>
              <p>Hope this helps!</p>

              <p>I'm rarely late... because just like you i'll also be annoyed if I have to wait XD</p>

              <p>Ok lah i got late 5 mins once but I told her to go first because idw her wait for me... then she rlly go first... kinda heart shattering.</p>
              <p>I'm really confused because we get along quite well (or at least in my perspective) so I don't really expect this kinda reaction....</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Greetings ! I would suggest the next time you meet her ( if you guys are still going to school together . ) that you tell her up front that if it is not " convenient " to meet up every single morning to go to school then it is OK for you guys to stop this arrangement . You are a guy right ? So man up and take the initiative o get things done . Keep in mind that most women love to use subtle signs to hint to guys what they want ( or do not want . ) CHEERS!

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Maybe you can just whatsapp and hint her say, like quite long since we go to school together or something.  Most of the girls that don't like to get misunderstood will jump out and clarify to you. But if she try to avoid the topic or what then i don't think it's a good idea to ask any futher because definitely means something bad. In my opinion i think maybe she thinks that it's quite a hassle to meet up everyday but doesn't know how to tell you. Maybe she need some space alone, or she feel that getting less and lesser things to talk about? Sometimes it's better to ask straight, but i won't suggest that to you since you guys go to the same school lol.</p></div>
