I got the same shit from a girl just like you but i didn't stoop so low as you did.<br><br>Move on.<br><br>love is just like an addiction.<br><br>u said u want to move on. actually u don't. u WANT to be back with her which is impossible.<br><br>u don't love urself enough. you act so weak which turn girls off. you even try to gain her pity. Girls avoid guys like you to the core because u are needy and u are weak.<br><br>I know now u feel that u can't go on with ur life without  her.  BUT once u move on, it won't even bother you! and the feeling is like wow i don't have to suffer , i don't have to feel down, i don't have to feel heart broken. And she wasn't even pretty, she is just someone good at playing mind games, tricks, and following the rules of dating.<br><br>The tricky part is to be strong now. cut off all contacts from her now, don't feel pity for her, don't,  and soon u will be out of your life.<br><br>Girls like this are just immature and any guy that fall for her are just gonna suffer.  Seriously, they don't deserve us. She still enjoy ur attention even when she got no intention of patching back with you.<br><br>Because it feel GOOD to be wanted, to be desired, to be wooed, to have many guys showering their attention on them, especially to girls. So some girls resort to playing games with you, behaving like someone who she actually is not, following the rules of attraction, playing hard to get, giving u hopes now and then, making u falling heads and heels over her.<br><br>She don't really care if she hurt u or wat. she just want to boost her big ego. that is why she is giving u false hope.<br><br>she no longer see u as a potential relationship parthners, her actions clearly show that fact, so why are u still deceiving yourself? why are you still listening to her bullshit? playing her game?<br><br>don't tell fucking say you want her back. U are telling her that " hey i can go get laid by some guys then come back to you whenever i want to and u are a loser that is still gonna take me back". Take her back if u want, she is just gonna go do it again. if u really have no self respect then i really have nothing to say.<br><br>and looking at ur other post, seems like u also toys around with others feeling. So? hows it like having ur feeling played? love it?<br><br>better don't go around breaking others heart if u don't want others to break yours.</div></blockquote>i knw in the past, i did all wrong. thats why up to now, i have already changed. i accept whatever punishment. i knw talkin is free. but i really have changed. thats all i can say. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br>i can say i dun like the feelin of being played.<br><br>but i juz dun understand why everytime when she call or sms me, i will feel like   so darn happy all these. i knw i am a sub yet i also duno why i wanna be a sub.<br><br>i juz recalled, she told me last sunday, quotin frm her "u said u wan me back but yet u are blamin me for everythin thats wrong. we can never be together"<br><br>after this i think she said somethin wrong then she said "eh thats not what i mean la" then she hang up. its like . . . .<br><br>ok u all may start to scold me again.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>how to forget her when i am so so so soft hearted ? she really meant what she said ?? haiz</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am only replying to the topic on "Can't forget":<br><br>If you cannot forget, then don't forget!<br><br>Simply put it aside and do other things. Who say you have to totally erase the memories you so wanted to forget about? That is virtually impossible unless you get hypnotized or some advance machinary capable of removing that particular memory from you or worse... amnesia...<br><br>Memories are part of our lives. We cannot simply just forget and move on. Its what makes us grow. Sure it must be painful and torturing, but without pain and torture, how can you know what truely is bliss and joy?<br><br>Btw...
