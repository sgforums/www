Im going to analyse what she said again.<br><br>She did not want to give you an answer? She is confused. Let me tell you something, girls who like you won't confuse you. They know who they want. It means she don't like you enough to give you a straight answer. It could mean you might be her backup plans if her relationship with the new guy don't go well. And once that happens, you are going to be under her control like a slave, if that's what you want. Remeber, she has sampled you before? She has found you distasteful. She is now tasting the new guy.<br><br>No comments? No need comments bro. The fact she is with the guy says everything. All the guy needs to do is make a kiss. You are blown away by the kiss of death. Do you need further comments? Wake up!<br><br>Something happened between she and the guy? Meaning you are the backup guy? Sure! If you like it, go ahead. Our words mean nothing. Just make sure your tolerance for her behaviour is high. Prepare a lot of money. Why ? To buy a lot of green hats.<br><br>This is what you should be doing: "Babe, I understand. Be with him. By the time you come back, I also do not know who to choose between you and the other hot babe. Good bye!"<br><br>But you did not. You cling on. You thought that every ounce of hope she sprinkles on to you, you thought there is chance. She sounds nice but she is not. No. This is reality.

Think about it. She has already made it clear to you. It's like she remembers what mistakes you made and it's not going to be erased with a button. Women remembers things very well and they take it very personally. How is it possible she suddenly like you again? You cannot just trust her words at face value when she contradicted her statements. Unless you are rich of course and she may need to depend on you in the future?<br><br>I don't know how you can form your own conclusions based on your feelings but to me, this relationship is over. And you are getting played around like a fool. Where is your pride as a man? Seriously, you don't behave like one. You be direct. Tell her don't waste your time anymore. Then thank her.

            <div class='col-md body'>hey TS u seriously deserve a wake up slap.  I got the same shit from a girl just like you but i didn't stoop so low as you did.<br><br>Move on.<br><br>love is just like an addiction.<br><br>u said u want to move on. actually u don't. u WANT to be back with her which is impossible.<br><br>u don't love urself enough. you act so weak which turn girls off. you even try to gain her pity. Girls avoid guys like you to the core because u are needy and u are weak.<br><br>I know now u feel that u can't go on with ur life without  her.  BUT once u move on, it won't even bother you! and the feeling is like wow i don't have to suffer , i don't have to feel down, i don't have to feel heart broken. And she wasn't even pretty, she is just someone good at playing mind games, tricks, and following the rules of dating.<br><br>The tricky part is to be strong now. cut off all contacts from her now, don't feel pity for her, don't,  and soon u will be out of your life.<br><br>Girls like this are just immature and any guy that fall for her are just gonna suffer.  Seriously, they don't deserve us. She still enjoy ur attention even when she got no intention of patching back with you.<br><br>Because it feel GOOD to be wanted, to be desired, to be wooed, to have many guys showering their attention on them, especially to girls. So some girls resort to playing games with you, behaving like someone who she actually is not, following the rules of attraction, playing hard to get, giving u hopes now and then, making u falling heads and heels over her.<br><br>She don't really care if she hurt u or wat. she just want to boost her big ego. that is why she is giving u false hope.<br><br>she no longer see u as a potential relationship parthners, her actions clearly show that fact, so why are u still deceiving yourself? why are you still listening to her bullshit? playing her game?<br><br>don't tell fucking say you want her back. U are telling her that " hey i can go get laid by some guys then come back to you whenever i want to and u are a loser that is still gonna take me back". Take her back if u want, she is just gonna go do it again. if u really have no self respect then i really have nothing to say.<br><br>and looking at ur other post, seems like u also toys around with others feeling. So? hows it like having ur feeling played? love it?<br><br>better don't go around breaking others heart if u don't want others to break yours.</div>
