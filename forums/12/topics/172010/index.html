            <div class='col-md body'>Sometihing went really wrong between my gf and I and i dont really know why. It happened this week as she went overseas with her best friend. We promised each other that we'd message one another daily, just one msg a day. I sent heartwarming ones to her till thurs night when she return. However, her reply was rather curt to me. I know something went wrong, most probably family problems again. We used to talk to each other daily...without fail. so i left her alone and hopfully she will contact me the next morning. sdaly, she didnt.<br><br>We have been together for nearing two mths. And there's one occasion when she met up with some family arguement, she confided in me and i cheered her up and really did make her feel much better. However, this time round, she didnt tell me anything. I've sent messages to her asking what's happening and non of them had been replied. She didnt pick up my call and i havent talk to her for 3 days since her came back from overseas. I'm so worried what have gone wrong between us. I didnt do anything to upset her, all she told me is to let her be alone for a while.<br><br>Maybe I'm just selfish and longing for her after so long. But how long must she  take? I'm clueless on what's happening around and what can a bf like me do at this point in time. I'm feeling very low and I have lots of random wild negative thoughts about possible happenings which often pain my heart. I was sent into the hospital early this week due to severe abdominal cramps as I worried too much. She knows about it and not a single bit of concern was shown(no reply, no call). Perhaps she's really down with her family problems. But then, why couldnt she share her burden with me. Doesnt she knows that there's always me out there, who's willing to provide a listening year and offer her with advices?<br><br>My numerous calls of around 4 to 5 and messages came unanswered and unreplied, I might think that im irritating her. Deep down, i feel so miserable. I went out as what my friend had told me but things just went back to same. Feeling so low and sad. I feel that our love isnt as strong as what it was during courtship and inital days together.<br><br>I would appreciate any advice from you guys..what should I do now? Stop whining, move on and treat nothing has happen and wait till she calls me? I dont know how much longer i can hold on till i go bonkers..</div>

It happened this week as she went overseas with her best friend. We promised each other that we'd message one another daily, just one msg a day. I sent heartwarming ones to her till thurs night when she return. However, her reply was rather curt to me. I know something went wrong, most probably family problems again. We used to talk to each other daily...without fail. so i left her alone and hopfully she will contact me the next morning. sdaly, she didnt.<br><br>We have been together for nearing two mths. And there's one occasion when she met up with some family arguement, she confided in me and i cheered her up and really did make her feel much better. However, this time round, she didnt tell me anything. I've sent messages to her asking what's happening and non of them had been replied. She didnt pick up my call and i havent talk to her for 3 days since her came back from overseas. I'm so worried what have gone wrong between us. I didnt do anything to upset her, all she told me is to let her be alone for a while.<br><br>Maybe I'm just selfish and longing for her after so long. But how long must she  take? I'm clueless on what's happening around and what can a bf like me do at this point in time. I'm feeling very low and I have lots of random wild negative thoughts about possible happenings which often pain my heart. I was sent into the hospital early this week due to severe abdominal cramps as I worried too much. She knows about it and not a single bit of concern was shown(no reply, no call). Perhaps she's really down with her family problems. But then, why couldnt she share her burden with me. Doesnt she knows that there's always me out there, who's willing to provide a listening year and offer her with advices?<br><br>My numerous calls of around 4 to 5 and messages came unanswered and unreplied, I might think that im irritating her. Deep down, i feel so miserable. I went out as what my friend had told me but things just went back to same. Feeling so low and sad.[b] I feel that our love isnt as strong as what it was during courtship and inital days together. </strong><br><br>I would appreciate any advice from you guys..what should I do now? Stop whining, move on and treat nothing has happen and wait till she calls me? I dont know how much longer i can hold on till i go bonkers..[/b]</blockquote>U mean you have both been together for a few months ?<br>Then the mistake is for you that, it is not long.<br><br>A beginning of the relationship for you is just short.<br>You might think its long, but its only the beginning.<br>Try to talk to her now and then.<br><br>What coming from her now seems to be she's confused or her heart has "died"<br>So its just up to you to decide whether to break up or to slavage.<br><br></div>
