Maybe she is already feeling bored with the r/s, maybe she wants to focus more on her studies etc.<br><br>You can't force her to be with you all the time. If she says she places more priority on her school work, that's her right. And might be good thinking too, since both of you are still young, and if she doesnt pay attention to her studies but instead dedicate all her time to the r/s, do you want her to fail her courses because of you?<br><br>The more you love someone, the more you shouldn't hold him/her too tightly.  Give them some space to breathe. It is like holding sands in your hand, clutch it tightly and it will slip thru your fingers, hold it loosely and most of them will stay.<br><br>So right now, give her some time to think this over. If she wants to break up with you, there is nothing much you can do to stop it. And the more you cling to her, the more irritated she will feel and she will start to label you as needy. And girls have enough on their hands to bother with needy guys seeking their attention all the time when all they want is just some space and time to think things over.<br><br>Good luck  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

I suppose it won't be such an easy battle. Both of you have worn down and there would hardly be any warrior standing to 'fight'. But you should decide to carry on with the battle on your own for now, you'll have to understand that any possible love and care from her probably won't be coming from these hours... Perhaps only during the later stages when things have more or less been overcomed or has already settled down. If you start to doubt if she loves you then I'm sorry to tell you, it's very likely that love is already starting to diminish.. Not because of her, but solely on your part alone is sufficient to dissolve it...<br><br>For now it's really TLC... Try not to make 'demands' of her for now as it'll only stress her and make the relationship suffer even further... Unless you don't really have intention to keep the relationship, then I'll rather advise you to end it for now than to stress her further.. Answer to my questions and provide me with more information... I'll try to guide you along...?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by lost_aeon:</div><div class="quote_body">so what should i exactly do now?

Read the last paragraph in the 1st quoted part and perhaps you might get a better understanding of how she might be feeling...?<br><br>From the way I see it, both of you could be waiting for 'TLC' from each other... That's no way to row a boat....</div>

Even my message came unreplied. Well, basically is just that she needs to have some time to sort out her thoughts. Not too long and not too short as mentioned by her, just like a mth or so (gosh..that's like so long to me) and I feel like asking her how can i helped so as to accelerate the process and perhaps tell her how i feel. Yet I'm not sure if i'll screw things up if i do so.<br><br>And regarding about this 'withdrawal', she told me honestly few days ago and hope that i can understand and it just happenned since starting of the new year.<br><br>Tender loving care, how am I able to shower her with it when she's keeping a distance away from me. There's this invisible barrier between us. I really do feel like telling her how i feel right now, so that she can be aware. And just to add on, during our previous conversation, she told me that she's serious and she said that she didnt say she still doesnt like me so I've got nothing to worry about. And I wonder, if she's serious, why bother to go thru this sort of crap.<br><br>I dont know how to find peace in my mind. Hwk are just temporary solutions. The harsh truth always haunts me whenever I'm alone, whenever I see the things around me which are related to her.<br><br>I dont want to be a wimp, yet I cant get much strength to take this whole thing like a man.</div>
