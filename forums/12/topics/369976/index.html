              <p>I guess the "matter" has created much changes to me. It was both good and bad. At least i learnt from the lesson, who to trust and whom not to trust.

              <p>That leads back to the question : You take these people as your friends, but do they take you as their friends?</p>
              <p>For all you know ( or rather, not know ), they could possibly just take you as somebody whom they could make use of - a tool.</p>
              <p>The first thing which you must learn before learning how to be kind and gracious again to others, is to learn to identify those who are out to make use of you and/or harm you.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, no matter how many times you try to be kind towards others, you will find them unappreciative and guilty of stepping all over you instead. This in turn will only drive yourself to be sorrowful about how all your efforts have went to waste.</p>
              <p>On a side note: Sadly, there are quite a number of forummers like you here on this forum.</p>

              one amongst us mortals are perfect, and can try to help them
              to lead better lives, but if it is no reciprocated, worse still if
              it is treated with contempt despite numerous attempts and are
              cheated, then should not one walk away?</p>
              <p>Walk away not with frustrations or
              despair, but with pride in one's heart for

              such noble attempts? </p>
              <p>There is more to 'true friendships' than  you may realize,

              day and cherish that person or persons in your life. Seeking for
              perfection in others may be an el dorado illusive dream in our

              <p>Though i'm not behaving like i'm mad, i know i'm still angry

                  less patience and to be there for people. I guess i tried too hard
                  previously which lead to an ultimate burnout. It was very sad to
                  discover that the other party who you have been good to is not
                  worth to your effort and not your time </p>
              <p>I guess the "matter" has created much changes to me. It was both
                  good and bad. At least i learnt from the lesson, who to trust and
                  whom not to trust. In a bad way, i have grown less compassionate
                  and become more indifference. I don't feel like caring for people
                  anymore because the people that you were good to had created so
                  much trouble for you, trash your kindness like rubbish and insult
                  your own dignity.</p>

              <p>Do parents actually expect children to give back what they had given? If so, do you seriously think what parents had given, we can give back fully? No, it is expected that you would give voluntary to your next generation.</p>
