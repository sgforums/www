WTF? As simple as a THOUGHT? He is not even sure himself; he had never asked, question or clarify with you &amp; just a thought, this relationship is brought down to its knees defeated - this is where you stand in his heart - light and weightless as a feather. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>All I can say is: if you have reasonble reason to finish this relationship, so be it. But with such weak reasons, you seriously must rethink and consider very carefully before you patch or anything similar. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
