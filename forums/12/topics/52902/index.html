Basically, there is a little misunderstanding of needs and reality.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You want a bf, you want love and you want company - probably he can give the first two, but lacks in the last aspect. All I can say is that personal space to a guy is pretty important (Especially if he is a Aries, Leo or Sagi), however, over the burst of emotions from your words here, I suspect its more than what had just happened.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You felt disappointed when you have broke off with him and he barely put in any effort in trying to win you back - originally, different from what you had wanted in the first place. Now, when he claims that he loves you - you doubt. Its like a sinking ship - descending into a void of nothingness <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Is love (and only love) enough to substain a relationship?<br><br>You both have to talk - I silly to lose a relationship without even first communicating and coming into a proper &amp; rational decision. I urge you to date him out to one good, quiet place and trash your feelings to him. What you want to know and what he is really feeling/thinking would be given from there.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Are you a PIsces, Scorpio or Cancer?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

What do you think your bf should do for you? Are these realistic? They things we are looking for may be nice to us but is it something we can expect someone to do and to do it  consistently? Does he know what you want him to do? It may not be fair to judge and say that since he cannot fulfill the 'roles and responsibilities', he cannot be your bf.<br><br>If you are more calm, maybe you'd like to think about the relationship: what did you appreciate about him in terms of his personality? These things will stay with him. If you would like him to be more sensitive to you, that can take time to cultivate. For eg, most guys are not as sensitive as females not because they do not want to, but they are less in tune to read body language, understand how you feel from you facial expressions and all. If you should tell them that you are not feeling good, they'll go all out to make sure you feel better. That's the protective instinct in most guys (especially towards someone they care a lot about). Is the issue you face something that he can learn (and he is willing to) over time?</div>
