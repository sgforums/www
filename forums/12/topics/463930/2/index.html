Parades just make people stand there and stand there and stand there until the GOH comes then sedi-A and then senang di-Ri agn then march off and salute then walk one big round then go back the same spot agn then ltr march off agn. Very entertaining meh? Why NDP also need Parades?? I dont understand. Even like SAF POP, also in Parade. Why is parade used for all this?! All the audience go there see their son only, not to watch the parade. Diao. Can anyone tell me why is Parades so commonly used for big / offical things?</p></div>

              <p><br>If u change CCA when year start, you attendance is refreshed in that CCA. Meaning you wont lose any CCA points due to the lack of attendance. However, assuming you took NPCC till June, then change to NCC, there's a chance you will get penalised for attendance %. Plus since you can only have 1 <strong>MAIN</strong> CCA, it means that if you changed in the beginning of the year, it does not affect any representation points and participation points you've earned so far. Assuming you changed your CCA only in June, meaning any representation points you get from JAN to JUNE would not be calculated but only participation points because after that when u change CCA in June, the main CCA would be the new CCA you've changed to.</p>
              <p>The time when u change your CCA affect how your CCA points are calculated. Please check with your PE HOD if you intend to change your CCA.</p>
              <p>Seldom do ppl change from 1 UG to the other though. But do note that you need not necessaryily restart totally (like being treated/restart like a sec 1) if you change from 1 UG to the other.</p>

              <p>Right.. after suffering for 2 years... you have now earned the right to torture those juniors.</p>

              <p>and hor,npcc is like totally pointless sometimes. We don't do police stuff like training how to self defense or chase as a team or wat, wat we do is drill and campcraft.

              <p>NPCC is really damn boring.. no wonder they think torturing juniors so fun.</p>

              <p>Simple...to keep kids off the street. Imaging no CCA, the kids will be bored at home and then roam the streets and shopping centres - then the police will be v v busy.</p>

              <p>very very true. But the fact is, CCA is blocking up the time needed for homeworks and revision. therefore, most of the time weekends are scarficed just for homeworks. And so, we have lesser time for family and friend.</p>
