            <div class='col-md body'>I had known a ger for abt 2 mths and she is from my workplace but she is not in the company anymore. I tried to get close to her by helping her with her work and it is very obvious until almost everyone in the company already noe tat i like her. I have not feel so strongly for a ger b4, therefore i tink she is the one for mi after interacting and finding out more abt her. I even sent her home for a couple of times and even she is not in the company anymore, i msg her everyday and with positive reply each time. The problem i have is tat i dunno if she likes mi or not and i dun have previous experience to rely on..... Can anybody tell mi wat should i do next or should i ask her if she likes mi or not this early, cos i scare this might scare her away..... Any signs that i can see if she is interested in mi also?</div>

What does it says abt her integrity??? Therefore,I strongly disagree with yr view!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
