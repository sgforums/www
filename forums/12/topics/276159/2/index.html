The girl of your dream just called!<br><br>Are you really going to say no because itÂ’s impolite to reject a friend of 10 years?<br><br>CanÂ’t you arrange something else after the party? Or maybe ask her to join the party?</strong><br><br>The above scenario would hopefully make my point clear to you.<br><br><strong>If you want a girl to say yes to dating and possibly smooching you after a matter of 2 months, you have to play your cards right and she has to be HIGHLY INTERESTED.<br><br>When I say highly interested, it means you are right up there in her wanted list.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">She views you as equal importance to her best friends.</span><br><br>In this case, I probably have to flip several pages before I can see your name on that list.</strong><br><br>Obviously, you can simply ask her whether sheÂ’s ready to be your girlfriend.<br><br>Her most likely reply is she needs time.<br></blockquote>This is obviously a skewed example and far from being applicable exhaustively to all cases.<br><br>I've seen enough people - both men and women - with enough principles to make good their promises and honour their word. In such instances, it wouldn't be reasonable to expect the woman (who has first given her word to the other party whom she had committed to prior to being asked out by the guy in question) to go back on her word, would it?</div>

I tried to get close to her by helping her with her work and it is very obvious until almost everyone in the company already noe tat i like her. I have not feel so strongly for a ger b4, therefore i tink she is the one for mi after interacting and finding out more abt her. I even sent her home for a couple of times and even she is not in the company anymore, i msg her everyday and with positive reply each time. The problem i have is tat i dunno if she likes mi or not and i dun have previous experience to rely on..... Can anybody tell mi wat should i do next or should i ask her if she likes mi or not this early, cos i scare this might scare her away..... Any signs that i can see if she is interested in mi also?</div></blockquote>well, what i can say is that.. all gals can treat u very good as a good fren.<br><br>Most gal will also give positive reply like picking up your phone or replying your sms..<br><br>Most gal concern you as good as your best fren concern you too...<br><br>But one thing that make every gal different is that if shes willing to go out spend precious time with you alone..<br><br>SO...<br><br>U asked her out, she rejected for some reasons.. fine. And she never make date with u nex week..<br><br>Even if she do say to go out nex week or so, perhaps you're just in the bottom list.. only will go with you if no one ask her out..<br><br>Try this... Try ask her out for 10 times... of course.. dun ask her everyweek.. But try 10 times.. if your attempt is 10 times and no result.. then.. sorry man..<br>YOu just need more time to be friend with her 1st...<br><br>First u need to check out if she has anyone in her mind yet? Dont ask too straight-forward = =  Think yourself ok? But be prepared cuz:<br><br>If no, dont assume she's 100% telling the truth. Mayb its no, cuz it might be some1 connected in the company and dun wanna let u know bout it or they both not yet official. Sometimes, this kind of thing we just let even our best fren to know bout it unless its official.. So be prepared..<br><br>Anyway, her best friend saying u got chance.. doesnt meant she likes you to be as bf yet.. it was just that your gal jus thinks you're cute or nice.. so rite now just go slow and steady.<br><br>Conclusion, The only way to know a gal likes you or not is by dating out..if you can date her out many times alone, then its good.. its a good sign that she has chemically interested to you too.. but takes thing slow even this happens.. and dont suddenly turn into a Wussy.. just be yourself..but dont be too timid.. A gal respect their bf to be tough and strong with their own thinking..Be that<br><br></div>

That said, it is equally important and imperative to note that most Asian women - as a matter of fact, it's an issue with the Asian culture more than anything specifically related to the dating game - would not actually take the initiative to suggest alternative arrangements <strong>even if she were interested in the bloke</strong> (there's no doubt this, to me, should very much be taken for granted as you suggested simply because it's basic courtesy to do so). In that sense, it's pretty hard to conclude the woman is not into the guy just because she doesn't take the initiative to propose an alternative arrangement, is it? Obviously, it's ultimately still down to the bloke to decide if this investment is worth his time.<br><br>[quote]Originally posted by curiousOrange:<br><br>Then again, the thread starter can choose to ignore this skewed example and simply ask her whether she's ready to date him.<br><br>My guess is she will say she's not ready.<br><br><strong>And I believe the threadstarter will not give up just like that...<br><br>He has already invested pretty much in her (that's the problem when you fail to leave out exceptions and protect your heart).<br><br>He is probably reluctant to let go just like that.</strong></div></blockquote><strong>Although my stance would pretty much mirror yours (in terms of dealing with the playing hard-to-get birds), the rationale behind my actions would actually be pretty much different from yours.<br><br>If anything, it's the fact that such insecure women not being worth the hassle and time (ultimately, such behaviour does actually reveal glimpses of insecurity and passiveness which, IMO, would hinder the relationship at some point later on) that dictates someone in such a predicament should call a halt on proceedings, rather than actually doing so to <span style="font-style: italic;">protect one's heart</span>. After all, I've yet to see any confident lass engaging in such mindless endeavours.</strong></div>
