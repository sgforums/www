            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by curiousOrange:<br><br>I admire your train of thoughts.<br><br>First of all, I will clarify that what IÂ’ve written so far has nothing to do with whether a guy should initiate or not.<br><br><strong>A guy must do the initiation.</strong><br><br>Not because of some romantic idea that if two people are mutually interested, things should flow naturally.<br><br>I guess IÂ’m not like you in that sense.<br><br>A guy does the initiation simply because he has the balls to do so.</blockquote>In fact, that's where the contradiction comes in although I get where you're coming from. You're effectively advocating a zero sum game with virtually no risk exposure - hence, the belief in the guy should be the one doing the initiation, yet emphasising on the need to protect himself.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by curiousOrange:<br><br>When I write about leaving out exceptions and protecting your heart. It applies to the <strong>initial stage.</strong><br><br>Your take is this; one should not be too afraid to jump in.<br><br>One should not be too afraid to love.<br><br>Love and trust should flow naturally when both parties are mutually attracted.<br><br>I would like you to pause for a moment and ponder about this:<br><br>On what basis do you love this woman?<br><br>On what basis do you trust this person?<br><br>The gradual establishment of trust and loyalty over time is vital in any relationship.<br><br>By sticking to rather stringent criterions in the initial stage, you have almost guaranteed yourself a woman with good potential to be accommodating in a relationship.<br><br>This will make your life much easier when you have to maintain the relationship if you are thinking of something long term.<br><br></blockquote>Putting it bluntly, I find your perspective rather thought-provoking. That said, just let me clarify on some issues which I suppose you haven't clearly understood.<br><br>I'm in full agreement that the guy should take the initiative to woo the lady. That said, I'm also of the opinion (and it's pretty certain I'm not exactly a believer in love at first sight or into the idea of picking a complete stranger up for a relationship - picking a stranger up for a fling is quite another matter, but that's a story for another day  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) that an overtly passive woman doesn't make a good partner for a relationship. As a matter of fact, it's precisely during the wooing stage (i.e. the stage before you formalize the relationship and both parties, implicitly or explicitly, understand they have a commitment to each other as more than just friends) that one should really observe and trust your gut instinct on where this relationship (or lack thereof) could potentially be heading. It's precisely also during this phase where you'd most need to let nature take its course IMO - for most, the concept of having nature delivering a verdict on the destiny of a relationship could stem from anything ranging from whether there's chemistry between the pair (i.e. for talking, common interests, etc) to whether one's partner actually remotely fits the stereotype of what one wants in a partner. This is what I'd call the <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">wooing</span></span></strong> stage.<br><br>Quite simply, at this stage, if a woman never takes the initiative to initiate a phone conversation or a date (I don't mean the very first date or phone call, but rather, it'd be ridiculous if after going out for a couple of months, it's still the guy initiating everything), it's the end of the road as far as I'm concerned (and I'm sure I'm not the only guy who thinks that way). From my experience and observations of those around me (I mean people I know), things that end at this stage invariably yield a few types of women (<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">note I'm only talking about women who actually have an interest in the guy here</span></span>) - and mostly, I'd say having a mindset whereby a certain degree of shyness/reservation that a woman should never initiate anything forms the bulk of the lot(the other group forming the bulk of this lot would be those playing hard-to-get) who fall short here. In truth, in such instances, much as many may not share my views, I actually do not sympathise with the women who think they have been led on by guys and if anything, it's the guys who have done right by them. The reason being, most of my mates who pull the plug at this point very rightly cites potential lack of communication and incompatibility as long-term obstacles that could potentially rock the relationship - to a very large extent, I have to agree with that for there're obviously some traits and characteristics which you cannot enter into a relationship without them being clearly established (regardless of how much you'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt).<br><br>Obviously, I'm in complete agreement with you that, should the abovementioned issues be redressed, then the ball should be on the guy's court to seal the deal and formalise the relationship (be it through formally asking for the woman's hand or simply holding her hands and sealing the deal with a kiss). And <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">that's where the wooing stops and dating begins</span></span></strong>...<br><br>On a sidenote, I think it's pretty hard for a guy to be romantic to a woman who falls in the above category for ultimately, things just do not flow well enough (in most cases) for the bloke to feel appreciated enough or be given the encouragement to offer the brand of romanticism the lady craves. If both parties decide to hold back, what ultimately gives?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> After all, as with any other types of relationship, it takes two hands to clap.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by curiousOrange:<br><br>Gradually, you will get to understand this person more.<br><br><strong>ThatÂ’s when you allow exceptions to come in, when you find that you really have faith and trust her enough to do so.</strong><br><br>Protecting yourself in the initial stage does not undermine the more mature form of love that will develop in the later stage.<br><br>I see where you are coming from as well.<br><br>It sounds calculated. It sounds mechanical.<br><br>It doesnÂ’t feel like love at the initial stage.<br><br>Love ought to be reckless, preferably with a nice tinge of pain involved.<br><br>But on the other hand, if you donÂ’t put yourself in the first place, no one will.<br></blockquote>Admittedly, much of what we have discussed centres very much on the character of the man and woman in question and what they both want in each other. Obviously, if you put an egoist and a sycophant together, then chances are your method would stand a better chance of pulling a deal off - for ultimately, ironically, an insecure woman who looks excessively to a man for security would, in all probability, satisfy the equally-insecure bloke's need for a validation and endorsement of his self-worth (in such a case, although both parties are insecure, they pretty much look for validation of their self-worth in different, yet complimentary ways).<br><br>That would obviously not work for a relationship between two confident individuals.</div>

While the extent of risk exposure is subjective, what you're advocating is exactly the same as mine. While you go on about protecting your heart to ensure you do not invest any more energy and time into an unworthy relationship, I'm merely advocating the importance of picking up the key signals (much of which were covered in my first post in this thread) to ascertain if the investment is worthwhile.<br><br>If anything, I certainly see very much of myself in you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Obviously, to play the game well, you just can't force certain issues and let nature take its course - needless to say, the most consummate players in this game are those who are able to get by without compromising beyond limits (as would be the case with the 'nice guys' you cited).<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by curiousOrange:</div><div class="quote_body">My opinion is simple. Escalation of her interest does not involve investing your feelings heavily and lamenting to the whole world when she does not reciprocate.<br><br>It comes mainly from what you already have within.<br><br>It comes from what you have done to improve yourself and initiation is a display of value(confidence, humour, patience, interaction) to her.<br><br>If she is showing signs of interest, go for it.<br><br>If she is giving unrecognizable signals, pull back rather than invest more feelings (time and effort) into it.<br><br>Pulling back does not mean pulling the plug as you suggested.<br><br>You are still treating this person the same way. Just that if she really has high interest in you, she will have to come out from her shell and gives you the stronger signals you are waiting for if she wants a second date offer.<br><br>If she couldnÂ’t be arsed to do so or if she is some ultra passive and shy creature, you should really ask yourselfÂ…why do you bother?<br><br>Regardless, your heart is still protected.<br></div></blockquote>While the ends pretty much justify the means on this count, the protection of one's heart is pretty much a manifestation of one's inner self. Like I've said all along, we pretty much share a similar consensus with regard towards ascertaining what a woman should do before the bloke takes things further, it's the rationale governing the actions of the bloke's actions that differ for you and me.<br><br>I suppose you can't fault those who choose to engage in this game with an objective of protecting his own heart, especially for those with the experience of failed relationships. That said, it's not hard to distinguish blokes who act the way they do because they're confident of what they can offer (in which case, it's a case of their self-belief governing their behaviour more than a need to mask their vulnerability) from those who are cautious for fear of investing in the wrong commodity (birds in this case  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> ). Ultimately, over a sustained period, I still maintain it's the former who possesses an edge over the latter as far as the natural selection process goes.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by curiousOrange:</div><div class="quote_body">In an ideal world, we can all rely heavily on our gut to tell us what to do and what to avoid.<br><br>Gut relates to your life experiences.<br><br>Would you tell a man who is 25 yrs old, has no experience in making an approach to rely on his gutÂ….and how nature would eventually take its course?<br><br>In this context,<br><br>Girl said she'd rather go to a birthday party.<br><br>There are no counter offers.<br><br>Girl couldnÂ’t be arsed to do anything after the incident, so he makes another offer.<br><br>My gut tells me this is not a sign of high interest.<br><br>His gut is probably telling him the same.

That way, you wouldn't need to worry about her lack of initiative conveying a lack of interest and you're, in all probability, going to get the answer you want.
