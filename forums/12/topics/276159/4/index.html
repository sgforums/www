It's hard for us to give the perfect advice through reading your written text as we would not be able to picture the exact scenario. But judging from what you have said, I would say that you might have turned her off. But there's no point dwelling in what might have happened as you would never know what she is actually thinking.<br><br>So my point here is go with the "feel' like I always do. And on the girl's perspective, going out with you on a date have already indicated a willingness to know more about you. I might not be a hint of fancying you but at least the basic interest is there. And to be fair to her, she's already taking a step in by meeting you so should you turn her off, it's only right if she discountinue this "dating relationship". Try afew more times and ask her directly if you have offended her in any way.<br><br>Sincerity goes a long way in a rs and all is not lost till she gets attached.<br>So all the best.. Perserverance is the key, that I can vouch for with my name..<br>Hope to hear from you soon</div>

You've apologised over the matter - if she cannot come to terms with that, she's probably not worth your time. The worst thing you could do now is cling on to her - if anything, the ball's actually in her court now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
