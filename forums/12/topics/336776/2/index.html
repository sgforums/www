              <p>It's more than 6 months. It's not that i'm shy to talk to her. Cos when she went back to her ex, she started avoiding me. When she avoids me, i tried to talk to her, but she still avoids.</p>
              <p>In the end, we became like strangers. It's almost awkward to talk to her.</p>

              <p><br>It's the attachment that they felt for each other.</p>
              <p>Cos their eyes got used to seeing/containing each other within their line of vision, their brains got used to think and considerate for each other at their daily lives, their body got used to be with one another in the places they used to visit/shop together.</p>
              <p>When all of these suddenly disappears from their lives, their body will reaction emotionally and send out signals to the emotions telling the mind that something is not right or missing from the normal operation of the body, so their minds will automatically react with signals to their hearts which caused them to yearn for and misses each other.</p>

              <p><br>That explains alot, and it's normal for her to yearn for her ex and return to him if you only got her at the rebound of her relationship.</p>
              <p>Unless the previous relationship love is destroyed, ceased to exist or overtaken by the current love between you and her, you will lose her.</p>
              <p>It's only a matter of time before she leaves you.</p>
              <p>Should have spent more time with her to build up a better relationship to overtake her previous one?</p>
              <p>Now is the time for regret and reflection. And you will learn from this and do better in your next relationship. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p><br>Of course by right they should be together forever if they don't change. But people change because they themselves wishes to change and are constantly learning and seeking ways to change themselves in their friends, environment, movies, people they know, people they have heard about, idols, situations which forces them to change in order to survive....</p>
              <p>Very few people in this world doesn't crave for changes, and these are usually people who are confident, contented, satisfied with themselves and their well-being in their lives.</p>
              <p>Many times in our lives that we had encouraged our loved ones, friends, or even people whom we have never met before (like in this sgforums) to change for the betterment of themselves and their loved ones. But not many people are able to change their lives even though they have successfully encouraged or advised their others to change for the better.</p>
              <p>themoment86, it depends on the individual if they wishes to change or have the will to change or not. An ideal relationship would be one where the couple changes at the same pace together for the betterment of their relationship...OR the couple doesn't change or do not see the need to change as they both believes their relationship is at the peak/prime of their lives and they are both contented with their relationship (This is RARE...but very ideal, even I also wished to find someone who can make me feel this way too).</p>
              <p>If a couple doesn't change at the same pace or one changes more than the other who doesn't have the will to change, then the relationship will eventually becomes one-sided or both will find themselves drifting apart eventually and their reason to be together would have been lost or changed unconsciously. This is common nowadays.</p>
              <p>Couples who broke up and then realised that they don't like their current changed lives compared to the previous one before their lives changed, may find their lives to be too miserable and misses their old lifestyle before they change. Some couples will discard their changed lifestyle and return to their previous contented lifestyle and likely to seek out each other's company again. Some couples may think of it as an opportunity to find a better partner to complement themselves again, but they will definitely make a mental note NEVER to change again as they do not wish to taste such misery ever again in their relationship. Couples like this will most likely to have flash wedding. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>People are different, life is ever-changing but religion is constant. So don't be surprised to find people seeking religion for constant peace in their lives or relationships.</p>
              <p>Look for someone who shares the same beliefs in life as you and is as KIND as you. I've met couples who have found each other as a perfect match as both of them are as EVIL as themselves. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>And of course, you must always find someone who can make you happy, must be handsome enough to make your heart flutters, must know how and when to romance you sensibly.</p>
              <p>How can I forget to mention must be able to afford at least MINIMUM 30k ring for proposal. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
