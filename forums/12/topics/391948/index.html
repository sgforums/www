              <p><br>You ah......being your girlfriend means must 100% with you meh? So dangerous ..... no wonder all guys so desperate to have girlfriend.......must be they all think girlfriend must give them 100%. Sounds like an unfair deal to me.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself, what fun is your relationship going to be without containing any uncertain elements in it? You can also spice up the ante with many uncertaincies of your own. Since you claimed you're still so young, don't tell me you don't have any other female friends to create some mini dramas and act as your uncertain elements in your relationship?</p>
              <p>Tell me why you deserves to get 100% from your girlfriend when you also don't 100% trust her and have faith in her? Don't forget you're doubting her in her and even to the extent of being calculative about your relationship towards her.</p>
              <p>What if she has already 100% to you already, but just that you think it's not the 100% that you are after? Then you cannot blame her because her 100% is different from your "é‚£ä¸ª" 100% lor.</p>
              <p>And there's nothing wrong if you want to look for another girl to replace her as your girlfriend. Just remember that you new girlfriend can also look for another guy to replace you as her new boyfriend because she thinks you haven't 100% to her yet.</p>
              <p>OK? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You should be happy that you have found someone good enough for you to accept her as your girlfriend. I also haven't found that someone who is good enough for me to accept him as my boyfriend lor.</p>

              <p>Okok, relac first. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="icon_mrgreen.gif"></p>
              <p>So... your indication of her not being totally devoted to u 100% is because she's not being able to cut off all ties with her ex bf is it?</p>
              <p>It seems unfair that you are not giving her the 100% trust too, 'cos you think she's like è—•æ–­ä¸�è¿ž with her ex? I don't know what you are worried about since you said that her ex has already cut off all contacts with her.</p>
              <p>And you said you'd rather have ur own freedom than wasting time in this kind of cocked-up relationship, so I'm wondering whether you are having a gf just on impulse or what. Which relationship is not cocked-up before? If you jitao anyhow break with your gf just because of that, it means you are not totally committed to her, right?</p>
              <p>Loving someone is not about calculating how much effort you have done compared to her's. Of course, she must be receptive to your efforts and do her part to keep this relationship alive.</p>
              <p>Maybe you can elaborate more on what she really did that's making you feel this uneasy?</p>

              <p>her past r/s got this ex bf hor, he that time just left her and never say a word.now although i know/and she say that she dun like him liao, she only want to be like normal frens la BUT the problem is that hor, the ex bf cut off all contacts with her</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">FYI, she say she dun like him, but does not mean she had completly wipe off her memories with him. Still want be normal friends, weired. You abit contridicting&gt; her ex bf cut off all contacts you not happy mea?</span></p>
              <p>so this is like some unfinished business la,i tell her that she needs to finish it soon, then she say, must wait for the right time all this shit</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">What business is there to finish?Leave then leave liao, still want them to meet up talk properly?Wait old feeling linger then you jia lat lor.</span></p>
              <p>sooooooooooooo, what the fuck have i been doing? doing all the shit, putting in so much effort, and now then find out that she haven 100% to me? smlj? wtf?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">I think you are jealous, its normal, who want a gf/bf that keep think of their ex.<br>So, buck up, move her wid your sincerity, gv her love, care &amp; concern.</span></p>
              <p>thats why i came to a conclusion, why must i waste so much of my time, effort and energy to this kind of cock up r/s, while i can have a ball of a time? i still so fucking young also</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Want to waste time or not depends on you.<br>1. Do you think she is the right one for you?<br>2. Do you want her as spare tire till maybe one day you find someone better?<br>3. Do you think having her as someone to cuddle at some point in time when you lonely?<br>4. Now you go play, do you think you can also so fast get a gf?</span></p>
              <p>andddddd heres the fun part, need advices from u sensible bros and siss'<br>should i just hold on and wait for something uncertain, or jitao break liao?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">My ans is imo of what i will do.<br>Getting a new gf is not easy, furthermore some females are just too materlistic, see you have this then be with you, and you have to start all over again, waste time right? </span></p>
              <p>if hold on, why? and what should i do?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hold on may mean she meant something to you, thus then you will stress &amp; come forum to seek options. I believeeeeee she's already somehow inside your heart. Let me put it this way, no-one is perfect, she is willing to be with you then go on, till the day when s*it happen. You try your best to make her 4get her ex, You make it a point to give her memories of your own.</span></p>
              <p>if break, why? and what should i do?</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Break is cos you cannot control your emotions (i think&gt; i may be wrong).<br>Why to break up is because you buay tahan the fact that she's somehow never wash off her ex momories&gt; this need times lah..(Dun tel me you can 4get your ex? if she some super pretty female, sure got some good memories de.)</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">You can also test test her by saying how she hurt you by thinking of her ex..the cock &amp; bull story, see her reaction, got remose or not..<br><br>Last but not least. Guys have to be a PLAYER, dun be a SUCKER.<br>In a r/s, you can sacrifise all, give all BUT you MUST always control your own heart &amp; brain. Dun get caught in the web of love, it will benifit you in time to come, unless you are very sure of that pariticular female that is willing to spect her rest of her life with you till she die. è¦�æ‹¿å¾—èµ·ï¼Œæ”¾å¾—ä¸‹. äº‹ä¸šè¦�ç´§ï¼Œæœ‰é’±ä½ æ€•æ²¡å¥³äººä¸«ï¼�ï¼�I dunno your age now, but when you come into the socity, you will hv a different mindset as you mature down the road of this pratical world. then you wil understand what my chinese words means.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Of cos i dun mean all female like money, some will provide it to you. When you come late 20s to early 30s, you see the females auto come de..Reason is cos many females somehow have a thinking / influnence of getting married, wearing the gown etc...She wan to look pretty on her big day.. so..if you understand what i mean.</span></p>

              <p>You think you too young to stick to one.. everyone can understand de.</p>
              <p>It's OK to go with many different girls in short relationships while you are still young.</p>
              <p>Sample what life has to offer first before you find one to give your life time commitment.</p>
              <p>Many guys make moronic mistake.. commit liao then want to sample life. </p>

              <p>so be fair enough, give her time.but i dont suggest her to re-connect with ex boyfriend.its just plain stupid.if he would want to be her friend, long ago from the very start right after break up, they would agreed.why now?tell her dont waste her time on her ex, and waste it more on our giga boy.</p>

              <p><br>Maybe she want to test you lor....see whether you kan chiong or not?</p>
              <p>Perhaps she felt that you have been a little indifference to her, sometimes nice...sometimes don't really care. She needs you to be kan chiong for her and be nice to her for anything regarding her...she needs your attention, care and concern...genuine concern!!! and not half-hearted concern which she can get it from any cats and dogs friends.</p>
              <p>I understand that guys need to act cool and need their girlfriends to think of them as cool. But why not figure out when you should act cool and when you shouldn't act cold?</p>
              <p>You shouldn't act cool when it's something concerning her or people related to her. You can act cool when it's something not involving her or related to her.</p>
              <p>For example, in front of her parents, friends....you don't act cool but behaved like the boyfriend who doesn't mind about displaying obedient love, care and concern to her. And in front of your parents, relatives, friends, colleagues...you can go act cool for all you want and bragged until the cow comes home and sleep also can.</p>
              <p>If you insists on acting cool in front of people concerning you and also concerning her, then you are just acting too COLD towards her. At least I'm sure that's what she would feel!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If your girlfriend desired the Moon, you would get it for her if you can right? So now she only desire to be friend again with her ex-bf, why don't you show her that you can become the One and Only Gracious Boyfriend who doesn't mind and yet is supportive enough to fulfill her One Wish?</p>
              <p>Really, if your girlfriend had any unfulfilled desire with her ex-bf, then there's nothing you can do about it also. And it's also partly your fault cos you did not quench all her unfulfilled hunger until she had to do something about it on her own will.</p>
              <p>Do what you can do within your own duty as her boyfriend. And ask yourself, have you really done what you should be doing as her boyfriend? OR Are you holding back many things because you cannot bring yourself to express due to your pride and ego?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Think about what you will feel if she really leaves you and your life without her. Then you can tell me how your pride and ego is going to help you feel better and replace her missing presence.</p>
              <p>Treasure people as much as you can, especially if it's people around you and even more especially if it's people you LOVE!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>I think the problem really lies with you.</p>
              <p>You are immensely INSECURE.</p>
              <p>Is there a reason why you feel this way ?</p>
              <p>Did you cheat on her before ?</p>
              <p>Did you steal her from someone else with underhanded methods, thus you fear she finds out the truth about you ?</p>
              <p>Do you feel like you don't belong in this relationship ? Perhaps you feel you and her are really not meant to be together ??</p>
              <p>If you cannot be honest with yourself.. you will constantly live in this fear and no one can help you.</p>
