Don't be too attached. Have some space. Love is about respect and giving space to each other. Don't be too clingy. If you two ever want to settle for a long-term commitment, there's no reason to keep seeing everyday. See bit by bit, it's good for the r/s.<br><br>It is true he does not need you and so does you. All because you are insecure. You need to get a grip on yourself first.</div>

You can only hear good things meh? Then you are not ready for a lot of things especially in married life.<br><br>That's why you are not rational. Any advice will be thrown aside except those you think is going to "help" and you think that by doing "all those prove", you will feel more assured about your R/S.  But all the prove in the world is nothing if there is just that little doubt in your mind eating away at your heart.  You will always "torture" him with endless questions that's why he thinks you are xiao mei mei.  Actually you are too young for him.<br></div>
