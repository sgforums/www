You caused ur own miseries due to your own insecurities. Remember what ShuQi said in "Po Lo Zun"?<br><br>"An Quan Gan Shi Zi Ji Gei Zi Ji De" Only you can provide security to yourself.<br><br>It seems like you sentenced him based on what he used to do...<br><br>Ask yourself this question: If you don't know he has a messy past sexual life, will you even have a tiny doubt in him, based on how he is treating you right now? Or is it that if he is a virgin when he meet you means that he will not fark around in future? Come on girl,, grow up.... What's past is already the past, so why make yourself troubled on things that cannot be changed. Treasure the present and don't worry about the future. Because nobody knows what will happened tomorrow. We don't even know what will happen tomorrow so why think about marriage???<br><br>But of course it's still good to weigh your relationship but not in this manner. Both of you got to move in the same direction in order to get married. And don't get married just because it's time or you need a flat etc. It must be because you are ready to commit to each other and bring the relationship to a next level.<br><br>Anyway, both of you are just boyfriends and girlfriends. So you think he is really obligated? To me, i don't think so. Maybe you should also slammed the breaks and take things nice and slow and enjoy the process of dating and enjoy this time when you are just ready to see the world.<br><br>Trust me... you haven seen enough so why bother to tie yourself up so fast.<br><br></div>

Systems and settings... Let alone coming at it with a 'bat'... Whether you've 'flattened' her or not is another issue... The real deal is whether you could have possibly hurt or mislead her...?<br><br>Note that I'm not saying you're misleading her. In fact, I agree with you that most of us are likely to be very far from what the truth might hold at this point.. But no. That doesn't mean we cannot advise.. Discourage or give encouragement... (based on evidence we present to our course of belief)<br><br>I'm not saying she should follow us on 100% note... Just more opinions to open up her perceptions... And I think she herself already understood this too... She's 18 but not stupid. Based on some of her 'understandings', I can say though she might be confused... It doesn't mean she's not thinking at all... Even anyone WELL ABOVE 18 can be CONFUSED and NOT THINKING... By comparson, I would like to think she's doing not too bad...<br><br>SEEMINGLY as it may be... NOT ALL threads with this kinda 'format' comes with the "I already know what I wanna do, I just need people to support my case" mentality.... She's not even in a stable relationship with this guy yet... You think she really think so much 'support' to kick him out of her life... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>'Fallings' of the internet and taking advices from strangers...? And... Just what are 'strangers'...? It almost made me wanna laugh to think that you hear and listen from 'people you know' would means their advices would be more sound..? Better...? 'Fallings'...? Just what kinda 'belief' is this....?<br><br>I can agree with you that if she's going to take it with a man with such a form of 'history'... The road probably won't be that easy... But nope, that doesn't mean we can 'naturally guide' her into <strong>OUR OWN FORM of BELIEF(S)</strong>.....</div>
