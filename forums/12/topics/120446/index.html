            <div class='col-md body'>I just initated to break with my bf.  I sent him an sms for i wont be able to tell him my decision verbally. I find that our social life is different. He is one who used to frequent nightclubs and pubs.

Recently he has started to quit smoking and drinking so he stayed away from his friends but his friends always come and pester him to go to such places again. He even dared to tell me if his friends are willing to pay for the tips for the girls and the beer he dont mind going.<br><br>I mean if he's really determined to quit all these why reply that to his friends, there is a possiblilty that his friends will really pay for those and does it mean he can do such acts behind my back. When we are outside and he sees a beautiful girl, he will keep looking at that direction even if i was talking to him. He said it will be a fool to not look at beautiful girls.<br><br>Now while still in the process of quitting smoking and drinking his friends all blame me. They questioned him as in "why are you quitting all the smoking and drinking just for a girl? She's not pretty, no figure, bad temper, is it worth it?" Though he told them its not because of me but his friends still blame me.<br><br>Am i doing the right thing to break off with him? Though i should be supporting him in quitting smoking and drinking but i really feel very tired of all these guesses and his actions. I dont feel any security at all. To him, a relationship must have sex then there will love. This is even more unacceptable to me, i asked him back is there really no love if there is no sex and he said yes.<br><br>From then on, i really lose faith and trust in this relationship, am now very sad.</div>

Never try being the woman who TRIES to change him; it's always better to be the woman when he has regreted much about himself/past and decide to exercise the change himself. (Especially if he is a Leo, Taurus, Aquarius or Scorpio).<br><br>Love can perform miracles in a person's character/habit/etc. I have seen it personally. However, question is: <strong>does he allow your love through to evolve himself</strong>?
