It didn't get any better over the past week, cold war between my dad and me.<br><br>Yesterday, my mom was scolded by my father over some matter. So, I stood up for my mom for i know she wasn't in the wrong...my dad quickly blew up again.. this time he was even worst..he told me to be careful for he is very hot tempered and could injure or even kill someone in the family. I told him that i will call the police for those threatens.. he told me to go ahead.<br><br>my family now is in the mid of crisis.. i don't  know what i should do. My dad is a very hot headed person. i'm afraid that if another quarrel is started, things might get out of hand.<br><br>Should I call the police?<br></div></blockquote>I don't know the context of your arguments and I still don't know who is right or wrong based on your account. I don't know how old you are either. I don't even know if it is a regular habit of him to be abusive towards his family.<br><br>All I can do is give you advice .  Sometimes very nasty things can be said in the heat of the moment.<br><br>Next time , old man starts being unreasonable , just walk away from him or get your mom to walk away. No point in aggravating him. Just remove the stimulus and walk away . Both sides will calm down sooner or later . Avoid him and don't tempt fate.<br><br>Alternatively ,just let him vent away what he wants . At the end of the day, he might feel remorse for taking it out.<br><br>If he carries out his threats and attack someone, call the police. Domestic violence should never be condoned.</div>

From what I can see , it happened over reunion dinner and some other vague scenario. Things can be said in the heat of the moment.<br><br>Parents are known to be unreasonable. Mine has been unreasonable at times but if they see reason , they won't apologise as with our culture but try to make up in some way . Parents don't like to be seen as wrong .<br><br>I won't be jumping to conclusions on this one. However if his father chooses to strike someone , like his mother, physically down over a matter, then it will constitute an assault, and domestic violence.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BoomBa!:</div><div class="quote_body">hi guys.. sorry for the late reply.<br><br>Things between my dad and me have been rather cool. I greeted him as usual for the sake of my mom, i don't want her to get upset over this. Other then greeting him i haven't talked to him yet.<br><br>To clear some of your doubts.. here is one of the situations that happened few days back. Last friday, my family went to my cousin bday party. At the end of the party, our entire family wanted to take a photo. We stood two rows, girls in the front and guys at the back. But because the guyÂ’s sides were more the photographer asked one to move down.  My uncle stepped front, standing beside my mom. He then put his arms around my mom's shoulder. Right in front of my dadÂ’s and me eyes. My dad and i both was WTF.  And the photo was taken, it happened too quickly.<br><br>Now back at home... when i was watching kingdoms of heaven on DVD the most exciting part when orlando defended his castle against the persians. i heard my dad shouting... he said my mom had brought shame to this family. I was fumming when i heard that ! i confronted him and told him that it wasn't my mothers fault. blah blah blah<br>he said i was being rude and shouldn't interfere in adult conversations. for fuck sake i just turned 21 not long ago. He said i shouldn't question him for his my dad. I said i only wanted to protect my mom from insults like that. He said whatever it is the photo will bring shame to our family.<br><br>k thatÂ’s the story..<br><br></div></blockquote>You think you 21 very big arh. So means you 21 years old you can kpkb at your father mother; woah, can scold them can shout at them. Is it?<br><br>It is every right of your father's to get angry. Another man put his hand on his wife's shoulder. What you expect him to do?<br><br>You should have kept your bloody mouth shut instead of trying to act all big and mighty and thinking you have authority to challenge your father. All you did was to fan the flames, dammit.<br><br>I believe you should go apologise to your Dad. No matter what, he will not be angry at you forever; but as his son you have to make the first move. Don't keep your feelings bottled up and end up hating your own family member for life... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Your mom has been with your dad far longer than you have; if she cannot handle it, how'd you think she'd stuck through with him for over 21 years?<br><br>Also, it doesnt really matter if you shouted, screamed, flew into a rage, or grabbed a knife. What matters is that you became hostile towards your own father. That was enough to make him blow.<br><br>Just stay out of it next time lar...you are only 21, don't act as if you are the same age as your father. You didn't, still don't, and never will have the right to challenge him...</div>
