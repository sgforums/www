He was unreasonable in your eyes, but since we don't know what the conflict was about, I'd say... try putting yourself in your dad's shoes? No matter how much you disagree, just try to see things from his point of view and see if you can understand why he behaves in this way.<br><br>3. If you need help, you can try seeking a mediator instead of calling the police directly?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm, actually the police cannot do anything. If you quarrel, and call them, at most they can do is to stand outside and advise you not to make so much noise and not disturb the neighbours.<br><br>Cause your problem is a domestic argument. Police do not interfere in that. They only interfere when someone gets hurt.<br><br>He threatened, but do you have any proof? Police cannot do anything. At most you can do is to sue him.<br><br>But of cos, that will surely strain your family ties.<br><br>So NO POLICE!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Let's say you go to the police station and make a report to the police.<br><br>You know what they will do? NOTHING!<br><br>They will be wondering what kind of stupid son you are.<br><br>Your father shouts and scream at you and because this is the twentieth century you must scream back at him?<br><br>Who says? Who told you that?<br><br>Don't be a sumseng. You are obviously learning from your father and behaving in an equally stubborn way. You blame your father but you are becoming like him! You are behaving like him!<br><br>You know that he is unreasonable and I accept that he is unreasonable. Is it a very big deal? Even if it is a very big deal, you do not have to scream and shout back.<br><br>It is like pouring petrol to stop the fire.<br><br>If he is unreasonable, when everyone is calm and cool, then talk to him. If you cannot talk to him, ask your mother to talk to him.<br><br>I assume he is still sleeping in the same bed as your mother.<br><br>Encourage your mother to talk to him about his unreasonable behavior when he is calm and "sane".<br><br>You cannot help it and you must scream back at him when ever he is unreasonable because it is the twentieth century? Then don't blame your father. You are the one that cannot control yourself.</div>
