Based on his recent display of possible 'attention seeking' and revoking possibility... There might be a chance that he might just try to 'leap' further before before... I would agree with your suspicion that he's probably habouring some hidden love feelings for you for the past years... Maybe he tried to keep them in store, or maybe the lost of this 'contact' had somehow triggered him off...<br><br>The issue is not to treat him too special, as he is obviously not to you... Most importantly, don't let him feel that way.... You could give him your HP no. if you want (subjected to slight risk I've mentioned above), but try to keep the whole situation PLAIN MILD if you're doing that...? And if you don't? Hopefully he won't go 'attention seeking' again?</div>
