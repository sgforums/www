            <div class='col-md body'>Okie. I have a problem here..<br><br>I have this guy friend whom I have known for ard 6 years.<br><br>The frenship started when he wanted to know more abt me through my best friend on a christmas nite. His intention was very clear at that time, he had a crush on me and wish to further the r/s.<br><br>Things never really work out and everything was made clear by me.<br>So, we become normal friends like everyone else, but he also ever mentioned abt still having a liking for me after all these years which I didn't really care n bother abt it<br><br>Recently I changed my hp no. but I have lost all the no. in my contact including his. and these few nitez he has been calling my hse to look for me, just right I'm out of my hse and he does not have my current no.<br><br>My mum was kinda frustrated and actually tried to ask me avoid this guy cos she felt that he is kinda "threatening" to my present r/s as his intention is rather obvious after sometimes of communicating n meeting this friend of mine. And yesh my bf did feel the same way like my mum do.<br><br>So now the thing is I tried calling him up to check y he is looking for me, and ever wish to inform him again abt my new contact no. But my mum keep reminding me of not giving my no to him.<br><br>Haiz. What should I do?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  Are they oversensitive? or am I not worrying what I should?</div>
