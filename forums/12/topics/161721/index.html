When my ex-gf left me due to my own foolishness and stupidity 9yrs ago, the pain of losing her and the fact that I've hurt her very deeply huants me.<br><br>For 9yrs I've been willing myself to forget her but I couldn't. But I would say this relationship did teach me a lot. I keep learning and learning (the hard way). Initially I did not understand why this failed relationship huants me so much. But after nine years, I finally understood.<br><br>Three years ago, I get to know my current gf (A) but I did not go after her then. We become soulmates for three years. She's the only one that I've been able to pour out all my woes to. Miraclly, about 4mths ago while I'm in Malaysia, it just seemed to me that it's time to let go of the past and the memories for I've learnt enough lesson from my mistake. I let go. Smile with pride and told S about it. And the best "graduation" gift given to me from God is my gf, a soulmate who has always been around to support me. It's then I realised, perhaps for the past nine years, god has already been preparing to give me this gift but in order for me to be worth him giving me such wonderful gift I would need to learn how to love her and cherish her. The nine years course is indeed a hard and tormented ordeal but I'm glad I survive it.<br><br>Now..I'm proud to say I have the most wonderful gf and best gift from god. I ask for nothing more.<br><br>Bottomline, for everything that had happened and is happening, there's always a reason behind it. And for every rough road, there's always a surprise at the end of the road. Walk through it and you'll be well awarded.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>That's great : )  It's encouraging to have forumites post their sorrows, &amp; their ability to cope with, &amp; overcome the obstacles &amp; heartbreaks in life.  Well done!<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by laosu:</div><div class="quote_body">There's no way one can forget about someone especially the one you really love alot. When my ex-gf left me due to my own foolishness and stupidity 9yrs ago, the pain of losing her and the fact that I've hurt her very deeply huants me.<br><br>For 9yrs I've been willing myself to forget her but I couldn't. But I would say this relationship did teach me a lot. I keep learning and learning (the hard way). Initially I did not understand why this failed relationship huants me so much. But after nine years, I finally understood.<br><br>Three years ago, I get to know my current gf (A) but I did not go after her then. We become soulmates for three years. She's the only one that I've been able to pour out all my woes to. Miraclly, about 4mths ago while I'm in Malaysia, it just seemed to me that it's time to let go of the past and the memories for I've learnt enough lesson from my mistake. I let go. Smile with pride and told S about it. And the best "graduation" gift given to me from God is my gf, a soulmate who has always been around to support me. It's then I realised, perhaps for the past nine years, god has already been preparing to give me this gift but in order for me to be worth him giving me such wonderful gift I would need to learn how to love her and cherish her. The nine years course is indeed a hard and tormented ordeal but I'm glad I survive it.<br><br>Now..I'm proud to say I have the most wonderful gf and best gift from god. I ask for nothing more.<br><br>Bottomline, for everything that had happened and is happening, there's always a reason behind it. And for every rough road, there's always a surprise at the end of the road. Walk through it and you'll be well awarded.</div></blockquote></div>
