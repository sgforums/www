              <p>I thought of giving my liking of boys another chance but its all crap to me now. I've been hanging out with my friends, and she brings along her friends. And that guy who is my friends friend keeps on flirting with me and my friends. Kinda disgusting but i know he's fooling around but i caught him looking or should i said "scanning" at me often, im not bragging btw. Its putting me in an awkward position. Come on, i only wear long jeans dont tell me that type of COVERING clothes also turn u on?! I have to wear an eskimo suit if i have to but luckily thanks to singapore hot weather.</p>
              <p>Ok that aside, I went out with one of my friends who is a boy. He go these two free tickets so he asked me out. So i just did since we're just friends. But he's cool and started to like him. We went in the movies and sat closely. But as the movies goes on, he was tracing his hand all around my upper arm and before it reaches my armpit, i jerked away. His fingers was so cold so i jumped when he reaches my underarm. But what the hell was that all about? im not even his gf and he did that?</p>
              <p>I give him the stare after the movie, and he shrug and gave me the 'huh?' look. I quickly went home and i dont give a damn people watching us that day. I dont even dare to hold any guys hands nowadays.</p>
              <p>I wonder my hatred of guys really put me in a lesbian spot but i dont bother that much. At least they're much gentle than some despo loser boys. Please tell me girls, do u have this kind of experience? </p>

              <p><br>there are such things as "good" guys but it is either taken or married....fantasy build in them is nature..fantasy do build up on girls too when they see a hunk..even in les or gays..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>its just that how u see things..like what lonestar states, do not give up on them...u will marry a guy sooner or later unless u choose not to. but, if it makes u happy by choosing to be les, by all means...life is all about choices..</p>
