They are super tried inside after a hard day training. What they basically scare is that their GF outside feel lonely also and get to know other guy in the process and then dump them liao..No that I say you will lah, but this do happen around me. But don't worry lah...Thats only for BMT, mean the 1st 3 to 5 months. After that they will be post to unit. Just pray that your guy is posted to a unit that he had to work only 8 to 5 each day like the Airforce....<br><br>Wish you and your guy all the best.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Guys who got just posted to BMT will have lesser time to book out due to duty and training, even if they got to book out, they will feel very tired and would like to catch up their sleep. Most probably the only time you will have spending with him is the period after POP where he will have some kind of block leave before his posting.<br>After that, he will be posted to some vocation training where the cycle begins. He will burnt his weekends training and exercise. By the time he got use to army life, he will want to spend more time with his buddies and campmates. You might not be the top priority in his life then.<br>Of course he will feel insecure, hearing all kinds of heart breaking stories in camp, afraid that you might break up with him.<br>And as for you, you will face a new life in your studies or work where you got to know more people. Yes! More matured people, who can shower you with the time and company you need.<br>But then it all depends on how much you love him, in relationship its always give and take. If you treasure him, then stay behind him and give him the support he needs for the 2.5 years.<br>If your ever survived this stage of llife, most probably both of you will end up together forever...<br>There are cases where couples stay together during and after NS, don't let what you hear affects you, its what your heart feels that counts.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>Juz my thoughts  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Most probably the only time you will have spending with him is the period after POP where he will have some kind of block leave before his posting.<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">After that, he will be posted to some vocation training where the cycle begins. He will burnt his weekends training and exercise. By the time he got use to army life, he will want to spend more time with his buddies and campmates. You might not be the top priority in his life then.</span>Of course he will feel insecure, hearing all kinds of heart breaking stories in camp, afraid that you might break up with him.<br>And as for you, you will face a new life in your studies or work where you got to know more people. Yes! More matured people, who can shower you with the time and company you need.<br>But then it all depends on how much you love him, in relationship its always give and take. If you treasure him, then stay behind him and give him the support he needs for the 2.5 years.<br>If your ever survived this stage of llife, most probably both of you will end up together forever...<br>There are cases where couples stay together during and after NS, don't let what you hear affects you, its what your heart feels that counts.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br>Juz my thoughts  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>How come he will prefer spending time wif frens n campmates dan his own gf? I mean, his own gf only have so little time to meet him yet he don wan? Abit the wat rite.....</div>

But don't worry lah...Thats only for BMT, mean the 1st 3 to 5 months. After that they will be post to unit.
