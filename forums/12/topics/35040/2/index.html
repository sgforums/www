            <div class='col-md body'>Going through NS is about transforming a boy to a man.<br>During this transformation, don't think any women will ever understand what men go through unless women are in NS doing the same things.<br><br>Men can tell you about their IPPT results, SOC results and their field camps in Tekong but how much can the gals talk in these topics... Maybe the men have the mentality of "Even if I tell you, don't think you will understand also..." So what then should they talk about? The poor guy doesn't know what is the latest show or the latest trend... He will find tiring to find the common topics they used to have to communicate... Moreover they have to split their precious book out time among family, galfriend and friends.<br><br>The poor gal will feel very neglected cos her boyfriend change to a total stranger who doesn't spend enough time with her. She would wonder the cause of the communication breakdown.<br><br>To guys going to NS or serving NS now -&gt; Trust in her, show some effort and don't neglect her<br><br>To gals whose guys going in or serving now -&gt; Go through this difficult time with him, he will need your support. Give him some freedom during his early stage in NS, after about a year he will sure change for the better, but if he doesn't, please go ahead and think twice.<br><br>What I am trying to say is that a lot of things will happen during this time which are not within the control of both of you. Treasure each other, think of how tough it was for your to be together.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Feel so really bad spoiling her CNY. It wasn't easy also for the new few months as that time there isn't anything as handphone, we got to queue up to make public phone calls for only 3mins. Really treasure those moments even if its only 3mins. We often meet up in tears during weekends. Things change slightly better after a year or so, spend most of my nights off with her. Well, she told me before that during my NS it was really tough for her, having to cope with my "NS atitude" yet can't vent her frustration... was really glad that she was there for me then  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
