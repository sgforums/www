            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Aunt Agony,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; I have a problem that I hope you can solve. Three years ago, I met a guy,<br>&gt; &gt; A, for whom I completely fell head over heels.  We started going together<br>&gt; &gt; and soon became an item. Recently there has  been talk of marriage<br>&gt; &gt; between him and his parents. During the same time, a good friend of<br>&gt; &gt; mine, B, broke off with his girlfriend and sought consolation in me.<br>&gt; &gt; Being a good friend, I was always there for him and before I knew it,<br>&gt; &gt; started having feelings for him too. 'A' did of course not know this, with<br>&gt; &gt; whom I'm still going out. At the same time, for reasons I am not sure<br>&gt; &gt; of, I have decided not to tell B about A.<br>&gt; &gt; Not too long ago I met B's family and B's brother, C, took liking in me<br>&gt; &gt; and asked me to join him and his friends for an outing. Not wanting<br>&gt; &gt; to disappoint him, I obliged, not letting B know. At the outing, I met an<br>&gt; &gt; old friend, D, whom I haven't seen for a long time. He had been away in<br>&gt; &gt; Australia for the last five years. He had returned because his uncle<br>&gt; &gt; has just died. Even though he wasn't close to his uncle, he had left<br>&gt; &gt; him, an inheritance, a house in Sydney and also all his money in his Swiss<br>&gt; &gt; bank account. I understand that this amount is more than enough for<br>&gt; &gt; him to live very comfortably for the rest of his life. Whilst we were<br>&gt; &gt; talking, D confided in me that he has always been attracted to me. He<br>&gt; &gt; told me that he is still unattached. He also told me that he had<br>&gt; &gt; planned to contact me, disclose his true feelings to me if I'm still<br>&gt;single<br>&gt; &gt; and had hoped that by some chance I may even consider going to Sydney<br>&gt; &gt; with him. He felt that the fact of us meeting so coincidentally was<br>&gt; &gt; due to some kind of fate. Now, you can see the fix I'm in. My question,<br>&gt; &gt; of course, is -<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Because of the SARS virus<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Should I fly QANTAS or SIA to Sydney?<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Deep Regards<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Confused Girl<br></div>
