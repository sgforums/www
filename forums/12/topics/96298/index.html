It's over." Then, shift your attention to something else immediately. Eg. work, friends, tv, food, movies.. shopping etc. Practise this constantly.<br><br>one reason you find letting go hard, may be cuz of the persistent hope that you could have done better should u be given another chance to be with him.. or deep inside your consciousness, you don't think or accept d fact that the r/s is over.<br><br>But, face the fact &amp; the truth.<br><br>when he said he doesn't feel for u anymore, it means just that. believe him. there's nothing else u can add to it.  no "what ifs, but.. perhaps.." yah? Let your heart goes into peace and cease trying.<br><br>it takes alot of courage to step out of the cell. i'm not fully there yet but every step taken has been very liberating and do believe that you're actually stronger and braver than what u imagine.<br><br>don't give up.<br><br></div>

There are many advices in the above post which you consider doing.. Which is a very good way to relieve and forget abt the past.. Memories are sure bound to be around.. Esp if that person had laid a deep mark in your heart.. Healing for you will take a long time.. No point look for another guy as a substitude.. As this way it will hurt you and the guy more if he finds that he is a substitude..<br><br>Go for a short trip overseas if possible.. Hang out with ur classmates.. Go do some sports to get urself healthy.. In Sg, there is not much places where you can go to forget things.. as here is a small country.. nevertheless, you still can forget abt things if you want.. Its all up there..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Vonderful, you are definitely not sounding silly in here...everybody want to be happier. The reason why you are feeling miserable is because you are trying to control your own emotions. If you feel the need to cry, go ahead and cry. If you feel the need to be alone and spend some quiet moment by yourself to adjust your own emotions, go ahead and do it. If you feel restless, go catch a comedy drama/movie or read some comic strips to cheer yourself up. You know what you want and what will make you happy, so go ahead and do it to cheer yourself up. There is absolutely nobody who will be able to sense your unhappiness and make efforts to cheer you up, you will have to cheer yourself up.<br><br>Instead of seeking ways to run from your sadness, face it head on. Admit and accept the fact that this unhappy event has occurred in your life. You will only be emotionally stronger once you have passed this unhappy stage in your life. And the only way to do it is to accept your sadness and digest it in your own stride...that is to surrender yourself to your own emotions.<br><br>There may be even a period of time where you don't even wish to go out with your friends but you do not want to be alone. If that occurs, you can always go online to sgForums.com and start crapping away in the forums or shoutbox.<br><br>Hmm...crying does helps a lot...and it always helps. And I'm sure you will start to feel better once you have cried. Nobody is perfect in this world and I am sure that there will be a better person who is waiting to treasure and love you more than the person who hurted you. Adopting a Religion will helps too...if you have a religion, go ahead and turn to your religion for finding peace to your heart.<br><br>Life is too short to dwell in sadness, so don't waste your life. Think positively whenever you can, and do not analysed too much on other people's behaviour and reactions. Do what you can to make yourself happy and not at the expense of other people's unhappiness.<br><br>Good luck, and feel better soon. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

Where physically his yours.. but mentally.. and emotionally.. his not yours.. You chose to let go.. that's becos you know that you wont give him or yourself any happiness by forcing to be together..  If both realyl aint meant to be together as a couple.. Why not try to be as friends?? You could be a good pair..<br><br>You have tried many ways trying to forget him.. But then again.. you have not.. You did not really put him real aside.. that's why you are feeling lonely.. and feels that no matter how mcuh you laughed.. how much you put up a brave front in front of everyone.. you are still suffocating.. Ask yourself.. have you really let him go??? or still pining hope that he will come back?? He might be the one you loved most.. but you might not be the one he loved most! How perfect can a man be?? Behind every laughter lies the pain.. Why not think this way.. at least at that point of laughing.. you ain't thinking of him at all.. And for that moment.. you have put him totally aside..<br><br>Friends.. and your family.. will support you always.. but most importantly.. that you have to really face the reality.. that he AINT coming back to you AGAIN!! This is the fact.. no matter how hurt or in pai.. you still have to over come this.. People always say i can't forget him.. i cant do with out him.. bllah blah.. the more they say.. they actually forgotten him long ago.. The more you talked about this person.. the more you get used to talking.. and soon enough you realised.. that he's not that important to you anymore..<br><br>Many cases.. are like that.. everyone knows that.. time will really heal... it jus that will you allow it to heal?? Getting into a 2nd r/s wont help you much.. in fact you might sub consicously.. subsitute him.. for another.. would you wan to hurt someone.. to ease your pain?? You are not stable enough to go into any r/s now.. You feel that you are all alone in this world.. Your life not only circling around you and your mr.right.. there are people out there who care for you..<br><br>Before you met mr.right.. your life doens't evolve around him.. Why not go back to the times.. when he's not around.. You scared to tell your friends cos you afraid that they wont listen to your story again and again.. I'm sure there will be one.. who is willing to listen and lend a helping hand.. Don't be afraid.. when you say it out.. you feel much better! Holding back everything yo yourself.. will mentally and physically kill you..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
