Actually I had a very huge crush for him for nearly 2 years...but then I confessed to him back then and he said I was just a fren and sister, nothing more.<br><br>Then the morning after that "incident" he told me that there was once he actually liked me, but he thought it is just a short term crush, so he didn't tell me about it.<br><br>How can you do this to someone whom you think of as a sister?<br><br>And to think I was trying so hard to keep the frenship going, even after he rejected me.</div></blockquote>It actually happened to me before to me and my "sis".<br>At first, I had a crush on her and treated her very well. I didn't really confess to her but she told me that she treated me as a brother..<br>It was after some time, maybe a year or two, we were quite close to each other. She started to be abit touchy..??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  As in hugging me everytime she see me, and would just rest her head on my shoulder or lap whenever we went for KTV. People would have mistaken us for a couple at 1st look.<br>And she would told everyone that I'm her half-time boyfriend because I would always accompany her for shopping and carry bags for her..<br>And once, I felt kinda weird when she just hold my hand... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br>Till one day, as usual, she was resting her head on my shoulder and asked me if I ever liked her at all in the past..  She knew that I'm interested in her close friend for a long time. I'm quite surprised by her reaction when I said that I only treat her as a sister all along. She just went off and refused to talk to me for quite some time..<br></div>
