CRAP!<br><br>i mean she knows we aint rich yet she still buys all these crap. so i told her, since u have the money might as well u give me yr credit card or give me extra 2k for my trip ? so tht i can live like a king there ?<br><br>for more than 4yrs i dun dare to change a pencil bag and a sch bag because i was afraid of being scolded as a spendthrift and also recalled how my sis was scolded when she bought a bag.<br><br>i mean i spend much less and save more than my mum does. yet she always nag at me to save up save up etc.<br><br>honestly i feel unfair,why does she get away with spending crap so often yet when i spend extra a little i get scolded ?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>like this i might as well take her credit card and buy a nikon DSLR for myself ? and a stockpile of leica lens ?
