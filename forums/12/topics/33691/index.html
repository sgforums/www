You don't see people marrying their first love and live with them till their passed away in these days don't you? Except for the expectional few. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>How to detect a selfish lover - here is an insight. People who TELLS you to wait for them are selfish lovers regardless of reasons. Because they want to make sure even when the venture forth into the unknown and fall back, there will be somebody to fall back on OR the feeling of people liking them is like a booster to their ego/morals/etc.<br><br>If you truthly love a person and if circumstances comes and you have to let go - you will let go and allow him/her to go. Even you heart bleeds inside - you will smile and wave goodbye. Some people think that its virtually impossible for them to do something like that, think about this - if others can do that, so can you. There is no such thing as 'Love her/him until too much until cannot let go' <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>You have learned a lesson - which is a very good thing. Next time, learn to open your eyes and look into a woman instead of just on the surface. Love is blind - you can't really trust your heart, therefore learn to use your eyes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Revenge on her - what's the use? In the end, let me tell you - even if you achieve what you want to achieve, you wouldn't be laughing and saying that you are very happy with your doing, instead you wouldn't feel good either if you succeed and worst if you don't. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>What happened in the past mustn't repeat again - if you know she is a b i t c h, then forget trying to reconcil. Remember: character don't change overnight, since when you are with her you can't change her, then when she is not with you - the MORE she wouldn't change. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
