My closest female friend in fact.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  But i'm not that sad, just a ok got rejected feeling, maybe cause i expected this le. I've hidden the fact that i like her and she alway got hint me that we're only friends but i decided to be honest. Called her on the phone and told her and she rejected me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  Maybe that is a good thing that she's honest and now I can stop thinking so much <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Studying to forget about this, since exam coming le... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>But i'm worry that our friendship will not be like b4. How should I handle this now? How to face her? How to make this less awkard? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Gals, will you still be good friends with guys you reject?<br><br>Hope my experience will not discourage anyone here from being honest about your feelings <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </div></blockquote>Honestly, u were too idealistic. U failed to respect the ladder theory. Go find out about it.<br><br>If you are still new to r/s, start learning. It's ok to fail, i made the same mistakes before.. we all did. But it's very simple.. when u first meet a new girl, quickly think how u gonna treat this girl.. whether u like her only as frens, or something more.. Coz once u go down 1 path, it's hard to swtich to another down the road.<br><br>Ur problem is u've been to friendly with her for too long. Too buddy. 1 yr man. Her view of u is already cast in stone. Telling her u like actually disrupts the social interaction betw u 2, that's why u 2 are awkward now. It's normal. Be prepared that u might even lose her as a buddy already. But it's ok, just learn from ur mistake.<br><br>If u are in a situation where u meet a girl n u are not too sure how u want to treat her.. then distance urself for time being.. be cordial but not too friendly n buddy with her. Very important.<br><br>But at the end of the day, if u feel u must tell her.. then tell her. For regret is an even more painful feeling.<br><br>So take heart.. no prob. Give her some time n space.. then come back as frens n see how.. in mean time.. there's the entire freaking forest outside for u to start again <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
