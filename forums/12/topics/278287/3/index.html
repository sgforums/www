But now after quite a while, the girl who rejected me talks to me again but we are just friends now. Exchange a bit of concern here and there so as to maintain the friendship.<br><br>Therefore, friendship doesn't really ends upon confession. It really ends upon your reluctance to continue the friendship.</div>
