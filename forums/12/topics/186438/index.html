Theres always something new to learn, a new skill to pick up, something new to experience. And if that doesnt push your buttons, i say just live a hedonistic lifestyle. It is your own life, just do things that make you happy. I'm reading Veronika Decides to Die by Paulo Coelho, and theres a line that goes something like "the more we have and the more we can achieve, the unhappier we realise ourselves to be." Dont focus on the huge aspects of life, zone in on the smaller things. Like how happy chocolate can make you feel when you're craving for it, or how wonderful the air smells after a heavy rain.<br><br>Sometimes i think that people think too much for their own good. i look at my dog, after a good belly rub and a small treat, she's happy as hell.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Â“Why was I born into this world?Â” is a question which everyone asks themselves at least once in their life. I believe that having a deep sense of purpose Â– knowing in the depths of oneÂ’s being what one was born for, is a great source of happiness.<br><br>A successful entrepreneur once remarked that even among the worldÂ’s wealthiest people, those who lack a real sense of purpose in life often spend their final years in lonely solitude. Sometimes, having amassed great wealth &amp; realized all their worldly ambitions, he found that they were left with a sense of emptiness &amp; meaninglessness.<br><br>On the other hand, to be filled each day with a rewarding sense of exhilaration &amp; purpose, a sense of tasks accomplished &amp; deep fulfillment Â– people who feel this way are happy. Those who have this sense of satisfaction, even if they are extremely busy, are much happier than those who enjoy great ease &amp; leisure but feel empty inside.<br><br>A clear sense of purpose gives birth to courage &amp; wisdom. It enables you to look beyond the victory or defeat of the moment &amp; see things in their true perspective. It can fill each instant of life with joy, even in the midst of their circumstances.<br><br>Whatever their occupation Â– mother, company employee, artist, fisherman, or farmer, each person has their own path in life; a unique mission that only they can fulfill.<br><br>Discovering this purpose or mission is a lifelong task. It is not something that someone can tell you or that comes upon you all of a sudden. You, yourself, must find the reasons for living, the unique contribution that is yours &amp; yours alone to make.<br><br>Buddhism uses the example of flowering fruit trees Â– cherry, plum, pear, etc Â– to illustrate how each person has a unique mission in life. A cherry tree fulfils its purpose by blooming &amp; bearing fruit as a cherry tree. It never tries to be anything other than itself, it never imitates the blossoms of other flowering trees or wastes time being jealous of them. Rather, it patiently bears the frosts &amp; snows of winter, drawing energy from the earth itself, pushing its roots deeper into the soil. Then, with the arrival of spring, in a burst it unleashes all the life force that it had been storing up, sending forth countless blossoms.<br><br>Everyone has some kind of gift. Being talented does not mean just being a good musician, writer or athlete. There are many kinds of talent. You may be a great conversationalist, or make friends easily, or be able to put others at ease. Or you may have a gift for telling jokes, selling things or living economically. You may be punctual, patient, reliable, kind or optimistic. Or you may love taking on new challenges, be strongly committed to helping others, or have an ability to bring them joy. Without doubt, you possess your special jewel, your own unique talent<br><br>In the same way, each of us has a mission that only we can fulfil. That mission will not be found somewhere far away, in doing something special or extraordinary. Even those people who seem to have led great lives have really done what they felt they had to do in order to truly be themselves.<br><br>We realize our purpose in life by doing our very best where we are right at this moment, by thinking about what we can do to improve the lives of those right around us.<br><br>The life of Rosa Parks, an ordinary African American woman returning home after a hard dayÂ’s work in the tailoring section of a department store by bus one evening in December 1955. Although the bus driver ordered her to give up her seat to a white passenger, as the discriminatory laws of the times required, she refused. Her single word, Â“NoÂ” Â– the courage of this one ordinary woman Â– changed history, &amp; her ordinary day took an eternal significance. Rosa Parks was arrested for her resistance &amp;this set off an explosion of righteous anger among the African American population, largely because of the regard in which she was held Â– she was respected in her community as a cheerful, warm &amp; intelligent woman. A boycott of the bus service was organized, &amp; within a year segregated busing had been declared illegal throughout the United States.<br><br>Now in her eighties, Rosa Parks remains an untiring champion of civil rights, working especially to share hope &amp; a vision of the future with the young people she loves so dearly. Through her sense of conviction, this solitary individual became a leader who transformed the world. One moment of bravery opened the path of her mission in life.<br><br>You cannot discover &amp; realize your purpose in life with half-hearted efforts. To follow the dream in your heart &amp; fulfil your mission requires true courage. Not the courage of battlefield heroes, but a courage much closer to home. Most of us, before being defeated by a problem, are first defeated by ourselves. A weak-spirited or cowardly person, before hesitating at the wall of an obstacle, will shrink before his own shadow, frightened by his own imagination, &amp; will be ultimately undone by the coward in his own heart.<br><br>Courageous people are first masters of their own heart. That courage is the key to that opens the door to happiness.<br><br>To create value &amp; contribute to the world, what do you need? You need to develop &amp; polish your character until it shines. The ultimate strengths in life are not a clever tongue or wealth; nor fame or power. The real Â‘weaponÂ’ or Â‘toolÂ’ for living a successful life is what left over when all empty artifice has been stripped away Â– the quality of your character as an individual. And small, steady efforts to develop yourself are what will lead you to the greatest happiness in the end.<br><br>You will not find your mission by standing still. The way to find it is by challenging yourself in something Â– it does not matter what. Then by making consistent effort, the direction you should take will open up before you quite naturally, just as wide, new horizons open up before someone walking up a hill. Little by little you will come to understand your mission. That is why it is so important to have the courage to ask yourself what it is that you should really be doing now, at this very moment.<br><br>It is likewise important to set your sights high. The greater the tasks you choose to take on Â– one step at a time Â– the more rewarding &amp; joyful your life will be. If you decide to dedicate your life to a truly noble objective, such as the work of creating a peaceful world for future generations, then you will be able to savour a truly deep sense of satisfaction &amp; happiness.<br><br>A person with a strong sense of mission is a source of light. For such a person, there is no darkness in the world. And just as a single lighthouse can guide many ships through dangerous waters, a single person shining with the light of genuine happiness can help friends &amp; family Â– their entire society Â– find the smooth open waters of peace &amp; fulfillment.<br></div>
