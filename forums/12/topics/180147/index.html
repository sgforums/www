Let's face it: would you like her to be popular and then have love rivals? Consider yourself lucky and fortunate. Don't let this chance slip by.<br><br>I have experienced this before though. The best way is to get to know her well. Be her best friend. Don't try to express your feelings too fast. Take it slowly. Good luck!</div>
