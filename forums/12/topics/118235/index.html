If u are still confused about who you want to spend the rest of your life with, take some time to really think about it. Don't regret the decision later when you realise that the person you married to is not the person whom you really and truly love...<br><br>Remember this: Do not choose the person whom you think you can live with, but choose the person whom you think you cannot live without...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>you can't have the best of both worlds. if you are trapped in confusion, committing yourself to anyone now is a WRONG move.<br><br>exchanging vows is not a child's play. you know very clearly that you are in a dilemma now. why force yourself to make a decision then? give yourself more time. marriage is a lifetime committment and important decision. sure you can annul the marriage if you feel not right for each other in the later stage. but who wants to go thru the heartache and the broken vows?<br><br>think carefully before deciding for you do not want to hurt any parties involved.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>but one is your ex. if u tell ur hubby-to-be, what you expect him to do? that he doesn't mind your confusion or he's willing to wait till u are ready. unless you are still hoping for a makeup with your ex, i think one shd move on. it's not easy but it's at least a more rational decision <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

You don't necessarily have to tell him even if you still feel a bit for your ex... In fact, it's usually not advisable to do that...

(But anyway...)<br><br>Although, it's a difficult to judge as you didn't mention much about the relationship with your ex, however, it seemed to me that this marriage of yours that is taking place seemed a little hasty. I suppose you see marriage as a final destination and not another stepping stone to a final destination, if you are still holding doubts about your feelings, in the first place, you are not even on stable grounds to get married. Physically and mentally, maybe you are fine with it - emotionally? A question.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>You have already made your overall decision to be with your current bf - sever all former ties that will brew feelings. It's never needed if you have chosen the path you desire to walk. Never try hanging onto two side of your decision; you will only fall and injure yourself. Meaning, if maintaining friendship with him or whatsoever will only serve to retain your feelings for him - don't.<br><br>You have to protect your own relationship.<br><br>And if having to protect means certain sacrifice, you would if you desire to further greater good of your own love.<br><br>You need to settle this dilemma before you accept any form of proposal. You have your whole life to be in a marriage, but remember, you only have <strong>one chance</strong> to do your thinking, consideration and emotional-clear ups before you leap into the next phrase of love.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
