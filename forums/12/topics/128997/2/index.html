            <div class='col-md body'>i have some more possibilities to add... on top of the attached, not interested or busy.<br><br>1. low self-esteem - dare not go after you, feel too good for him even though he likes you.<br><br>2. dont get it - some guys dont sit down and think... 'why does she sms me?' or 'why is it we can talk hours and hours?' or 'how do i feel about her?' some people are slow.<br><br>3. past experience - had similar experience in the past, mistook that the girl was interested in him and doesnt want history repeating.<br><br>suggestion - during the talk about movies or something that both of you are interested in, suggest that you go catch a movie or coffee together. then on a one-to-one interaction, you may get to see the real him.<br><br>good luck! and be brave.<br><br>my hunch is that he is just shy.</div>
