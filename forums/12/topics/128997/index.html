            <div class='col-md body'>haiz maybe I will tell you a story first before I say anything.<br><br>Once there was a guy who is interested in a girl but he does not know her true feelings. So he try using sms  to find out more. Firstly he started to have sms chat with her. she replied back promptly but she never start sms first. This countinued for 2 months. Soon the guy turn desperate as he felt he was in love with her deeply. Next he started his move amd started sending love sms messages to her in order to hint the girl. First the girl got reply with cute sms back but soon stop. The guy was feeling werid as to why she stopped smsing him. Could she have finally understand what he meant and decided to stop in order not to give him the wrong idea?  Or she finally knows what he is saying and just shy about it? He felt his heart ache when he thought about this and after one week of sms silent he decided to ask her out alone for a date. He sms her asking her for a dinner then he waited for her to reply. The poor fool waited for 22 hours just hoping she will sms. Finally he decided to sent a cute sms to her. Strangly she reply that she is not free on that day. Sadly the guy wanted to cry but could not. After thinking about her so much that he decided to stop all this. Enough is enough, he said and started going out with his friends in order to stop thinking about her. 2 weeks, later another girl who is his good friend told him she loved him and decided he would try again, lucky for him it worked out for him.<br><br>What really happen to the first girl you asked?<br>This is her side of the story.<br>When the guy sms her, she just thought is just for chat, but as their chat progress, she begin to have feelings for the guy but she is not sure. So she waited. When she received the love sms she was so happy, she ask her friends wat to do and they told her to start slow so she smed cute sms back to him.
