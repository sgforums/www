            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by A.I:</div><div class="quote_body">Actually, I don't really understand few things. How do you define aggressive &amp; clingy women? Because though I like him and intend to court him, the only time I will get to communicate with him is when I need something from him for work or he contacts me on his own. And the duration of each of our contact point is sometimes 1-2 weeks to the extent of more than 2 months or above, due to the fact that both of us are busy with our work.<br><br>Other than that, I do not bother him at all because I know that he is tired from work. If I really do bother him, normally I will only leave little gifts that benefits him at the moment with a encouraging note. </div></blockquote>You are contradicting your own words. Earlier in my post I did mention you couldn't be possibly in love with a man without really knowing him personally and you reply you discover you 'love' him as time went by you discover the softer side of him. How can you possibly fell in love with someone when your contact with the person was so short and limited? Above you said the contact was sometimes 1-2 weeks to the extent of more than 2 months since both of you so busy at work. So, pray tell me how can you know him well? You don't love him. you thought you love him. You believe you love. You are only in fancy with him. And further more you said,<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by A.I:</div><div class="quote_body">However, though he said that, he makes the relationship between the 2 of us to be so weird that it's undefined. Like you dunno whether u should define us as working partners, friends or just nobody to each other.</div></blockquote>How weird can it be when he was just treating you as a business associate. Subconciously you knew very well there wouldn't be a chance of him wanting you as a gf but conciously you were in denial mode. Conciously you were still hoping there might be a glimmer of hope. It's okay to hope but when a man rejected you so outrightly and openly then no point even daydream of it. When a man said no they really mean no. So don't even attempt to be exceptionally nice to him for it would turn him even more off and thought of you nothing more than a nuisance and a harrassment. Furthermore you said you left him little gifts and encouraging notes. Why do that? To you, you just want to care but to him he would probably think you were still chasing him and he would take it negatively like you were crowding his personal space. Unless you do that to the other business associates I don't see you should do that for the time being.<br><br>I mean, frankly if I don't like a guy I don't even want to receive anything from him however insignificant that gift may be. Because by receiving even an insignificant gift from him I might inadvertently send out the wrong message to him like rekindling his hope in chasing me, which I don't want that. I wouldn't want to give him any possible reason to think otherwise.<br><br>You got what I mean? So, please move on. As I've said before when the right time come for you to meet your other half no matter how you want to avoid you wouldn't be able to do so for it is your fate. Think no more of him. Concentrate on your work go out with more friends even if they are females for you may never know through them you might meet your 'zhen ming tianzhi'</div>
