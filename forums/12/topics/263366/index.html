It's not as if you two were ever an item, bf/gf. And why would you still want to court someone who has very clearly but gently break it to you that he is not interested in you? Just continue on with life and go out with friends. Don't keep arrowing in on every guy as a potential bf. When your fate comes to meet your other half it will come. Let things happen naturally. Just go on with your daily life and continue to talk to him. You may feel a bit awkward at the moment due to you professing your intention to him and got rejected but as time goes things will eventually go back to normal.</div>

Majority males and they see u as friend/buddy ah.His bad habits can change overtime the way i see it.<br><br>Well, there is a chance that maybe he is willing to settle down.

I am older than my wife by 8 years. And you said his reason for rejecting you was you were too young for him age which, any average intelligent person will know the true meaning lying behind those words. HE DON'T WANT YOU. YOU ARE NOT SUITABLE FOR HIM. YOU ARE NOT HIS IDEAL DREAM WOMAN. Get it?<br><br>Now take it from a man standpoint of view. Men don't like to be pursued. Men like to do the pursuing. Men dislike clingy women. Again I repeat, men don't like aggressive women. Men like confident women.<br><br>You were very lucky he was such a thoughtful and diplomatic person and used the age difference as an excuse. It was a lame excuse but he knew it because he wanted to save your water face.<br><br>Move on and don't pursue on a one sided relationship. Be happy he is still treating you like normal and be happy he didn't go around telling others you propose to him (Seriously hope he didn't). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
