            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Asfi_Kay:<br><strong>Here's a repost of an article I wrote on the subject of "Life". Hope this helps to give at least some insight...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[b]How's Life?</span></strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">How's life</span>? A phrase that is used everyday, when you meet an old acquaintance or when you run out of questions to ask. Inquiring as to how people's lives are is commonly confined to people whom you are acquainted with. One doesn't simply go around asking people whom they do not know, "how's life?"<br><br>Life is peachy, life is c^@p, life's a b!@ch, life sucks, we've heard them all.<br><br>What is the meaning of life? According to <strong>Dictionary.com</strong>, life is "<span style="font-style: italic;">The property or quality that distinguishes living organisms from dead organisms and inanimate matter, manifested in functions such as metabolism, growth, reproduction, and response to stimuli or adaptation to the environment originating from within the organism</span>." Whatever that means. I myself cannot give an answer to all the queries pertaining to life. All I can offer is a broader perspective on the subject that has been debated and discussed over since the days of yore.<br><br>Our lives are run by our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wants</span> and our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">needs</span>. Our level of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">contentment</span>, our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">focus</span> in life and our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">perspective</span> are also main factors.<br><br><strong>Needs</strong>. We need food, shelter, clothing, all the basic necessities in life, but these basic necessities break down into complex groups and categories that intertwine with our <strong>wants</strong>.<br><br>For example, currently, for our needs, we require money, so we work. Now we have money, but we aren't satisfied, we want more. We want to eat good food everyday, settle in a lush home, wear fashionable clothing. So we work some more.<br><br>Enter <strong>focus</strong>. Some people focus on building their careers or making more money, others focus on their personal lives and family, yet others still will have, well, no focus at all. One thing for sure is that our point of focus will always be shifting from one thing to another. Why? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">To get what we want</span>.<br><br>But I have to ask, do we really <strong>need</strong> what we <strong>want</strong>? Can we live without most of the things we strived so hard for? This is where <strong>perspective</strong> and philosophy comes into play. One's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mindset</span> on life substantiates and sets the benchmark of one's level of contentment and satisfaction, which correlates with one's quality of life.<br><br>It doesn't really matter if the question of life is answered or not. What matters most is how we live it. If we live our lives without wants, will we be reduced to just another creature on the face of this earth? Sometimes, wanting is a good thing. It can broaden one's intellect and also bring out the best in us. But there are pro's, and there are con's. Excessive wanting can also be one's downfall. The lesson here? <strong>Moderation</strong>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Life is too short to focus on shortcomings, but it's long enough for us to fulfill our longings</span>.<br><br>Ever heard the adage, "Life is a journey, not a destination"? If some thought is to be given to this phrase, it does ring true. Everyday of our lives, we see new things and experience new sensations. Time doesn't stand still. It moves, and so do we. Since <strong>space = time</strong>, and <strong>distance = space</strong>, aren't we traveling everyday?<br><br>Life is not just a mere "<span style="font-style: italic;">thing</span>". Words don't seem to be able to even describe it. Can anything ever compare to it? Life is intangible. You cannot see it, you cannot hear it, you cannot touch it (all in the literal sense) but you still experience it, by living it.<br><br>Back to the question on the meaning of life. I still cannot provide an answer, but all I can say is this. Point your <strong>focu</strong>s on the things in life that really matters, put your <strong>wants</strong> and <strong>needs</strong> into proper perspective, and be <strong>contented</strong>. <span style="font-style: italic;">Your life won't have any meaning, unless you yourself give it some. </span><br><br>So, how's life?<br><br><span class="small">Copyright Â©2004 Asfi K </span><br><br>Just sharing my thoughts. people.

And THANKFULLY, they're STILL ALIVE to tell it...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><strong><br>Let mi describe a situation metaphorically:<br>- You have a job at present (You are alive).<br>- You worked so hard, frm morning to night (tolerating wif the ups and downs of life).<br>- At the end of the month (When u were expecting some comfort/rewards for all u gone thru),<br>- yr boss tells ya tt he has some cash flow difficulty, and can only pay the other staffs 1st (God/Providence/Fate doesn't recognise yr dillegence or sympathic towards yr pains, while showering yr peers with good fortune/luck/destiny).<br>- U are very understanding of your boss and willing to let him/her delay payment of yr salary. (U temporary bottle up all the unhappiness, and hope for a better 2molo.)<br>- U felt that maybe u haven't performed enuff, thus u work extra hard to prove yr worth. (U tried extra hard to curb all the negative feelings within u, being optimistic abt being able to get yr rewards eventually.)<br>- For the time being, u borrowed money frm yr relatives and friends to past the days. (U relied on yr tolerance and got yrself some hobbies to bring some comfort to yourselves.)<br>- Another month went by, and u got poorer. Yr boss said the same thingy again. (With days, yr patience and yr tolerance ran out. Looking for hobbies or optimistic reasons seems like deceiving yrselves. Self-pity built onto of yr misery.)<br>- Many more months went by, and u no longer trust yr boss. U lost the motivation to produce quality work, and u slack even more. (U have lost faith and hope of yr life, and u sink into self-degraduation. U drink yaself drunk. U smoke like a chimney. U can't b bothered wif ppl around u anymore.)<br>- Finally, yr boss wasn't happy abt yr performance and gave ya a sounding. U wasn't happy abt him nt keeping his promise and delay yr salary payments anyway. U quit. (When the world hates u for what u've become, u've become cynical. U felt tt u have every right be fallen since the whole world owns u. U sheer anger, u suicided.)</strong><br><br>I've been through EXTREMES TOO. But the FACT IS.. It's just NOT the truth... EVEN IF YOU BELIEVE that the <strong>WHOLE WORLD </strong>is AGAINST YOU... Or the <strong>WHOLE WORLD </strong>is FULL OF TOTALLY SELFISH people... When you're SOBER now and you simply THINK... HOW can that BE POSSIBLE at all...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><strong><br>This is my analysis of ppl who hates their life and wanted to suicide. Coincidently, i reflects mine too, juz tt it has nuthin to do wif boss or wad. My solution is: Dun waste emotional energy dwelling on yr pains. It will only multiply them. And dun put hope in anything. The wings of hope will only bring u high, and flung u down a few hundred thousands to your death. Instead, learn to like wad u do. Be enthruastic abt living and the good people around u. (If u dun have, find these ppl. I'm sure sgforums got a good number of this ppl in this section of the forum.

Indeed. We can all live as long as our physiological needs are fufilled. But the strange thingy abt human is tt their needs expands, one level high each time they are fufilled. When they are not fufilled, they feel incomplete. They feel a regret abt live. They feel... "since i'm nt complete (cos i can't get wad i want), living in pain is inhuman.

Instead, we shld be living each day of our life as if it's the last day. Whenever u make any decisions, tink abt if tt's really wad u want in life. If u intending to go into evilness, tink abt whether do u gain anything at the end of yr life, and are u willing to face the judgement of karma(, for Christians, would be GOD himself)?

I need to add an extra keyword: Adapt.<br>If u can, focus and find something meaningful abt life. If u can't, adapt... And hope that u might something else more interesting coming later. Eating chocolates everyday is a health hazards, so u might as well skip it for a few weeks and have an extra big chocolate steamboat on 1 day! hehe!
