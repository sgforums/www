I've considered switching to evil mood a million and one times, but eventually couldn't bare to hurt the innocents since i've been an innocent 1 myself.

It's no exageration that in sg, kids might possibly lose their childhood at the age of 3. Everyone will be born to learn and learn and learn and learn and learn and x 1000 or infinite. With knowledge, one can earn a place and big bucks in the society. With money, one can enjoy comfort &amp; extravagrants. Thus, ppl's are driven by their materialistic nature. Many ppl had complained abt the problematic education system, but nothing can be done abt that. Singapore... has nothing but human resources. If the human resources sux compared to e rest of the world, we all starving on a bare island.<br><br><blockquote>precisely. </blockquote>But so many ppl has suicided, so little was achieved.

            <div class='col-md body'>Up to this point.. I'm glad that you're not all that offensive and destructive. Otherwise it might be soon that I would have to 'abuse' my 'authority'?<br><br>Anyway... Just to let you know that I'm not all that keen in holding up this conversation and discussion with you... Not that I'm not interested... But due to my time constraint and the inappropriateness of discussing such a topic here, I really have limited options.. And I'm a MOD. I've got a JOB to do here. Besides... Laying people's lives down the hanging cliff because of my own personal interest ain't exactly my style... If given the TIME and may the discussion be hold somewhere more appropriate, I might just be AS INTERESTED as you are in the discussion...<br><br>And though I understand that you would be more tactful in your presentation of words (and I really don't doubt your capability of reaching that at all).. If a 3rd party is to come in and ABUSE the situation, everything could turn PRETTY UGLY <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>Hope you'll UNDERSTAND...<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by egotist:<br><strong><br>Of cos, nt only zen masters can control themselves.

Seen any medical treatments before? Some may be PAINFUL or even have LONG LASTING SIDE EFFECTS... But the SURVIVAL OPTION they PROVIDE... Can you UNDERSTAND?<br><br><strong><br>Dun ask mi for an answer rite here. I dun wanna any1 in e wrong frame of mind to try it. Though suicide doesn't seems to be the best way out for any prob, but at least it's a double edge sword, wif pros and cons worth debating abt.</strong><br><br>YES. I AGREE with this. One of the MAIN reasons I'm not discussing it here.. The PROs which are worth discussing about are OFTEN NOT applicable to the PROBLEMATIC SUICIDAL CASES we see or hear around us...<br><br><strong><br>My stand currently is nothing more than a devil advocates, else there's no fun in da debate! u dig? If necessary, juz taking it tt i'm airing thoughts for those who has objections abt not suiciding, though in reality, i'm neutral abt it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </strong><br><br>Like I've said...

As much as I would like to continue with this discussion and try to convince you, I don't wanna take ANY CHANCES. GET ME?<br><br><strong><br><br>My impression abt u tok philosophy comes frm here:<br>[quote]HAPPINESS and UNHAPPINESS. Neither happens ALL THE TIME at ALL THE MOMENTS. It's a BALANCE. NOTHING is CONSTANT. If you feel or find that it's happening that way... You're NOT seeing from a different perception but ONLY because you're RESTRICTED by YOUR OWN POINT OF VIEW... Not REALITY's FAULT... </strong></blockquote><br><br>Philosophy is only for the LOST. People who NEEDS to be CONVINCED of SURVIVAL. You see people breaching about RELIGIONS on the STREETS... Or asking others to BUY their PRODUCTS... But I don't it's normal that you'll see people pulling a NORMAL stranger on the streets and telling him the reasons why he should just keep himself ALIVE...?<br><br>Because a normal RIGHT FRAME person won't be exactly thinking of SUICIDE.<br><br>'Philosophy' or REASONS are only for THOSE who NEEDS to be CONVINCED.<br><br>And as FAR as we're OUT HERE in this FORUM. I would RATHER be CONCENTRATING on the METHODOLOGY than the PHILOSOPHY (whether we should save them? Whether they should die?) UNDERSTAND that ONCE they're DEAD, they're DEAD... No amount of words would BRING them BACK ALIVE...<br><br>'METHODOLOGY' 1st... KEEP THEM ALIVE... Then we shall talk about whether suicide really is a solution for them? Too bad there ain't exactly undeads in this world (at least not like those you've seen in the movies..).. Otherwise IMAGINE them 'WAKING UP' one day just to REALISE that they're ALREADY DEAD... No amount of REGRETS or REFLECTION is gonna be bringing them BACK...<br><br>Another reason I refrain from discussing such a thing here.. It can be QUITE MEANINGLESS... Because the situation would VARIES ALOT on a CASE to CASE BASIS...<br><br>And like I've said earlier... 'SICK' people might not be in the condition to think... Especially if they're already EMOTIONALLY STIRRED UP and MENTALLY DISTURBED... They'll NEED 'HELP'... NOT more STIR UPs...<br><br><strong><br>Then given yr view, prolly there's no such thing as unhappiness, since everything is a matter of perceptions? Thru tt perceptions defines and presumes alot of things, but it has its limitation too. Reality has a fault of it's own, in most cases.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> </strong><br><br>Yes. Unhappiness is about perceptions.. But that wasn't my point... My point is NOTHING is ALWAYS at a STATIC STATE in this world... Things CHANGES with TIME... You HAPPY, you LAUGH? You NOT happy then you GO JUMP? It's a way of DECEIVING YOURSELF...<br><br>IMAGINE yourself reading a BOOK or WATCHING a MOVIE... A couple going through all the SORROWS... If you are to decide to just CLOSE the BOOK and not read it anymore, OR WALK OUT of the CINEMA without seeing the ending of the show.. You'll NEVER KNOW what is it ALL ABOUT?

But i guess the question of "humane-ness" applies only to those wif critical medical problems or some others tt i dun remember at the moment. I assuming ppl commiting suicide cos of emotional problems, in the case of tis thread. It's only now tt i began to realise we were toking on a diff frequency. U were considering methodologies to survival, while i was analysing the reasons y ppl suicide, and whether each is worth it. -_- '|<br><br><blockquote>Like I've said...

After all, a thread like tis was posted. Surely u can't expect everyone to be posting an identical response, yah? Like i said, i'm juz a devil advocate. But in the end, no one is teaching everyone how to suicide anyway. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Try posting a thread abt Sadam Hussein.

If you're GOING THROUGH SH|T now. You just ENDS your life. Your life would be NOTHING but SH|T. WHERE's your PAY BACK?? It's like WORKING for a particular JOB... You WORK SO HARD...

You END UP GIVING ALOT but receiving NOTHING in RETURN... </blockquote>Let mi describe a situation metaphorically:<br>- You have a job at present (You are alive).<br>- You worked so hard, frm morning to night (tolerating wif the ups and downs of life).<br>- At the end of the month (When u were expecting some comfort/rewards for all u gone thru),<br>- yr boss tells ya tt he has some cash flow difficulty, and can only pay the other staffs 1st (God/Providence/Fate doesn't recognise yr dillegence or sympathic towards yr pains, while showering yr peers with good fortune/luck/destiny).<br>- U are very understanding of your boss and willing to let him/her delay payment of yr salary. (U temporary bottle up all the unhappiness, and hope for a better 2molo.)<br>- U felt that maybe u haven't performed enuff, thus u work extra hard to prove yr worth. (U tried extra hard to curb all the negative feelings within u, being optimistic abt being able to get yr rewards eventually.)<br>- For the time being, u borrowed money frm yr relatives and friends to past the days. (U relied on yr tolerance and got yrself some hobbies to bring some comfort to yourselves.)<br>- Another month went by, and u got poorer. Yr boss said the same thingy again. (With days, yr patience and yr tolerance ran out. Looking for hobbies or optimistic reasons seems like deceiving yrselves. Self-pity built onto of yr misery.)<br>- Many more months went by, and u no longer trust yr boss. U lost the motivation to produce quality work, and u slack even more. (U have lost faith and hope of yr life, and u sink into self-degraduation. U drink yaself drunk. U smoke like a chimney. U can't b bothered wif ppl around u anymore.)<br>- Finally, yr boss wasn't happy abt yr performance and gave ya a sounding. U wasn't happy abt him nt keeping his promise and delay yr salary payments anyway. U quit. (When the world hates u for what u've become, u've become cynical. U felt tt u have every right be fallen since the whole world owns u. U sheer anger, u suicided.)<br><br>This is my analysis of ppl who hates their life and wanted to suicide. Coincidently, i reflects mine too, juz tt it has nuthin to do wif boss or wad. My solution is: Dun waste emotional energy dwelling on yr pains. It will only multiply them. And dun put hope in anything. The wings of hope will only bring u high, and flung u down a few hundred thousands to your death. Instead, learn to like wad u do. Be enthruastic abt living and the good people around u. (If u dun have, find these ppl. I'm sure sgforums got a good number of this ppl in this section of the forum. Juz dun go to the bar room!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  )<br><br><blockquote>2.

But both works anyway, since it juz appeal to 2 different groups of ppl.<br>Agreed on the part abt: "And the DEEPER DOWN you are... Even the SLIGHTEST 'happiness' can seems SO BEAUTIFUL to you... ". Juz like pure chocolates, they taste better when they are also slightly bitter! Yummie!

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's a repost of an article I wrote on the subject of "Life". Hope this helps to give at least some insight...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>How's Life?</strong></span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">How's life</span>? A phrase that is used everyday, when you meet an old acquaintance or when you run out of questions to ask. Inquiring as to how people's lives are is commonly confined to people whom you are acquainted with. One doesn't simply go around asking people whom they do not know, "how's life?"<br><br>Life is peachy, life is c^@p, life's a b!@ch, life sucks, we've heard them all.<br><br>What is the meaning of life? According to <strong>Dictionary.com</strong>, life is "<span style="font-style: italic;">The property or quality that distinguishes living organisms from dead organisms and inanimate matter, manifested in functions such as metabolism, growth, reproduction, and response to stimuli or adaptation to the environment originating from within the organism</span>." Whatever that means. I myself cannot give an answer to all the queries pertaining to life. All I can offer is a broader perspective on the subject that has been debated and discussed over since the days of yore.<br><br>Our lives are run by our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">wants</span> and our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">needs</span>. Our level of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">contentment</span>, our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">focus</span> in life and our <span style="text-decoration: underline;">perspective</span> are also main factors.<br><br><strong>Needs</strong>. We need food, shelter, clothing, all the basic necessities in life, but these basic necessities break down into complex groups and categories that intertwine with our <strong>wants</strong>.<br><br>For example, currently, for our needs, we require money, so we work. Now we have money, but we aren't satisfied, we want more. We want to eat good food everyday, settle in a lush home, wear fashionable clothing. So we work some more.<br><br>Enter <strong>focus</strong>. Some people focus on building their careers or making more money, others focus on their personal lives and family, yet others still will have, well, no focus at all. One thing for sure is that our point of focus will always be shifting from one thing to another. Why? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">To get what we want</span>.<br><br>But I have to ask, do we really <strong>need</strong> what we <strong>want</strong>? Can we live without most of the things we strived so hard for? This is where <strong>perspective</strong> and philosophy comes into play. One's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mindset</span> on life substantiates and sets the benchmark of one's level of contentment and satisfaction, which correlates with one's quality of life.<br><br>It doesn't really matter if the question of life is answered or not. What matters most is how we live it. If we live our lives without wants, will we be reduced to just another creature on the face of this earth? Sometimes, wanting is a good thing. It can broaden one's intellect and also bring out the best in us. But there are pro's, and there are con's. Excessive wanting can also be one's downfall. The lesson here? <strong>Moderation</strong>. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Life is too short to focus on shortcomings, but it's long enough for us to fulfill our longings</span>.<br><br>Ever heard the adage, "Life is a journey, not a destination"? If some thought is to be given to this phrase, it does ring true. Everyday of our lives, we see new things and experience new sensations. Time doesn't stand still. It moves, and so do we. Since <strong>space = time</strong>, and <strong>distance = space</strong>, aren't we traveling everyday?<br><br>Life is not just a mere "<span style="font-style: italic;">thing</span>". Words don't seem to be able to even describe it. Can anything ever compare to it? Life is intangible. You cannot see it, you cannot hear it, you cannot touch it (all in the literal sense) but you still experience it, by living it.<br><br>Back to the question on the meaning of life. I still cannot provide an answer, but all I can say is this. Point your <strong>focu</strong>s on the things in life that really matters, put your <strong>wants</strong> and <strong>needs</strong> into proper perspective, and be <strong>contented</strong>. <span style="font-style: italic;">Your life won't have any meaning, unless you yourself give it some. </span><br><br>So, how's life?<br><br><span class="small">Copyright Â©2004 Asfi K </span><br><br>Just sharing my thoughts. people.
