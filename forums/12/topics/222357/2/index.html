Of course the less people know about it better ! One more person know about it is one more risk ! Look at how immature your thinking is, think your friend did the right thing to not let you know.<br><br>It is safer to play it safe then risk you spilling the beans on everyone if you get caught........<br><br>You say another friend say they got good result they copy - they all got answers ..... ? is it the truth ? this someone your friend also ? so if he so friend to say bad things about others how come he don't friend enough to tell you how to copy ? how come everyone know how to copy but you ?<br>Maybe you should think about it , maybe everyone is friend friend - all except you.  The problem is still you .<br><br></div>
