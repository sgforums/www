              <p>I have two friends, A and B, who like the same girl. She is very sweet, pretty and nice. But my two friends suddenly became loggerheads over her. The girl is a nice girl, she decided not to hang around both of them because she doesn't want to cause any disharmony but my two friends now cannot get along.</p>
              <p>B is currently in very bad state because his parents recently went thru a divorce. B likes the girl very much but he also want to save his friendship with A. But A is hurt and is not happy with B, A felt betrayed and offended. A does not want to forgive B. B feels very bad because he is now being rejected by the girl and lost his friendship to A, not to mention his family problems.</p>
              <p>That day when we bunch of friends went out to the mall to hang out, we can see that both A and B were challenging each other to talk to the girl. This caused a lot of disharmony among us.</p>
