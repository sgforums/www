There was this man who was injured in a car accident. His frontal lobe got slightly damaged, as a result, he lost the ability to love and to feel emotions. Nothing bothers him now, he feels very carefree. It seems like a wonderful ability to have.</div>

Must admit it was a bitter-sweet experience mainly bcos I knew it was one-sided. I couldnt eat much, felt so terrible and moody. I mustered up all my courage to express my feelings for her via email.. which, in retrospect, was the most insincere way of telling her how i felt.. haha. I got rejected by her and the world came crumbling down. To make matters worse, one of my good buddies went after her immediately and they were a couple within 2 weeks I got rejected. Thereafter, we all went out in a group and everytime i see them holding hands, behaving intimately, a thousand needles ram through my heart.<br><br>Oh well, survived that.<br><br>Many other rejections came along thereafter.. haha. Till this day, I never had a girlfriend. But I never saw the need to feel bad for myself. Least I learnt lots from rejections and really, its like a walk in the park for me.<br><br>So Pete, your stomach churning feelings are perfectly normal. But its whats coming up next, be it success or rejection, thats where the lesson comes in. So, learn to go with the flow. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Nevertheless, it was definitely stolen because there is an unfamiliar emptiness now where my heart use to be.<br><br>Again, I ask, is it a happy feeling when someone steals your heart? If yes, then why do I feel rather sad? Could it be because this person has stolen my heart but has not given me her heart in return? I mean it should be only fair that she let me steal her heartÂ…why does she need two hearts anyway. It would then be such a perfect ending - she having my heart and me having hers.<br><br>Actually, I just want to know whether this feeling I am having is consistant with someone having their heart stolen.<br><br>PS.
