Must admit it was a bitter-sweet experience mainly bcos I knew it was one-sided. I couldnt eat much, felt so terrible and moody. I mustered up all my courage to express my feelings for her via email.. which, in retrospect, was the most insincere way of telling her how i felt.. haha. I got rejected by her and the world came crumbling down. To make matters worse, one of my good buddies went after her immediately and they were a couple within 2 weeks I got rejected. Thereafter, we all went out in a group and everytime i see them holding hands, behaving intimately, a thousand needles ram through my heart.<br><br>Oh well, survived that.<br><br>Many other rejections came along thereafter.. haha. Till this day, I never had a girlfriend. But I never saw the need to feel bad for myself. Least I learnt lots from rejections and really, its like a walk in the park for me.<br><br>So Pete, your stomach churning feelings are perfectly normal. But its whats coming up next, be it success or rejection, thats where the lesson comes in.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi bro,<br><br>You never know how much that person means to you until she gone. I was very close this girl at work once and she is not local. I knew she liked me and even asked whether I had a girlfren. I wasn't very sure whether i had any special feelings towards her. Anyway i felt like being put on the spot, so being an idiot I said "yes" even though I don't have one. Is not that i don't like  her, just that i needed more time. We remain good frens until one day I heard that she will be going back home to further study. I confront her and she said it's true. She even asked me whether it's to soon to leave. To me her future is more important than some guy who couldn't even make up his mind, so I told her to pursue her studies. Later that week, I went to reservist and did not even got a chance to say goodbye and my true feelings. Until today, when I see couples walking on the on the street, I think that could have been us. Anyway all I can say is if you really like someone, tell her. She won't be waiting forever.</div>
