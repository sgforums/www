              <p>I have three points for the thread-starter to ponder over.</p>
              <p>1)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>I have to make myself very clear. Baby is a liability to me. If
                                      this baby is an asset that generates money, to me that is a total
                                      different thing. I see things only in terms of investments and
                                      returns. In babies, I'm not able to see any return on
                                      investment.</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Whether something is an investment a not depends on you. You might see it as a liability because you see it with a timeline of probably merely 20 years?</p>
              <p>But to others, babies give potential ROI after 20 years because they can help run your business, or they could run their business and able to provide for you when you are unable to walk, etc. Of course, this carries risks. But don't all investments carry risks?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) My businessman friend told me, if you know how to make money, why are you afraid of paying money?</p>
              <p>No point being a millionaire scrooge ;)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) She can help you make money if she stays. So what makes you think she will stay to help you if the baby is gone, especially if she suspects or knows it was you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One can still get very rich even with raising a family. The question is do you have the financial know-how?</p>

              <p>Right now, I'm already hit with this fucking baby monthly check up bills and waste of my time and yet I've to pretend that I've accepted the whole situation but well in fact, I'm praying even to satan if he can help me take the baby away by natural miscarriage. I can't pray to Jesus that's for sure. Jesus will probably fuck me up instead so in this case, I'll fuck Jesus first and be with the devil.</p>
              <p>Right now I'm pretending that I've accepted the baby so she is going one step further by asking if I'm able to give her mom money to help take care of the baby as well as building a nursery. ummm..I was like "Hey bitch, you're the one who wants that bastard so badly not me. You pay yourself and don't even think about touching my money. The baby can be thrown into the rubbish chute"</p>
              <p>Evil thoughts in me says "Umm... didn't your fucking friends encourage you to get pregnant intentionally? Why don't you go take the money from them now? I'm sure they will help. "</p>
              <p>If satan exists, please kill the baby before it's even born. The baby can be your slave for all I care. Seriously if the baby sees the light, when she is not around, I may even suffocate the baby to death with a pillow and pretend that the baby died of unknown reasons :-) NO REMORSE</p>

              <p>Ying Guo? You must be kidding right probably watching too much fairy tale movies bro. In reality, good people in this world almost always have a very sad and tragic ending while the evil thrives.

              <p>I have three points for the thread-starter to ponder over.</p>
              <p>1)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Whether something is an investment a not depends on you. You
              might see it as a liability because you see it with a timeline of
              probably merely 20 years?</p>
              <p>But to others, babies give potential ROI after 20 years because
              they can help run your business, or they could run their business
              and able to provide for you when you are unable to walk, etc. Of
              course, this carries risks. But don't all investments carry
              risks?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2) My businessman friend told me, if you know how to make money,
              why are you afraid of paying money?</p>
              <p>No point being a millionaire scrooge ;)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3) She can help you make money if she stays. So what makes you
              think she will stay to help you if the baby is gone, especially if
              she suspects or knows it was you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One can still get very rich even with raising a family. The
              question is do you have the financial know-how?</p>
