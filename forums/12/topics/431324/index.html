              <p>Hi guys, need some advise here regarding my girlfriend's prenancy. 
              Long story short, I've been staying in Taiwan for the past 6 years and 
              recently out of the blue, my gf of 5 years told me she is pregnant. She 
              is a Taiwanese and I'm a Singaporean. I wanted her to go for an abortion
               but she on the other hand is hell bent on having the baby.</p>
              <p>I've <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>no intention</strong></span> of getting married<strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">(No Marriage = No Divorce)</span> </strong>but the baby's birth cert will bear my name as the father.</p>
              <p>The question is</p>
              <p>1) How can I get the baby bonus from SG Government? What documents do I have to submit?</p>
              <p>2) How much is the baby bonus <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>in cash</strong></span> will I get?</p>
              <p>For
               your info, all along she loves baby like mad and always wanted to have 
              one without weighing the consequences. I on the other hand, never in my 
              life want to or plan to have kids. She has been on contraceptive pills 
              all along and recently I noticed that she has not been taking it on a 
              regular basis.</p>

              <p>Hi thanks for your input. As I mentioned earlier that <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>I've no intention of getting married</strong></span> because if there is a divorce, she is entitled get half of all my assets which I spent years of hardwork building it. I do not have the time or want to waste any unnecessary time on this thing besides building my business which is currently my top piority.</p>
              <p>Anyway if the baby bonus is not much, then I think I'll forgo it since it involves ROM cert.</p>
              <p>My next question is "How can I persuade her to go for an abortion or induce miscarriage"?</p>
              <p>From my point of view on this issue, baby is not considered an asset but a liablity. Not to factor in how much time (equivalent to money) will be wasted on this baby.</p>

              <p>your gf cannot claim ownership to your assets if you are not married.</p>
              <p>but your gf can claim maintenance fee from you due to a child once it is given birth to and your child can than claim ownership of your assets in future.</p>
              <p>if you want to avoid the possibility of her claiming your assets in future, get a lawyer, write a agreement stating that she has no intention of claiming your assets in anyway possible other than legal respondsibility such as fathering a child.</p>
              <p>Marriage is a legal loophole in Singapore still presenting for alimony is not recognized yet, except for overseas countries like in the States etc..but get yourself protected first even if it isn't recognized..</p>
              <p>at least you have some decent form of protection..include a clause inside which states that in the event should she in future wish to seek compenstation for whatever stupid reason, going against this alimony agreement, she fully understand and agree that she will forfeit any potential maintenance fee paid to her for the children..</p>
              <p>but thinking from the Taiwanese girl's perspective, the culture there is very different, they can get married as young as 16-18 years old and with both sides of parents support..it's a very loving family culture and upbringing there..as compared to the materialistic Singaporean culture la..</p>
              <p>nonetheless, if you say you are a businessman, if you can't even take responsibility for your own actions, want fun, don't take precautions, your business will be the same..what if one day you make it big, and your gf will spread the news of your irresonsible actions to media..than your business will also fail in a short period of time..due to your negative record..</p>
              <p>Real Life Example: 'Dr' Clement Chiang of Forex Trading..his business failed not because he has no skills (being frequently featured by Business Times as a regular expert speaker and article contributor), but rather on the basis of lack of integrity &gt;&gt; Dishonesty, lying about his PhD certification..</p>
              <p>Your failure to be accountable for your own actions will lead to your own downfall in future.</p>

              <p>Taiwan has one of the highest number of abortions per year. This will tell you much about Taiwanese girls. Some of them even has more than two abortions.  The Taiwanese girls can cohabit easily , have more than one boyfriend and more than one abortion.</p>
              <p>Unlike Singapore society whereby morals are still of higher standard and abortions are not common.  Marriage is sacred and girls are entitled to dowry and divorce alimony.  The Singaporean familes are usually much more united and closer than the Taiwan loose moral society.</p>

              <p>Eh why can't you marry her in Taiwan's legal system ? I don't think Taiwan divorce entitled the wife to half the assets of the man.   Why must marry in Singapore's terms leh?</p>

              <p>Am I the only one who seems to notice that he wants to induce miscarriage?</p>
              <p>You don't want anything to do with it, break up with her. Simple. Don't need to cause bodily harm (with future consequences) just to protect yourself.</p>
              <p>Disgusting too. That you even want to capitalize on this via baby bonus.</p>

              <p>Disgusting? Umm... Sorry I don't feel that way. I'll feel disgusted when this thing starts sucking time and money out from me.</p>
              <p>Since I don't see any capital gains or positive returns but 
              negative returns and liabilities in this situation, the next alternative
               is to get rid of the baby to avoid any future implications which may 
              arise. Even that means inducing miscarriage. I'm currently wasting my time with my doctor on a solution which is safe to get rid of the baby once and for all.</p>
              <p>In this relationship, I've never taken a walk on the wild side, 
              I'm being faithful to only one and so was she. All these years, I've 
              done my very best to prevent her from getting pregnant which is why 
              condoms, contraceptives, you name it. I'm being very responsible here 
              and she understands the fact that I hate babies to no words can fully 
              describe it, she went ahead to have one to satisfy her desire for 
              babies.</p>
              <p>She did mention about marriage years before this incident 
              and I'll never agreed to it besides the door swings both way. If she 
              leaves, she will have to give up her current lifestyle. Very straight 
              forward.</p>
              <p>I believed alot of forum goers here may feel that I'm 
              realistic, cold and uncompassionate. Face it guys, we lived in a very 
              realistic world. How many married couples at the point of walking down 
              the asile exchanging vows soon realise the next best solution will be in
               the lawyer's office signing divorce papers and fighting for money.</p>
              <p>I'm taking a precaution to prevent any of this from happening right from the start. Simple: <strong>No Marriage = No Divorce</strong> and everybody lives happily ever after. This is the real world and not 
              the story book fairy tale where the prince and the princess live happily
               ever after which sadly has been ingrained into most girls' brain since a
               tender age.</p>
              <p>No ROM means the girl will never have the right to 
              fight for alimony or whatever money in future. In a household, if she 
              knows she entitled to part of your assets or alimony upon marriage, I 
              believed the man will soon loose his foothold and respect.</p>

              <p>Yes I agreed that she is a very good girl. Helps me alot in my business, housework, cooking, etc... and she loves me alot (I don't really care about the part if she loves me or not). I will never get married for very clear reasons which I've stated earlier.</p>
              <p>The issue I am facing now is how to get rid of the baby (obviously a huge liability) to me.</p>
              <p>I've also read that even a healthy women has a 20% chance of miscarriage but I'm not willing to place my bet on a 20% chance.</p>

              <p>Sorry if I may sound realistic. Nothing in the world can make my heart beats a 1000 times faster besides money. I do not believe in true love by the way. Even in the world of animals, only when the male has a beautiful nest, able to provide for the family then will the females come. This is a true fact.</p>
              <p>DNA test will be deemed unnecessary because the baby will not live to see the light. Right now she is about 2 months pregnant and I have about 6-7 months to resolve the situation even it means inducing miscarriage.</p>
