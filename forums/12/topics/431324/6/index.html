              <p>just take your heart out of the situation, break up with your gf as amicably as possible and negotiate to maintain her as a subordinate at work. </p>
              <p>if need be, distribute some K$, give the money making machine enough incentives to comply with your methods. cold hard cash means a lot more than issuing her threats of abandonment. carrot and not the stick. </p>
              <p>why even think about inducing the miscarriage illegally and leave urself vulnerable to a whole string of lawsuits in the future? you can't force her to abort against her will, it's against the law so don't bother.  </p>
              <p>if prospects and pickings are good, there is no reason why employees would leave your business. if they leave because they disagree with your code of ethics, just hire new ones with none. if you can't buy the ones who cannot be bought, then fire a few to set an example. </p>

              <p>That is correct. Being a husband or father has never been on my list. It seems like most of the girls I've dated so far be it Taiwanese or Singaporean all share the same thoughts. BF = Potential Husband.</p>
              <p>At this moment, I do not really care if this is a foul play or for whatever reason. A fact is a fact. She is now pregnant and the baby must go.</p>
              <p>I see it as <strong>Baby = force marriage = divorce = alimony</strong>. The denominator almost always revolves within the subject of money. If women out there assume by making yourself pregnant to realise your profits, that is a bad move because you will end up with nothing.</p>
              <p>At this moment, she is not willing to go for abortion. The next alternative would be induce miscarriage.</p>

              <p>Hi guys, need some advise here regarding my girlfriend's
              prenancy. Long story short, I've been staying in Taiwan for the
              past 6 years and recently out of the blue, my gf of 5 years told me
              she is pregnant. She is a Taiwanese and I'm a Singaporean. I wanted
              her to go for an abortion but she on the other hand is hell bent on
              having the baby.</p>
              <p>I've <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>no
              intention</strong></span> of getting married <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">(No Marriage = No Divorce)</span></strong> but
              the baby's birth cert will bear my name as the father.</p>
              <p>The question is</p>
              <p>1) How can I get the baby bonus from SG Government? What
              documents do I have to submit?</p>
              <p>2) How much is the baby bonus <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>in cash</strong></span> will I get?</p>
              <p>For your info, all along she loves baby like mad and always
              wanted to have one without weighing the consequences. I on the
              other hand, never in my life want to or plan to have kids. She has
              been on contraceptive pills all along and recently I noticed that
              she has not been taking it on a regular basis.</p>

              <p>eh you piece of shit..you got your 
              answer..not legally married cannot get baby bonus. So fcuk off with the 
              "i love money and i hope the baby stop breathing" attitude before your fcuk up post gets posted for the whole country to see.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>The only thing I like about the TS is that he's very honest and direct in his online persona. But he's honest and asking for advice from others in his evil plan. Is it a illegal to love money? Definitely not. Will you burn in hell after your short life for being evil? Possible. Is there life after death? Based on NDE, so far I did some research and it indicates there are signs pointing towards life after death. But obviously those were based on NDE patients and science can't retrieve any concrete data so they cannot say for sure. Before science was advanced enough, do we all breath? Yes, but it took humanity millions of years to discover oxygen atoms and protons and electrons and of course recently about quarks... Just because science and humanity doesn't find evidence for it doesn't always mean something doesn't exist back then... For all your plans, I won't judge you, but God will.</p></div>
