              <p>You will be surprise that I do not find my parents a liability
              at all because they loved me, raised me, put me to school and took
              care of me which I in turn take care of them with no complaints.
              Without them, there won't be me. I truly love them and hold utmost
              respect for both my parents.</p>

              <p>Yes ofcors.. you are their liability.. and they loved you enough to not think of you as one.</p>
              <p>Unfotunately.. their love for you only taught you how to love only yourself.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately.. they never teach you to be able to love another.. just like they are able to love another being.</p>

              <p>Thanks for sharing but True love between me and another women does not exists.</p>
              <p>If you take the time to read stats regarding divorce, you will find that the lack of money is always the cause so tell me without money, can "True Love" substain? The answer is pretty obvious.</p>
              <p>I did hope that she will kinda fall down and a natural miscarriage occurs and at least I can show some crocodile tears that we have just lost our baby and everything goes back status quo but what are the chances this gonna happen?? Very low I think not unless I did that intentionally but it will definately reveal my true inner self.... I even think of ways like mixing a high level of Vitamin C into her meals but I'm not sure if that will guarantee a miscarriage.</p>

              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></strong> Interethnic marriages in singapore are somewhat more likely to end in divorce than were marriages within an ethnic group. During the 1980s the divorce rate for Malays fell, while it rose for the other ethnic groups. In 1987 there were 23,404 marriages in Singapore, and 2,708 divorces, or 115 divorces for every 1,000 marriages.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The figures included 4,465 marriages under the Muslim Law Act, which regulated the marriage, divorce, and inheritance of Muslims, and 796 divorces under the same act, for a Muslim divorce rate of 178 divorces for every 1,000 marriages. Marriages under the Women's Charter totaled 18,939, and divorces under that law were 1,912, for a non-Muslimdivorce rate of 100 per 1,000 marriages.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;">The differential rates of divorce for ethnic groups may have suggested greater differences than were in fact the case. Situations that for Malay families resulted in prompt, legal divorce were sometimes tolerated or handled informally by Chinese or Indian families for whom the social stigma of divorce was greater and the barriers to legal separation higher.</p>
              <p style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">For all ethnic groups, the most common source of marital <span id="IL_AD4" class="IL_AD" style="border-bottom-width: 1px !important; border-bottom-style: dotted !important; border-bottom-color: #0000cc !important; background-image: none !important; background-attachment: scroll !important; background-origin: initial !important; background-clip: initial !important; background-color: transparent !important; cursor: pointer !important; position: static; display: inline !important; padding-top: 0px !important; padding-right: 0px !important; padding-bottom: 1px !important; padding-left: 0px !important; float: none !important; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif !important; font-style: normal !important; font-size: 12px !important; background-position: 0% 50%;">breakdown</span> was the inability or unwillingness of the husband to contribute to maintaining the household. This sometimes led to desertion, which was the most common ground for divorce.</span></span></strong></p>

              <p>Don't you get it until this point? If she outlives her
              usefulness, she will already find herself out of my door with her
              luggage all packed.</p>
              <p>Right now she is still one of my assets that makes money in my
              company. Without that money making ability, you think she is able
              to stay by my side for 6 years? If she leave now, her department
              will be without a leader and everyone in the office will know what
              kind of person I really am and everyone will lose morale and in
              turn lose revenues.</p>
              <p>In front of all my staff and her, I hold her hands and take care
              of her very well... all because of her big mouth, everyone in the
              office f.ucking knows that she is pregnant with my baby and
              everyone was looking at her that she got the best BF in the world.
              They were like congratulating me but I don't see any blessings at
              all. I want the baby dead.</p>

              <p>OK. So all these are water under the bridge.</p>
              <p>Your staff already knows.</p>
              <p>Dead baby is not damage control.</p>
              <p>Damage control is accepting responsibility.. and make her work hardER to take care of her baby.</p>
              <p>Your baby IS an asset... people LIKES to work for a person with family to take care of.</p>
              <p>Your baby ADDs to your image as a FATHER.. a FAMILY MAN.</p>
              <p>The image of a family man is reliable,.. because he has responsibilites.</p>
              <p>You want respect ? You will get it when you show everyone what a GREAT father you are to the child.</p>
              <p>If the baby dies and she leaves you... You'd just come across as a heartless SCROUGE.</p>
              <p>Where'd your EQ go ?</p>
