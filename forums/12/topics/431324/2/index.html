              <p>Sorry if I may sound realistic. Nothing in the world can make my heart beats a 1000 times faster besides money. I do not believe in true love by the way. Even in the world of animals, only when the male has a beautiful nest, able to provide for the family then will the females come. This is a true fact.</p>
              <p>DNA test will be deemed unnecessary because the baby will not live to see the light. Right now she is about 2 months pregnant and I have about 6-7 months to resolve the situation even it means inducing miscarriage.</p>

              <p><br>My uncle has over $16 million in assets and he recently died of heart attack in the office at only 46 years old. He hordes his money and is very mean and stingy. Some of our family members believe that at the time of his heart attack, his staff saw it and never do anything because they cannot be bothered, as in they probably thought it's a minor issue. Not that I'm saying they will be more concern and call ambulance in time to save his life if he was nicer to his staff but the scenario is more likely compared to being the enemy of your staff.</p>
              <p>What I am saying is, what goes around, comes around. You may not realize but your actions will have a cause and effect on your life later, might not be days, might be months or years later, but it'll come back. Even thinking alone has an effect, say you can think of something delicious and you start salivating... cause and effect, never underestimate it.</p>

              <p><br>btw, i am also in business myself, worked super really hard but i gave the company shares entirely to my loved ones and best friends. I myself have 0% shares and I do that because in the worse case scenario, i got betrayed by everyone, i'll get a normal job for $5k/month. It's not alot of money but i'll survive comfortably. for now i work the company up and take very little allowances so the company has enough money for them to retire when i am in no longer in a capacity to take care of them.</p>
              <p>even more importantly, when i die, there is no tax complications. the government will not be able to take a single cent as 100% of my money will be distributed based on the company shares. contrast this to if i die and i have 10 mil, the government will take some and then the remaining will be passed down for distribution. so the government may take away around 3-4 mil as tax.</p>
              <p>and yes, eventually i will die, and given my track record for depression and heavy mood swings, i might die earlier. i have suicidal tendancies due to my bipolar.</p>
              <p>but what i want to say it, don't just think about yourself.</p>

              <p>Very chauvinistic thinking.....$$$ and career comes before everything else, including the loved (or unloved? lol) one. I used to think like that.....but age has mellowed me. Money is good to have but it can't buy everything. Sometimes, take care of your loved ones and somehow good fortune comes naturally.</p>

              <p>Just a simple question, if your gf meet with an accident and passed away. How would you feel?</p>
              <p>Business is just business, no matter how much you earn you can never bring back a life. I experience it first hand losing someone I love. All the regret and money in the world could never turn back time to change anything.</p>
              <p>Is up to you to chose the path you want but is just a friendly reminder that once life pass you by you will not be able to get it back.</p>

              <p>Hi guys, need some advise here regarding my girlfriend's prenancy. Long story short, I've been staying in Taiwan for the past 6 years and recently out of the blue, my gf of 5 years told me she is pregnant. She is a Taiwanese and I'm a Singaporean. I wanted her to go for an abortion but she on the other hand is hell bent on having the baby.</p>
              <p>I've <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>no intention</strong></span> of getting married <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">(No Marriage = No Divorce)</span></strong> but the baby's birth cert will bear my name as the father.</p>
              <p>The question is</p>
              <p>1) How can I get the baby bonus from SG Government? What documents do I have to submit?</p>
              <p>2) How much is the baby bonus <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>in cash</strong></span> will I get?</p>
              <p>For your info, all along she loves baby like mad and always wanted to have one without weighing the consequences. I on the other hand, never in my life want to or plan to have kids. She has been on contraceptive pills all along and recently I noticed that she has not been taking it on a regular basis.</p>

              <p>That is correct. Being a husband or father has never been on my list. It seems like most of the girls I've dated so far be it Taiwanese or Singaporean all share the same thoughts. BF = Potential Husband.</p>
              <p>At this moment, I do not really care if this is a foul play or for whatever reason. A fact is a fact. She is now pregnant and the baby must go.</p>
              <p>I see it as <strong>Baby = force marriage = divorce = alimony</strong>. The denominator almost always revolves within the subject of money. If women out there assume by making yourself pregnant to realise your profits, that is a bad move because you will end up with nothing.</p>
              <p>At this moment, she is not willing to go for abortion. The next alternative would be induce miscarriage.</p>
