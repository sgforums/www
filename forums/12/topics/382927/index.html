              <p>Hi XiaoBunbun,</p>
              <p>By "Commercial School", does it means that you are not taking up your higher NITEC in ITE? If that is the case, it will be best for you to send a mail directly to the Polytechnics and enquire if the Higher NITEC you will be holding is recognised by them or not.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>why do you choose high nitec in accounting!!!???</p>
              <p>Accounting field is usually for "accountant" who are degree holder + 2 years of apprenticeship.</p>
              <p>For you to be an accountant is a very hard path to take, do you know that?</p>
              <p>Do you really have some plan in mind or an idea about the accounting industry?</p>

              <p>You can always make new friends in school. So no worries. Just open up yourself and go approach those group of people you like to hang out with. Maybe you want to start with a 'Hi' then try to start a conversation. Do the things they like with them so they will enjoy to be with you. Good luck.</p>

              <p>Well, actually I went to this polytechnic website and saw that they accept  ITE accounting students for night classes.</p>
              <p>I then decided I could actually enroll into ITE but until I came across a commercial school offering the same course and it's only 1 year, so I thought why not? And paid nearly 4k to study.</p>
              <p>I did not take POA at school so you could say I just went in becase 1) I saw the course requirements on a poly website stating they accept ITE accounting students and even stating the subjects they took 2) I was curious on how acounting works and have read up the internet on quite a bit on what people say 3) I wanted to just start somewhere</p>
              <p>I took 6 subs for first half of my modules and got 4 A's plus 1 C and a D (haix, pulled my gpa down) and my accounting subs was the ones that got A's. Anyways, I am the top student for the ITE courses they offered. (yeah, 3.025 top student, pathetic...)</p>
              <p>Anyways, I got 5 more to go but recently I've been very depressed whenever I go on facebook and then think about how my peers are so far ahead of me and living the life while i'm stuck here doing the basics.</p>

              <p>Dear TS,</p>
              <p>Your future is determined by yourself. There are many forms of intelligence, not just by books alone. If you think by being bookish and getting good grades, one is smart, you are dead wrong.</p>
              <p>The true intelligent ones knows how little they know, for there is so much, so much, overwelhmingly to know in order to call oneself smart. I ask you - is the engineer smarter than the doctor, based grades alone? Nope, they each, if they can be honest, will tell how little they truly know, for each day new discoveries are being made in each other's trade.</p>
              <p>Thus, never look down on yourself, or let anyone look down on you. Some are good at regurgitating facts, some are good at thinking out of the box, some are just plain lazy. You can never tell who is who at a glance.</p>
              <p>Just because you have no liking for academica, does not mean your future is dim. You only need to find what are your gifts and talent, good at, and act upon it with perseverance. As long as you love what you are doing, confident of doing it, and can make a cntented living with it, be happy always.</p>
              <p>Some professors enjoy their work, some dont. Some mechanics enjoy their work, some dont. This world cannot have everyone as professors, or everyone a mechanic. Your gift will be your contribution to our society. Just be the best that you want to be, and can be.</p>
              <p>But do know that you were not born, live to work, but work to live. No person is or must be a slave to work. The days off and leaves are times for you to socialise, never to be neglected, so that you may live a full life. The journey of life is made much more enjoyable with true friends you make along the way.</p>

              <p>Why compared yourself with others? Jus do whatever you are interested in and carry on with your OWN life. So just continue your studies from ITE then towards polytechnic. That should be your main goal now instead of comparing with your peers.</p>

              <p>Well, actually I went to this polytechnic website and saw that
              they accept  ITE accounting students for night classes.</p>
              <p>I then decided I could actually enroll into ITE but until I came
              across a commercial school offering the same course and it's only 1
              year, so I thought why not? And paid nearly 4k to study.</p>
              <p>I did not take POA at school so you could say I just went in
              becase 1) I saw the course requirements on a poly website stating
              they accept ITE accounting students and even stating the subjects
              they took 2) I was curious on how acounting works and have read up
              the internet on quite a bit on what people say 3) I wanted to just
              start somewhere</p>
              <p>I took 6 subs for first half of my modules and got 4 A's plus 1
              C and a D (haix, pulled my gpa down) and my accounting subs was the
              ones that got A's. Anyways, I am the top student for the ITE
              courses they offered. (yeah, 3.025 top student, pathetic...)</p>
              <p>Anyways, I got 5 more to go but recently I've been very
              depressed whenever I go on facebook and then think about how my
              peers are so far ahead of me and living the life while i'm stuck
              here doing the basics.</p>

              <p>Hi XiaoBunbun,</p>
              <p>You must understand that everyone have different aims and thus move at different speed. Having a university degree doesn't make one far ahead of others who doesn't, for a lot also depends on what that individual does after he or she graduates.</p>
              <p>Allow me to give you an example. If your friends are to graduate with a good honours, yet remain jobless for ten years, and you manage to get a job once you completed your course - and have been promoted a few times and received some good pay rises over the decade - I will say that you have moved further ahead than they have.</p>
              <p>As for your social circle, you can try doing some voluntary work, so as to help out the less fortunate and make some new friends at the same time. For now, the most important thing is for you to focus on your studies and try to enter a local polytechnic, since that is your current personal aim to begin with. </p>
              <p>Last but not least, all the best to you in your studies.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hey, no big deal. The entry requirements are man made and are there only because there are only limited places avaliable. It does not signify your level of intelligence, as each and everyone of us have different levels at different ages. Some mature faster, some are slow starters. So, dont look down on yourself.</p>
              <p>You can always try again next year, or opt for private studies, or even start a job, work your way up and look for sponsorships, which are avaliable if you prove yourself capable and espacially attitude right. </p>
              <p>Some CEOs I know were only clerks or supervisors when they started work for their company. Some called it luck, but I knew them from young and they had work extremely hard, got promoted and prove themselves responsible enough to be elevated when opportunities arised.</p>
              <p>So, it aint the end of the world yet. A world of opportunity awaits you. I wish I was your age again with opportunities that lies before you today, if only you have more confidence in yourself and the perseverance to act on it!<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

              <p>I used my O level cert to apply, knowing well I would be rejected. Ha, I was right....I mean I just hope for that little hope that they would accept (fat hope I guess)</p>
              <p>I wish I am clear headed about what i'm going to do, but the true is...it's always hard since I've been stuck for so long and well, I dont have much friends to mix around so I wouldn't know what kind of things might spark me to do in life even more.</p>
              <p>Right now, I just want to stop my depressing thoughts. It's really painful since ever since I go to school now, it's like there's a sharp pain in ur stomach that you knew you didn't want to go but yet force yourself to go those kind...</p>

              <p>It's normal to be confused. So many roads to take, but not sure which one is right, and fearing to take the wrong one. Made worse by the low results you obtained. Thus the depression.</p>
              <p>Let's try an experiment. Sit down, relax, make yourself comfortable. Just write down the things you enjoy doing. Can be anything, eg - shopping, playing games, food, etc.</p>
              <p>From that list, it will give you an idea of what you truly like and would be happy doing it. For eg, if you like shopping, you may be looking at a job as mechandizer, scouring for materials or products locally or around the world for your company to sell.</p>
              <p>If computer games fascinates you, you may be looking at a computer game design job. If you enjoy food, perhaps you may want to consider being a chef.</p>
              <p>Once you determine what you enjoy best doing, then select a specialized course offered locally that will give you the knowledge to excel in it. Once you have obtain a cert for it, apply for a job, gain experience, prove yourself, save money and then take on further modules to gain better knowledge and certification.</p>
              <p>When you are as good as that piece of paper claims you are, career paths will be further opened to you.</p>
              <p>PS: Ultimately, everyone enjoys money, counting money, working with money and the opportunities it gives us. But money is only a compensation/reward for our capability, and it is only thru a job that our capabilities can be appreciated and paid. Cashiers and bank clerks no doubt are jobs, but you should be aiming for higher positions, thus the need to plan now.</p>

              <p>It's only normal, for you are young, restless, and perhaps disappointed with what you had managed so far, to run away and seek a new beginning.</p>
              <p>But I am glad you are still rational enough to realize the difficulties you will face in a foreign land. You certainly cant just simply walk into australia and declare your loyalty to the aussie flag, and become a citizen. It needs not only money and tangible documented talents, you will have to fit in to their society and way of life or you will be miserable.</p>
              <p>You were smart to figure out that it may be better to get a job there. But be aware that many of the aussie grads are even fleeing out of their country and working elsewhere, similar to your reason for fleeing - young and restless,besides the lack of better opportunities and costs of living.</p>
              <p>So if you were to seek work there, with your grades, you will probably have to join the cheap foreign worker queue to get a job. Your grasp of english will stand you in good stead. They are short of people with ITE skills as the many proud and racists aussies shunned such jobs.</p>
              <p>Best you find out more about Australia, both the good as well as the bad, before you decide to work there. Pays well, but the tax is one of the highest in the world.</p>
              <p> Sometimes, money isnt everything. Your family, relatives and friends are more important. Within that circle is where you will feel warmth and be wanted, a somebody, an equal. Outside the circle, you are on your own.</p>
              <p>In the end, it is still your choice to make, a choice which at your age and maturity level that you will never listen or nor allow others to tell you otherwise. We all will eventually have to make our own mistakes in order that we learn better.</p>
