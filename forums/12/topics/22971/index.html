She had become a team leader.Any projects that she plans will inform you at the last minute or withhold information. Sometime we got into conflicts and had heated arugements. She worked in e co for estimated 5 yrs,know the environment, technical skills is a bit here and there. I worked in e co for a year but had 5 yrs of technical experience. Recently she become the team leader, i was so angry as I know that she is using mgt skills to use for leadership when I dun bother to respect her.If she is wrong in technical stuff, she insist she is right.
