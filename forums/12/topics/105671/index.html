            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I chanced upon this forum, and decided to open up my heart here.<br><br>I met my wife 9 years, and we got married 4 years ago. We were quite happily married, but I was hiding a dark secret from her, I was heavily in debt from stock market losses. My debts were rising quickly, till I had problems servicing it. Out of desperation, I took out some loans in my wife's name (means forging her signature). But no matter how hard I worked, never seemed to clear them.<br><br>In Oct this year, I finally had enough. I came clean about my debts. My wife was shocked. What was worse was that she found out I forged her signature before I can tell her. She was livid.

She has told me that it is impossible for her to trust anyone again, and I have wasted her youth, and destroyed her dreams. She mentioned that we are finished.<br><br>I had apologised to her, her parents and have sought for forgiveness. That was the only thing I did wrong in the last 9 years, and i really regretted it. I only committed the folly out of desperation. Why can't she forgive me?<br><br>Also, she said that there was no chance for us to get back together, yet she is not taking any actions to serve me the divorce petition.. why is that so?

I was hoping that it would be (i), but more likely it seems like it is (ii) now..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Well, over the years, our marriage life was probably stable, but was not exactly lovey dovey... I was mired in this debt and there were a lot of things a husband normally would have done (i.e. buy gifts, go on trips) to pamper the wife that i did not do. this resulted in her commenting that I love her less after marriage.<br><br>after I had come clean with everything, I had tried to ask her to give me a chance to make up to her as I was unable to give her a gd life becos I was mired in debts. However, once the flat is sold, my debts would have receded significantly and i should be able to become the old me, the guy that she handed her heart and youth to.<br><br>I am extremely hurt and sad that she refuses to give me this chance in life. i have loved her all these years and for those things that I did for her, do they count for nothing? I have never chided her for anything before, and even if i was angry, i have always forgiven her. i really do not think that she love me less, else she wouldn't have entrusted her life to me...<br><br>it is indeed hard now, i have lost my job because of this and now, she does not want to continue with our marriage...<br><br>however, i will be strong that as long as i am not served the divorce petition, i will not give up. I will try to secure a job and carry reducing my debt burden...<br><br>thank you Yunhaier for your wonderful advise... and if you do have further views, pls do continue to contribute...<br><br>Have a nice day!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi RegularJoe,<br><br>U sound as if u're blaming ur wifey for Not being able to forgive u...  I'm sorree but I hafta be harsh here, as this is somethg many guys r blind to.  Why can't she forgive?  Ev. body makes mistakes wat....... etc etc etc.  I went thru the same thgs wif an ex...<br><br>Lemme share wif u my perspective, altho I wun go so far as to generalise &amp; sez tt all women feel tt way.<br><br>It's Not the mistake, but the depth &amp; the severity of the mistake.  Here're, it's complicated by the length of time u took to confess wat u'd done.<br><br>1.  Severity of the mistake.  U'd actually forged ur own wifey's signature.  That is a betrayal of trust tt most of us can't fathom.  Many white-collar crimes involve forgery of a signature.  But note "white collar crimes".  These r committed @ work, &amp; it's a betrayal of trust of an employee.  Here, ur wifey has to live wif the betrayal of her husband, the man who professed to love her until death do them part.  A thot tt runs to mind wld be, "Why cldn't he haf shared this wif me?  We cld've thot of a solution together &amp; borne the burden together".  Which brings me to the 2nd part...<br><br>2.  Length of time it took u to confess.  U took 10 yrs, during ur r'ship AND during ur marriage.  A marriage is a commitment, &amp; both of u vowed to stand by each other thru thick &amp; thin.  Yet, u din share wif her ur darkest fears, &amp; u din allow her to the opportunity to stand by u before it became too much to bear.  For yrs, there was a veil of deceit, &amp; suddenly, she was faced wif a double life tt u'd led without her knowledge.  It wldn't be an exaggeration to sez tt her world has come crashing down ard her.<br><br>Wat follows, is subjective.  A trust is broken, &amp; the severity of the breakage can take a long time to repair.  Marriage counselling will be the best alternative here, cosh these counsellors r academically trained to help repair a marriage.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by FeowFeow:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi RegularJoe,<br><br>U sound as if u're blaming ur wifey for Not being able to forgive u...  I'm sorree but I hafta be harsh here, as this is somethg many guys r blind to.  Why can't she forgive?  Ev. body makes mistakes wat....... etc etc etc.  I went thru the same thgs wif an ex...<br><br>Lemme share wif u my perspective, altho I wun go so far as to generalise &amp; sez tt all women feel tt way.<br><br>It's Not the mistake, but the depth &amp; the severity of the mistake.  Here're, it's complicated by the length of time u took to confess wat u'd done.<br><br>1.  Severity of the mistake.  U'd actually forged ur own wifey's signature.  That is a betrayal of trust tt most of us can't fathom.  Many white-collar crimes involve forgery of a signature.  But note "white collar crimes".  These r committed @ work, &amp; it's a betrayal of trust of an employee.  Here, ur wifey has to live wif the betrayal of her husband, the man who professed to love her until death do them part.  A thot tt runs to mind wld be, "Why cldn't he haf shared this wif me?  We cld've thot of a solution together &amp; borne the burden together".  Which brings me to the 2nd part...<br><br>2.  Length of time it took u to confess.  U took 10 yrs, during ur r'ship AND during ur marriage.  A marriage is a commitment, &amp; both of u vowed to stand by each other thru thick &amp; thin.  Yet, u din share wif her ur darkest fears, &amp; u din allow her to the opportunity to stand by u before it became too much to bear.  For yrs, there was a veil of deceit, &amp; suddenly, she was faced wif a double life tt u'd led without her knowledge.  It wldn't be an exaggeration to sez tt her world has come crashing down ard her.<br><br>Wat follows, is subjective.  A trust is broken, &amp; the severity of the breakage can take a long time to repair.  Marriage counselling will be the best alternative here, cosh these counsellors r academically trained to help repair a marriage.  Or as Devil1976 suggests, woo her all over again.<br><br>The more u love someone, the harder u fall when u find tt there was a thick layer of smoke pulled before ur eyes.  It'll make it all the harder to win her back.  But if u love her as u sez u do, then it's Not all failure.

I am terribly hurt by how things have turned out.<br><br>Like you mention, not hearing from her at all for the past week is so difficult, when we were nearly together everyday for the past 9 yrs.

But I don't dare, because she doesn't want to hear from me.<br><br>I am so torn; I want to say hi, but I am afraid of her anger... and like you mentioned, it could make her go to the extent to end the marriage. Although she has not mentioned the word "divorce" yet, but she has mentioned in an email to me that she could never trust me again, and hoped that I would be a better person after I settle the loans and wished me the best. She also mentioned that she is not suitable for me, and urged to find some other companion. Isn't this the same as saying that she wants to end the marriage?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I would really love to talk to her during this period; but should I do so when the hurt is still so raw?<br><br>Being the daft person I am, I might not have understood some of her words and actions and why.

She means well when she wants to sell it off to pay your loans, and it seems deep down, she really loves you.<br><br>Deal with your most immediate problems first, and stand by it. Do not regret, and try to rectify the situation.<br><br>Since the main problem all this while(to you), is the financial problem, do what you can to solve it asap. If selling the flat can do that, then do it. You need to get your life back on track, before you can woo her again.<br></div>

Men also remember bad deeds in the past as well. It is just human.<br><br>Really trust has to be earnt , it is not given.  You betrayed a trust. So time for you  to find a way to earn her trust back. Earning a trust back is never easy.<br><br>Regularjoe , you are lucky your wife did not push formal charges on you for forgery. She seems to exhibit some concern for you to use the flat to repay the loan as well. You are lucky in a way. For the moment , I suggest you give her some time out to think things over carefully.<br><br>Don't go telling her " I have never chided her for anything before, and even if i was angry, i have always forgiven her. i really do not think that she love me less, else she wouldn't have entrusted her life to me... " because , friend, what you did was an ultimate betrayal.<br><br>If she decides she cannot forgive you during that period , you cannot push her either except take things one at a time.  People make mistakes , some can be repaired , some cannot .

Fix yourself first before you try fixing your marriage. Let her know how sorry you are and your plans over a coffee or something if she is agreeable. Keep her as a friend.

But unfortunately, humans are afterall creatures with emotions; it often clouds one's thinking and perspective.<br><br>I know what I should do, but it is just so hard...<br><br>Anyway, thanks for your advice and hope that you will continue contributing in this thread...<br><br>Regularjoe</div>

Be comforted that she still sees you. I would do anything even just to hear her voice again.<br><br>You must hang on to your job no matter what happens, cos this is your lifeline. Like all well meaning forumers had adviced, take steps to solve our problems first; before even thinking of salvaging the marriage.<br><br>I am going through the same thing as you. She doesn't care anymore about what happens to me anymore. I sms her, she will not reply. It's just that, it seems she has just disappeared.<br><br>I understand what you are going through... I think I am getting out of depression. During the past 2 months, I cried, I despised myself, I had suicidal thoughts, sleepless nights, I lost a lot of weight... while going through all these, i kept worrying when the banks will actually come after me... everytime when the phone rings, I will go crazy. I dun know if it is my wife or the banks...<br>I was also bitter about why I was given a chance; but know I understand, cos this is the way some women are... though sometimes I wonder about the marriage vow.. "through thick and thin"...<br><br>Now, I am starting to pick myself up. How do I know I am getting out of the rut? Because I don't get affected by bad news anymore. For instance, I was told by some gd and kind career counsellors taht indeed, it is difficult for me to find a job in this market now, because of my career work experiences. Maybe, that is what they call structural displacement. I am of course concerned, but then I know that there must still be some way that I can earn some money. I will carry on trying... and I know that if eventually, I am still unable to get a job to fend off the banks, it is just bankruptcy that I have to face. However, I will try to fight it off cos I still want to salvage my marriage, and I do not want to sabotage my own chances by getting myself bankrupted.<br><br>Has she mentioned about divorce yet, or are you legally separated? Are you also about to sell your matrimonial flat? Try not to bring up these subjects in your outings, and never lose patience with her... just be happy that you still get to see her and try to please her as much as possible...<br><br>I hope you can stay strong during these times... it's gonna be worse before it gets better... I always believe that the world is actually a place full of warmth and hope, and if you hold on to this belief, you should be all right.<br><br>C'mon in often to share...<br><br>Take care.<br><br>Regularjoe<br></div>

So time for you  to find a way to earn her trust back. Earning a trust back is never easy.<br><br>Regularjoe , you are lucky your wife did not push formal charges on you for forgery. She seems to exhibit some concern for you to use the flat to repay the loan as well. You are lucky in a way. For the moment , I suggest you give her some time out to think things over carefully.<br><br>Don't go telling her " I have never chided her for anything before, and even if i was angry, i have always forgiven her. i really do not think that she love me less, else she wouldn't have entrusted her life to me...

She did not respond to that, but instead helped me pay off a part of my loans. then she moved out. It hurts me even more this way; How could I have hurt someone who loves me that much? This hurt and regret will forever be etched in my heart, and my only desire and motive now is to get out of this debt and try to win her back.<br><br>I will not push her into anything now, for this is what she wants now, to be away from me... she needs time to think things through, and I will respect her decision. These times away from each other is hard to bear, but I believe that eventually if we ever get back together, we will be blessed with a wonderful and happy future. I will carry this hope in my heart and try to get myself up...<br><br>fymk, your sharing is brutal and honest, and I appreciate that, for only then can one learn and change... pls continue to share...<br><br>take care.<br><br>Regularjoe</div>
