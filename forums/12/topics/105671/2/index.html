            <div class='col-md body'>what you said is very true fymk.. i believe both joe and myself knows that it is very difficult to win back already. it may take years or whatsoever but the crack and lost of trust is there. although my case wasnt about forgery but it was taking $ with the intention to return later but it is an unforgivable thing.<br><br>i have been trying so hard for the past few months to give my best and try to earn back the trust. whatever i do, it is backfiring. even the smallest things as to what to eat can create fights.<br><br>i would like to see a counseller but the guts to go tell them is not there. many times i have asked her to go along with me, but it is rejected. although we do spend time together, but it is superficial. all good things i do becomes bad in her eyes. get scolded, beaten, kicked, slapped,scratched etc..<br><br>reality is such that when you love a person deeply, you are willing to sacrifice all. but when mistakes done, the end of story.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by fymk:</div><div class="quote_body">As a woman , I don't think I want to trust someone who forges my signature. No pun intended.  Men also remember bad deeds in the past as well. It is just human.<br><br>Really trust has to be earnt , it is not given.  You betrayed a trust. So time for you  to find a way to earn her trust back. Earning a trust back is never easy.<br><br>Regularjoe , you are lucky your wife did not push formal charges on you for forgery. She seems to exhibit some concern for you to use the flat to repay the loan as well. You are lucky in a way. For the moment , I suggest you give her some time out to think things over carefully.<br><br>Don't go telling her " I have never chided her for anything before, and even if i was angry, i have always forgiven her. i really do not think that she love me less, else she wouldn't have entrusted her life to me... " because , friend, what you did was an ultimate betrayal.<br><br>If she decides she cannot forgive you during that period , you cannot push her either except take things one at a time.  People make mistakes , some can be repaired , some cannot . Like a mirror , once there is a crack , there will always be a crack despite all the repairs.<br><br>May even take years for forgiveness.<br><br>You got your priorities right - get yourself out of the debt legally and honestly. Fix yourself first before you try fixing your marriage. Let her know how sorry you are and your plans over a coffee or something if she is agreeable. Keep her as a friend. Friendship is a building block for trust . Don't go pushing into marriage etc.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

Be comforted that she still sees you. I would do anything even just to hear her voice again.<br><br>You must hang on to your job no matter what happens, cos this is your lifeline. Like all well meaning forumers had adviced, take steps to solve our problems first; before even thinking of salvaging the marriage.<br><br>I am going through the same thing as you. She doesn't care anymore about what happens to me anymore. I sms her, she will not reply. It's just that, it seems she has just disappeared.<br><br>I understand what you are going through... I think I am getting out of depression. During the past 2 months, I cried, I despised myself, I had suicidal thoughts, sleepless nights, I lost a lot of weight... while going through all these, i kept worrying when the banks will actually come after me... everytime when the phone rings, I will go crazy. I dun know if it is my wife or the banks...<br>I was also bitter about why I was given a chance; but know I understand, cos this is the way some women are... though sometimes I wonder about the marriage vow.. "through thick and thin"...<br><br>Now, I am starting to pick myself up. How do I know I am getting out of the rut? Because I don't get affected by bad news anymore. For instance, I was told by some gd and kind career counsellors taht indeed, it is difficult for me to find a job in this market now, because of my career work experiences. Maybe, that is what they call structural displacement. I am of course concerned, but then I know that there must still be some way that I can earn some money. I will carry on trying... and I know that if eventually, I am still unable to get a job to fend off the banks, it is just bankruptcy that I have to face. However, I will try to fight it off cos I still want to salvage my marriage, and I do not want to sabotage my own chances by getting myself bankrupted.<br><br>Has she mentioned about divorce yet, or are you legally separated? Are you also about to sell your matrimonial flat? Try not to bring up these subjects in your outings, and never lose patience with her... just be happy that you still get to see her and try to please her as much as possible...<br><br>I hope you can stay strong during these times... it's gonna be worse before it gets better... I always believe that the world is actually a place full of warmth and hope, and if you hold on to this belief, you should be all right.<br><br>C'mon in often to share...<br><br>Take care.<br><br>Regularjoe<br></div></blockquote>till now i have not gotten out of my depression and it is more than half a year. i still am going thru all the despise of myself, suicidal thots, sleepless nights, drastic weight lost. even she sees me now, as said is all superficial and she keeps tell me that we are bent for divorce and no chance to be together. over the months, i have been injured. can be due to lost of concentration or indirectly caused by her, but no more than a how r u from her..i have been trying to make sure my work is stable but it is affecting me. even colleagues know that. although i am not told to leave yet but due to my often sickness i have to be prepared for it. i keep telling myself i gotta step out of it but it never happen. the care and concern for her is too much. even second i am thinking of her. i am stepping into depression again..<br>i have got a lawyer letter saying they preparing for divorce or seperation. but i do not know how it goes. it does not state in the letter too i gotta go sign anything or whatever.<br><br>i need counselling. can you tell me where should i go ?? whether for marriage counsel or even advise for divorce of seperation. it is painful. till now, i still see her regularly and doing all my very best to provide.. it is turning worse instead. every single thing i do, is a trap for her to bite on me..<br><br></div>

I am indeed sad to hear that you have received the lawyer's letter, that could mean a petition has been served on you... a legal separation could ensue if both of you do do satisfy the divorce criteria at the moment... You could also seek counselling there...<br><br>My greatest fear is that my wife is becoming like yours... she is beginning to care less, and sometimes downright rude. There are no fights yet between us, but I fear that it might become a reality soon...<br><br>I am really ashamed of the severity of my mistakes; and I am beginning to hate myself all over again. To be frank, I don't harbour so much hope that she will forgive me, let alone get back with me... just have to learn to deal with the pain...<br><br>Just a while ago, my wife told me that she had given the agent an ultimatum of selling the house by this week... however, she said it's up to me whether I wanted to sell... there's been an offer that is way way below the market rate and can only help clear 1/4 of my debts... I am in a dilemna; is she telling me to sell becos she wants nothing to do with me anymore, so that she can institute divorce proceedings?  I am going crazy everytime these things happen... the fear of the unknown... and i keep second guessing her ...<br><br>deepman, i know you love your wife deeply, and i would tell you to hang in there... try to get her to go for marriage counselling... btw, have you returned her the money? also, pls prepare yourself should you lose your job... I can tell you that the job market is really tough.. I've been unemployed for 3 months already... and I am deep in debt ...<br><br>The advice here is right, you can pour out everything here, but we know that we need to get things together again... we might live with regrets all our life, but we can lessen the pain by learning and being a better person...<br><br>Be strong, I am with you...<br><br>Regularjoe</div>

But the most important thing is to solve your most immediate problems, and then slowly go down the line of your priorities.<br><br>Do not lose hope in the way Joe, we all make mistakes, and as bad as your situation looks, just know that its always darkest before dawn.<br><br>Godspeed with your new life~</div>

I am also happy to hear that you are trying to gather all your strengths to pick up and live again.<br>At the meantime, i still have my job and she is still seeing me.

For me, i am really ashamed of myself. mistakes are done by me and i used lies to cover them previously. but when i honestly let them out, it is way too late. the love is gone.<br>she just told me she no longers have love for me and each day we prolong, the more pain i will feel and more nasty things will befall me. she also mentioned that she is not as magnanimous others as to forgive and she cant trust or do it anymore.<br><br>Joe, I really hope the best for you</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Deepman &amp; Regular Joe<br><br>I have deep similarity of the problems u guys are facing.<br>The only security I have now are my 4 children and the eldest is grown up and the other 3 are still school going.<br>Like Joe, out of desperation, I forged her signature to obtain a credit line without her knowledge and that was 5 yrs ago and until today, I am still sruggling to pay the interest every month just to prevent legal action.<br>If legal action is instituted by the bank, I will face the same consequence like u guys. I have been taking $ from her every now and then, by the hundreds and occasionally by the thousands, saying that the thousands will restore my credit problems with the banks. She trusted me and did not hesitate to help me. I do not know how long I can hold the truth especially I am left with nothing every month after paying off various banks from my wage.<br>I recently gave up my car as a result of a bad accident and not being able to handle my repair cost. That aggravate the situation as I was seeing her every day to and from work. Having no car brings us further apart.<br>My latest blow is one bank consolidated my accounts together and expect me to pay a substantial amount every month thru their lawyer otherwise they will proceed with legal actions.<br>I know my days are numbered before facing the chopping board.<br>I tried to seek part time employment in the evening but being 50, it is so difficult to find one.<br>Like Deepman, she is touchy over minor things unlike before and I can tell the difference instantly.<br>I am prepared to face bankruptcy but the thoughts of getting her involved is tormenting.<br></div>

I dont wish to come down on you or anyone like a ton of bricks but as many of the previous posts had so clearly discussed some of the issues, so I decided to just go straight into what I want to say.<br><br>For a short moment stop condemning yourself.  Yes what you did is a terrible thing.  It is good that you recognise this.  I think your wife knows that you yourself recognised the wrong you have done and feels terrible about it as well.  I think she has seen you suffer for your mistakes.  Now, ask God for forgiveness and repent and then forgive yourself.  <strong>Ask her for her forgiveness BUT DONT PUSH IT.  JUST SAY HOW SORRY YOU ARE ABOUT ALL THE DECEIT AND THE HURT THAT YOU HAD CAUSED HER <span style="color: red;">AND LEAVE IT AT THAT.  IF SHE HAS NO REACTION WHATSOEVER, DONT YOU DARE PUSH HER TO HAVE ONE!  IF SHE HAS THE HEART TO FORGIVE, SHE WILL - * IN HER TIME* NOT YOURS![/</span>  In the meantime, forgive yourself! you need this, you need to make peace within yourself.  Without forgiving yourself, you will find that the actions you want to take is being held back by the condemnation that you feel!  b]<br><br>Now learn from this terrible situation and Remember the pain that your actions had done and remember it well.  But that is different from beating yourself to death by every act of kindness that you receive from your wife who I must say is exceedingly supportive!  [b]If she does not wish to scream at you why should you feel bad?  Just like expecting her to say she forgives you the moment you asked, for whose benefit is it that she should scream at you?</strong>  She has her own ways of dealing with the situation and if screaming at you is not one of it, why should you want her and expect her to scream at you?<br><br>Remember she is the one who is hurted by your actions.  YOu are hurt bec of your own actions so you have nothing that you can expect from her.  She will give you whatever that her kindness and grace will enable her to give.  You cannot expect anything.  The moment you expect, your actions will look like a demand and that will only show that you are not sincere in changing your ways and seeking her forgiveness but will come across as one which is designed to make yourself feel better!  you have no right to demand anything at this stage.  I'm sorry to say this but her last priority to you is to help you feel good about yourself.  So dont rush anything, dont push.  This is part of showing her that you love her more than yourself.<br><br>I know how desperate it feels but the more self control you have the eaiser it is to deal with the situation.<br><br>About the flat.  Have you done the sums, what amount must be returned to CPF and what amount is available to you to repay the loan?  <strong>I would seriously suggest that whatever amount that can be realilsed you use it FIRST TO PAY OFF HER DEBT not yours!!</strong>  It is not right that she should have to suffer the bad debt while you spread the money around!  Also, no point trying to cover all bases when as you said, the amount availabe can only cover 1/4 of your debt. so might as well clear as much of hers as you can first - best of all if her debts are cleared once and for all.  That way you are back to square one which is not a bad place to start, judging from the situation.  Also helping her clear her debt first also shows with your actions that you love her more than yourself!<br><br>Sentiments aside, if she is prepared to sell the flat and if it can help clear some of the bills, I would suggest that you do that.<br><br>once again, I am sorry for the heavy post.

I have been taking $ from her every now and then, by the hundreds and occasionally by the thousands, saying that the thousands will restore my credit problems with the banks. She trusted me and did not hesitate to help me. I do not know how long I can hold the truth especially I am left with nothing every month after paying off various banks from my wage.<br>I recently gave up my car as a result of a bad accident and not being able to handle my repair cost. That aggravate the situation as I was seeing her every day to and from work. Having no car brings us further apart.<br>My latest blow is one bank consolidated my accounts together and expect me to pay a substantial amount every month thru their lawyer otherwise they will proceed with legal actions.<br>I know my days are numbered before facing the chopping board.<br>I tried to seek part time employment in the evening but being 50, it is so difficult to find one.<br>Like Deepman, she is touchy over minor things unlike before and I can tell the difference instantly.<br>I am prepared to face bankruptcy but the thoughts of getting her involved is tormenting.<br></div></blockquote>Dear Larry,<br><br>I guess supercharger's advice applies here. I assume that you might be staying in an apartment now, is it possible to downgrade? If you can get back some cash to alleviate the problems, it would help things. But you should get her out of the problems first...<br><br>Like you, I am past caring about bankruptcy. And to some irony of fate, I am glad that my wife is not with me as I go down this path... my only worry is that I am unable to find a gd job...<br><br>if you do not mind, there are indeed some PT positions that you can try for, PT surveyor, tutor, property agent, production night shift operators... i guess you do not mind the pittance as I feel every dollar counts...<br><br>From your post, it seems like your wife is already aware of you forging her signature... if that is the case, then the problem is purely financial... so might not be a bad thing to work PT after all...<br><br>For the bank that consolidated your statement, try again to stall for time by working directly with them and being upfront with your debts... you can try writing directly to the top management about this, and you'll be surprised with the result... or try to get your MP to help... pride should not be in the way here...<br><br></div>

They've come to assist you through a difficulty, to provide you with guidance and support, to aid you physically, emotionally, or spiritually. They may seem like a Godsend, and they are! They are there for the reason you need them to be. Then, without any wrong doing on your part, or at an inconvenient time, this person will say or do something to bring the relationship to an end. Sometimes they die. Sometimes they walk away. Sometimes they act up and force you to take a stand.<br><br>What we must realize is that our need has been met, our desire fulfilled, their work is done. The prayer you sent up has been answered... even if you don't realize it...<br>and now it's time to move on.<br><br>Some people come into your life for a SEASON, because your turn has come to share, grow, or learn. They bring you an experience of peace, or make you laugh. They may teach you something you have never done. They usually give you an unbelievable amount of joy. But believe; it is real! But, it's also only for a season.<br><br>LIFETIME relationships teach you lifetime lessons: Things you must build upon in order to have a solid emotional foundation. Your job is to accept the lesson, love the person, and put what you have learned to use in all other relationships and areas of your life. It is said that love is blind but friendship is clairvoyant.<br><br></div>
