              <p>There are people who have no certificate but can be own bossess. The media make an example out of things.</p>
              <p>These are few. The majority have to juggle with the truth. Unless you work for a company a job that do not required a certificate for a job position. Having a higher certification certainly help you meet the stated requirement of a job position. If you happen to get a promotion, fine. But once you land in a situation where you have to change a job, with no higher certificate you may sometimes be forced to work for a lower position, and fnd it near impossible to get the same position you are working as.</p>
              <p>Can you state your desire to study for a diploma and see if your technical institute can help or advise further?</p>
              <p>Is ther anyway to retake the exams of make an appeal?</p>
              <p>I am not familiar with the current education system.</p>

              <p>I have a friend who didn't really do well for his studies but ended up getting a job taht he likes and pay slightly well (thanks to his industrial attachment). Honestly you can't do much with a low GPA...</p>
              <p>However I don't really think it's the end. Nothing is the end because life will forever go on even if you stop.</p>
              <p>You could try re-studying something else? In ITE again (maybe a different school)? Something that you know you have a passion for. Or you can try studying private like kaplan? Some of the ITE students also go there.</p>
              <p>But if you are not going to take the initiative then you'll forever be stuck on the same place. Try to think of what you want, take a few week off. Go take a part time job and while working think of what your gonna do next.</p>
              <p>You can wait maybe for about 6-7 months to relax yourself and really consider your future. Then after one year go and make on your decision again.</p>

              <p>Office deskbound job? Yes, possible. Provided that you are willing to make compromise.</p>
              <p>Meaning longer working hours, lesser pay. Defintely no MNC but you have a bigger shot at smaller companies around industrial areas.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Finding a job with ITE cert really no problem. Often is what you are expecting from it an issue. You cant be expecting to hold an ITE cert while getting deg freshgrad pay... Not everyone so lucky...</p>

              <p>Hey there.</p>
              <p>I know success stories comes with a lot of struggles too.</p>
              <p>I think the right mindset you need to input yourself now is, carving your own path.</p>
              <p>Everyone's path is different and it's how you would like to get yourself there and finding out the interest and most importantly, to be happy in what you do.</p>
              <p>There's people had to succumb to certain types of jobs because it pays them well but some are not happy in what they do but do for the sake - support family? financial issues? etc etc.</p>
              <p>Everyone struggles eventually, if or not how high their education certs that they have. There be some setbacks in your life and you have to overcome that hurdle. </p>
              <p>I have a bunch of friends that only holds an n'levels cert and also struggling as well.</p>
              <p>Some even gotten a stable job even though because of cert, they only been paid at a certain amount but they are happy in what they do. </p>
              <p>You can always opt for options for a private diploma and theres reputable private schools and need to do research on the school etc. </p>
              <p>What i can suggest is, try working for awhile and discover yourself and what you would like to make as a career and what you would like to study and focus on that direction.</p>
              <p>Sometimes the things we plan wont go our way, but do the things you don't regret doing than regretting choices you never try in the first place.</p>
              <p>All the best. </p>
