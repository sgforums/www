              <p>Dude, do you even know what you talking about ? R you just complaining for the sake of complaining. Culture and undesirable human behavior are seperate discussions you know.</p>
              <p>Yes, I get it.. you don't like this feeling of being Overwhelmed 
                      by the Tsunami of those DIRTY and ILL- MANNERED ( not Culture) China 
                      pumpkins invading our Island with the blessing our dear PAP.</p>
              <p>However, You really need to travel outside little red dot more 
                      often, so you can open your eyes to what's happening in many countries 
                      with several generations of Chinese/foreign immigrants.</p>
              <p>Chinese-Singaporean's
                       ancestors came from CHINA. They blended in with local cultures and had 
                      lots of Western Influence because we used to be a BRITISH COLONY.  Go 
                      and read your history books dude.</p>
              <p>Negative influences will fade 
                      away.. cultures take on positive influences because we all want a nice 
                      environment and nice people to hangout with.</p>
              <p>Oppressive, barbaric and unjust practices eventually FADES if 
                      left un-enforced by religious doctrines or fueled by 
                      "political/beureaucratic" hypocrisy.</p>
              <p>Without strict laws/legal obligations and proper education to alter our 
                      behaviors, we coulda be no different from the people you abhor.( whom also shares the same culture as you)</p>
              <p>I suggest you take up Social Science to understand 
                      cultural/social evolution. Sadly, you may never see the same Singapore 
                      you are used to again in your lifetime, because it took several 
                      generations of social evolution to get to where we were 10 years ago.</p>
              <p>The sheer number of China foreigners in our country and the <strong>transient</strong> nature of these workers simply means, it will take an even longer time 
                      for their culture to blend and their behavior to improve.</p>

              in Singapore.</p>
              <p>But I am afraid that this kind of blending would play a negative
              role to the preservation of Chinese culture... and after hundreds
              of year, we may forget our family roots. That is what I am also

              <p>Dude, do you even know what you talking about ? R you just
              complaining for the sake of complaining. Culture and undesirable
              human behavior are seperate discussions you know.</p>
              <p>Yes, I get it.. you don't like this feeling of being Overwhelmed
              by the Tsunami of those DIRTY and ILL- MANNERED ( not Culture)
              China pumpkins invading our Island with the blessing our dear
              PAP.</p>
              <p>However, You really need to travel outside little red dot more
              often, so you can open your eyes to what's happening in many
              countries with several generations of Chinese/foreign
              immigrants.</p>
              <p>Chinese-Singaporean's ancestors came from CHINA. They blended in
              with local cultures and had lots of Western Influence because we
              used to be a BRITISH COLONY.  Go and read your history books
              dude.</p>
              <p>Negative influences will fade away.. cultures take on positive
              influences because we all want a nice environment and nice people
              to hangout with.</p>
              <p>Oppressive, barbaric and unjust practices eventually FADES if
              left un-enforced by religious doctrines or fueled by
              "political/beureaucratic" hypocrisy.</p>
              <p>Without strict laws/legal obligations and proper education to
              alter our behaviors, we coulda be no different from the people you
              abhor.( whom also shares the same culture as you)</p>
              <p>I suggest you take up Social Science to understand
              cultural/social evolution. Sadly, you may never see the same
              Singapore you are used to again in your lifetime, because it took
              several generations of social evolution to get to where we were 10
              years ago.</p>
              <p>The sheer number of China foreigners in our country and the
              <strong>transient</strong> nature of these workers simply means, it
              will take an even longer time for their culture to blend and their
              behavior to improve.</p>

              <p>From the perspective of Cultural Anthropology, migration and assimilation are strongly connected, and there is enough space for the "third culture"— an integration of norms across cultures. But that is the reality. So is the cultural evolution.</p>
              <p>From personal emotion (however accommodative to the social evolution or not), cultural root should also be laid stress on. That's why Mandarin and other dialects are still maintained and widespread used in SGP especailly when English is qualified media language among all ethnic grounps. Actually my question and reply do not refer to wrong or right but personal experience and attitude. Though culture is indeed compatible and evolutive, it does not mean we cannot be nostalgia.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Not long ago, i saw these batch of documentary programs on Channel 8 about foreigners blending in and integrating to Singapore society. Wow, majiam make it as if it is such a proud thing to be able to pick up things in Singapore. I am utterly sicked to the gut.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>How hard is it exactly to blend into Singapore's environment? Singapore got many modern conveniences, things are duno 100 times easier / better than their home country. Whats so hard to get use to? Whats the big deal if they can fit in ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And so what if they can? Just because some red-necked foreigner can integrate into our society, then we would have to accept them here? What kind of nonsensical reasoning is this? Absolutely Ludicrous !!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I come in your house and live with you, i also can blend in one mah. Just that i also take your share of your house's space, food and water. Is that what you want ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Do you want to open your house door and let me in, just because i can integrate in your home? </p>

              <p>Everybody in my family voted for the opposition cept for my dad. Cos hes an RC member and he naively believes that by being a govt lackey allows him conveniences in the business hes running. So why does he always come to me when he needs to do this and that licence/insurance/permit application? Where are those govt conveniences he claims hes getting? And he complains about the govt all the time. I ranted at him for having no backbone and being hypocritical.</p>

              <p>IMHO, the main reason why PAP won the election is because the number of senior citizen votes outnumber the young people votes. They won out of luck.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many senior citizens especially those 60s and above, when they cast their vote, they simply continue their past tradition of voting for PAP because they think it is safe. Only the young people are sensible enough to know what the party is doing to Spore. But i am not sticking my butt around the next 5 years to find out if PAP ever gets taken down. Sorry, i dont have that much youth to spare to wait til then.</p>

              <p><span> Some authorities keep tauting their contributions to our economy, thats their reason for letting more of them in and expect locals to tolerate and accept them.</span></p>
              <p><span> What about contributions made by Singaporeans ? Are they saying Singaporeans contribute LESS than those foreign workers ?</span></p>

              <p>Good point, but be aware that genrally people do the same in other countries too.....and yes that includes us in other countries.</p>
              <p>As mentioned by others, i think the difference here in sgp is that our leaders are in a way more open to selling ourselves - to put it bluntly. If we (sgp) are too strict wih foreigners, then we wouldn't be able to get to where we want to try to get to.</p>
              <p>I think it's fair to say that the objectives of the leaders may not necessarily always reflect those of the people....well at least not as many of them (but still most).</p>
