We like to be able to say - "hey, even if it didn't work out, we're still friends ma, can still be friends right?"  It makes her look magnanimous, and if the ex can't get over her, then her ego is boosted and he is an even bigger loser.</span></strong><br><br>Thus even if she knows very well that she is not interested, she still wants to be in his life, and vice versa - wants him in her life.  <br><br>How should you react to the above?   Well if you're secure enough in the knowledge that she is sensible and fully committed, you may let her have her source of ego trip and just b|tch along.  Then again why leave an opening for people to wreck havock, right?   It's really up to you how strict you wanna be about this, but keep in mind that it's impossible to dictate what company your girl should keep... she may still be in contact with them without your knowing.  And it's too tiring to be suspicious all the time.  Bottomline is, for this matter, better tackle using the soft method rather than hard method.<br><br>Her ex sounds desperate and abit screw loose.  Get back with him to be a surrogate mother / maid?  Just because he can provide transport??  And a guy who's naive enough to expect things to be same as past?    Your girl would be crazy to take him seriously at all . <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">[/b]</blockquote>u sure mah? haha. i'm now wooing my ex back again. and she acts like she doesn't want me to talk to her. but when i ignored her, she became sad and told me she still loves me. i changed alot for her. and i'm very sure i'll remain like this because it has become a habit. haha. i've been giving in to her everytime now. but i'm afraid she'll take me for granted. she says she wanted to patch but something's stoppin her and she doesn't know what it is. hahas. women are too complicated...</div>
