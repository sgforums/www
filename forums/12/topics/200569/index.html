Do not argue or fight because you are jealous.  Emphatise with her cause after all, she did have a relationship with all of them before.  She need not block them off because YOU WANT HER TO.<br>Be a mature guy, listen to her woes, comfort her and love her.  Tell her how you feel and also hear how she feels.  Communications will bring out the better of the relationship.  Good luck.  BTW, marriage will not solve all these problems.</div>
