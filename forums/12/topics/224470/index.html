            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, i am new to this forum. Just got dumped by my gf of half a year and need some advice.<br>The reasons she dumped me was because she felt our interests are different, we quarrel quite often and her parents do not like me. She can't forget some of the things i said when we quarrelled previously and dwells on it.<br><br>She feels i treat her very well (when we are not quarrelling) and she still has 'some' feelings for me. She says she is not seeing any one else and there is no one courting her. I know she is not lying as i know her lifestyle very well which makes it even harder to accept as i feel her reasons are not valid. I have apologised for the things i said when i was angry.<br><br>I thought she needed a cooling period so i waited for two weeks before asking to patch back with her but she refuse and only wants to be friends with me. Even as friends, she does not want to go out with me any more.<br>Because of this my performance at work suffered and i even got called up by my boss as i can't concentrate and made many mistakes at work. I fell into depression and started drinking to try to stop thinking of her.<br><br>I can't forget her even though this happened over a month already, probably because we work together. Can't forget something you see everyday. She will still care for me when she see me moody at work. I thought about resigning but decided it is not worth it and i asked her if she could resign since she was the one who initiated the breakup and put me through so much pain. She refused and we had a big quarrel. I did something quite drastic to make her and me hate each other so now we can't patch back again. We don't even talk when we meet in office. Actually i regreted burning bridges with her but she was heartless to me first.<br><br>Should i quit my job or stay on? How to move on from a relationship that just failed because of some arguements?</div>

I hate this kind of 'ai meh' in office so i had to do something drastic to make her stay away from me at work.<br><br>The reason i asked her to quit was because she said she would quit if i could not stand her anymore in previous arguements, so i held her to her words.<br>I know some of you will still think i am selfish.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tiredcapricorn:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi, i am new to this forum. Just got dumped by my gf of half a year and need some advice.<br>The reasons she dumped me was because she felt our interests are different, we quarrel quite often and her parents do not like me. She can't forget some of the things i said when we quarrelled previously and dwells on it.<br><br>She feels i treat her very well (when we are not quarrelling) and she still has 'some' feelings for me. She says she is not seeing any one else and there is no one courting her. I know she is not lying as i know her lifestyle very well which makes it even harder to accept as i feel her reasons are not valid. I have apologised for the things i said when i was angry.<br><br>I thought she needed a cooling period so i waited for two weeks before asking to patch back with her but she refuse and only wants to be friends with me. Even as friends, she does not want to go out with me any more.<br>Because of this my performance at work suffered and i even got called up by my boss as i can't concentrate and made many mistakes at work. I fell into depression and started drinking to try to stop thinking of her.<br><br>I can't forget her even though this happened over a month already, probably because we work together. Can't forget something you see everyday. She will still care for me when she see me moody at work. I thought about resigning but decided it is not worth it and i asked her if she could resign since she was the one who initiated the breakup and put me through so much pain. She refused and we had a big quarrel. I did something quite drastic to make her and me hate each other so now we can't patch back again. We don't even talk when we meet in office. Actually i regreted burning bridges with her but she was heartless to me first.<br><br>Should i quit my job or stay on? How to move on from a relationship that just failed because of some arguements?</div></blockquote>Haha...Normally I will try to defend men. This time it's different.<br><br>Look, the reason she dumped you was not because of different interest. The reason she dumped you was because she was not interested in you anymore, romantically speaking. A very common excuse eh?<br><br>Take it like a man. Cooling period? Sorry. Once she wants to take a break from you, it is over. This is how the female operates. She don't love you? Then go find another one. No big deal.<br><br>Guy, because you were too uptight. An end to a relationship is the start of a new one. At least you were free from her shackles. See, she dumped you, you felt you treated her too well and you felt you deserved better than this. Ok, fair enough. But it is wrong of you to ask her to quit her job as it has nothing to do with her.<br><br>If I were you, I will continue the job because it showed I will not allow her to upset me. Unless you feel you can earn better somewhere else, you don't really have to resort to quitting your job. Besides, if you can maintain the frienship with your ex, she might even introduce some girls to you. You were too uptight.<br><br>doko</div>

Actually i also know all her reasons are just excuses. When i think about our relationship, it was only good for the first two months, after that it was just quarrelling everyday. I dunno why i clinged on and keep pursuing this relationship, even when i know she is not interested anymore. I realised the more i give in, the more she take me for granted.<br><br>No chance of her introducing friends to me as i know most of them and we not onspeaking terms anymore. Think i will just concentrate on my job and forget about her.</div>

So, you thought she still loved you. It's because you love her a lot, much more than she loved you.<br><br>When you see her, always smile. Apart from that, you give her nothing. Remember, she don't owe you anything and neither do you.<br><br>doko</div>

You need to go out and meet some other girls... not saying you should jump into a r/s immediately, but you are free to date other girls. By doing this, you may be able to find some qualities you found lacking in her that is in other girls, and you may be able to change the ways that you do wrong in the past, so that you can treat other girls better.<br><br>I had an incident in the past where I keep thinking the girl was an angel becos of the how nice she treated me that good few days. Truth is, she was a b!tch for the other few months. Don't make the same mistake as me, move on before all the good memories are consumed by the nightmares she's going to give you, and all is left is the hurt she's given you. At least it was good while it lasted. Pull yourself together!</div>

That's why you see girls make good PR staff. They know how to talk and what to say. But it's a facade. Everyone has two sides. It's whether you can bear with their bad side as a boyfriend. It's whether you think their good side is more than their bad side.<br><br>doko</div>
