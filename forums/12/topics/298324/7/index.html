Originally, i did have sympathy towards Adrian, but, i think you were too extreme and some of your words did condemn all women.<br><br>Yes, women's charter maybe abit out-dated as women are more independent now.  But we can never object to the point that generally women are of the weaker sex despite we may do as well as men, or some better than men in career these days.  But that is only career.  Inherently, women are still more vulnerable.  hence, the need for women's charter to still exist.<br><br>Despite Ivy's tall demands, she did not obtain the alimony that she had wanted.
