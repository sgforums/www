              <p>Jojo....pte tuition for just a handful students is not deemed a tuition center as this is on a small scale basis with no signboard or whatsoevr according to HDB..for U just plugging info from internet from the various sources-SGH,HDB,etc..you're merely generalising.</p>

              <p>787180,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You have gone too far.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I will be in my other office from 7pm to 10pm.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Please call this number: +65 6557 5900 during that time. Ask for Mick.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I shall like to have you verbally tells me what is Ivy's number and will do the contacting and collaboration of the stories for her side to proceed further.  If you want to PM, do so and make sure a cc goes to jojobeach.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So far, I can still confirm that you have not submitted any concrete contact details or information besides that divorce number.  If none is forthcoming, I shall then have to use that divorce number and proceed against Adrian.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Better if we do this now then to let you continue pretending to be some righteous forumer to be posting slandering info about Ivy as well as trying to concoct stories about other forumers here which are frankly what low lifers does.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its already very obvious you are opting to behave like one.  So lets see how far else you want to dig your own grave.</p>

              <p>I was flying around in a airplane and was trying to settle down a bit and didnt checked how far this went.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Following was what 787180 posted that might lead to our uncovering of both Adrain &amp; Ivy as well as the real name of the child.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And since I am posting this out, I am prepared to take on the secondary backlash that this number be traced and a minor be named in public.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Adrian filed for divorce in 2002 and was successful im obtaining the decree nisi absolute on 5 April 2005 under case no.D4350/V."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>787180, I hope you know how to 'support' your Adrian when all shitz hit the fan.</p>
