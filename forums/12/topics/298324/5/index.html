Marriage is a life time commitment between 2 parties.  if things dont work out, and things turn ugly, it could be painful for either or both parties.  It is rarely one sided.<br><br>And like i said, marriages are life time commitments.  You and/or Adrian keep blaming Ivy and his mother, but, has Adrian exercised due care to make sure he was marrying the right girl?  Was he responsible towards himself even?  He married the gal after knowing her only 3 mths.  3 months!  that is a very short time.  How much can a person know another within such a short time?  I am sure Adrian knew the risks of marrying a stranger, but he went along.  So he should be responsible for his action (for marrying a stranger).<br><br>So, stop saying marriage is harmful for men.  Marriage is sacred.  Just cause some people do not respect the institution of marriage and not exercise due care to themselves, and the institution of marriage is blamed for their own carelessness or 'heckcareness'?</div>

We hear you loud and clear, the plight that Adrian went through.  Yes, there probably (if what you said is true) was unfairness and he was in some sympathetic positions.  But by character-bashing ivy and her mother, and blaming women in general for Adrian's mistake for marrying a woman he doesnt even know , it really shows how a extreme a person you are and how not clear-headed you are.<br><br>Actually i am beginning to wonder how you are related to Adrian.  Or are you Adrian himself?</div>

Cos she probably has been brainwashed by him or overcome by her bitterness &amp;/or jealousy that she has bore a hatred for all the women in this world and is maligning all womenkind (of course that includes herself and her mother)!</div>

The root of all this evil is traceable to our system and its antiquated protection of women through the Women Charter. And I can confidently say the rationale and motive behind it all is about vote buying(from women) and revenue collection by our leadership to perpetrate their hold on power in this country. It is not unreasonable to say many of the women judges are prejudiced against men and I can prove it with evidence and status quo in my own case which I won eventually single handedly in the High Court without any lawyers. The whole process breeds contempt and makes a mockery of justice system which is about fairness, justice and equity. Good women when subject to 'rat poisoning' becomes terrible monsters. Given the edge accorded by the law they can become very vicious especially when further taken advantage by greedy lawyers who places the sword in their hands. I take comfort however that more modern and educated women are learning and beginning to realise how destructive and grave the social injustice and thus giving support to a Family Charter which is more beneficial and the building of the family which is the bedrock of our society<br><br>Randolph_scjgyc<br>View Public Profile<br>Send a private message to Randolph_scjgyc<br>Find More Posts by Randolph_scjgyc<br><br></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BTW, I was re-reading everything and noticed the following:<br><br>1) Adrian wants his wife and mother in law dead, so he can take over the care and upbringing of his child so the child will not turn out like his ex wife &amp; grandmother.<br><br>2) Adrian has the choice to pursue the issues about false report made about the rape during the marriage.  Also on the issues of the ex wife's unreasonable harrassment behaviors are as he claimed it was thru the guidance of the mother in law.<br><br>3) Though the ex wife has custody of the child.  In the event that the mother and the grandmother is not suitable parent/ guardian of the child.  Especially if criminal matters has been bought against them.  The custody of the child will go to a more suitable parent. ie Adrian.<br><br>Now. Adrian either needs a better friend, or at least a better lawyer.  Because there is higher chance, thru 787180 actions and possibly Adrian's indiscreetion to be confiding in his so called 'good neighbour &amp; friend'.<br><br>That Adrian is more liable for unreasonable behaviours and is thus no way suitable as a parent even in the event of the ex wife and the mother in law's death.<br><br>I must say, 7871780 is doing a good job right now ensuring that Adrian may never be recognised as a competant parent in more years to come.</div>
