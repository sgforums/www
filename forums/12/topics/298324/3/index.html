            <div class='col-md body'>Adrian is not even aware of the blood disease Thalsimissa until he was going ahead with the divorce and Ivy then disclosed she had this ailment so as to bolster her claims for ailmony and child maintenance of $3700.In fact during the courtship Mother-in-law led Adrian aside and disclosed that her daughter went for liposuction to rempove the fats in her tummy as she had a big tummy since young.In reality Adrian then realised the 2 criss cross in his ex wife's tummy was to remove her spleen as disclosed in the affidavit pursuant to the divorce.The fcat that Ivy without fail everyday including weekends and public holidays went to her mum's place at about 9am and return at night to the matrimonila flat at about 10pm raised doubt in Adrian's mind.He is not medically inclined and speculated that Ivy probably needed to go back to her mum's condo was to secretly pumped blood.Hence there is nothing ficititious but the truth of the story was reported in the Singapore Family Court where Adrian attended about 15 court appearances ranging from child custody,PPO(Police Protection Order),divorce ,request for child visitation ,divorce and ancilliary matters.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> [/b][/quote]<blockquote></blockquote>T<span style="color: green;">[/<span class="large">color]The marriage was a scam right from the start initiated by a daughter and her mum.Why lie to Adrian that it was liposunction about the 2 criss cross on her body instead of being frank that it was a blood disease.Both mum and daughter insisted that it was to remove fats only till the divorce state that it was revealed in the affidavit that it was Thalsemissa.<br><br>Adrian was perectly healthy but Ivy the ex wife is a thalsemissa major so the young child could be a carrier.I write this story after talking to Adrian and he fully agrees that it is ok to let the public be aware that there are such wicked.malicious women existing in S'pore and that the Women's Charter is skewed towards the protection of women is definitely outdated in today's context and it;s due for review ,if not ,more women will use as weapons to get back at their estranged husbands...jojobeach...looks like U're related to these 2 malicious women if not why keep siding them.For me I've nothing to gain but just want to highlight the injustice done to my friend Adrian<br><br>[color=red]</span>What slander? JojoBeach...when all the characters here names have been changed completely although the story is true based on what Adrian has realted to me.<br><br>As a woman,I guess U'll hve difficulty understanding how men had been taken advantage off by the outmoded Women's Charter whose original aim is to protect the illiterate and traditional housewives in the 1960s and my aim is to highlight it has not served its purpose in the 20-21st century in modern Singapore.Many women including foreigners know how to take advantage to get even or spite their estranged husbands.Imagine Ivy just needs to shout abuse and the polce will investigate while Adrian himself has PPO protection from Court.Can recall Adrian spend hours at police cell even though Ivy and her mum falsely accused him of abuse at the Family Service centre when he sought access to visit his young daughter then.Despite the presence of social workers CCTV Adrian was escorted to police to be investigated.Imagine the agony and frustration and in the end Ivy and her mumonly apologised in court to Adrian.<br><br>Ivy and her mum continued to pile on their attacks...she accused him of "raping'her and video taped the scene to force her to give up child custody and the matrimonila flat(she did not pay a single cent and yet demanded 70% share and 70%share of his CPF) when the marriage lasted ,a year.Police investigation showed that Ivy had again made a false police report and the punishment was a stern police warning only..clear-cut bias in favour of the female gender at the expense of men.<br><br>Adrian agreed for me to write this story as his ex father in law died a lonely man in a mental hospital after suffering almost same torment from Ivy's mum(demands for branded goods,landed property,etc)To them marriage is a transaction to exact maximum gains.Do U know why  her mu insisted on a condo when they hve been staying in a rented flat for years.Investigation revealed that her mum wanted to show to her in-laws that she was capable financially but at the expense of soliciting so many relatives to be her guarantors(only one successful) of her bank loan in view of her  retired and poor health status.<br><br>I rest my case as I merely hope this story will help S'pore man to choose thaie wives diligently before saying "I do"<br>.Shakesphere says'I've to be cruel to be kind" ..my aim is only to let general public know that such malicious women exist in modern singapore.JoJo,U're free to invite the 2 women to come onboard to present the case<br><span style="color: red;"></span></span></div>
