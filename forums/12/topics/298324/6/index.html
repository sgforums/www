And how is 78180 confirmed that there is lying on the mothers or even Ivy's part about liposuction.  Was Adrian a virgin and free from any dieseases?  Can 787180 confrm that Adrian submitted a medical report to his spouse when he married thus both side should not have 'lied' about each others condition?<br><br>Second thing, Thalassemia is a blood disorder.  Nothing to do with any surgical procedure.<br><br>Third thing, this blood mutation issue has no bearing on any divorce or alimony or woman's charter in any way.  Neither does it have any bearing or effect in the legal sense on a marriage, unless Adrian is lamenting about his refusal to follow on his oath about 'Thru sickness &amp; in health'?<br><br>You bringing it up, w/o researching it is just plain trying to sensationalize Adrian's stupidity.</div>

Thankfully her husband is not.  And her child was born w/o that gene.<br><br>But there was discussions with other couples who both have that gene and does not reproduce to spare themselves the heartache of a defective child or a possible death by the female who might die during childbirth.<br><br>Of a couple, the females with Thalassemia actually has the risk of death in the event of birthing.<br><br>IF Ivy knew her risks because she knew she has Thalassemia; and yet willing to give birth to hers &amp; Adrians child.

Maybe 787180 might be more helpful to point out the exact amount of the maintenance amount for the child as ordered by the court.<br><br>I am also curious, that 787180 mentioned that Adrian was demanded of $3700 alimony and demanding for A1 class ward for the delivery of a child.<br><br>(By the way, its not known as alimony in sg courts, so 787180 might need to clarify where this term came from.)<br><br>Can I also know. Was the child birthed before the separation/divorce, or it was during that period that divorce petition papers are served on Adrian and Ivy has not given birth?<br><br>Back to the $3700/-.
