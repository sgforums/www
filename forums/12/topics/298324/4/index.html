Isn't the law is to protect both parties?<br><br>In the 1960s yes I agree many women esp the illiterate were left in a lurch after their husbands left them due to abuse,infidelity,etc and hence those poor defenceless souls had to be protected.But in today's context has the women's charter still serve its usefulness..likley to be exploited by the highly educated or vicious wives...even in TCS chinese shows U often hear..never mind divorce the hubby but demand ailmony so as to drag him down as it's the draining of hismoney/wealth that hurts.<br><br>I stand up for s'pore men  and hope the Women's Charter can be made more equitable for both parties but at the same time ensure the female gender that genuinely requires court protection be alloted the help/protection and not just grant PPOs so easily that the estranged husbands will be investigated for every silly acts as complained by the estranged wives...Ivy raided Adrain's flat on 2 consecutive sundays wasting police resources just to collect a packet of 2 AA size batteries and the subsequent sunday just to collect a packet of unused condoms(she claimed she paid for it)..see went to harass poor Adrain just to spike him and the Law allowed that to happen.Ridiculous right..all theses at the expense of men.Let there be justice for S'pore Man in marital disputes<br></div></blockquote>As a woman, I have personally seen how a man also tormented his wife when she asked for a divorce.<br><br>So, when it comes to the authorities, they don't differentiate treatment based on gender.<br><br>So in simple words.<br><br>You just want the one with higher earning power to pay alimony irregardless of gender. Correct ?<br><br>And irregardless of gender, ALL assets acquired DURING the marriage should be treated as community assets.<br><br>Is our society ready for such laws ?<br><br>When.....<br>Majority of our SG men are not uneducated.<br>And SG is not a female dominated society, yet.<br>Most of the men earns a higher income compared to their wives. ( this needs to be verified with proper statistics)<br><br>You do know this is how US of A goes about their divorce ways.<br>And their divorce rates are 50% ?<br><br>Are the SG men/women ready to switch family roles ?<br><br>And are the SG guys/girls ready to ask for pre-nuptials agreements before asking " Will you marry me?" or saying " I do" ?.<br><br>Will it also increase the numbers of co-hab and unmarried couples with kids ?<br><br>Will we see a spike in unmarried lower income men ?<br><br>There are good and there are bad.<br>We don't mind embracing the good , but you may want to study also the social ills that comes with such changes.<br><br>Lastly, why do men needs to rely so heavily on family laws to protect themselves against money diggers ?<br><br>Couldn't they just exercise some good judgments before taking the woman as his wife ?<br><br>Now, you mentioned Ivy forced Adrian to sell the flat at a loss.<br><strong>In the end, did Adrian sell the flat at a loss ?</strong><br>How can Ivy claim anything if there is a net loss ?<br><br>FYI: Amount claim has to be the NET profit, NOT the selling price. ( NOTE)<br><br>See, the reason why I find this story hokey ?<br><br>Now, if Adrian feels that he should be entitled to 1/3 share of the Condo.<br><br>Has he considered what is the true net worth of that piece of property ?<br>If Ivy has to sell it at a loss, is Adrian going to bear part of the loss too ?<br>Somebody still has to pay the remaining bank loan you know ???<br><br>In my opinion, you are taking a very simplistic approach to the issue.<br><br>In a real divorce, there is no such thing as "convenient."<br><br></div>
