            <div class='col-md body'>Been happening with a lot of thing since I entered in my current unit. It is a long story. F*uk, I take Medical Appointment during execise cut , people say they are unhappy and my "so called" buddy keep pissing me off sometimes by saying words like "fire him, he lousy" All this happended straight after the major exercise so I was thinking all these people in the dept must be to use me before killing me. Funny thing is when it is their buddies who go for Medical Apointment, no one say anything, everyone so happy. I also knew a few bastards who always talk behind people back, kept saying this guy bad but he still make good friends with him. My warrent warn me that this dept has actors and react-ors . When I am working like a bloody fool, nobody cares, when I get something extra benefit, people kept gossiping about it. unfair this unfair that.<br><br>Really feel like posting out . when requested  to do so, officers kept pulling me back saying that he need me and help your understudy. I feel like being used all along and thrown away. I still got 2 mths left to clearing leave. is it still possible to post out to another dept. Really sickening all this people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>HAiz, it doesn't pay to be kind. I always told him that you are lucky to find me a good understudy to teach you everything I know. BUt he always go up when the work is done and only come down when I call him. Everything also press button to move, a bit pek chey. Last time, my upperstudy after I finished learning, everything all throw to me until the day he ORD. Life is too tough for me. SOmetimes I have to run here run there just to do multiple jobs at one time and up and down the stairs 20+ times a day. I was on duty somemore. Those were the days. My understudy likes to act smart. Very Pek Chey</div>
