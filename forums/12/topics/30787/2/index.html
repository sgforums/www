            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know. I mean if they did it once, who knows there might be a second during your marriage perhaps ? you never know. I just find it hard to trust. I once devoted whatever free time I had to this girl 24/7 who once said she liked me. After 6 months and she decided to presue some other guy. Of course I never confess my love for her because I knew it wasn't gonna work out. But the very fact she act as if its perfectly normal is just too much for me.<br><br>I don't really give a damn about the virginity thing. But the thought of her sleeping with someone else before kinda disgust me.<br><br>Imagine 1 fine day the both of you walk the streets of the city just finishing a romantic dinner and right that moment you run into her ex,<br><br>"Hey ! hows it going man ! I slept with your wife before ! Man, she was good in bed"<br><br>"At first I thought I was in love.... it was so real.. and I knew we could be together forever.... Boy was I a dumbass!"<br><br>Qoute from Get over it.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Kinda think of it, I once read the newpaper and this story interest me.<br><br>Its about this couple having a wedding thingy going on at the in-law's house or something. This photographer was taking photos for the couple when the bride had to retreat to her room to do the make up and stuff. So basically everyone were outside. The photographer "claimed he needed to take some photos of the bride" and so he entered the room. There she lay on her chair "surprised" to see the photographer in her room.<br><br>He took a couple of photos and asked the bride if he could "help her" with the dress as it was "somehow out of place". She agreed. He run his hands through her chest area as "claimed by him" as he was "merely adjusting" her whatever. He than bent down and adjusted her garter and the most interesting thing is the bride "claimed she was shocked" and yet "did nothing" about it.<br><br>She could had resisted ? Shout ? or jab a knife into the guy's ears ? And what can the guy do ? use the camera and kill her ? She's got an entire battalion out there ready to charge in there and smash the jerk's head through the wall.<br><br>Obviously the newpaper adopted a more sarcastic approach the way the report was written. 5 yr old kids could tell what the hell's going through the photographer's head.</div>
