            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Magnus:<br>I have read MÂ©'s thread link.<br><br>My thoughts are True Love or Perfect love is borne out of the universal theme of selflessness. That's why it "stays where it is".<br>Maybe it comes to a point where even words are too superficial to decribe it (at least for me). It had to be exprienced. Be it a lifetime committment or just a blink of the eye, it's eternity.<br><br>As for "humans alters and changes it as they desires"<br>, due to our imperfect selves, our immaturity, self-preservation, circumstances  etc..we will precieve and/or act the way we want it to be. We will be bias (and so, a balance is needed?).<br><br>Sometimes we will even chase that elusive True Love to the extend of self destruction, and even to die for it.</blockquote>In other words, Love is like an elephant, and we humans are but blind men feeling different parts of the elephant? So the question that follows is: Is selfless love the ultimate big picture?<br><br>I personally subscribe to the school of thought that love can be classified into 3 categories: Eros, Philia and Agape (they could be different parts of the elephant).<br><br>Your definition of True Love or Perfect Love seems to match very closely with Agape (Paul also talked about Love in this sense in his letter to the Corinthians), but such True Love is a concept of a higher spiritual level that is difficult to understand and even more difficult to act in accordance with. That is because the selfless nature of Agape appears to violate our instinctive nature for self-preservation and actions in self-interest. And that is also why that particular definition of love can remain universal and ageless: people who cannot live it cannot twist it to their perceptions; people who can live it no longer consider the definition relevant -- they just live it.<br><br>Love, as described in most threads here however, is only limited to Eros and sometimes Philia. Those two concepts could be easier to grasp, but problem is the boundaries are often vague and subject to personal and emotional bias. Hence, we may know what Love (especially in terms of Eros) is, but to understand Love within this scope, to study its workings and effects on humans, to explain why humans in Love do the things they do would be an exercise in futility as such Love simply defies rational scrutiny.<br><br>The point is: For common peons like myself, Love (Agape) is almost unattainable (at this point in life) that understanding it becomes rather meaningless; whereas Love (Eros/Philia) is too irrational to be understood. Though I'd much rather choose to be in Love (Eros/Philia) and remain blissfully ignorant, than to be in Love (Agape) and become spiritually enlightened. For now, at least. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Thanks for the explanations, anyway. It was a stimulating discussion.<br><br><span class="small">Note: Some people have told me that Agape could co-exist with Eros/Philia, but that is perhaps a discussion better left for another day.</span></div>
