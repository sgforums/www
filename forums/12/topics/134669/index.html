            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps i think you should leave him and move on. Hes giving you the answer already "Don't blame me if i go stray". I suppose hes looking for a partner right now who can give him SEX.<br><br>It doesn't matter how much you love him in this case cuz it doesn't make sense to him. The defination of "LOVE" to him is to screw you. Passionate or not is one thing, there could be more than sex in a r/s.<br><br>If he insists, leave him. You deserve someone better. He does not respect you. I'm a guy, i know.. he'll start preying till he gets one tht suit his needs. Such guys are seeking fun, the more you dunwanna have sex; he'll try his best to physcho you to do so. Bottom line is: If love really play a part here, he wouldn't be demanding things from you and worse insist the things u do you won't regret.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

And, we will end up quarreling again.<br><br>I know he is desperate and from what I observe from the forum, a lot of guys are like him. In fact, girls too. I am not sure if I should leave him. He tried to change my mentality in a lot of ways, to the extent of using 3rd party to threaten me. He has stopped doing that after after a big fight. Now, he just dun update me about the 3rd party anymore.<br><br>And, I haven't been meeting him on sats. He said he does not even look forward to meet me anymore.<br><br>I dunno if he is trying to make me feel guilty for making him suffer like that. Sometimes, he says that I should marry a monk or my nerdy frens and I will get really angry. But at the end of every quarrel, he will call me and we will be alright until the daily conversation starts again. sigh..</div></blockquote>than when when u disagree to have sex with him.. he no longer put u in priority?
