To give is often certain degree of sacrifice, while to receive is merely to receive the goodness of what your partner/relationship has to offer. Regardless of the type of principles involved, an unbendable rule (e.g. against pre-marital sex) clashing against one who desire what you are against, jammed up this system and causes continual conflicts.<br><br>When your boyfriend's clarity returned, he probably would feel that 'he would try to respect your wishes.' This is a form of sacrifice on his part and would term as 'giving' in it's own meaning. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I am kinda flabbergasted to learn that he said this to you:<br><br><blockquote><strong>He says that next time if he strays, it is my fault.</strong></blockquote>This goes beyond the theory of giving and receiving - it's intimating and demanding. And a complete lame excuse, stated in advance, to 'protect' his own self-absorbed interest when this actual occasion arises. He had previous sexual activities with his 'sexy' ex-gf back then and because they played him, he prefer someone more down to earth like yourself currently. I don't know if you have already made known to him that you are conversative by nature, but because you demonstrate the kinda of quality he is looking for NOW: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>what comes together, comes in a package.</strong></span><br><br><blockquote><strong>He wants to settle down with a "proper" girl and "gentle" girl.</strong></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You want a proper girl, yet you don't want the 'proper' girl to be proper. (I am not saying people who indulge in pre-marital sex are not proper, rather, it's a similar expression of saying a man who demanded a virgin wife, yet wants her to be a sex goddess). Kinda wtf.<br><br>So what if the relationship is four years? So what if you are already in your late twenties? Basically, all these figures don't really matter much without your personal 'love investment' consideration for this relationship. You are with a bf who introduces a third party into the relationship, causing serious upheaval, JUST because he wants to change your mindset about pre-marital sex. Let me ask you: would things be very different if you were to change your mindset back then?<br><br>What will change? In fact, nothing much.<br><br>It's no longer about the sex issue - <strong>it has bring forth new factors that has almost eliminated the pre-marital sex problem in your relationship</strong>: The empathy, trust, foundation and everything else in the relationship have shook violently, leaving a trail of smoky dust, bearing pure evidences of how weak your relationship is.<br><br>Let me tell you, ANY one girl would have the ability to destroy your relationship. Even if they don't, you wouldn't have that power to endure affairs-of-your-man for long.<br><br>You need more than just communication - its almost like rules stating. You present your personal proposal on what you expect in a BGR, against what he sees in one. Learn to suck-it-up and compromise or die in the process. If certain critical clauses are left in a stalemate, congrats him on his future relationship and bid him farewell.<br><br>P.S: If you two are not looking in the same direction, its kinda difficult to substain your relationship ultimately, even if the relationship continues to run. Same direction as in having good knowledge of how your OWN relationship works and work around it. If you have to end a relationship, dragging it served as a burden for everyone involved. That may not be a product of love - more like insecurity and fear to move on.<br><br>You got to know the difference. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Heh Â…. I guess most of the thing I wanted to say had being said. Well Dreamlander it is up to you to whather or not to accept everyone advices. No one in this forum can tell you what to do. It is up to entirely up to make the final decision. Remember .. when making a decision always keep to your principle. And also remember there is no such thing as true right and wrong. The world is grey and what fits your way of life and principle is the best way to make decisions.<br><br>And if I am right your principle is against pre-material sex. So used that as your strength and standing point to make the next move. U must understand and accept the choice of consequence u made. If u go against your principle and have sex. U must be ready to accept the possible rash reality that may follow up. He might dump you after having sex with you. But again if that did not happen and he stick with u, that will be great. But again u must ask .. are u betraying yourself?<br><br>To be frank no one can save you or ever help you but yourself. As a saying, all the problems in the world can be solved by the person in the mirror.  I know you are afraid of making the wrong decision but again these are paths of life which some of us must take it alone. The choices taken may be wrong but mistakes serve to make us stronger. All of us make mistakes and I are one of those who made almost thousands of mistakes. Instead of crying over split milk, just pick yourself up and find the next path to live a fruitful life. If u do not make the final decision , u will continue to suffer a prolonged suffering just like a hare ensnared in a net where it keep running in circles, afraid but dun know what to do. Take your time to think about it, but u MUST reach a final decision  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Just adding a bit from my read, I felt that your relationship and your bf is just like a master and slave scenario. I felt that he needs you in a sense of self regarding and security. He acts like the master and demand thing from you for you are the slave. His strength comes from you submitting to him. But you still have some power over him (not allowing him sex) If u give him the things he want, u complete the cycle of master and slave and you totally lost out. So giving the sex he wanted, he wins.<br><br>Good luck!!!<br><br>Cheers<br></div>

Into a "proper" guy... we ended up being "freaks" and "weirdos" in each other's world.<br><br>I tried to show him my definition of romanticism...it need not be steamy,passionate...just dinner at a restaurant, singing, going for day trips, holding hands, hugs..all which he has lost interest...in his terms...those are the things I like to do..what about the things he likes?<br><br>He said that I needed a fren, a soulmate. He just needed a simple, passionate girl, maybe even a vietnamese bride.<br><br>In a way, I'm glad that he is frank about his feelings throughout the whole relationship. It's hurting to know that he was extremely frustrated about being the loser among his frens, felt tempted when the 3rd party appeared.<br>I feel like the naggy,boring housewife who has lost to some wild, young things in the jungle. Why has love become such a battle? Fighting for my beliefs, fighting to be myself, fighting some 3rd party who keeps tempting him. Fighting to keep his feelings...<br><br>I feel so tired... I was devastated when I tried to leave him.. the tots of him being with other girls... and doing the stuff which I refused totally puts the balance off me. I went back to him for fear that he will really abandon me and do those stuff with other girls.<br><br>It doesn't help that my temper is getting from bad to worse with all the frustrations at work. I feel so tormented each time our daily conversation revolves around that topic and nothing else. I can't confide in him about work cos he doesn't emphatise. He can't tell me about his fantasies cos I refused to participate...I know it's normal for guys to do that..perfectly well but I just find it hard to be part of it.. does it get a bit of using to?<br><br>I'll try to gather your advices and think through the whole thing...again. Hopefully I can be brave enough to face whatever may be. </div></blockquote>Maybe now you should re-evaluate your this r/s again and how much it means to you. But then again do consider clearly cause people like us (third parties) can't see what's going on in your r/s and all we see are texts that you wrote. He sounded like a good bf though in your this post with all the send you home blah blah blah kind of stuffs. Sex or not before marriage is something to be discussed between you two and still shouldn't be the reason for a break off unless you tell me you two are already married and still there's no sex life between you two.<br><br>Give a good thought about it. Do not rush into a decision whereby you know you'll regret later. Anyway, I still don't agree that he should use straying out as a threat to make you have sex with him. Sex between a couple should be consenses between both and make it a beautiful process.</div>

It won't be fair to your bf as well. But putting myself in a woman's shoe, I don't think I'll want a bf who can easily say such things to me just because I refuse sex before marriage.
