He opt for a more proper gf, opposite to what he has been going after, as he deems that it is less likely for her to hurt him while he has the ability to hurt her back.<br><br>There is no longer any other form of communication beside the topic on having sex. There is difficulty for the mind of the 2 of u to meet since as u 2 are at the different end of the line. With this topic ard there is no room for any other forms of communictaion. DO u think ur r/s can grow healthily from here?<br><br>U both tried to convert each other to ur ways. How permanent could the change be if it was a direct conflict against ur belief? For eg. u decided to give in to him and have sex with him. He stays with u, no more arguments abt pre-marital sex anymore. Will u still be able to love urself? How will u see urself? Will u ever enjoy when having sex with him from then on?<br><br>When mind differ, everyone is a partial alien to everyone else. Just like different races aee each other differently. (i am not trying to be racist, jus an example.) So there will be pple who shares ur views to certain extent.

            <div class='col-md body'>Dreamland, what I am about to say may offend you so I apologise before you read on.<br><br>I am female and have had my fair share in relationships as well. I am no younger or older than you are and hence I do share some of your perspectives as well as some of your boyfriend's.<br><br><strong>In all frankness, I believe you no longer feel as deeply for him.</strong> In fact, I may suspect that you've hung on to him for practical / social / realistic / psychological reasons other than for love. Not that these reasons are invalid but that, love &amp; feelings should reign above and over any other factors should you decide to stay with a person for the next 60 years or so.<br><br>Why do I say so? Naturally, given biological chemical reactions intensify by your 'strong' emotions for a man you love,  there is no boundary in the things you are willing to do for him.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">To clarify, I am not saying that you should satisfy him with penetrative sex, but if you do love him with all your mind, soul and also - your body, your body languages will tell. </span>HJ, BJ or kisses will naturally be more intense and no one needs a teacher in sexual intimacy with a partner he/she feels passionately for.<br><br>Furthermore, from what I have read in your account, you strive for mental and emotional support above anything else and yet, he is unable to satisfy you. This is as much a hindrance to you as to how the lack of sexual intimacy baffles him.<br><br>Why then is it unbearable for you to leave him? Many reasons (eg. possessiveness, jealousy, habitual reliance and other practical / social reasons) may explain but your inability to leave him need not and does not prove that you still love him.<br><br>I respect your boyfriend for his honesty and though his words are harsh and unbearable, he has laid the cards out clearly for you.<br><br>I am sure you know that if you continue to abide by his rules, you will  suffer further in the end. So, if you ignore all these tell-tale signs and go ahead with marrying him lawfully, you've just done a stupid in the name of love, but is it really for love?<br><br>All the best for any decision you will be making or not making.</div>

Once you give in, he will leave. 99% confirm and 1% that he finds he is gay.<br>the only reason for daily dosage of his psychological attack is your body, not your  heart.<br><br>My conclusion: He does not know how to love you or anybody esle. You are just a  tool for his arrogance, pride and ego. Leave him while you can. No, RUN.</div>
