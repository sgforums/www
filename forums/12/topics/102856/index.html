Just that in your case, its is unfortunate that things happened at the same time. Try to tackle them one at a time. Think too much of it wont hepl u much either.<br><br>Be brave to face ur problems and conquer them. I believe its the change of environment that caused u to be stressed up. =)</div>

When you clump everything together, it looks hopeless, and you get tired just thinking and looking at it, and end up doing nothing.<br><br>How many times have we seen our table being so messy, and just say 'Sian, so many things to do. So many things to clear.. i'll never get it done.' (And hence one of the mysteries of procrastination is solved). But IF you tackle it one by one, instead of letting life unfairly clump everything together, you'll stand a chance.<br><br>1. Your grandma's death.<br>Death is a hard thing to accept. Even after living through 2 friends who committed suicide, i must say i really wouldn't want to go through another, but i'm side-tracking.<br>Only time can heal this wound. Getting yourself busy with stuff helps, but in time it will heal...<br><br>2.  GF.<br>What can i say? Perhaps you could have seen it coming, then again, maybe not. What's done is done, just forget about her. If you can get the money back, then good. If not.. *shrugs* It depends on how much you need the money, and since it looks like you need it a lot. Keep calling her. Since its a loan from you right? All loans should be repaid.<br><br>3. Money.<br>If you really have no choice, maybe you could resort to lending from friends and relatives, but this is only temporary...<br><br>The main problem i see here is your job. These problems add up, and is affecting your job. Try to focus on your job when you're working, and think about your other things when you're not.<br><br>As i said, don't lump everything together. Life is strange and cruel, when you don't need something, it comes. When you need something alot, it never will.<br><br>Lastly, do you have a religion? Talking to fellow religion mates, or friends about this will help alot.<br><br>Hope i'm able to help in some way..</div>

Normally when you start work at ur new work place, you have to get use to the environment and that takes time. I know you are depressed over what has happened to you lately but you have to seperate from personal and work. When you are in the office working, try to focus on your work and dun let your personal problems affect ur work performance in your new company. It's very crucial as you just joined and your performance is being monitored by your superior.<br><br>In life, it's like a cycle. Humans come into this world and leave eventually when they grew old. It's part and parcel of life which you can't change it. Girls? They are important but they aren't everything to a man! Right now you have to focus on your work, work hard but work smart too. Prove to your employer that you are an employee worth keeping! When a girl left you, there's bound to have dozens of reasons which sometimes you can never find out. But dun let this affect you in looking for another relationship! Concentrate on your career and build it up slowly. When your career is stablise, you have no worries in looking for a new gf.<br><br>Everyone has financial difficulties including me. But life has to move on. You can't let this affect you from living in this world and to survive. There are ups and downs in life which sometimes we have to make an effort to make it right. Although it's a bit hard but we have to persevere. Nothing is impossible in this world! You have to do your own thinking in what you want in life and what you want for your future. Dun let ppl make decisions for you. You make it yourself!</div>
