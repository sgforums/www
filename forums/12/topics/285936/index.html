Most superiors claim that they are transparent, so let see how transparent are they?<br><br>Unity is the name of the game here, once your team is united, you can be sure the management will listen to you, however management will alway, i repeat again, will alway back and support their managers, as these managers are what they deem managerial staff supporting them. So, it does need a tremedous effort in convincing the higher managment that your team is indeed in trouble with such manager.<br><br>Remember, Leader rule by his action and responsibility, Manager can just rule by authority ya. So a manager does not necessary to be a good leader, he manage with authority over you is more than enough to make you suffer. But given a manager with good leadership will be a great bonus to all.<br><br>Having said all, all of you are wage earners including the line managers, you got the right to seek the rightful way of work. When you speak to the higher management, alway take the company future growth as the main objective. Higher echelon like me like to hear such commitment. Nevertheless, there is another method which some of us adopted, ie , if you can beat him, join him, know him, then slowly destroy him. Ah! working politics, so cruel.<br><br>666<br>Angel<br>Director<br><br></div>
