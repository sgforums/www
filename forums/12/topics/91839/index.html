            <div class='col-md body'>I am in my early 20s. I had this gf who is a scropian. Very attitude. But i dont have a good temper whenever things doesnt go my ways. We were together for 4months plus, endless of quarrel because i admit i was very unreasonable sometime. So we broke up. But i cant forget her. I know i found her and i wouldnt want to lose her. I promise her i will change.<br>i kept a diary accounting the days we spent together and my thoughts. For that 1 month after breakup, i tried all means to give her the diary through my friends. She missed me during this 1 month but didnt dare to contact me because she thought i hate her over the breakup. I finally managed to send through postage to her house after 1 month. When she finished reading the diary. SHe messaged me that she loves me. The next time i saw a total turnaround from her. She claimed she do not want patch anymore because she doesnt want to hurt me even more intense if we patch back. The next day we met up with her and her friends. I showed the message to her friend which she claimed was just only a simple message and she doesnt mean anything. I tried all means to convince her that i still love her but she just rejected it and even told me she was attached for 1 week and was impossible she will break up wif him but be with me again. So i walked away.<br>The next day i had an operation and i told her i didnt have any confidenace in the operation and would hope she will say I LOVE YOu to me again one last time in case anything happpened during the operation and she obliged and even admitted that she actually wanted to patch back with me but trying to resist it which she succedd and also admitted she still has feeling for me till now. After my operation, she tried to comfort me while i was in pain.<br>I asked her to visit me at my house. SHe asked her friend along. She told her friend that she doesnt want me to mistaken that she still have feeling for me so she only wants to visit for awhile and wants her friend to drag her away if she wants to stay longer. While she was in my house, she asked me whether have i eaten my medcine, she helped me to clear my room and washed the plates in the basin. I send her to her bussttop after that. Her friend walked away but with me on crutches, i was not able to catch u wif her friend but she was walking bside me at my pace. After she boarded the bus, she messaged me. She admitted that she trying to keep a distance fro me because she scare she will fall back in love with me. I really dont understand why she treating me llike this. Has this love really ended just like that ?  Recently i made a website for her with al our pictures taken together in it but she doesnt seems touched at all.<br>Can someone tell me what to do ? Pls dont tell me to give up i will not.<br>I really need good advice on what to do next to touch her again.<br>Thanks<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>rid off your temper and stop being unreasonable. U must know that any promises now can't give her any INSTANT assurance that u wun revert back to your old-self again. That probably explains her fear coupled with the wounds from endless quarrels.<br><br>Dun keep asking her to patch back. Take this time to change yourself. Communication and understanding of one another will prevent more quarrels...<br><br>Only time will let her know whether u really mean what u had promised.</div>

Look at the countless quarrels which you 2 had. Who it have been better that you 2 sometimes sit down and talk things over quietly than having to quarrel?<br>You have done what you can to try to win her back.. Diaries send etc.. From my stand point, I can say that she is not ready to go back to you as she is very very confused.. Why don you give her time to think it thorugh? There are alot of points which are being contradicted by her.. E.g, She missed you for that 1 month.. and she don dare to call you?<br><br>Its more like an excuse to you rather than a reason.. I believe the part where she said she had a boyfriend? Its more like something she wanna tell you to "forget abt her" sort of thinking.<br><br>Saying I love you before you going for an operation and such are more like ways you wanna cheat yourself.. Yes, she went your house and look you up after the op. Look at it this way.. She has said that she scared that she is keeping a distance from you cause she scared she will fall back in love with you.. What does that show? She has feelings for you still.. The "bf" thing maybe a hoax or even if she really has one.. she MAY BE using him as a substitude for you..<br><br>Advice to you is why not you 2 give each other some time.. Come out one day.. Talk it nicely through.. This sort of things.. the more u rush, the worst it is.. Both of you i believe are still very young.. Don rush.. and PLEASE CHANGE YOUR TEMPER if you really love her.<br><br>"an egg which is thrown at a stone will surely crack"  or rather 2 angers together will create disasters..</div>

You are just fighting to resist getting used to life without her and of course, with unsettled feelings, your craving to get back to the relationship is strong.<br><br>We all understand and KNOW that irregardless of how sh!t a relationship will become in the future, we all do enjoyed a sweet past somehow or another in the past. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">But should we use such benchmark as a reason WHY a relationship should get back?</span> All I see is a child denied of his toy and frantically trying all his ways to get them back - your relationship lack substantial reasons why it should return.<br><br>You are unreasonable and she as well - which ultimately causes your break-up. So I believe you will be telling me that you will change and all that? In my experience (you could even look through all past aunt agony topic), such statement rarely secure the kind of vision you had for your relationship, now. <strong>Change is a short-term solution to relationship issue</strong> - to substain improvement, you have to evolve (and yes, there is a whole lot of difference between these two words). Evolving is a long term process - people don't get enlightened overnight. Ask anyone around and when they share with you their thoughts - you know where they are coming from. THAT is evolvement from their personal experience - change is talk and candleflame.<br><br>I can say you are incredibly smart in a way - subconsciously, the method you use to try to re-woo her, works well against her. A Scorpio - intense, emotional and packed. And if you can probably win her, can you substain till the next rough tide that hits onto your ship? Do you even know what went wrong in the relationship, that leaves it with no choice but to break-up? It is <strong>MERELY</strong> personality conflicts? Or is there more? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Take some time to cool off yourself instead of trying to cling onto the last desperate part of the ship. Continue your method to woo her back, I can only predict your next setback on the 3rd and 6th month of your relationship, again.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Kennerve:</div><div class="quote_body">From where I read your story, its more like you 2 are not even ready for a relationship.. 4 months together is a very short period of time.. Look at the countless quarrels which you 2 had. Who it have been better that you 2 sometimes sit down and talk things over quietly than having to quarrel?<br>You have done what you can to try to win her back.. Diaries send etc.. From my stand point, I can say that she is not ready to go back to you as she is very very confused.. Why don you give her time to think it thorugh? There are alot of points which are being contradicted by her.. E.g, She missed you for that 1 month.. and she don dare to call you?<br><br>Its more like an excuse to you rather than a reason.. I believe the part where she said she had a boyfriend? Its more like something she wanna tell you to "forget abt her" sort of thinking.<br><br>Saying I love you before you going for an operation and such are more like ways you wanna cheat yourself.. Yes, she went your house and look you up after the op. Look at it this way.. She has said that she scared that she is keeping a distance from you cause she scared she will fall back in love with you.. What does that show? She has feelings for you still.. The "bf" thing maybe a hoax or even if she really has one.. she MAY BE using him as a substitude for you..<br><br>Advice to you is why not you 2 give each other some time.. Come out one day.. Talk it nicely through.. This sort of things.. the more u rush, the worst it is.. Both of you i believe are still very young.. Don rush.. and PLEASE CHANGE YOUR TEMPER if you really love her.<br><br>"an egg which is thrown at a stone will surely crack"  or rather 2 angers together will create disasters..</div></blockquote>But problem is i just wan to find up whether izzit a hoax or not. But i just cant seems to think of any ways to dig that information out from her. Since she keep on insist she has a bf.<br>She didnt tell me she misses me for that 1 month, i known it from my other friends. She only told me that she dont dare to call me becos she tot she hurts me alot. She scare by being together again i will get more hurt n she wouldnt want it to happen anymore.<br>She is a good and devoted gf. Because she has a bf yet tell me that she loves me. She is not that type of ger. That why i am very suspcious that she has a bf which she insisted. When she read the diary i sent her, she cried. She wanted to return a ring that i gave her, but i told her to keep it which she did too.<br>Sighhzz.. I cant walk now. I cant go out since i am no MC. i Dont know what to do except staring at a PC and the ceiling. SHe said i can call her if i am bored but i dun dare becos i might say the wrongs things again.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have to say ya not ready for any relationship, try not to rush things too fast, I can sense she doing out of sympathy. Btw, I can sense not all of the above mentioned is truth. Well, like what one of the chatter says," stay out of MRT tracks." Please don't live in illusions anymore, you needa get out and touch da world. Cheers!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dun think it's sympathy, maybe your diary invoke guilt in her?<br>That's why even though the r/s is not going for both of u guys, but after reading the diary, she felt she 'owe' you?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by december:</div><div class="quote_body">I am in my early 20s. I had this gf who is a scropian. Very attitude. But i dont have a good temper whenever things doesnt go my ways. We were together for 4months plus, endless of quarrel because i admit i was very unreasonable sometime. So we broke up. But i cant forget her. I know i found her and i wouldnt want to lose her. I promise her i will change.<br>i kept a diary accounting the days we spent together and my thoughts. For that 1 month after breakup, i tried all means to give her the diary through my friends. She missed me during this 1 month but didnt dare to contact me because she thought i hate her over the breakup. I finally managed to send through postage to her house after 1 month. When she finished reading the diary. SHe messaged me that she loves me. The next time i saw a total turnaround from her. She claimed she do not want patch anymore because she doesnt want to hurt me even more intense if we patch back. The next day we met up with her and her friends. I showed the message to her friend which she claimed was just only a simple message and she doesnt mean anything. I tried all means to convince her that i still love her but she just rejected it and even told me she was attached for 1 week and was impossible she will break up wif him but be with me again. So i walked away.<br>The next day i had an operation and i told her i didnt have any confidenace in the operation and would hope she will say I LOVE YOu to me again one last time in case anything happpened during the operation and she obliged and even admitted that she actually wanted to patch back with me but trying to resist it which she succedd and also admitted she still has feeling for me till now. After my operation, she tried to comfort me while i was in pain.<br>I asked her to visit me at my house. SHe asked her friend along. She told her friend that she doesnt want me to mistaken that she still have feeling for me so she only wants to visit for awhile and wants her friend to drag her away if she wants to stay longer. While she was in my house, she asked me whether have i eaten my medcine, she helped me to clear my room and washed the plates in the basin. I send her to her bussttop after that. Her friend walked away but with me on crutches, i was not able to catch u wif her friend but she was walking bside me at my pace. After she boarded the bus, she messaged me. She admitted that she trying to keep a distance fro me because she scare she will fall back in love with me. I really dont understand why she treating me llike this. Has this love really ended just like that ?  Recently i made a website for her with al our pictures taken together in it but she doesnt seems touched at all.<br>Can someone tell me what to do ? Pls dont tell me to give up i will not.<br><span style="color: blue;">I really need good advice on what to do next to touch her again.</span>Thanks<br></div></blockquote>None. Why would you wanna gte her back again to complicate things? Besides... What was caught within your previous relationship is probably still unsettled for and would snowball into your next relationship with her if there really is one... Only which... To add.. Things should be much more complicated...</div>
