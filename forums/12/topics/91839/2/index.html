Very attitude. But i dont have a good temper whenever things doesnt go my ways. We were together for 4months plus, endless of quarrel because i admit i was very unreasonable sometime. So we broke up. But i cant forget her. I know i found her and i wouldnt want to lose her. I promise her i will change.<br>i kept a diary accounting the days we spent together and my thoughts. For that 1 month after breakup, i tried all means to give her the diary through my friends. She missed me during this 1 month but didnt dare to contact me because she thought i hate her over the breakup. I finally managed to send through postage to her house after 1 month. When she finished reading the diary. SHe messaged me that she loves me. The next time i saw a total turnaround from her. She claimed she do not want patch anymore because she doesnt want to hurt me even more intense if we patch back. The next day we met up with her and her friends. I showed the message to her friend which she claimed was just only a simple message and she doesnt mean anything. I tried all means to convince her that i still love her but she just rejected it and even told me she was attached for 1 week and was impossible she will break up wif him but be with me again. So i walked away.<br>The next day i had an operation and i told her i didnt have any confidenace in the operation and would hope she will say I LOVE YOu to me again one last time in case anything happpened during the operation and she obliged and even admitted that she actually wanted to patch back with me but trying to resist it which she succedd and also admitted she still has feeling for me till now. After my operation, she tried to comfort me while i was in pain.<br>I asked her to visit me at my house. SHe asked her friend along. She told her friend that she doesnt want me to mistaken that she still have feeling for me so she only wants to visit for awhile and wants her friend to drag her away if she wants to stay longer. While she was in my house, she asked me whether have i eaten my medcine, she helped me to clear my room and washed the plates in the basin. I send her to her bussttop after that. Her friend walked away but with me on crutches, i was not able to catch u wif her friend but she was walking bside me at my pace. After she boarded the bus, she messaged me. She admitted that she trying to keep a distance fro me because she scare she will fall back in love with me. I really dont understand why she treating me llike this. Has this love really ended just like that ?  Recently i made a website for her with al our pictures taken together in it but she doesnt seems touched at all.<br>Can someone tell me what to do ? Pls dont tell me to give up i will not.<br>I really need good advice on what to do next to touch her again.<br>Thanks<br></div></blockquote>i guess the reason why she is keeping a distance from you is that she feels that being together with all those quarrels will hurt you..<br><br>is like she loves you and she doesn't want you to get hurt and to do that she is keeping a distance away?<br><br>hope you get what you mean..<br>maybe you can try explaining to her that if you 2 are together it won't be like before?</div>
