              <p><span>It's better to play "politics" at a young age

              <p><span>-A person who WON'T MAKE IT BIG.</span></p>
              <p><span>-Obviously someone who don't PLAY or worst
              involve in politics and talking crap here.</span></p>
              <p><span>-Someone who "jia ba bo liao" go dee siao people
              because he/she is not a "future-politician" or worst
              "hopeless-politician"</span></p>
              <p><span>Solution for you : Get a life , even if you are
              "successful" you won't be here at the first place. Too bad you
              isn't a politician thus save your fucking crap mouth here. Please
              GROW OLD and die earlier to save the world from HUMAN

              <p>Can you even hear yourself? You are just blabbering to save your balls from being twisted like it didn't exist at all. Obviously you don't even understand the context of "playing politics". Play politics =/= Politician. Dumbass. You telling me to get a life? You are the one that needs one. Instead of being a whiny bitch online about how you got your ass handed to you by a girl, why not spend some time doing constructive work? Like maybe, whining to your mommy? Because she is the only one who probably think you're cool</p>
              <p>Rolling eyes? How bimbotic... Do you twitch your bum and do that bimbo hand thing too?</p>
              <p>Dumb fuck.</p>

              <p>By the way, who is your teacher ?</p>
              <p>I'd like to write to the HOD and MOE about how un-professional your teacher handled this incident.</p>
              <p>She's playing politics, playing you against that girl, very unbecoming of a teacher.</p>
              <p>And not forgetting playing favourite with you " the teacher's pet". She's suppose to be fair to EVERYONE in her care.</p>
              <p>Yes, if given a choice, I'd like to have her sacked.</p>

              <p>101 ways.. is depending on what he hates..these are some which i thought of on the spot..but if i can have more time..it definetely gets better... from mild to horrible.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) hiding his sportswear if i know that he love sports(that is if i am in a good mood)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2_spread around by suggesting that he bully "the person" as he likes her so much and start creating situations that would have make others agree with that conclusion</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>3_scorned him about being a useless twitt that hide behind the teachers skirt..wait for him to retaliate and go complain again then look with big sad eyes.. i just say that teacher like him alot..but he start bully me again.. *pause* start crying again about how hard it is to make friends..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>4_write to ST and say why singaporeans like to disturb china people and somemore his is a "council" something.. emphasize on what a good role model he would be.. I betcha he would be taken off quicker than you say your own name.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>5_photoshopped him wearing drag(lipstick, skirt and looking hideous) at a crowded area (e.g PS) and circulate it around the school with the title "His side hobby".that would go along with his macho image. *<strong><strong>I love this part.. the wonders of photoshop..ah</strong>...~(^^)..side note.. it has been done before though not by me.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>6_accuse of him of cheating in class if he ever seat besides me or somewhere infront of me. It doesn't matter if he did it or not.. is my word against his..at the very least the school have to involve his parents again..at the end i just be a good citizen that report what i "think" is a crime.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>points 1, 2, 5 could be done without his knowledge. Pt 6 is a little extreme though i did see it in secondary school which a "nerd" revenge on another bully.. the person was let off with a black mark though he did not cheat but coz got "eye witness"</p>

              <p>I must say MrSotong is study smart because he (I assume MrSotong is a "he") can show that he knows his history subject <em>well</em>! Wow! I must say <em>I'm amazed</em>! He has revised his history until a point where he thinks he's still living in the Nth century where there's caste system. And he must have been so furious with his classmate, he forgot that he's living in Singapore and not ancient India when the Mauryans existed.</p>
              <p>But he's <em>such a poor thing</em>! He's only good in history and can't show off his English! As we can see, the <em>poor kid </em>got the
              definition of "lower caste class" and "low class" mixed up. He also didn't know the meaning of politics stated in this thread and he mistook it as related to "governing".</p>
              <p>I <em>pity him</em> for thinking that it's hard to set one's foot in Fullerton, it's not like Fullerton is Park View Square or something. And maybe he has not seen other fantastic hotels in Singapore, because he thinks Fullerton is more worth the money than Hotel 81. Oh no, such a <em>poor kid</em>, must be trapped at home all day, being angry over with his classmate, since he don't even know Hotel 81 don't have ballrooms to hold weddings.</p>
              <p>Oh, and I guess he did <em>score some points</em> in Science because he showed that he has learnt nanometre in class. =)</p>
              <p>I do hope Aunt Agony has seen his agony-- having hallucinations that he is living in ancient civilisation, using internet and typing a not-so-agonised story to Aunt Agony</p>
