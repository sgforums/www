            <div class='col-md body'>Well i guess the best solution is to have a serious talk with him...<br><br>1. Reveal how you feel about the whole issue. Tell him how important is he to you<br><br>2. Ask him to reveal his problems. Do not ask him for a change but see how to comporomise between both of you. If that is his character, i feel he wouldn be able to change but you as his gf must understand his characters.<br><br>3. Examine how sincere is he. If he dun even make effort to make this talk or he just make a wishy-washy explanation.. maybe is time for you to reflect on your relationship. Maybe this guy in front of you dun really suit you. I guess there is no point to cling on further...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think he is not that type of "show love" guy but what he did is that he made you love him. If you love him, you should love him what he is.. this is his character. I think i need to tell all couples out there.. never ever change yr parther because he/she feels uncomfortable because that is not the real him so Love what he is but not love what he gonna change for you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>
