Guys like that tend to keep things to themselves cos they do not know how to express it in a good way that others understand. Even if they say it out, others may get a different idea cos the way he express is not the way he want to and also base on that ppl may get the wrong idea, thus give irrelevant advices then waste of time. This can lead to frustration of cos. Rather than that, its better to be quiet.<br><br>Alternatively, some guys choose not to say it out so as not to let others worry. What for let others worry for yourself when you can take care of it in time to come? Problems need time to solve and not all problems are worth mentioning. Example: what do i wana get for some fren bday etc). Small problems not worth mentioning so no mention. At the time of the problem, of cos no immediate solution, thus waste some time thinking, thus mayb in some bad mood, thus not happy, thus no smile. But in time when its solved, things will be ok.<br><br>Sometimes, not all problems are suitable to tell your lover. It may be more suitable to tell best frens instead. Girls shld know these sort of things better. Also the fact that u are here means u understand this point as well.<br><br>He doesnt know how to comfort u or he doesnt know how to comfort u the way u want him to comfort u? Diff ppl have diff ways of comforting ppl. u may want him to say those nice words or to hug u etc but his way is to divert ur attention away from sadness. I think its a miscommunication here.<br><br>Oh and its not crazy to see ppl happy and u feel happy as well, even though u have some problems. Its called putting others before urself. Some ppl are like that. I think ur bf is one of them too. Not many ppl appreciate such character cos most of them think: "This is stupid. Where got ppl not think for themselves 1st?"<br><br></div>

I think its just miscommunication ba. Sorry if i made u feel u are bad, I din have that intention.<br><br>I guess everyone has their own views. I think mayb u shld tell him abt it? To me, as someone's bf, i think i would try my best to comfort gf and also if I have problems , I will share with her most of the times.<br><br>there are also times like I said ppl prefer to deal with certain things alone. I think u shld have a talk with him since its affecting u more than it is to him. Let him know ur feelings ba.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I understand how you feel because I've gone through such incident before. My guy just wouldn't take the initiative to do anything, and forget about mushy messages. He's a guy I trust alot, he doesn't flirt around, very loyal to me just that he's a "newbie" in relationship. I didn't want a breakup, I tried to talk to him about it, things aren't making any improvements. So we lasted for about 2 years plus when we finally broke up. Hmm... the number of times we went out together was around 10 times in 2 years. Many people salute me, questions like :" how can you tolerate this kind of person for so long?" is very common for me. Well, my advice to you is that this problem is between you and him, solve it with him, tell him how you feel. He wouldn't know what you are thinking if you don't tell him. Give him another chance, space for improvements. If both of you can't compromise with each other, I suggest you to give up and find another. No point wasting time on someone who doesn't care about your feelings. You are just torturing yourself if you keep it to yourself and bear all these pain in you. Remember, only you can decide what to do next. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Angel,<br><br>If he's never been in a relationship prior to being with you, then it's understandable that he's still learning.  It's only been a year, a person needs years to grow in a relationship.  It's true that whilst for some, time isn't a factor, but for many others, it is.<br><br>I'm my baby's 3rd (I hope it's 3rd time lucky), &amp; he's my erm, let's say quite a late 1.  But both of us are still learning to adapt to each other's needs, &amp; to the preferences of each other.  Of course, we can't be perfect all the time, &amp; we understand that (having been with others before).<br><br>For your bf, the learning curve is much steeper, since you're his first.  There's No prior lessons that he's learnt, he's never had his heart totally broken.  So it could be he's Not taking it seriously enough, or he's trying but still hasn't succeeded.  Since you know he loves you, it's more likely the latter.<br><br>I wouldn't encourage this all the time, but if he doesn't get it, have a fight (i.e. quarrel).  Little arguments now &amp; then help to iron things out &amp; deepens understanding.  There's a thin line, though, you have to make sure it doesn't blow up into something too major to repair.  My baby &amp; I view little disagreements now &amp; then as normal, but we also have a pact Not to go to bed without ironing things out.  Anyway, we don't fight for long.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by angel_mei:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: red;">he's nv been in a relationship b4.. always luv to be wif frenz.. always jokin n foolin ard.. e playful n active type.. sumtimes he neglects me.. he's nt used to lovey dovey msgs.. huggin in public.. u noe e stuff couples always do. he dunnoes wad to tok abt when he calls.. thus, he hardly calls.. we hav been tog for more than a year.. how to make him tok more to me..? n care more? i trust him.. i luv him alot.. n i noe he luvs me too. but y is he liddat? can i change him?  i dun wanna giv up on dis r/s.. wad to do.. </span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">   </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hiyah DRX,<br><br>I can't speak for everybody, but maybe due to the fact that I'm an old hag at 28, my views are kinda different.  1stly, I don't think of breaking up at the slightest instance/provocation/problem.  Unless the problem is serious enough such as infidelity, we've drifted too far apart (which can still be prevented), guy wouldn't stand up for me numerous times, etc, breaking up doesn't cross my mind (also, I know it's hard to find someone as great as my baby).<br><br>Anyway, I would think it's Not just about the girls (or me, since it's my individual view).  The partners are also equally important in determining whether or Not a girl asks for a breakup.  Mine is so wonderful, I wouldn't want to inflict the hurt of threatening a breakup "to wake him up" or "to change him".  Both of us are old already, so we talk things over calmly, even though we DO have our little fights now &amp; then <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I suppose everybody's different, but this is what I feel towards my own : )<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by drx:</div><div class="quote_body">Really want to ask girls, what they want their bfs to do in order not to break up.<br><br>Everyday pei them?<br><br>solve all their problems?<br><br>Give them money to spent?<br><br>Serve them?<br><br>Think of new place to go when on dates?<br><br>Do not mind them going out with single dates with other guys?<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
