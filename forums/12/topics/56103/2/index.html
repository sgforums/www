            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Mcsquare Pal,<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I have nothing against knowing girls at pub - its kinda fun and entertaining at times. However, when it comes to committment base relationship - I truely doubt the chances to find one there.<br><br>The kick about being single is simply being single - no burden of attachment. New year is a great day to fool around causally - however, you are probably blinded by the light airy atmosphere of that day with recent-lost relationship.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You dated her out and express your feelings towards her: infatuation is obvious - The liking for acceptable physical appearance and ambigious characteristic about her that seemed to be ok at that point of time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>She rejected you, yet gave you hope and went through series of hot-cold treatement. You fell and succumb. Maybe not because she is good at it, but rather you are unstable and unable to see through. She has weekly boyfriend and long history of her own love. She is not simple - like your friends suggested.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> While in the relationship, she was caught being unfaithful.<br><br>Seriously speaking, you do actually expect her to be faithful? When a woman give her contacts to you easily - this would also happen to others as well. No? There are bound to be one mountain taller than the other (Yi shan hai you yi shan gao) - people whom are better looking, richer, etc. And why not? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Relationship is like fire. The more powerful it burns, the quicker it dies. Kissing on second date - what makes you think she wouldn't do that to others?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Passion dies quickly with haste.<br><br>First Law of Love states: People chose their partner, don't the other way around. Your mind screamed a warning about her - your heart heed its own blinded thoughts. Seriously speaking, I have many friends who have similiar fate like you - falling for a playgirl. Nothing of what I had said goes into their mind - well, its ok because that would be their cosmic lesson to undergo. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If so many guys have tried and failed - its not their problem; its with the girl herself.<br><br>She has weekly boyfriend, what makes you think you wouldn't be just the same? Yesh, love can change attitudes and characteristics - but based on my case studies, experience and personal opinion - <strong>never be the first to change that</strong>. Maybe the next relationship she has may be different/better - but the first who tried to change that will suffer the full impact of the invisible blow. (Karma to change her). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Quote of the day: A love easily gotten is easily lost - a person easily knew, its easily forgotten.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I wish you well pal. If things are getting difficult and you need a listening ear - by all means PM or call me.<br><br>Cheers</div>

But then again, though it work - in the end, I would have discover that she isn't suitable for me.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> All these lies within the your karma by taking a gamble. I don't like chance gamble - I only believe in calulated risk.<br><br>Thought of fooling with her? Pure fooling involves no committment - obviously, at subconscious level, you don't think/feel this way either.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> People can only stand one either side - either you play the field or you get serious.
