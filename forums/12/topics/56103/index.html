            <div class='col-md body'>After attended to my Sister's wedding dinner at Hyatt Hotel.<br>The dinner was ok, but i had fun drinking lots of brandy-cokes till i got tispy.<br>You can imagine when i walked to Takashimaya swinging away. Come to think of it. Hilarious!<br>11:50pm......New Year Day reaching soon. Got to hurry and meet them in Grease. But don't know how to go....don't know which entrance. I walked around the building like a stupid fool to find that the entrance was actually at the back of Taka. (Those who went Grease know)<br><br>I got to Grease and joined my friends. We drank and had fun...till i felt really bored of Techno music which my friends were so into. Got out of that section and went to Pop section. I tell you man....the babes there were so many...but then none caught me.<br>So i went there commited to only one purpose. Dance! Dance dance... *knocked!* Apologized to a girl who caught me. She smiled and waved a gesture to say 'it's okay!'<br><br>She was such a wonderful dancer, my eyes glued literally onto her thought i made several glances around to make sure there isn't any guy who is eyeing on me. 'Hit' I slapped my forehead to remind myself to focus on having fun. Since the last relationship ended not long ago.<br><br>But but....hai. I typed a sms and showed it to her.<br>With the loud music..she wanted to tell me something, but at the same time she shook her head.<br>So i understood the head part and told her that 'It's nice meeting you'<br>Then she fanatically waved her hands and took my phone furiously. I kinda liked that....<br><br>Then the sms in my cell phone had her number and her name is XXXXXX<br>Cloud nine!<br>Then went back to Techno corner and gulped down 7 glasses of Tequlia. Woah....afterthat my mouth was full of nonsense liao.<br><br>The last conversation with her was 'Happy New Year, byebye'<br><br>The next day, we were smsing one another for the whole day. So sweet....i tot to myself.<br>and then i invited her to Art Museum as a first outing. Then to dinner<br>On that very day...i said 'What if i tell you that i like you?'<br>She rejected me and wanted to go home.<br>She left me with a message that made me smile. 'I reject you not because i dislike you, but i'm afraid that i might fall for you'<br><br>On the next day, XXXXX called me up and asked if i'm free. She thought of meeting up near my place.<br>She stays in the West! My heart leaped and agreed.<br>We went to Pasir Ris beach and chit chatted....<br>until it came a time i need to get back to camp.<br>She agreed to go home with me so that i can get changed and pack all the stuff.<br>I asked her again if she likes me. Then a kiss was planted onto my lips. Stars!!! I see Stars....<br>It got me really confused because she didn't say anything after that.<br><br>On that night in camp. I called to confirm the act.<br>She agreed to be with me. So happy....<br><br>So many things happened.<br>She likes to play hit and run 'asked me not to call her anymore, leave her alone and don't be together.'<br>She left me high and dry.<br>So i run and seek for her.<br>It went on for months, tears and stuff.....<br>The word i gave to her is always. 'I would rather have a friend then to lose you'<br><br>Even my friends who saw her told me not to play anymore. I cannot take it one. Cos she's not a simple girl.<br>Yes love is indeed blind. I choose to take the gamble and went all the way.<br><br>So many things happened until she revealed that on the day i know her. She suggested breaking up with her bf, and they offically broke off when we were together. Very confused.<br>Further told me that she had been with so many guys. Weekly - one in the past. And did so many things which hurt them.<br>Then i understood what my friends said.<br><br>But still i choose to believe in the relationship.<br><br>It went on for a year and eight months. Until i know there were few occasions which she was unfaithful behind my back.<br>I look thru it all!!!<br><br>She left saying that i didnt care for her.....and hinted to me that i've lost her.<br><br>Anyway...this story was told to remind myself of the good and special things which was meant for me.<br>I never had such a experience with a girl. Really gave my heart to her.....and she's special because she's a very compassionate girl.<br>I never know how to treasure my former girlfriends. I never realised how it felt to lose someone i treat so preciously.<br>I wept before my friends.....one very close friend of mine told me to never forget this feeling.<br>The feeling of treasuring someone. i thanked him.<br><br><strong>thank you all for reading. Thanks. </strong><br><br>I've learnt.......<br><br>I thought i knew all things, i don't<br>All the things i know, i forgot... - Cally (to the one i lost) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br></div>

He loved.. damn the consequences...<br><br>we love.. we get our heart broken...<br><br>that's all.. but love on.. perhaps the from the most acute of pain, comes the greatest lessons in life...<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MÂ©+square:</div><div class="quote_body">I'm trying very very hard.
