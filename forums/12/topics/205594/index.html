It's not like it is IMPOSSIBLE to do, is it? Through emails, it's ridiculous. You're separated by your team members because they are in different countries? And yes, I could see your manager's point when you're asked why you were so free emailing them. Walk &amp; talk to your team. You just create your own wall of barrier by not interacting with them face-to-face regularly.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by melody83:</div><div class="quote_body">The other time i was doing some data entry work for my customer, and she told me off by saying "You must as well do your customer service job since you already know it.

Remember that you're a sales coordinator. Those data entry work are supposed to be delegated to your team member. Uhm, not that I know for sure what the job scope. But for sure, a menial task like data entry would be a waste if it were to be done by a sales coordinator.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by melody83:</div><div class="quote_body">Haiz.. i really don't know should i continue to stay on..

Earn your team's trust. It takes time, though. Good luck.</div>
