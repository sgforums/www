Public judgement is a hard thing to undo. You have spoken up, and they continue to stick to their opinion. No matter how many threads you have created on this issue, no matter how you said that you are feeling tired and sad, the truth and reality is, very few will sympathize with you. They will just take advantage of this situation to show how "heroic" they are and make you feel even worse by their replies.<br><br>So I think it is better for you to "disappear" for a while, maybe come back when things are better, or start anew with a new nick or something.<br><br>And Space1999 and Ladi, it is so obvious who both of you are  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Don't ask me how I know, I just do  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> </div></blockquote>I agree with you.
