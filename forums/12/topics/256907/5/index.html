All I see are pointless flames and baseless accusations.<br><br>If we want to consider the context of Singapore as stated by forumers above, these are my views:<br><br>1) <span style="color: red;">You are innocent until proven guilty</span>. Hence, by calling you a liar etc etc, you can find out their IP address, and sue them for defamation. This is Singapore. I know people has been charged for wrongly stating things on their blogs. Why not the forums? You are always responsible for what you have said. But I guess Devil will be too lazy to bring the case up to court.<br><br>2) Now supposed all the accusations are true. So what if Devil had an ONS or some similar encounters? I'm sure both sides has consent to it. You cannot escape the law if you do any such illegal stuff as the gal will most likely report to the police, no matter how long it took. Furthermore, we are living in the 21st century. We are also not living in any Arabic/Middle eastern/Islamic country. Unless the specific forumers are not singaporeans, in which case, get off this forum.<br><br>3) I also believe in karma. What goes around will come around. If Devil had really done something bad, it will come back to haunt him one day. Also, I believe that the flamers will get back what they deserved. Buddhist karma states that if you tell lies or anything bad, you will be born dumb or with a very crooked mouth in your next life.
