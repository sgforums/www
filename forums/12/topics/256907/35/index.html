If you really have a life out of this forum, then quickly keep out of here before people start to, by some bizarre but possible way, recognize you in real life and there, poof goes your real-life reputation too.

People who once had a neutral view are now turning against you, do you see? If you really have a life out of this forum, then quickly keep out of here before people start to, by some bizarre but possible way, recognize you in real life and there, poof goes your real-life reputation too.
