              <p>if i was you, i'll let it be. you may really have no hidden intentions, but one can't be sure if your reconnection with him will change everything or not. 16 years he probably forgot who u r already but even now you're strangers, remember one can always develop feelings for a total stranger.esp there was "gonna miss you" back then, and he will be super curious about why you want to connect with him again after 16 years. curiousity can do a person wrong, mind you.</p>
              <p>read "why spouses stray" thread in here and you'll know what i mean.but again, it's your call.</p>
