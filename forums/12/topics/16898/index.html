            <div class='col-md body'>Zizi,<br><br>Hello, been quite a while since last heard from you. Got heard by him badly again i suppose.<br><br>Like you yrself had said it, will we believe what yr bf had said? well you got the ans lor, to me its definitely a NO!<br><br>From what i see, you r just a replacement to him. If one is no longer afraid to be hurt in a relationship, then that's not love.<br><br>Forgive me if i said something you might not wanna hear. Dun worry, in no way r u a third party, and pls dun feel that way. Its not yr fault. To me, i have serious doubt abt the maturity level of yr bf....... a lot of things he should not have done, or even said in the 1st place.<br><br>In a relationship, sometime you have to learn to let go a bit....... if you can't take it anymore, let go, its good for both of you. Of cos, its not easy and u will feel sad, but i still believe its better than getting hurt by him times after times. How long can you take it? Or how long will the happiness last? Give it a thought.<br><br>Of cos, i am not, and in no way encouraging you to let go, but you yrself know the situation best, what's good and bad for u. I am sure u will find better guys else where....... who will really treat u like a little princess.<br><br>Do take care of yrself, and let us know if you ever need help okie? After the storm, there's always sunshine. All the things u been through will only make u a stonger, better and more mature lady in the future.<br><br>Regards<br><br>------------------<br>nOthiNg iS ImpOsSibLE In tHiS wOrLd<br>EvEn tHe wOrD ImPoSsiBLe SaYs "i'M pOsSiBLe"</div>

Messing up his thoughts at this moment would not be of any help at all... In fact, you'll only make him detest you if you try to interfere with his thinking period...

And you don't have to tell anyone about it... Don't have to answer to anyone except HIM and YOURSELF...) If you do, tell him to get back to you when he's 'better'... Smile to you... Show that you still love him and care for him.... Let him know that you understand his needs... (To think it through..) And then? Make sure that you really UNDERSTANDS him....<br>If you think you wanna cut the story SHORT and find this whole thing not really worthy or not really what you want... Give him a period of time to think it through... Ask him how long he needs to think it through... Tell him you can't wait forever... Life can't wait forever.... Reminds him that life goes on.... Don't disturb him during that 'period' of time he stated he needs for thinking through... Look for him for an answer after that.... NB. As much as he has the rights to terminate this relationship, you have the rights to do it too.... But I just hope it's not out of a moment of desperate... A moment of harshness.... Foolishness..... As long as you clearly know what you're doing... You can also set your priorities... But I just wish for that you'll give him a notice if you're thinking along this line.......<br><br>REGARDS~<br><br>------------------<br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>zizi,<br>actually that time when i was undergoing so called this "calm stage" which is nv calm inside our hearts..i think i did the wrong thing. i irritated my ex by sending him all e previous sms that he send me saying that he loved me forever n forever etc. then he got really stressed up n thus wanted a breakup..but i have not regretted breaking up cos i noe that he's not the one for me.. for ur case, i do agree that u should try to let this relationship go..n forget abt this guy cos it's unfair for u that u loved him so much yet dun receive wat u shd receive.. it's of cos tough to gif up, easier said than done but u will at least prevent urself from further harm in the future..as u already said that he will nv be able to forget abt his ex... dun be too stressed, in my pt of view, i think LOVE SHOULD NEVER BE A BURDEN. once it's a burden, its no longer love.. take care...!~</div>

But just go through what they've got to say and MAKE YOUR OWN DECISION... Because nobody would really know the situation better than you do... Though the MOST CONFUSED you may be, you should also be the MOST SOBER... Think you're somewhere along this track,  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> and I feel happy for you...<br>Actually at this point (I believe?) you pretty much have an idea of what you want already? Though doubts might pour in once in a while to confuse you, CLEAR YOUR MIND... Many good advices HELP in the initial stage... After that they can only be render as 'disturbances' to offset your FINAL DECISION....<br>Making a DECISION out of all the mental instabilities is already a difficult thing to do.... PASSING your decision through your heart is another TEST.... Learn to control YOUR FOCUS or you'll never arrive there smoothly.... Below is a general guide for you, do consider it if you may?<br><br>1. THINK of your OBJECTIVE. What you want?<br>Then MOVES your life towards that<br>DIRECTION.....<br><br>2. THINK of the CHANCES of you ACHIEVING<br>YOUR GOAL. Can you cut out some of the<br>POINTS?<br><br>3. QUESTION your DECISION with REASONS. NOT<br>stupid and insignificant words from<br>others.<br><br>4. DEFINE and DECLARE your OBJECTIVE,<br>DIRECTION and MOVES. CARRY ON.<br><br>"When work is done, HEAT is produced...<br>HEAT is WASTED as a form of ENERGY<br>usually... Most of the time it's just a<br>side-effect...
