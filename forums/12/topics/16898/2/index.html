But understanding may not work in line with time. Understanding could be a 'bilateral flow' or sometimes even much more complicated than that. Sadly to speak, understanding is usually affected by 'emotional causes'. In TRULY understanding a situation or a subject, logical views and analysis are the the KEYs. But personal judgement is also another 'key factor' not to be overlooked to see the situation or subject a personal touch. And the control of the 'key factor' is to be minimised OR used to exact needs. Excessive would lead to 'emotional breakdowns' and lost of the situation or sense of judgement. Which, in time could prove to be another fatality. Practice of the mind is an essential. Control and maintenance at that state is an added bonus.<br>In the search for an answer, the journey is long. But remember this. If the answer we search is only a 'truth' we seek, then the fact is only so because we honour it on the 'throne'. Nothing is the truth only because we choose them to be so in our firm of mind. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> You're tired. You really shouldn't be doing this too often? There's no end to the journey of 'truth'... Do you realise where you're heading? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>
