              <p>I am a working person. Two years ago, I had a difficult break up and my ex left me for a more older and weatlhy man. I decided to be by myself and do everything by myself. Nobody bother to contact me. But recently I have ephiphany. I want to change my life and I want to be more brighter and positive.</p>
              <p>So I call all my old classmates and ask them out for a drink. One by one they all make excuses, say they busy lar, say they got appointment lar, etc, etc. So I let it go by. Then now is world cup, I call them back again so we can go watch world cup. They give me same excuses again. Some of them not married and only have girlfriend but why are they so busy? I only call them like once a month. Excuses, excuses.</p>
              <p>So, I decided to make other friends, join association and religious activity. Quite fun, I made new friends. But I am not giving up on my classmate. Very sianz lar, they so not cooperative, so I call them back again, again those poor excuses. So I scold one of them who say he was driving, I say to him I will continue to call him until he come out, I dont' care. I complain to him and say why friend call you you don't want to come out? He say busy lar got this and that lar. I say that we should keep in touch and as long as he never say he dislike me and he don't to go out, I will continue to pester him.</p>
              <p>Last time, I get bully by my ex girlfriend, she say I am poor, I am not like this, I am not good enough and I am not good looking enough. I am so sick of this. Last time, I try try to cater her make her feel happy, spend a lot of money on her clothes, dinner and presents. But she treat me so bad. So bad. And then when got richer guy come after her, she break up, just like that. Yes, she got right to leave me but if you are me, then you feel very bad.</p>
              <p>Now I do not want to feel being push down by people, I want to breath good and new live. So I don't want to give up on my classmate who give me poor excuses. I want to be aggresive to find better life.</p>
              <p>Last week, I have another friend who have so good social life. He is still single but everyday he is busy, I call him, I can always hear background got sound and a lot of people talking. THis friend, I believe his reason that he cannot come out because he is honest. Last week he went to Greece and then today he was out with some of his church friend. Although I am beginning new life and meeting new friends, I cannot match his social life and I got so many weekends with nothing to do except Sunday. I want to be busy with people and helping people. Please advice what I should do to make my life better and leave behind the bad memories of hte ex girlfriend. She has now married but she is so bad she didn't even invite me but invited my friends. She change her tel number and i cannot contact her.</p>
              <p>Pls advice me on my old classmate friends. If you tell me to seek other friends and leave them alone, I feel that I have been defeated. I must take the challenge and complain more to them to come out. I want to scold them, I don't want to be like a scardy mice like last time always scolded by exgirlfriend.</p>

              <p>im not sure of wats ur relationship like with ur friends..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but.. as from wat i can see.... they seem to already have a life of their own... well..cant deny tat as we grow older..our priorities change..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the immediate solution is to look for new friends and slowly form another social circle.. always always never have one source of social circle.. make sure u mix around well... easier said than done tho.. but anything is possible..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i was once lonely.... now attached..i make sure i handle one or two social circle of friends regularly...  we cant be friend-less...  our world doesnt evolve around just on our SO...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it takes time to get over a relationship... learn from the past...  u are motivated by doing things.. not thinking about things... if u wanna forget her..then take action...  move inch by inch forward..</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>First let me convey my condolences.</p>
              <p>Secondly,</p>
              <p>In my opinion, when your friends say they are busy......</p>
              <p>This has a meaning.</p>
              <p>You had an epiphany. So you now place more emphasis on relationships, and you want to re-forge your friendships. But your friends, they didnt have any epiphany. They are still living their day-to-day life as usual. Therefore there is a mismatch and imbalance of perspective and expectation. If you keep pestering them, they will feel you are weird. Meanwhile you feel it is them who are weird, and who are abandoning you.</p>
              <p>There is no right or wrong. It is just a difference in expectation.</p>
              <p>Like I said, your friends didnt have epiphany.</p>
              <p>So try to understand this condition and situation first, and dont be too disappointed.</p>
              <p>I have a practical suggestion and solution for you.</p>
              <p>Try to meetup somewhere convinient for them.</p>
              <p>Then their transactional cost is lower, and their busy-ness can be more accomodated.</p>
              <p>Ok good luck.</p>

              <p>Last time, I get bully by my ex girlfriend, she say I am poor, I am not like this, I am not good enough and I am not good looking enough. I am so sick of this. Last time, I try try to cater her make her feel happy, spend a lot of money on her clothes, dinner and presents. But she treat me so bad. So bad. And then when got richer guy come after her, she break up, just like that. Yes, she got right to leave me but if you are me, then you feel very bad.</p>
              <p>Now I do not want to feel being push down by people, I want to breath good and new live. So I don't want to give up on my classmate who give me poor excuses. I want to be aggresive to find better life.</p>
              <p>Last week, I have another friend who have so good social life. He is still single but everyday he is busy, I call him, I can always hear background got sound and a lot of people talking. THis friend, I believe his reason that he cannot come out because he is honest. Last week he went to Greece and then today he was out with some of his church friend. Although I am beginning new life and meeting new friends, I cannot match his social life and I got so many weekends with nothing to do except Sunday. I want to be busy with people and helping people. Please advice what I should do to make my life better and leave behind the bad memories of hte ex girlfriend. She has now married but she is so bad she didn't even invite me but invited my friends. She change her tel number and i cannot contact her.</p>
              <p>Pls advice me on my old classmate friends. If you tell me to seek other friends and leave them alone, I feel that I have been defeated. I must take the challenge and complain more to them to come out. I want to scold them, I don't want to be like a scardy mice like last time always scolded by exgirlfriend.</p>

              <p><br>Why do you keep harping on your so-called friendship with a bunch of people who does not appreciate you as their friend?</p>
              <p>Go and make new friends who doesn't upset you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or you can go and join gangs, they will be your undying friends even when you don't want to be their friend anymore.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I am a working person. Two years ago, I had a difficult break up
              and my ex left me for a more older and weatlhy man. I decided
              to be by myself and do everything by myself. Nobody bother to
              contact me. But recently I have ephiphany. I want to change my life
              and I want to be more brighter and positive.</p>
              <p>So I call all my old classmates and ask them out for a drink.
              One by one they all make excuses, say they busy lar, say they got
              appointment lar, etc, etc. So I let it go by. Then now is world
              cup, I call them back again so we can go watch world cup. They give
              me same excuses again. Some of them not married and only have
              girlfriend but why are they so busy? I only call them like once a
              month. Excuses, excuses.</p>
              <p>So, I decided to make other friends, join association and
              religious activity. Quite fun, I made new friends. But I am not
              giving up on my classmate. Very sianz lar, they so not cooperative,
              so I call them back again, again those poor excuses. So I scold one
              of them who say he was driving, I say to him I will continue to
              call him until he come out, I dont' care. I complain to him and say
              why friend call you you don't want to come out? He say busy lar got
              this and that lar. I say that we should keep in touch and as long
              as he never say he dislike me and he don't to go out, I will
              continue to pester him.</p>
              <p>Last time, I get bully by my ex girlfriend, she say I am poor, I
              am not like this, I am not good enough and I am not good looking
              enough. I am so sick of this. Last time, I try try to cater her
              make her feel happy, spend a lot of money on her clothes, dinner
              and presents. But she treat me so bad. So bad. And then when got
              richer guy come after her, she break up, just like that. Yes, she
              got right to leave me but if you are me, then you feel very
              bad.</p>
              <p>Now I do not want to feel being push down by people, I want to
              breath good and new live. So I don't want to give up on my
              classmate who give me poor excuses. I want to be aggresive to find
              better life.</p>
              <p>Last week, I have another friend who have so good social life.
              He is still single but everyday he is busy, I call him, I can
              always hear background got sound and a lot of people talking. THis
              friend, I believe his reason that he cannot come out because he is
              honest. Last week he went to Greece and then today he was out with
              some of his church friend. Although I am beginning new life and
              meeting new friends, I cannot match his social life and I got so
              many weekends with nothing to do except Sunday. I want to be busy
              with people and helping people. Please advice what I should do to
              make my life better and leave behind the bad memories of hte ex
              girlfriend. She has now married but she is so bad she didn't even
              invite me but invited my friends. She change her tel number and i
              cannot contact her.</p>
