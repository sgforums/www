            <div class='col-md body'>hey asatroseal and arrggh,<br><br>I was in the same exact shoes as the two of u!! haha, I totally can relate to EVERY SINGLE THING the two of u have typed. Juz like to share my experience:<br><br>I gave and gave too, she was a taker all the way.....also asked me not to expect anything in return for all that I wanna do....no reciprocation. It was crazy of me.....a completely zero-return investment of my time, energy, money, and emotional strength into a r/s she's made so worthless.....At the end of it all, it juz seemed like she had a good time with me, got me to pay the bills, drive her around, be a nice temp companion....and afterwards leave for other guys when she gets tired of me......I feel screwed, exploited, shortchanged and dun noe wat else......<br><br>Even though I saw the futileness of the r/s, I oso clinged on literally like a sucker. She was also seeing other guys behind my back until I finally caught her (figuratively, not physically red-handed) and she admitted flirting ard with some other guys.....<br><br>And at tt point, I learned something new abt myself - tt I can tolerate everything horrible about a girl except for unfaithfulness and infidelity.....and I finally found the strength to close the door on her for good......I will not and never again be taken for a fool/idiot who waits on her while she has a nice time with her multiple men. I have my own dignity (and all those out there in the same situation should think the same too!!).<br><br>U noe, really, if your damn female canine can get tired of u this early in a r/s and start having fun with other men, do u think a marriage with her will survive?? Trust me man, u will NEVER be able to forget those imaginary images in ur head of her frolicking with other guys.....U can forgive, but u wun forget........u wanna bring these disgusting tots of ur partner into ur marriage?? Its really ur choice.....For me, if we get together again, it'll certainly play in my head should we have any possible intimate moments.....Its an indelible emotional scar she's inflicted upon me and will always remain......<br><br>I used not to be able to get over her, but now juz thinking of her UNFAITHFULNESS alone is MORE THAN SUFFICIENT to totally turn me off. Well, at least I've learnt this very important lesson about myself, both for now and later in life.....<br><br>Hey guys, dun allow the girl to make a mockery outta u......<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello....<br><br>Just want to mention something. Do u think ur GF appreciate u, and ur relationship with her? Since she is 'accepting' the attention of other men, and get impatient easily with u, making u as a sort of a punching bag to relieve her work stress.<br><br>Do u think these are signs that she appreciates u and the relationship?<br>I think u mentioned this concern urself.<br><br>If I were u, Im not too concerned about the other guy, but what all these mean. It means ur GF doesnt appreciate u, and she has low EQ (coz taking out her work stress on u, no emotional maturity).<br><br>Perhaps u put urself in this position. From now on, try to make ur GF appreciate u and ur relationship. If that doesnt work out, leave her. Find another GF with a better EQ.<br><br></div>

Take it from a gal's point of view.<br><br>If she's faithful, she won't stray no matter what temptations she may get and this guy might just be a close friend. Are you asking her to IGNORE him?<br><br>Anyway, unless you have read his SMSs to your gf, you can't be sure of what he messaged and all you have is a whole lot of suspicion and speculation.<br><br>That does not bode well for a relationship. Perhaps to alleviate your fears you can talk to your gal and ask to see some of the messages. As long as you tell her that you want to lay some ghosts to rest, she should not object. Relationships are after all built on trust.<br><br>That's my suggestion.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>I know she is not appreciative and taking things for granted. She admitted that she has not been kind to me.Yet she doesnt seem to do anything about it.<br><br>As for her EQ, i duno. I would say EQ = temper as well. She is very short tempered. at least to me coz she is taking me for granted.<br><br>To be fair to her, i know the kinda stress she had to undertake coz i can see the shit she has to take. As far as I can, i try to accommodate her, make weekends enjoyable for her, remind her constantly not to bring work back home after work etc.<br><br>One more thing she wasnt like this in the past. It only happen few months ago.<br><br>I must confess. We are together for 2 yrs. In initial period was all sweetness. There is a period in between which i think i caused her great distress. It not consistantly a period of distress.We did shared our enjoyable moments at times. And dont get me wrong. I din do anything unfaithful or go after other gals or contact other gals. I just take her for granted and din really give her much attention or rather as much attention as she wants. We fight and make up and the cycle repeats till a breaking point. That was the lowest point. That was few months ago. I managed to salvage the situation and we had a better understanding and have since been the best I can give and love.I have also try to curb my temper.I am also hot tempered. Maybe this is call retribution. Yet throughout, tho i took her for granted, I never stop loving her or caring for her. She knows that. I muz say currently i am like running at 200% yet on her part, i see at most 20%. Such disparity. I am so burnt out and always feeling very tired. Got to think of how to help her relax yet at the same time,contend with the @#$%harressment.<br><br>that aside, am just trying to be constructive.sometimes she sees it, sometimes she dont. I just have to work harder. anyway,the finishing line is in sight. preservere......yeah. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>For now,be cool so as not to jeapodize things and @#$% can profit from the situation, do thing wen4 xing1 wu2 kui4 ( ask heart no remorse) as i always did, work hard,continue to love and I will victorious.<br><br>#$%^ is in the dark trying to cause damage.I am in the light. Light will prevail against the dark. Who says all of God's children are good. That @#$% is a serpent pretending to be a good guy. No offence to fellow christians here but I do believe no religion teaches one to cause harm to others or have the intent anyway.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I mention i make a good PI. Firstly this #$%^ is not a close friend. I know all her close frens. She only got to know this #$% fews months ago. As for smses, I did managed to see some tho not ethical. the content is to me is" itz none of your business type"<br><br>she aint ur gf, why msg asking if she is alseep, busy etc. and call and msg ever so often. like i mentioned earlier, her best fren (a guy) also only ask her out once in a while to have dinner to catch up.<br><br>she wont let me see her msg.i think just asking her wld pissed her off.in fact she is quite protective of her hp. in fact she is always keeping her hp in silent mode.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wish itz that easy to talk to her. I also want to have a good talk with her. But several factors to take into a/c. Her temper is short and she dont like to hear what she dont like to hear.or simply she only wants to hear things she dont want to hear. Secondly, she is always so beat up after a day's work I am 100% she cant get it in. Lastly, i treasure our weekends together. itz so short. And during these period she is perfectly okay and I dont wana spoil the short precious moment we get for the week. i always look forward to weekends. weekends i try not to bug her coz she finds that i am like controlling her, sticking to her too much etc.<br><br>One question to all out there esp the gals. Dont you are like your other halves to place you with utmost importance and shower you with all the love,care and attention? who doest????? For the guys, how much do you stick to your halves???? Isnt it a normal for couples to want to spend as much time with one another???? To me is perfectly normal. Considering I try not to do it on weekdays.<br><br>Just feel that the give and take part is too wide a difference. At least some consideration for pple's feeling and appreciation is better than nothing even when you dont want to reciprocate.<br><br>To be loved is a blessing. Chinese saying bei ai si xin fu de.......... Sighz............ dont guys feel good too if itz the other way round.<br><br>how many of you are givers? takers??? or 50/50. or more biased to one than the other.......<br><br>maybe can identify your gender coz sometimes not easy to deduce from your nick<br><br></div>

He knew very well she is attached and yet always ever so often sms asking her if she is with her bf, gog out with bf etc...He would also call her on her mobile.<br><br>This jerk is so persistant and  pain in the ass always doing such things. Even my gf's best friend(a guy) dont sms or call her so frequently. Sad but true, my gf seems not to mind such "attention". What irks me is that she would even bother to reply him.<br><br>I tried to reason with her once, asking who is it she is smsing....she would get pissed off and brushed me off and we would end up in a sour note for the day.

Now, the situation reverses.<br>I would think that maybe your gf is trying to protect herself emotionally. She was disappointed in you initially. Thus, by not giving herself fully to the relationship, she can minimise her pain to the lowest if one day you guys are to breakup. And by keeping her options open means another alternative. She is tired of giving and now wants to receive.<br><br>Thats my view!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well, itz not taht i was the taker all the while in the past. I do give equally,perhaps more. No matter what or how we have quarrel, I almost make it a point that I wont like the hinder any special occasion etc. I just kinda take her presence for granted. Not that I din give her love or attention.<br><br>In fact in the past i would say I am outpouring at the arte of 80-85%. But after the darkest moment in our lives, after we had a heart to heart talk one night, I have been working 200% in my opinion to maintain the relationship.<br><br>After the incident, I had reflected upon myself and made great efforts to make up for the so called "lost time" in better. Time we could have gotten better memories. I consciously make an effort to see that I shower her with love,attion and mindful of her feeling. I made the change for her and she too changed. For worse sadly. Itz like a 180 degree change in her.<br><br>Seriously i duno whatz on her mind. sometimes she is ok,somethings she can be real nasty. For example, we were happily doing something stuff together. Itz not even like I am doing my own staff and made her follow me. itz something that concern us,both of us. Yet when she was somehow frustrated with something the next day, she can tell me that I stuck to her the whoel day and din even let her have her own time. I told her itz not fair for her to say such things as I wasnt doing thinsg for my own. Do you think  itz fair to me she said such things??? I told her and she realised that but usually she only managed to see that after i pointed out and yet such things happen again another time.She simply taking me for granted.<br><br>Good thing is she still bothers to call me more often now over the phone when she is on the way home.In fact quite regularly lately. Guess I just have to slowly so called "Gan Dong" her. But still sometimes she can be so difficult to understand. No wonder thr is a say " woman's heart is like ocean deep" so heart to understand and man(as in human) is the slave of emotions. But that also set us apart from other species as a more advanced species.</div>

I do give equally,perhaps more. No matter what or how we have quarrel, I almost make it a point that I wont like the hinder any special occasion etc. I just kinda take her presence for granted. Not that I din give her love or attention.<br><br>In fact in the past i would say I am outpouring at the arte of 80-85%. But after the darkest moment in our lives, after we had a heart to heart talk one night, I have been working 200% in my opinion to maintain the relationship.<br><br>After the incident, I had reflected upon myself and made great efforts to make up for the so called "lost time" in better. Time we could have gotten better memories. I consciously make an effort to see that I shower her with love,attion and mindful of her feeling. I made the change for her and she too changed. For worse sadly. Itz like a 180 degree change in her.<br><br>Seriously i duno whatz on her mind. sometimes she is ok,somethings she can be real nasty. For example, we were happily doing something stuff together. Itz not even like I am doing my own staff and made her follow me. itz something that concern us,both of us. Yet when she was somehow frustrated with something the next day, she can tell me that I stuck to her the whoel day and din even let her have her own time. I told her itz not fair for her to say such things as I wasnt doing thinsg for my own. Do you think  itz fair to me she said such things??? I told her and she realised that but usually she only managed to see that after i pointed out and yet such things happen again another time.She simply taking me for granted.<br><br>Good thing is she still bothers to call me more often now over the phone when she is on the way home.In fact quite regularly lately. Guess I just have to slowly so called "Gan Dong" her. But still sometimes she can be so difficult to understand. No wonder thr is a say " woman's heart is like ocean deep" so heart to understand and man(as in human) is the slave of emotions. But that also set us apart from other species as a more advanced species. </div></blockquote>Continue to care and love her then?<br><br>When you truly love someone, you shouldn't be too concerned with the 'results &amp; return'.....<br><br>Give her some time to adjust... Continue to contribute but not advisable to the extent of wearing out yourself and blaming her on that instead...<br><br>Good luck.... Btw, care to let me know what's both your horoscopes?</div>
