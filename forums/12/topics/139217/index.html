            <div class='col-md body'>Hello everyone, need construtive advice and views from both gender.<br><br>There is this jerk.I would like to call him jerk anyway. He knows that my gf is attached.(to me that is) yet he would always sms her and call her.<br><br>What the #$% is he trying to pull??? He knew very well she is attached and yet always ever so often sms asking her if she is with her bf, gog out with bf etc...He would also call her on her mobile.<br><br>This jerk is so persistant and  pain in the ass always doing such things. Even my gf's best friend(a guy) dont sms or call her so frequently. Sad but true, my gf seems not to mind such "attention". What irks me is that she would even bother to reply him.<br><br>I tried to reason with her once, asking who is it she is smsing....she would get pissed off and brushed me off and we would end up in a sour note for the day. Nowadays, I don't ask her but I know full well that #$% is still smsing etc etc.<br><br>It is easy to say one muz trust your partner but itz definitely not easy when there is such a persistant @#$% trying to be funny.<br><br>Now, do any of you guys or gals have this kinda problem.? How would you pple feel personally if there is this  @#$ who keep sms your partner even with full knowledge that he/she is already attached.<br><br>And how do you pple handle it or any suggestions???<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hm.. well i think i got similiar opinion...<br><br>1. Have a heart-to-heart chat with  your gf over this issue CALMLY. I guess raising your voice wouldn be able to bring the message across.<br><br>2. Do tell her that you feel uneasy over this issue. I feel is healthy to get jealous. If u do not get jealous, then i think its a big problem to your relationship.<br><br>3. Interpret the outlook from her answer, if she keep assuring you that its only a friend or she feel sorry about the whole issue, i think you can set your mind already. If she just try to divert your attention from this topic or she just ask pissed off, maybe you like to think it over your relationship, if she is really suitable for you. Your character is abit senstitive type and if your gf dun even understand your character, i feel both of you might not be lasting so why bother to stick together and "suffer"<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>man, just tell your gal it's not because you dun trust her, it's just that you don't like it when she's letting another guy come too close, cos you will get jealoused... if she Bitch about it, then ask her, if i not jealous at all u like meh?? you say one ah.... see how she respond loh... then tell us again ok??<br><br>normally ah, i think your gal likes your jealousy lah.. maybe that's why she's letting the guy sms her. but let her know that there is a limit to what you can endure. i hope she understands. if not, she may be just toying with you, for ego's sake.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well well. Some of the things you pple suggested I have thot of. Like geting my gal frens to msg me and I wont tell her who msg me etc. But I thot it over and feels that I dont have to be mean to her even if she is mean to me at times.<br><br>Thats why I am moving very cautiously in these. I din want to piss her off. She has very very short temper and patience. Of coz I would remind her once in a while that " Dnt do to others what you dnt want others to do to you" these kinda statements etc lah.philosophical i guess. And i dont know how much she really absorb. Just trying to put those thots into her. I think they are very valid thots in a relationship.<br><br>Last but not least, I know she din not do any thing funny behind me. That I am quite sure. Just that maybe she needed another voice,so as to speak. I had mentioned taht her job is very stressful.<br><br>I always reminded her that she can talk to me if she has any problem etc. I will be more than willing to listen to her etc. Many times, after we had a unpleasant encounter, went thru the shit,talked etc... then realised that prior to that in the day etc, she had some problems or nasty encounters at work. She dont talk to me abt it, just vent on me when i did even know whats her problem.<br><br>Of coz that happens only when she is feeling lousy.<br><br>Just that that #$% likes to "jiok jiok" her and she doesnt ind replying.... Guess I have to learn to adapt to this harrassment. Maybe after our marriage, that #$%^ get the idea and just buzz the @#$% out of our lives.<br><br></div>

The saddest thing is despite all you have done, all the effort put in, the other party dun reciprocate.<br><br>Quite disappointed with my gf's thinking. She said if you want to do things, dont think of expecting reciprocation coz usually thats leads to great disappointment. Never mind reciprocation. All i ask for is appreciation. I think the two are essentially different concepts altogether. I feels that she is always taking things for granted.<br><br>How many of you have partners take take all you have done for granted.
