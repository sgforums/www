            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">"Living well is the best revenge."<br>- George Herbert</span><br><br>Your friend is a lucky man. Not meant to be sarcastic, but there are real-life examples of men whose wives cheated on them with their (the wife's) male friends, and those men are still living well with their new families.<br><br>Your friend would be very foolish if he destroyed his life over a cause as  unworthy as the ex-girlfriend. Invite him out for some drinks or whatever he usually likes doing with you and his buddies. (Alcohol is not very healthy, but it could be therapeutic for matters of the heart -- it does help to either numb the pain or release some of the pain out.) Sometimes male bonding might be useful, but in the end it all depends on him to reach out and accept the helping hand offered by good friends like you.<br><br>Time is the best healer, and men generally recover faster from such setbacks than women. The only worry is that if your friend takes it too hard, he may not trust a woman easily again and could even become a little misogynistic, which does not bode well for his future relationships.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>how long were they together?<br><br>he is in so call shock mode.<br>he always say want to die want to die but super strange this type of people never ever die. so just stay cool<br><br>How to help ?<br><br>method 1<br><br>Super highly effective method!<br><br>Slap him both side of the face so hard that it leaves a burning pain on his face and  Say, Oi you so weak is it? Your ex gf enjoying her life now and you are here saying you want to die. Will she care? She will sure laugh at you and say she is rite in cheating you, for you have proved her rite for being such a useless fk. Get up and be a man! Show the shit who she is dealing with.<br><br>P.S ( This are the actual words my friend used to help me in the past. She actually hit me so hard that I fell to the ground. But I find it super effective and I regard her as my best friend till today. For she has shown me the light and yes my friend is a gal, people even ran away when she hit me, they  thought she was mad liao. )<br><br>method 2<br><br>Talk and talk<br><br>haiz semi effective can just try to keep talking say nice things to me. Will work on some people but not all.<br><br>method 3<br><br>Scold the gf hoping will change her mind.<br><br>Hey I know this idea sounds weird lar but not highly effective. My friend did try it once for me without my knowledge but kena scolded back by my ex , and the two nearly kena cat fight. haiz, that was a sad case.<br><br>method 4<br><br>Bring him to see his gf who is enjoying life without him.<br><br>This method is to shock him and show him his ex has move on liao no point holding on.<br><br>method 5<br><br>Intro some new gals to him<br><br>Humm will work only if the girl is interested in him or at least give him hope that he still wanted by girls and forget the gf.<br><br>method 6<br><br>Ask parents to help<br><br>Well only works on people who are close to their parents. As they will listern to their parents advice.<br><br>method 7<br><br>Bring him go geylang to have a fun time to lighten him up<br><br>Sadly this method is something which I too had a hard timing in believing but my findings show that 20% actually use this method to find some peace to the hurt that their ex had inflicted on them. This method has 2 highly rated but strange outcome. !)  They love paid sex so much that they will never find any gfs again and keep going back there , they are scare to be hurt. 2) They will pay for sex but strangly they cannot perform when seduced by all means, Haha weird rite? but this type are the strong ones who can bounce back up when they are given time. I have seen this type of guys bounce back and stop thinking about their ex and move on and now are happily married to their new gf.<br><br>Final thought :<br><br>These methods were taught to me when I was down like your friend. I believe that as a friend you can only advice him thats all.  Please use these methods  wisly and hope that your friend can recover from this experience. Life is short so please do not waste time on a gal who has betray him.<br><br></div>
