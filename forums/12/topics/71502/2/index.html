It's no longer serious anymore, it's a phrase based on feelings and at-the-time-of-mood. So when you break off this relationship, somewhere in your subconscious, you knew you could get back this relationship somehow when you say/did the correct thing. The relationship will suffer in the long run because of the break-patch phenomenal theory.<br><br>I dunno chinese astrology. I only know western astrology.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>Always wanted to reply to this thread but no time to do so.<br>I didn;t really read thru every post I simply go thru so if I happen to miss out anything pls tell me alright?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Okie 5 years of r/s.  Many times of breaking up n patching up. She mentioned that she has Ai but no Qing for u anymore. She may be tired of the cycle. To be honest and from my view of point as a women, she might implying -&gt; I can't bear to leave you but I can't stay with you anymore<br><br>or<br><br>she just can't bear to hurt u by saying those really hurting words.<br><br>In a long term r/s, what usually might take place is continuing the r/s due to obligations. In another words, this is when responsibility takes place.<br><br>From what you have mentioned abt she is living on you, the percentage of tied down to you due to obligation is more like to happen on the both of you.<br><br>I suppose you should be quite possessive in the way that you have tried to control her way of living. Meaning you don't like to her to go the place u dun like and I ASSUME you don't mix well with her friend do you? and I believe you should put urself in her shoes when you forbids her to hang ard/go out/ do sumthing she likes. when u try to forbids her it just simply implies you don't trust her enuff.<br><br>How would u feel when you just wish to have a simple date with a fren and you have ta explain where, what, why to ur partner? sounds irritating right? you might feel that you are actually giving in to her, but in the fact I will say she will be the one who is giving in to you.<br><br>okie now to ur stand, you are thinking that you actually wanted to protect her more than forbidding her. But forbidding takes place when you sense that she has many suitors ard her right? Trust me, allow her to have some space of her own. It does help a little to improve on the r/s.<br><br>At this moment of the r/s, what you can do is try to make her feel loved instead of being controlled. Plan a day special for her Let say gif her a little surprise by sending her some little sweet pressies. I believe she will appreciate if she still have feelings for you.<br><br>And also find sumtime to have a really gd tok abt things between u guys.<br><br>anyway, hope everything goes fine for ya. above mentioned is based on my experience with my bf.. so hope it helps in a bit.<br><br>cheers<br>Angeline<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm... I can say you cannot judge a person by the cover (appearance). Its her actions tt really signifies her character.<br><br>Normally there are two types of wild girls (who like to chiong ktv etc)<br>1. one who goes wild w/o bf<br>2. Together with bf<br><br>Normally, girls will not play to tt extent even though their bf is not by their side. They will recognise tt the had a bf and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a good gal will know her limits. </span>. They is no need to lie about what she is doing even though she fear tt u might b upset. If tt's the case, than don't do. Although not a must but when in relationship many thinks are pretty restricted. She should just be herself. Lying over small things can lead to bigger lies in the future. Even if someday if she cheated on you, u might not know. (hopefully she aint tt kind of gal).<br><br>You 2 really ought to talk and think of a solution. If not matter wil jus get worse. Love is not sympathy or getting used to. Is being happy being with the person. Are you happy with wat she is doing to u? Is she willing to solve the problem? If ans is no, it will get u nowhere.<br><br>Just feel tt 2 are being still together out of fear not to hurt each other and bu ren xin tt kind of tink. Maybe both of you have reach a point whr the love is not longer thr but stayed becos of personal reasons. Tts wat she could have mean Qing is gone. Love come in many forms. She might still love you but the kind of love she had might have changed oreadi. tts whr the qing is gone. its just like a brand new vase and a broken one. The feeling u had for it will nv b the same again.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Honestly do you really love her or just get used to her oreadi? U must be very clear of your own feelings. Don't stayed because of bu ren xin or getting used to her, stay because you truly love her.<br>Given tt she doesnt cook and laze ard, you must be able to tahan her attitude like tt even u had a family with her someday. Settling down with her forever as a family, things would be diff le. If you cant solve it now, next tm when u n her had a family it will b even harder esp u cos u hav to financially support the whole family and with the bills and burdens tt comes along, you might not be able to take it.<br><br>Still, a chance is impt.<br>Do your best but not neglecting yourself too.<br>You can only love others if you learn to love yourself</div>

I think what's essential is about knowing what's running and working around the core of your relationship, solve them before you dump in romantism.

She is a gemini, her need for mental speech, assurance is more important.<br><br>It's not matter of plucking the stars from the sky and she goes 'wow', then leave whatever problems there still. (Zi biao bu zi ben).<br><br>Here is a list of things to achieve, which will indirectly built the relationship, foster better harmony, trust and love - successfully done, it will also appear like elements of romantism. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I) Improve personal character. There is nothing more loving than this. We all evolve in the process of relationship, but some personality stays because of insecurity. Then again, shall we allow this flaw to remain when we know that it is damaging the relationship? No, we can't. But what we can do is to handle our source. Insecurity has to be handled. This is attributed to:<br><br>- Break-patch cycle, the fear for her to leave you. <strong>You fear therefore you hold tightly, only to lose again. </strong>Learn to realise those fear and work around it. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Believe that if she has no reason to stay in the relationship - there is no meaning even if she were to remain</span>. Always think for the other party - if she is happy with her choice, release them because only then if they remain, you know its for love and not for circumstances.<br><br>- Jobless contribute to financial insecurity. Work hard in career. Know what you want in life and strive. You don't have to be rich, but you have to be self-sufficient to support the both of you, <strong>without</strong> neglecting your relationship. Money can't win love - by the willpower and determination to strive and improve income - the quality you shown can't never be compared to 'princes' with loads of cash because if she goes for material gain forsaking a good love- I rather you lose her.<br><br>- Learn to observe little details in relationship. Learn to predict and forecast moods/pms/etc. Don't have to go all out to please her, reassure regularly to let her know you still love her and always will. Confidence should return when the above two are satisfied -  when quarrelling, be tact on words. Avoid cold war for more than 24 hours. Don't focus on situations - learn to act on root of problems. Keep up the good work to ensure reason to stay in the relationship and be happy with it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is probably the last thing I'm gonna say regarding your thread...<br><br>Your relationship is / was probably OVER. She just drifted on with you. If my prediction is correct, it's a 'subconscious drift relationship'. Some time down the line she could have realised it somehow already.<br><br>Whatever is happening today somehow coincides with the 'there and not there' - Zombie Relationship... Meaning the relationship is already dead, people are just there for the sake of being there...<br><br>She just can't give up because there's 'ai'. And she matters much about how you feel...<br><br>Advice: If you REALLY love her, ask her what she really wants... (genuine concern and not a threat tone pls...) Painful it may be, dragging sometimes just don't mean anything...<br><br>PS. Let your ego down a little for the sake of love?</div>
