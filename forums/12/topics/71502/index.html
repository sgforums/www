            <div class='col-md body'>First, you can try talking it out with her. "Ai but no Qing" is rather vague. Find out what the real problem is. If she really loves you, she should love you even in the most unlovable situations. Meaning "being there for you thru good and bad times". It does sound cliche but it does hold true.</div>

It don't neccessarily have to reflect any truth.<br><br>She feels much LOVE, but no basis for the relationship. Meaning foundation is not strong enough. It COULD (and maybe only) also mean that she thinks this relationship is going nowhere far.<br><br>Could it be that you're not giving her enough sense of security or commitment?</div>

For a starter I can only based my ASSUMPTIONS on GUESSINGS...<br><br>Directly speaking, I wasn't the one who said the foundation is not strong enough. I just made an assumption that this is probably what she meant. Saying that the foundation is not strong enough is just an indirect way of saying that she don't have certain sense of security in you.<br><br>A good GUESS would be your career and perhaps financial stability. It may also implies your attitude - meaning the way you do and handle things or your sense of achievement in life <span style="font-style: italic;">disappoints</span> her.<br><br>May I know both your age?

If I was a competitor trying to chase someone who is attached, the best thing that could ever happen is that his/her partner has such flaws. Love works in such a way that the more you want to cage, the more it distance away from you.<br><br>One should always learn to tackle problematic roots instead of superficial short term issues. (E.g. Preventing her from mixing with guys limits her contact with other guys - short term solution. Long term solution is to address trust, personality and love issues)<br><br>You situation is a potential breeding ground for her to run away. Inner environment is screwed up while external environment brings in stress and possible rewards lies elsewhere. She already told you in her own words that there is a gap in your relationship - this could have millions of reasons, which I am going to ask:<br><br>I) Any past critical problems?<br><br>II) Broke and patch before (more than once)?<br><br>You said she is staying with you, therefore I presumed you both are cohabiting? Cohabiting never make things better. Furthermore, she is older than you while you are jobless and running risk into financial difficulty. Woman after their teeny-love, sees more of the practical side of love - that's where money comes into the picture. This is worst if she is a Taurus, Capricorn or Virgo. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Probably you may like to answer those few questions above, before I would continue my post.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>22, still relatively young. Spice and sparks in a relationship has to be contributed by both parties. Courtship does not end even with marriage.... the phrase "aiyah, lau fu lau qi already" as an excuse not to be romanctic is one of the worst things to say in a relationship, think you might be heading in that direction.<br><br>Do you want to settle down with her because you had 5 years together?<br>Or do you want to settle down with her because you see a future with her? Do see her being the mother of your children? Deciding about spending the rest of your life with someone should be about both your futures.<br><br>If you want to settle down with her just because you can't let go, pardon me for being candid but if thats the case I forsee problems in the future. Please do not get married for the wrong reasons... seen too many of that...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't think I would wanna say much for now.... But a few assumptions which I would like to add before I start work... Perhaps give you a more proper advice when I have the time to?<br><br>1. She's one who likes to mix around with crowds, friends and guys. So it's quite unlikely that you can stop her activities. There is a tendency for her to be flirty, but of course that don't imply that she's flirting behind you or anything.<br><br>2. She minds how people see her and how you (or maybe even your friends) see her. Even if she wanna break with you, she'll probably be using some indirect method. Kinda like the got 'ai' no 'qin' message. But don't necessarily jump to conclusion that it's a break off message.<br><br>3. She don't seems to have much choice for this 5 years relationship. It could also be a 'subconscious relationship' which falls quite a high tendency for someone like her to commit in. Probably she just went along with the flow. She needed you because you're (were?) just like a pillar in her life. Not that there was no love involved, but it's a subconscious flow.<br><br>4. She might have changed or be in the mid of changing her mentality now. The exposures that she's getting from her work and friends. If there're other options available for her she might be considering it.<br><br>5. Are you a boring person in a way? She probably can't stand boring person... But no point trying to 'twist' yourself to blend in to her taste, it probably still won't work out anyhow?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... I am oso a Gemini super active like ktv late nights out but i quit this because I have a bf. I know what I should do and what I should not. Its not like because I like late nights out, I have every right to do that, everyone have a choice to do what they want. Girls esp should know what best they should do. Shouldnt she be the one cooking since u cant ? (normally guys cant). its ok i tink if her cooking isnt tt satisfactory but it is the heart tt counts rite?<br><br>Firstly, does she loves u like u do now?<br>if ans is no? than?<br>if ans is yes she wldn't be doing all this. Think again if you were her and you do wat she is doing to u to ur gf, whats probably your feeling at tt point when treating her in such a manner? (eg.u doing exactly wat ur gf doing to u to other gal)<br><br>I wldnt allow myself to do wat she is doing if I am in her situation. I will make sure I do my best and not allow myself to continue falling(like watching vcds whole day). Had she stayed cos you are willingly to support her at no matter what cost? so she climb over your head already?She can easily find herself a job as a salesgirl. Spending and not earning is not the right attitude in the first place. if she had really love you, she will help you financially and not wait to be spoon feed.<br><br>some guys are born possessive while others become possessive because their gf failed to give them securities. The thing you say about possessives, I wouldnt mind cos I wouldnt do them as a gf. I don mind possessive guys at least in a way they care(although some are fake) but I cant really take it when he fail to fulfill his promise. (than again see situation, there must be a reason y he cant fulfill a promise and if the reason is valid there isnt anytink to b angry about). Its about understanding isnt it?<br><br>(sorry but no offence) If I were you, I will seriously think twice about keeping her. Have you ever considered what your life in future will be like with her attitude like tt? Try ignore her for awhile. If she really love you, she will initiate at least a call or at least worried. Given she is the wild kind, if she cant b bothered about the 5 yrs relationship u two had, there is no way you can keep her, she might probably just ask u to give her some space(but i doubt she won cos she still nd a place to stay)<br><br>forgive me for saying. Her attitude only the guy will get stressed up and dumped her instead.<br><br>I dunno wat kind of gal is she but if she is those kind who only wan to make use of ppl and sit ard do nth, she stayed only becos of a reason (u noe wat i mean?) but her heart at somewhr else. if tt the case she will only come to u only when she knock her head against the wall and realise tt you are still the best.<br><br>I guess if she quit her night life, I don tink u will face black black and b so possessive towards her?</div>

If it fits under the category of many times - love has truely ended long ago. I hope you it's not for your case.<br><br>Capricorn? MCP? I can understand. She gemini? And she allows you to control her? Of course conflicts arise. Anyway, its not about letting her do what she wants - giving freedom to your partner is RESPECTING her personal and private space.<br><br>Do you happen to realise that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>if your girlfriend wants to leave this relationship by will, whether you restrict her or not has no effect at all?</strong></span><br><br>Having no confidence is the usual psychological behavior that possessive/MCP guys always have. You can keep using this excuse to defend yourself, but you can't change your situation. It's not good and would create rift in your relationship. Living together - now reality-problems sunk into your relationship. You really need to work hard on your relationship instead of complicating it further.<br><br>Love Equation theory states that it has to be love &gt; problems for relationship to be fulfilling and have ample reason to stay. Once love = problem, couple undergo critical problem stage. Love &lt; problem - its time to solve root problems or you risk losing the relationship without you knowing. Love here refers to the intangible value of happiness, value and loads of other thingy, while problems refers to flaws, internal and external problems. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>So she work at KTV pub? <strong>Do you think you can stop guys from knowing her</strong>, etc? You can only instill trust, belief and love into your relationship and hope that she truely knows what she wants. If you truely mind, then disallow her to work there and learn to succeed in life, in terms of career so she don't have work in such environment.<br><br>Find a good time, date her out and have a good talk. Talk about old times, and gradually to the present. Share a small vision of the future together and listen hard to what she may have to say in this talk. It good to soul-communicate every now and then - its time for yours to happen.<br><br>Cheers</div>
