The FACT is you have NOT heard from her PERSONALLY. My <strong>1st ADVICE</strong> for you would be to ASK her 1st. Plan your steps from there. Can she or can she not accept you? For what reasons? Can those reasons (difficulties) be overcomed? (Don't deceive yourself here... They either can or CANNOT be overcomed, don't FORCE things IMPOSSIBLE especially trying to see things FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW ONLY.. Relationships don't work this way...) GENERAL SPEAKING as the AGE of the parties involved go higher, age gap USUALLY get relatively insignificant.<br><strong><br>capability-wise i have faith that i will match and surpass her but right now have no chance to prove this. moreover any time now she can choose someone more established, and honestly i feel she should too, because shes not getting any younger and cant wait too long.</strong><br>IF you think she should be choosing someone else THEN I think you should not be WASTING your time and OUR TIME... Ask her what she wants 1st... Don't be a MCP here. That might be not what she's looking for?<br><strong><br>for me, obviously i dont care abt the age. think its tough enuff trying to find someone of matching frequency...less to say if i were to put an age limit on tat.<br>i think maturity is not an issue, pp my age are(should be) pretty much grown up. fear of gossip/loss of face etc? not an issue either; if i like someone i dont care wat others think. but obviously for something like tat to work out the person i like must think the same.</strong><br>So WHAT for you WAITING for...?

Without even starting a BATTLE you've already got your MORALE down by 50%... CONGRATULATIONs... Carry on and THINK of ALL the POSSIBLE 'trival' problems you'll face and I BET you SOON ENOUGH you can SAVE all your TROUBLES.... Because she'll already be someone elses'.... (Hmm... Maybe she ALREADY IS?  :p) You're no COURTING her... NOT MARRYING her.. It's NICE that you think that far... But don't jump steps... <strong>Advice No. 2:</strong> IF you CAN'T EVEN pass TEST 1... You can FORGET about the REST....<br><strong><br>on a separate note:<br>effects of gals on gals- my guy frens and i sometimes cant help but notice a terrible trait amongst many gals. we know tat gals usually take their galfrens' advice pretty seriously and for tat matter many have a habit of discouraging their peers from accepting guys; or worse, some advise their frens to dump their bfs etc simply (in my opinion) becos they're unattached themselves and are jealous. ive come across a gal who actually cursed(perhaps too strong a word to use here) an attached fren of hers whos getting married soon, claiming that the courtship period of her fren had been too short and that the marriage wouldnt last long. tats really a mean thing to say, dont u think? i hope any gal who reads this take this advice: take any advice from yr good galfren with a pinch of salt and with regards to such stuff..try to think for yourself.<br></strong><br>Though I can agree with you that SOME of the girls might be doing that...

Or maybe you're a super duper Goodie nice guy that will roll around and play dead for her.  Well, do you know what's the problem?  That's because you think too much and don't give the yourself nor the relationship a chance to grow.<br><br>Listen more to her then constantly hearing yourself whine in your head... quick go do that and date her again.<br><br>Get the stupid catch-up game outta your head!  You want to graduate and become a rat to participate the ratrace of corporate life?  SUCKS!  Bet that they could never be happy...</div>

People say you can never TRULY understand a woman... But how easy have it been trying to UNDERSTAND a HUMAN...? Perhaps you can never FULLY understand a woman... But NOT knowing the woman you're interested in or you're having a relationship with is DEFINITELY a BIG NEGATIVITY....<br>I say IF you're REALLY interested in her, should put in MORE EFFORT (but not put in EVERYTHING lah...)... Don't expect the LOVE to fall naturally from the sky.... But if you've already put in much EFFORT and gave SUFFICIENT hintS..... Then just let things be.... The relationship MIGHT START too if she's really interested in you... But I BET it still won't get you FAR if you don't try to know her BETTER?</div>
