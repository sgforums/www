When you are infatuated with him, emotions will follows consciously or subconsciously and your thumb of rule will be washed away and you will fall. Hearts are fragile I called it.<br><br>In your case, I could tell the relation between you and him are inconsistent....perhaps the way you handling this is still immuture. Tell yourself, is this what you want? Do you really love him or acting impulsively just becoz you feel lonely or becoz he had a new love in such a short time that makes you acted vindictively? Ease your mind and think carefully.<br><br>Even though if you both get to be together, it would be just a short fond dream.

I thought i found he likeable romantically too. but i don't know if it was love. So after 3 days, i was so not used to the whole couple thing that i told him i wanted to be single again.<br><br>He was unbearably upset, angry and puzzled.<br><br>3 months later, i heard he got attached to his colleague whom he know for only 10 days. I felt really angry and sad....he told me he was serious about me and that his feelings were strong and constant. 3 months and 10 days?? a new girl? Oookaaay....<br><br>Then he broke up with her after 2 weeks and came back to tell me he still had feelings for me---that was why they broke up. I didn't want him back. Still feeling annoyed, cheated and stupid for buying his "stories".<br><br>After 4 days, i got over my anger. i wanted him back. he said no... "the feeling numbed." Ooookaaayy..... "i can't bring myself to love you right now." Ooookaay......<br><br>So what the hell is wrong with him? what the hell is wrong with me??<br><br></div></blockquote>Dear Herself,<br><br>You decide to give this guy a chance, which means he isn't a potential in your mind - but nevertheless you just have to give him a chance because he touched you. You knew that he wasn't your potential and just a matter of three days you feel choked - you think that this chance giving is feastible?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>3 months later, he got attached with a girl he know for 10 days. Let me tell you one thing about him; there is an underlying urge for someone to be there for him to love and loved in return. It is so obvious that he is a slave of love - this compulsive desperation to enter into a relationship. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>He broke up 2 weeks later and comes back saying that he got feelings for you and broke up her - obviously strenghtening my point I made above. What? He can't be with that girl now he is looking back to find you? A substitude or thinking that you are that dumb to believe his crap. So I am suppose if he could last with her and be happy with - he wouldn't say that huh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>You wanted him back after 4 days because of what had happened and this womanly jealous consumed you. You personally witness the guy who is supposedly to be yours, left because of your confusion remark, and into the arms of another girl. There is this deep subconscious feeling that is creating that drawing effect and this is not love.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Then he comes saying that his feelings numb? This is utterly ridiculous! Think about this Herself, if his feelings got 'numb' so fast and if he could be with a girl he knows for 10 days - do you think you stand anywhere better then just surface of his emotions?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>For a guy to do all sort of romantic stuff to touch a girl is relatively simple - and all that don't really speak much about the strenght of his love. He wants to be with you THATS WHY he is doing all these -which again cannot measure his love for you, which could be shallow - only he knows.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I suggest not to make hasty decision again - take some time to fully look at the real him. If his other relation could break within 2 weeks -there must be something undesirable about him or her. You need time to fully check out the man who proclaim his endless love for you. Head your gut womanly instinct and look not at his words - but at the ways of his doing and his actions.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
