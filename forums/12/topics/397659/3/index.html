              <p>Hi Ts, i am new to this forum here but if you may i like to give you my take on your situation.  Basically your last post ended off with signs taking you for granted. Actually there are signs displayed but from experience, the most important signs you got to look out for is what your gut feeling is telling you.</p>
              <p>People have acknowledge that a female's instinct/ sixth sense is very accurate but honesty, guys' gut feeling are more or less on the spot too. In-fact, when our ancestors roam the earth without today modern technologies, gut-feeling is one of the thing that help them to survive. When you feel, something is not right, you got to ask yourself or bring in friends to help you. Reason being, often the guy is too blinded by the beauty of the girl to make rational decision. Yes, personally, i agree that "beauty" is a drug.</p>
              <p>The fundamental question you should be asking too is that, " In this "relationship, is she in control now , or are you in control ? " More often or not, guys feel extremely miserable as no longer can they play a part in the relationship. They fall into the wait for the girl's action and react phase. I been through this so i understand the shit feeling of waiting for someone or someone's reply.</p>
              <p>What you should be looking for is the female interest level in you. for the sake of the readers here, the details are in this link. <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sixguysataprataplace.blogspot.com/2010/01/exploring-planet-venus.html">http://sixguysataprataplace.blogspot.com/2010/01/exploring-planet-venus.html</a></p>
              <p>When you can ascertain her interest level in you, you won't even have to confess anymore. Seriously, correct me if i am wrong but most girls will help you when they liked you. When they have the feeling of : " Gee, what is this guy doing at this moment?" and stuff like that, this shows they have high interest in you. </p>
              <p>Through horror stories and feedback from girls, i have also found out that it is always better to read the person action rather than their words. If the girl laugh at all your lamest jokes, make breakfast for you, wait for you so that you can accompany each other home, i tell you dude, even 3 blind mice can tell she is interested in you. Its so easy to say, i like you but i having problems with my ex or bla, bla , bla. Honestly , sometimes i think about it, if brad pitt were to ask her to be his gf, will she give all the reasons. I like to trust once again that, when girls likes you , they help you.</p>
              <p>Alright i think i have written a tad too long and i need to stop here. However, in this topic, the learning is endless and because far too many times , the author of the blog have come across guys not knowing what to do with girls, they set up this blog, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://sixguysataprataplace.blogspot.com/">http://sixguysataprataplace.blogspot.com/</a> , hoping that now, at last , there is a place for guys to vent out their frustrations.</p>
