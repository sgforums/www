              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>If you have something to share, something to offer of yourself without expecting returns - you might be able to have your way. However, from what has been transpiring and what you have posted here - you want to own her. If u love, simply love, unless your love is not love but something else parading and masquerading as love. Look into yourself with a modicum of SELF-HONESTY  you would know ..</p>
              <p>Also, u state that u had turned others down - as it occurred to u that u are comparing? and sadly it is being neurotic and sooner or later (assuming it pans out in your favour) you would expect her to 'toe your line'' and with her current state of heart - it would sooner or later crash.</p>
              <p>She has to deal with her ''demons'' and you have to deal with yours - till then it would be better to remain <strong>friendly </strong>and allow the other to be. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">When there are reasons and there are fears - love never abides, at the most it pretends to be. </span></strong></p>

              <p>Hi guys , I've been trying to woo this girl for about 6 months
                  now but she doesn't wants to get in a relationship because of her
                  failed relationships in the past . She said that she had already
                  lost trust in guys and relationships .</p>
              <p>We've been quite open about it , and I told her that I'll be
                  with her all the way through .</p>
              <p>I was thinking if any of you can propose methods or ways so that
                  she can regain back this trust ?</p>
              <p>From what I know , she was hurt very badly in her past
                  relationships .</p>
              <p>Is there a phobia of getting into relationships ?</p>
              <p>Personally , I can get along with her very very well
                  ...   but she isn't sort of my girlfriend yet (Not
                  official)</p>
              <p>Can I have your advices please</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>When she's ready to trust, she will trust.</p>
              <p>Proposing methods and ways ain't gonna work, especially with em coming from you.</p>
              <p>You want to MAKE her trust you, you want to MAKE her love you.</p>
              <p>All the more, you ain't trust worthy.</p>
              <p>What you have promised her and expected from her.. are exactly what others before you had promised and done as well. Do you think she will believe the same "promise" twice ? You take her as a fool don't ya ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My advise to you is to leave her be and let time heals her wounded heart.</p>
              <p>If she is truly worth your waiting, then wait and stop pressing.</p>
              <p>The question is .. DO YOU TRUST HER ?</p>
              <p>If ya don't, then why should she trust you?</p>
