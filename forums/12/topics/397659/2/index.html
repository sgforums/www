              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>u shldnt actually see ur group of old frens as a hinderance.</p>
              <p>infact, it would play to your advantage if you react properly in the right situations.</p>
              <p>being around old frensÂ should make it easier for youÂ to be yourself which is a plus point for a girl who says that sheÂ cant trust guys because then she will see you for the guy that u are, and not someone just pretending to be someone you're not in order to get her attention.</p>
              <p>and it's makes things easier for her as well because then she wouldnt be stressing herselfÂ time after timeÂ about going out with a guyÂ exclusively as you guys are hanging out together in a group.</p>
              <p>it will take time for girls to warm up to your feelings because they don't feel the same way right of the bat unless you look like someoneÂ whom she idolises.</p>
              <p>if you're really affectionate and care for her, your frens will see it too. friends play a big part when u became attracted to someone in the group. better still if her best friend(s) is also in the group, cause you can ask them to sound her out. If your friends feel that you are genuine at heart, surely they'll put in a word or two for you. of course that's if you also doing things right and not continuously pressing her to accept your advances.</p>
              <p>that's really all i can say, cause so far my females friends have complained only about how insensitive a guy is to their feelings when they start wanting to be more than just friends.</p>
              <p>peace out.</p>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>u shldnt actually see ur group of old frens as a hinderance.</p>
              <p>infact, it would play to your advantage if you react properly in the right situations.</p>
              <p>being around old frensÂ should make it easier for youÂ to be yourself which is a plus point for a girl who says that sheÂ cant trust guys because then she will see you for the guy that u are, and not someone just pretending to be someone you're not in order to get her attention.</p>
              <p>and it's makes things easier for her as well because then she wouldnt be stressing herselfÂ time after timeÂ about going out with a guyÂ exclusively as you guys are hanging out together in a group.</p>
              <p>it will take time for girls to warm up to your feelings because they don't feel the same way right of the bat unless you look like someoneÂ whom she idolises.</p>
              <p>if you're really affectionate and care for her, your frens will see it too. friends play a big part when u became attracted to someone in the group. better still if her best friend(s) is also in the group, cause you can ask them to sound her out. If your friends feel that you are genuine at heart, surely they'll put in a word or two for you. of course that's if you also doing things right and not continuously pressing her to accept your advances.</p>
              <p>that's really all i can say, cause so far my females friends have complained only about how insensitive a guy is to their feelings when they start wanting to be more than just friends.</p>
              <p>peace out.</p>

              <p>I have to admit that it's mentally exhausting to have things like these dragging on for so long . But I won't give up because I can see the light at the end of the tunnel and I'm very confident of that .</p>

              <p>Then good loh, if you feel you can tahan till the end, can even tahan if she reject u then go ahead. But from what you posted, seems like chances not too big, since her friends also got negative comments of you. Not so easy to change people opinion de leh..... But okay lah as long as be friend, dont zai yi so much, you wont get hurted as bad.</p>

              <p>Whats the point for pin pointing signs of being taken for granted ?</p>
              <p>Do you give hoping to get ? Or do you give for the sake of giving ?</p>
              <p>How can you tell when she's not taking you for granted ?</p>
              <p>If you want to be calculative.. then this kind of girl still healing from her past hurts ain't right for you. They are a long hard road to home. And the efforts you put in for the next few months/years may not reap you the rewards you seek at the end of the day.</p>
              <p>Look for the ones who are ready to be in a committed relationship.</p>

              <p>Hi guys , I've been trying to woo this girl for about 6 months now but she doesn't wants to get in a relationship because of her failed relationships in the past . She said that she had already lost trust in guys and relationships .</p>

              <p>Hi Ts, i am new to this forum here but if you may i like to give you my take on your situation.Â  Basically your last post ended off with signs taking you for granted. Actually there are signs displayed but from experience, the most important signs you got to look out for is what your gut feeling is telling you.</p>
              <p>People have acknowledge that a female's instinct/ sixth sense is very accurate but honesty, guys' gut feeling are more or less on the spot too. In-fact, when our ancestors roam the earth without today modern technologies, gut-feeling is one of the thing that help them to survive. When you feel, something is not right, you got to ask yourself or bring in friends to help you. Reason being, often the guy is too blinded by the beauty of the girl to make rational decision. Yes, personally, i agree that "beauty" is a drug.</p>
              <p>The fundamental question you should be asking too is that, " In this "relationship, is she in control now , or are you in control ? " More often or not, guys feel extremely miserable as no longer can they play a part in the relationship. They fall into the wait for the girl's action and react phase. I been through this so i understand the shit feeling of waiting for someone or someone's reply.</p>
              <p>What you should be looking for is the female interest level in you. for the sake of the readers here, the details are in this link. <a href="http://sixguysataprataplace.blogspot.com/2010/01/exploring-planet-venus.html">http://sixguysataprataplace.blogspot.com/2010/01/exploring-planet-venus.html</a></p>
              <p>When you can ascertain her interest level in you, you won't even have to confess anymore. Seriously, correct me if i am wrong but most girls will help you when they liked you. When they have the feeling of : " Gee,Â what is this guy doing at this moment?" and stuff like that, this shows they have high interest in you.Â </p>
              <p>Through horror stories and feedback from girls, i have also found out that it is always better to read the person action rather than their words. If the girl laugh at all your lamest jokes, make breakfast for you, wait for you so that you can accompany each other home, i tell you dude, even 3 blind mice can tell she is interested in you. Its so easy to say, i like you but i having problems with my ex or bla, bla , bla. Honestly , sometimes i think about it, if brad pitt were to ask her to be his gf, will she give all the reasons. I like to trust once again that, when girls likes you , they help you.</p>
              <p>Alright i think i have written a tad too long and i need to stop here.Â However, in this topic, the learning is endless and because far too many times , the author of the blog have come across guys not knowing what to do with girls, they set up this blog, <a href="http://sixguysataprataplace.blogspot.com/">http://sixguysataprataplace.blogspot.com/</a>Â , hoping that now, at last , there is a place for guys to vent out their frustrations.</p>
              <p>Take care dude. =)</p>
