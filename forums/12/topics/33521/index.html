            <div class='col-md body'>hi peeps. need you guys to conclude for me on something.<br><br>the first day of my poly life was such a joy when she came into my life. not that we ever talked much or anything but i like looking at her from a distance. she's in the same module group with me. i finally found something to look forward to in campus and i've found my "fire" to start things new and afresh, away from my secondary skool days which suck a lot.<br><br>i decided the first few weeks to make it a little obvious to her that i was interested in her. i never click with her girl group cuz i can't stand one girl from that group. anyways, it was on one occasion that i had to pass around some candy to the girls that i had this courage to ask a little bit about her. i asked her on the pronounciation of her name. then i begin to ask where she's from, i thought she was a foreigner or sth cuz she spoke cantonese, and at that time she made friends with 3 other malay girls so i assume she's from indonesia. silly me! she's chinese by the way and she's a local. that made her smile and i thought the conversation was the start of things to come. i've never felt better in any other days at campus.<br><br>well then it was a little difficult to get into a conversation with her, cuz i dun really click with her group in the first place and she's always with them. she's such a doll she never talks to any guys in campus... not at the best of my knowledge. maybe its cuz she's a little shy she only talks with ONE guy in my class, and she only talks to him to ask him about studies. even that, its a formal talk and it happens RARELY. i notice she would only go so far.<br><br>she's so innocent-like. that was the thing i like about her. in fact, me liking her was a no-brainer cuz i make it so obvious on that first impression. also, i try to sms greeting messages sometimes but she never replied. she replied only once asking who i was. and that was that. i sms around 6 times but not a good sign cuz she doesn't seem to take notice. i refuse to take it negatively. i still think she's just shy to admit anything, and girls that dun communicate sucks in most cases but in her case, well i think its in her nature to be who she was. conservative. and i dun blame her for that.<br><br>first of all, i dun think its my looks. and neither was my english cuz i speak with a little bit of the foreign tongue when it comes to english. thanx to the tv. they even thought that i was a foreign student in the beginning cuz of the way i talked. i dun think its my looks that chase her away cuz one of my friend told me that i am not that bad looking. thats all. he started this conversation by asking personal questions like whether i had a gf or not. whether i like someone in my campus. well i take it as a compliment. i take it that i look okay and added with my western drawl i think it made me quite appealing as a person. i'm not trying to brag here, its just the feedback i'm getting from my module group.<br><br>so anyways i really don't know what shes thinking. is she just being herself, doesn't want me in her life but just wants my attention, or even hates me for not making the first call too soon. i dun wan to make a fool out of myself. i'm trying to keep things real. i dun want to act like a fool to anybody. i think she knows that i like her but she's not giving me any good signs or doorways for me to walk through. i felt like shit ever since... i'm out of ammo i dun wanna look like a desperado in skool cuz that would just be a useless distraction in class. i grew tired of it but i was still hopeful. the position i'm in is not good. i dun make conversations with her group much, none of my guy friend does either. their group was okay at the beginning but i think somehow bcos of me, i gave everyone in my side a wrong impression of the girls group. the module group splitted into two cuz the girls group were starting to become such a tough cookie to crack. no thanx to me i think. this happened all in the first term.<br><br>now i'm in the second term and it is still this way. my biggest blow just happened today when my friend told me she told him that she already has a boyfriend. i didn't drop my jaw or anything but i asked him how exactly she told him. he said that he asked her in a casual fashion, he was like jokingly ask her and she told him. until now i still dunno what to think of that cuz i didn't think she was THAT sort of person. and i'm having a little trouble with reality my perspective of things changes... again. i really believed that she was this good girl whom i admire. how wrong i was? or am i?<br><br>now my question is mainly for the girls in this forum if possible. guys are welcome too. the question is: do girls tell guys' best friends (who actually like her)  that she has a boyfriend just to make him feel hurtful or am i not the only one who has had an experience like this before? i mean is it a just a hurtful lie or does she really have a boyfriend? in most cases, is it really true? or are they just making stuff up? i still wanna pursue this relationship cuz i just realise my mistake of being too idle in this one sided relationship. or is there no chance for me at all?<br><br>thanx for y'alls reply i would really appreciate it.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in the first place, if you really like her, you should also like her friends and try to click with them.. if not, it's hard for you to get closer to her. You can also ask about things of her from her friends..<br><br>Why she never reply your sms can be as simple as she's faithful to her boyfriend. So she just ask you who's that msging her.. or maybe you can think that she can't be bothered with sms msgs and she's plain lazy to reply msgs. She might also be shy, as what you have said, and kept those messages that you sent her and didn't know what to reply u..<br><br>since she's so conservative about herself, and i think she's the type that doesn't joke around.. and since she had said that she's attached, i think she's serious.<br><br>you should somehow approach her one of these days to ask her whether she's attached with anyone or not.<br><br>and for your question <span style="font-style: italic;">do girls tell guys' best friends (who actually like her that she has a boyfriend just to make him feel hurtful)</span>.. She told your best friend because she doesn't wants you to get hurt and since he told your best friend, she assumes that your friend understands you better than her..<br><br>the end .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hrmm<br>I'm gonna tell u quite honestly that if she say she has a bf and if she has no intention to leave him u better give up honestly. I once was in the same position, took a girl out for about a month or so and later found out she has a bf. Sometimes girls dun expose their relationship to others that they do not know very well. Especially shy ones, anyway she and me are still good friends.<br><br>So maybe you can get to know her better wif no other intention and should something happen in the future that would be left to f8 to decide. Least should nothing happen u wun end up wif a big disappointment. Thats how life goes Good Luck <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

i mean is it a just a hurtful lie or does she really have a boyfriend? in most cases, is it really true? or are they just making stuff up? i still wanna pursue this relationship cuz i just realise my mistake of being too idle in this one sided relationship. or is there no chance for me at all?<br><br>thanx for y'alls reply i would really appreciate it.<br><br></div></blockquote>wah lao eh... you b!tch untill like she cheated you or something.<br><br><strong>you said "and i'm having a little trouble with reality my perspective of things changes... again. i really believed that she was this good girl whom i admire. how wrong i was? or am i?"</strong><br>why do you need to change your opinion on her when you found she had a bf? you dun know her "THAT" well in the 1st place either. you yourself said you dun talk to her much also wat. the her you thought she is was just an image you created yourself.<br><br><strong>and for your last question, "do girls tell guys' best friends (who actually like her) that she has a boyfriend just to make him feel hurtful or am i not the only one who has had an experience like this before?"</strong><br>did you ask her if she had any bf? no right? your friend asked it. so she told him. how can you say she is not telling you about her bf? you didnt her ask it in the 1st place.<br><br><strong>"well i can't take her word for it. cuz i believe that she's not the sort of person who would click with a guy that fast. and i really believe that not blindly. i am very observant. and not even considering me? i mean at least dun haf to tell it to my best friend cuz that would only make me hurt even more right? i mean her motive is clear if that were the case. to hurt me? that is too cruel. thats why i'm half guessin that she does it only to spite me... but then again, i dunno what to think without u ppl's opinion."</strong><br>pls... how long did you know her? few mths? everything can be deceiving boy... more over, you are interested in her of coz you would think she is a pure angel lah.<br>why cant she had bf even tho she dont click fast with guys?<br>she told you best pal cos he asked her! stop thinking that she is out to spite you or make you angry or what ever you want it to be.<br>and... why the hell does she wanna spite or hurt you? i think you may be thinking too highly of yourself liao. to her you may be just a classmate thats all.<br><br><strong>"do i know u or sth? how would u know if she has a bf? anyways my trusty friend actually asked all the girls from my group the first time round earlier and he never mantioned her of having any bf. he knows one of the other girls has. thats my best information that i haf. but seriously, do i know who u r?"</strong><br>not everyone will go around telling ppl about their private live when asked you know? i guess you friend asked them when you all just started poly right? and she doesnt know all of you that well, so why does she have to tell you guys everything?<br><br>so... i think you better stop thinking so much, like why she lie to you lah, is she trying to hurt you lah or something. she is just telling you friend what he asked. so dun jump to the conclusion that she is out to spite or hurt you.<br>the problem here is, you think you know her but you actually dont.<br>and the way you sound is like you are thinking that you are someone special in her heart or something. you never know... she may be just treating you as a normal friend or worse... a classmate.<br>i know you may not like wat i said and might now be scolding me saying i know nothing... but thats wat i think about your problems lor.<br><br><strong>"i still wanna pursue this relationship cuz i just realise my mistake of being too idle in this one sided relationship. or is there no chance for me at all?" </strong><br>you have to think about it yourself... you wanna give up coz she said she had bf or you wanna stop idle around and take some action?<br>there is always a chance if you try...<br>but dun come b!tching that she hurt you again if you fail.</div>
