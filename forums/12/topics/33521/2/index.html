no right? your friend asked it. so she told him. how can you say she is not telling you about her bf? you didnt her ask it in the 1st place.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> its not to say that i dun like it that she doesn't tell me. in fact, i'd rather she keep that to herself and make it less obvious to me... which made me thought that she tell my friend on purpose to spite me. but i didn't say she was a b|tch. i'm not a selfish person i'm just trying to put the pieces together.<br><br><strong>"well i can't take her word for it. cuz i believe that she's not the sort of person who would click with a guy that fast. and i really believe that not blindly. i am very observant. and not even considering me? i mean at least dun haf to tell it to my best friend cuz that would only make me hurt even more right? i mean her motive is clear if that were the case. to hurt me? that is too cruel. thats why i'm half guessin that she does it only to spite me... but then again, i dunno what to think without u ppl's opinion."</strong><br>pls... how long did you know her? few mths? everything can be deceiving boy... more over, you are interested in her of coz you would think she is a pure angel lah.<br>why cant she had bf even tho she dont click fast with guys?<br>she told you best pal cos he asked her! stop thinking that she is out to spite you or make you angry or what ever you want it to be.<br>and... why the hell does she wanna spite or hurt you? i think you may be thinking too highly of yourself liao. to her you may be just a classmate thats all.<br><br>heheh! true... but why is it then when i make jokes in front of her she pulls that dao face on me? weird right. meaning she must be unsatisfied with me on certain things... or i did sth wrong.... maybe i flirt with other girls and not her. thing is, i'm inable to flirt well with the girl that i like. maybe that made her feel awkward? but definitely, there's some unresolve tension between me and her. somebody needs to speak up...<br><br><strong>"do i know u or sth? how would u know if she has a bf? anyways my trusty friend actually asked all the girls from my group the first time round earlier and he never mantioned her of having any bf. he knows one of the other girls has. thats my best information that i haf. but seriously, do i know who u r?"</strong><br>not everyone will go around telling ppl about their private live when asked you know?

or am i?<br><br>now my question is mainly for the girls in this forum if possible. guys are welcome too. the question is: do girls tell guys' best friends (who actually like her)  that she has a boyfriend just to make him feel hurtful or am i not the only one who has had an experience like this before? i mean is it a just a hurtful lie or does she really have a boyfriend? in most cases, is it really true? or are they just making stuff up? i still wanna pursue this relationship cuz i just realise my mistake of being too idle in this one sided relationship. or is there no chance for me at all?<br><br>thanx for y'alls reply i would really appreciate it.<br><br></div></blockquote>which poly are you from?
