Well, to my point of view... some people will never learn how to cherish someone special or be happy and content with what they have until they lose it. Its the same with me... we are going through the same problem. The only different is that mine lasted for 6 years before finally breaking <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  I don't think that you are posessive but just feeling very insecure. Sometimes, i believe that it is better to loved and lost then to have never at all. If you know that this relationship is worth trying then don't give up without a fight. Good luck and hope for the best!</div>
