It seems that she is unsure of what she wants and looks like you would need to give more than what you can to ensure that you are the "Mr Right"..<br><br>If this goes on.. I would advice you to give an indirect confrontation so that she knows you are aware of what is happening instead of blur blur standing "listening" to all her "commands."<br><br>Don't let love blind you and control you.. You control the situation. She can be telling you in the world that she loves you and such.. But you got to give yourself a limit to what can be done.<br><br>If you insist that you have given your best and letting her know indirectly that she is "playing with your feelings" still does not help..
