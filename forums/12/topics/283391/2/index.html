So what if your salary is high but cannot find true love or happiness but rather the gal go for your money only???<br><br>As long as a guy can click with me, i go for it. But no sex please</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You have to understand Singaporean girls. Why not go into a neoprint booth, and browse through the neoprints that have been taken before ?<br><br>You'll see girls hugging, girls kissing, girls doing EVERYTHING, even if they're just friends. So bringing yourself to sit closer to her in a taxi probably isn't a big deal to her.<br><br>Females have complex minds, you really can't know if they like you or not.<br><br>If you don't have the courage to ask her face to face, ask on MSN or something. Or you can use the indirect way of asking - ask if she has any crushes, or anyone she likes. If she asks why, just say you're curious. (: You two are pretty close so I don't think it's a problem, no ?</div>
