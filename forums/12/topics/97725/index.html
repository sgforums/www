            <div class='col-md body'>i've been having this problem all my life. my father has been lousy controlling his temper. recently he started to show signs of becoming senile, by hoarding old things he had bought from sungei road. now, my small three room flat is totally packed up with no space to even walk through the house. it is becoming so filthy that it has sparked off a skin allergy on me. i have tried many times to talk to him to clear up the place and he kept procrastinating. it has been a total of 5times in less than a year that he said he will, but nothing was ever done. whenever i raise my voice, he would hit me or challenge me to a physical fight outside the house, which i smartly declined. the problem is that he has a 60% ownership of the house. my mum has no way of buying another house due to lack of funds. as such we are stuck here. i would like to discuss what options i have to make my life better. i have thought of getting them to sign divorce papers, but from there, where will me, my mum and bro stay? i do not wish to bring in the law unless its absolutly needed. i have an ambition to become an air force pilot, which i am working hard to achieve. one of the requirements to be a pilot is to have a stable family history, which the SAF would check by looking into legal records. i do not want to place my ambition at great risk.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just some thoughts<br><br>Why don't somebody here organise a gang (big enought) to visit the house and buy over the junk from the father (at a token sum or whatever amount deemed reasonable) and the big gang will then remove the junk (in one trip) and then set up stall in Sungei Road to sell.<br><br>Maybe you can ask your father how much he is willing to part with the junks.  Then get a garnag gunny man to remove the junks and pay him the asking price.<br><br>Another way is to buy sufficient number of those boxes (must be one regular size) used by the house mover.  Get a gang together from here to go to your house.  Organise the junks and put them in the boxes and then pile up the boxes to the ceiling.  Your house will be ready for more junks to come.  Haha.<br><br>Just some sily thoughts for you to consider and for others to add on.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thats a very interesting proposal. when i can, i will consider that. the town coucil has come by before to warm about the fire hazard of the things outside but he has sweet talked them to go away. no point finding him a job. i tried applying to the library to take him in but he doesn't want to work. my mum got him a job at my auntie's provision shop but he got into trouble with the gangs there so can't work cos of the threat to my relatives. meanwhile, i've found this while searching through the hdb website<br><br>Direction by Board to remove any article or object placed in a manner likely to cause damage to property, etc.<br>63.

I think there is really a mental problem with him from what I am reading (but I have no way to judge). Obsessive compulsive behaviours can exhibit through behaviours like continously cleaning the house or self , OR  collecting junk. Either way whether senile or mentally disturbed ...ur dad needs medical help .... no amount of HDB and town council interventions are going to help if he has a medical problem .  Get him examined . I know sometimes you can call a gp to do a homevisit if you are worried - talk to the gp about your father's behaviour and bring photos of the house. Or call the number below and explain your situation - I think maybe they could help but I am not sure.    Hoarding trash is not normal . Senility comes with forgetfulness and agitation in an unknown environment, not violence unless they feel cornered. People who are senile don't usually make excuses for their actions either.
