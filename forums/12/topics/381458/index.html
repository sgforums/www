              <p>Hello guys.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Firstly i would thank those who have helped me on my previous topic. Remember when i said that i want to fufill my goals before i reach 20, well i did and i never feel so alive until now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Last sat, me and my friends were in the rebel(club) and its kinda like my first time getting high. Im not sure how exactly "high" feels like but i think i have one that night. My friends called me weak because just a few vodka shot apple and im already in that state. Anyway, me and my friend (girl of course) were dancing side by side. Let me tell u, my friend here is the most cheerful girl i've ever met within our group. She so fun to hang out with and when we were dancing, she often do those random acts and i laughed. Ok here comes the awkward part, since we didnt think through u know... high and all, we ended up hugging each other and next was just a peck here and there. I have no idea where all of my friends are that time because im too caught up with this girl. I was excited and guilty at the same time because she's my friend.... what am i thinking? but i didnt think clearly at that time.</p>
              <p>To my surprise, there were quite a number of boys and girls coming out together from the boys toilet. i was "wow" since its my first time and i suddenly felt this sexual energy in me and to add in more, this girl is holding my hand somemore. We went inside and just hug here and there non stop and kissing too. the funny thing is we fell asleep in the cubicle for less than an hour i think.</p>
              <p>She woke me up and her eyes widened. She said things like omg and what the hell we doing? and stuff like that. My vision were clearing up and i can suddenly felt the pressure building up. Our friends were already know about this and they just tease us around but she didn't took it quite well and after that day onwards... its beginning to worry me.</p>
              <p>When we went out last sun, she went quiet all day. I mean there is a talk from her but its awkward that majority of her is silence. Usually she's not like that, she's freaking playful and love to make people smile. She's quite crazy but that day was weird. And not only that, she avoid any physical touching from us (boys only). When one of our guys tap her shoulder, she straight away wiggle it away and gave out a pity smile. "???" was in our head. Normally, she would just playfully flirt back and she dont even care if we hug her from behind. But now is a new different person.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Guys pls advice. Do anyone of the girls in your group react this way? is this some kind of the emo stage of girls?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And especially to girls, just asking but do u girls have stomachache 4-6 times a day? is it those the girls nature thing? </p>

              <p>From your observations of her, she seemed the typical flirty girl. All she wants is just to have fun, to flirt and NOT to entertain any serious sexual advances, even to the extend of under influence of liqour.</p>
              <p>She believes she can control such physical contacts, despite probably many advices from parents and friends. But being young and youthful, eager to try many things, her confidence or rather over-confidence in her abilities had been over-rated, from her performance.</p>
              <p>All that had happened had shocked her to the core, badly shakened her beliefs, and her present emotions is to deal with such shattered beliefs of herself - with silence and better understanding, to regain her confidence.</p>
              <p>Time is a good healer, and perhaps thru this experience, she may change into a more serious person. But if her confidence is high, she will easily revert back to her flirty ways, and even more determined to gain better control of herself, by testing the limits of her liqour intake and sexual conduct.</p>
              <p>The only thing from absolutely shattering her into an all out surrender of her confidence, turning herself into a cheap whore is that she was only involve in some heavy petting and not a frightening drunk stupored sexual intercourse which would happened if she had been in new environment without close friends.</p>
              <p>This held her back, as well as her sense of shame she would feel for being in a toilet cubicle with you, witnessed by her friends, worse if it was her very friends who had advised her not to be too flirty for there would be consequences.</p>
              <p>The way to help her deal with it is to explain to yours and her friends honestly that nothing actually happened in the cubicle. Let her regain her pride and confidence, and that you both were drunk.</p>
              <p>Reassure everytime possible, that you had no intentions for petting. It was your first time handling liqour, and that it would not happen again, no matter what happens.</p>
              <p>And give her time to come to terms to deal with what happened. Changes would be imminent. For better or worse, only she can decide. All you can do is to give her moral support, encourage your friends to give her that too, and treat the affair as an experience, part of growing up, at least a lesser mistake than one where worse could have happen.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              <p>The event should have been to tramatic for her to accept. Someone who is flirty, outgoing etc doesn't mean shes loose or willing to get too involved with anyone besides out of fun.</p>
              <p>U urself should go think carefully what u do when u go clubbing etc next time. If u cannot hold ur own liquor well, u better not drink as this time nothing happen doesn't mean the same thing will happen again in future and you might live to regret like some people i know...</p>

              <p><span style="color: #000000;">the ones that i had highlighted really scares me. I swear to u i really dont want her to be a whore. Its something that i will cry if i saw her selling herself.But i just kept on thinking how good it felt when i touch her. there's nothing wrong right?<br></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #000000;">But i miss the old her. i really like her being herself...she is so much fun with that personality. Now its like a souless girl. And ya one of our friend hates me because of this. Another addition to my stress.</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And thanks fro the help. I guess all i can do now is just be patience and hope she will be back to normal, i hope.</p>

              <p>The event should have been to tramatic for her to accept.
              Someone who is flirty, outgoing etc doesn't mean shes loose or

              <p>U urself should go think carefully what u do when u go clubbing

              drink as this time nothing happen doesn't mean the same thing will
              happen again in future and you might live to regret like some

              <p>both of u noe exactly wad happened, but she herself still can't accept the fact that she's so into physical contact with u.</p>
              <p>i think it's hard for her to completely forget this incident, especially since she's a girl. So that means even if both of u only engage in so called petting and nothing else, it still cause quite an impact on her, ruining her so called image infront of her frens.  It's hard for her to regain back her own self whenever she's with u, and the frens who noe abt this incident.</p>
              <p>no wonder they say "é…’å�Žä¹±æ€§“. maybe try talking to her how she feels about the whole thing and see how it goes. what has been done cannot be undone.</p>
