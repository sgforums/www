              <p>Pls stop arguing here. But i have to agree with dkcx. He already warned me about doing this before i reach 20. I'm really sorry but i just cant think straight and dont know what to do and furthermore, she's a girl and i see lots of my friends got experience around that area and i see them quite cool.</p>

              <p>Don't make it a big issue, dude. I'm sure she can resolve the matter herself. Let nature take its course. One thing you must question yourself is whether you like her sexually or romantically or you want her just as a friend, nothing else. If you choose the latter, then u can let her know that you are still friends and nothing more. Or else, let her decide.</p>

              <p>one thing that puzzles me is that since she's being uncomfortable or being extremely quiet infront of u guys, why does she still hang out with u all? she can jolly well avoid u guys for the time being.</p>
              <p>anyway, just leave her alone for awhile and wait till she finally initiates to talk to u. if u keep on pestering her to talk, it may create a negative impression on u.</p>

              <p><br>because of our female friends. Her best friend asked her out to let her stress free and to cool it down. So far no affect yet. Besides, i remember she saying that she will go out no matter what because its bored at home. At least there's one thing in her didnt change.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok sure :) i'll wait for her to talk to me then i talk to her. Hope me best of luck. thanks</p>
