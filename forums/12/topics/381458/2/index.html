              <p>both of u noe exactly wad happened, but she herself still can't accept the fact that she's so into physical contact with u.</p>
              <p>i think it's hard for her to completely forget this incident, especially since she's a girl. So that means even if both of u only engage in so called petting and nothing else, it still cause quite an impact on her, ruining her so called image infront of her frens.  It's hard for her to regain back her own self whenever she's with u, and the frens who noe abt this incident.</p>
              <p>no wonder they say "é…’å�Žä¹±æ€§“. maybe try talking to her how she feels about the whole thing and see how it goes. what has been done cannot be undone.</p>

              <p>I appreciate it but its upsets me when i read your 2nd paragraph. U mean i have to not go out whenever im with her? She no mood to talk, i tried and our friends tried too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So i guess ur right. When she go out together with us, i have to avoid her or not to be in a present state when she's around. Thanks for the advice :) hope it turn out good for me and her</p>

              <p>U are not a kid anymore, don't be stupid and ever doing such stuff again. I've already told u before that your aim of getting involved with a girl before 20 is totally stupid and if you don't start being practical and stop fooling around, this won't be the last time such things might happen to u.</p>

              <p>Don't make it a big issue, dude. I'm sure she can resolve the matter herself. Let nature take its course. One thing you must question yourself is whether you like her sexually or romantically or you want her just as a friend, nothing else. If you choose the latter, then u can let her know that you are still friends and nothing more. Or else, let her decide.</p>

              <p>one thing that puzzles me is that since she's being uncomfortable or being extremely quiet infront of u guys, why does she still hang out with u all? she can jolly well avoid u guys for the time being.</p>
              <p>anyway, just leave her alone for awhile and wait till she finally initiates to talk to u. if u keep on pestering her to talk, it may create a negative impression on u.</p>

              <p>No guts to come find me right. I know u have a fear of uni cos ur brains cannot accept most ppl can go in yet poor thing like u cannot.</p>
              <p>Do come down, i'll give u the chance to visit the counselling center on campus as well as share ur problems with my profs and maybe some of them can help u with ur low self esteem issue and teach u how to face uni undergrads without being scared.</p>
