            <div class='col-md body'>Dude you just like dug a 6 foot hole for yourself when you accepted that marriage proposal.<br><br>I don't know. But it sounds like your wife is having second thoughts since mariage life is probably not what she expected. I am curious though. How long did you know her before you were both married ?<br><br>I find it hard that a person can change so fast unless she is much more weak-willed. Perhaps she has been brainwashed by some ppl. Hard to say. Since she is avoiding the issue there is no real point in discussing it. Might be get worst with counselling.<br><br>Personally I think she is playing you. She probably having fun being single again and I promise you mistakes will be made. Going clubbing and all means getting drunk and when you are drunk you will make mistakes. Sooner or later. And when that happens its going to get worst.<br><br>Now if you want to divorce her than she gets alimony and live off all your hard work while she keeps enjoying her carefree life. Ask yourself this, if she really treasured your  love for her and hers for you, do you think she would take off her wedding ring and tell people she is still single. When she says she is single it is an invitation for other men to come and woo her and crap.<br><br>And don't listen to this "talk to her" cow dung. You gave it a go and she didn't even think it important  enough to talk over it with you. You and her are HUSBAND AND WIFE. If you two can't even discuss about your marital problems sincerely there is no real point in being married ia there. Its insulting the very santity and foundation a marriage is suppose to be based upon.<br><br>Here we have a sincere guy working hard to earn money and put food on the table. And provide a roof over her head. So instead of appreciating the kind of sacrifice the guy made, the girl complains her freedom is being stifled and taken away. NOW TELL ME, WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH THAT ?! Why are people even trying to find a reason why the girl might be doing it. I am sure tequila has done all he can. He's 30 and surely enough more than intelligent and mature to figure and approach the problem.<br><br>Shes demanding too much without even doing anything. I detest women like that. Who the hell they think they are. I have seen so many of this cow dung its making me sick. Worst of all the guy have to shoulder some of the blame or fault. What UTTER CRAP.<br><br>My advice is simple. Don't give in to anything she wants. She wants a divorce, don't give her one. Thats right, drag her along and make her suffer. She wants to fool around. Fine you can do that to. She wants moolah. Go tell her to earn her own. From now on have separate bank accounts and assets. This is to protect your own arse. Give her a divorce and she is going to squeeze you for everything you got. &lt;---------- well this scenario if she really is not even bother trying to save the marriage and trying to scum off you later<br><br>But through all this I do wish you the best. Hope in some way maybe she just lost and need some nudging back to the right path. Just try your best to sort it out with your wife.

I dun want to waste my time seeing her around my life... I intend to ask her abt her decision today again, if she still refused to change then i will chase her out of the house, i dun want my mum and me to be her maid anymore. We had been taking care of her, my mum even wash her clothes, buy her meals but she dun show any appreciation at all. I'm certain her parents will not let her stay as well as her younger sis was divorced too(maybe it was in her family blood) and her mum dun let her come back and stay. And i being too much?<br>I think i have to consult a lawyer regarding tje alimony issue. Dun think i need to give her if i'm earning less than her right?.</div>
