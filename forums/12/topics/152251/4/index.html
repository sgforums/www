She blamed me for treating her so cold for the past few days and refused to talk to me.. Said she will talk to me if she wants to. Am i wrong to treat her coldly when she had done all this thing? Does she expect me to joke with her, love her as much as before?

She came back and pretend nothing happened. Telling me she spent a lot this month, ask me want to share a cab with her but i declined. I told her its better for us to separate for awhile, move back to her mum's place to cool down for awhile but she dun seems want to do so. Its not that she dun want but i think she's tooo lazy as she had a lot of stuff in the house or she's afraid her parents will scold her.<br><br>My mum is very worry abt us. She told me to let do what she wants for awhile if things still dun work well then think of divorce. I feel so guilty to make my mum worried. My sis-in- law passed away after married for 2 months hence i can understand how she feels.<br><br>I dun think her parents can help in anyway as they r the one who really spoilt her. They are simply the slave of their 4 siblings. And my wife is very rebellious hence dun think she will listen to them..</div>

Its partly due to my job but the other side of her is even more scaring if u had read her mail. This job had great potential for me and the reason why i work so hard is also to provide a better future for us.

Seeing a counsellor has nothing to do with control and checking on her... Like you've also mentioned, you simply can't tolerate her form of life-style... Have you been too harsh when trying to patch things through..? You simply can't just expect her to be only agreeing with you and not understanding that she needs her own life at the same time...? Certainly that would be even hard to carry out the 1st step in a negotiation....?<br><br>Instead of just making demands from each other, how about seeing things from another angle..? About how things might just fit in from another way so that things can be through and better...?<br><br>Make a PROPER 1st step approach and your counsellor might just be doing the right things for you... Making of WRONG MOVES (especially emotional ones) just set the sailing even further...</div>

My working hour is like from 11am to 10pm so it seems to be no life for me. My wife who works 5 day week, 8-5 job is always left alone hence i brought her a dog which she's been longing for it. Things goes on well until last month when she knew some guys in disco. She started to change. She stopped wearing her wedding band, took off her "married" status in friendster. The worse thing is she will meet up with them and came back at 5am or even in later hour. she will not answer my call when she's out or didn't even tell me where she's going when she went out. Last nite she went out and came back the next day at 11am. What is this?? She said i dun give her freedom and control her too much. Is there any guys will give such a freedom when your wife is telling ppl she's still single? We quarrelled a lot of times because of this. I'm really very devasted by the change she make.. I was actually thinking of divorce or separate for awhile and let her think what she wants as she told me she's not used to married life. What should i do? </div></blockquote>u ever tried changing your own job to working hours at least u knock off at latest 8p.m? seriously like that u are not spending enough time at nite with her which is a very bad thing especially when u know girls always crave for attention. for me i never like clubbing girls or girls who club frequent...a leopard never changes its spots....i prefer those with healthier life style.<br><br>i believe this can be solved....if everyone divorce so easy the why get married in the first place? if u really at the wits end then just kill that philanderer <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> this will teach monkies that a wise monkey will nevern monkey with another monkey's monkey</div>
