            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet Tequila,<br><br>I am sorry to hear about it. It seems to me you have already tried to talk to her but to no avail. Well if you want to get to the core of the issue its best you have a Tarot session with me, as that would be able to give you a clearer picture of your present situation, the recent past &amp; what to come. From there, i will see what i can do to help you thus providing the best course of action to take inorder to resolve it as we are dealing with the issue from the core. If everything seem so bleak, it won't harm to try,why don't you let me help you, do not hesitate to contact me via PM. Divorce is not a solution or an end to your issue, If there is still Love between both of you be it more or less, if there is a chance to salvage it, i don't see why not. If you chose to end it otherwise, why get married in the 1st place. At the meantime, just don't get too worried over it, let got of all negative feelings, by wallowing in sadness with alot of negative thoughts, it will not help at all but worsened the current situation adding more negativity to it thus affecting the outcome. Take care &amp; don't think too much.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

I did confronted her and she maintains as they r just friends. Occasionally she will tell me more abt them but very briefly. And u r right, everytime when quarrels r over, she will pretend everything is alright and the problems will come back again.

I did tell her b4 i accept this job that i won't be able to spent much time with her if i accept the job offerred. She gave me the green light to go..<br>I dun mind she went out and have fun but not to the extend to come home at 5, 6am or even din come home till the next day afternoon? And telling ppl that she's not married. She did told me most guys won't want to be her friend if they knew she's married but i find that if thats the case, they r not geniunely ur friends. Although she's 29 but she always behave like a kid.<br>I did talked to my boss for a shorter hour but due to our business volume and manpower movement, i can't do so. I even tot of switching to another job with shorter hours but less prospect and pay... But i just can't bring myself to take it..</div>

Her parents dun seems to know what to do to her as well, she's totally spoilt by them that lead to my misery. I pack the room, clean the dog when i reached home at 11pm after work, my mum wash our clothes, cooks or buy dinner for her but she's just laze around when she come home at 7 or 8 pm. sometimes i even cook for her but i dun mind all this as i want to compensate her for the time i can't company her. She dun appreciate what my mum and i at all.</div>

My working hour is like from 11am to 10pm so it seems to be no life for me. My wife who works 5 day week, 8-5 job is always left alone hence i brought her a dog which she's been longing for it. Things goes on well until last month when she knew some guys in disco. She started to change. She stopped wearing her wedding band, took off her "married" status in friendster. The worse thing is she will meet up with them and came back at 5am or even in later hour. she will not answer my call when she's out or didn't even tell me where she's going when she went out. Last nite she went out and came back the next day at 11am. What is this?? She said i dun give her freedom and control her too much. Is there any guys will give such a freedom when your wife is telling ppl she's still single? We quarrelled a lot of times because of this. I'm really very devasted by the change she make.. I was actually thinking of divorce or separate for awhile and let her think what she wants as she told me she's not used to married life. What should i do? </div></blockquote>Try to get her back at a friendship level 1st before it drift too far apart...?</div>
