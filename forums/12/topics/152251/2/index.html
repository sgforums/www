Maybe the Love between both of you has turned cold or lost its fire. What you should do is to rekindle this Love between both of you. Changing a new job may not solve the existing problem. Anyway these will be my advice to you for now unless you want to take another step further to seek my help. I am sure i can help you if there is still Love between both of you, be it more or less. If you chose to seek Professional Psychiatric help as in Marriage Counsellor, if she is agreeable its not a bad idea too. If your issue is not due to psychology aspect of Marriage, it would'nt harm to seek any Spiritual help. I have help many over the years in situations similar to yours.

She probably thinks that it is time to get married, but not exactly so in terms of maturity, mindset and everything else. This could be due to her ticking biological clock or external pressure like her parents.<br><br>The reason being very simple: a woman leading a married life the way she did during singlehood (which technically means unmarried life, not singlehood as in unattached), says alot of things. Sure, we don't go about restricting this and forbiding that, however, who in a stable state of emotional mind would go clubbing as often as one would do when one isn't married?<br><br>This alone question her grounds for marriage in the first place.<br><br>The following clues further reinforced my stand; denial of being married and its status.<br><br>Her priority ain't settled and is definitely not suitable for marriage.<br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Too bad, we can't reverse time - Since you have gotten her as your wife AND KNOWING that your marriage is creeping towards the edge of doom, trust me - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>if you give it enough time to mutilate, it's game over forever</strong></span>. You can put your continue to hang onto the job, but this decision almost guarantee a doomed marriage. Your wife already shown signs of infidelity and if this marriage means something to you, the least you could do is to prevent further hemorrhage.<br><br>But I must stress that changing a job DOESN'T GUARANTEE you that she will remain faithful to you, for Love cannot assimilate into the unwilling. But at least when you know you have did what you could, you will not look back and tell yourself why didn't you do this... do that...<br><br>P.S: Something to think about: which is more important to you? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
