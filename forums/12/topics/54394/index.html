            <div class='col-md body'>A lot of people would do that - especially in the beginning of a relationship.  Both of you are anxious to get to know each other better, and it's only natural to go through a 'honeymoon' period.<br><br>If it's only for a short while, I am sure your friends would understand.  And it's wise to keep it only a short while, because while you have just met your girl, your friends have been there with you through thick and thin .. and you'd want to have people to invite to your wedding!  J/K.<br><br>Anyway, you'd be really lucky if you can get a girlfriend who can get along with your friends, but chances are, your friends and her would probably hate each others' guts .. so you'd have to be pretty smart before you decide that your friends will think as highly of your girlfriend as you do.<br><br>So, spend a good portion of your free time with your girl, but keep in touch with your friends, if possible, once a week? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>It's a quantity vs quality issue here.<br><br>Spending quality time with your gf, quanlity time with your friends or vice versa? Know how to strike a balance between the both will be the most advisable.<br><br>Then again, may I remind you some gal just want their guys to prioritise them above anything else. Basically it's the <span style="color: brown;">'You-don't-spend-time-with-me-bcoz-you-dont-care-about-me' </span>mentality or it's the <span style="color: brown;">'You-mean-your-friends-are-more-important-than-me'</span> attitude. Then it's up to you to assure her on your stand and make things workable.<br><br>Likewise for your friends, they should be able to understand the fact that you're in a new r/s and you're in cloud nine and that you will be yearning to spend the 'honeymoon period' with your gf. If they don't understand, talk to them nicely. Friends want the best for their friends as well, so chances are they'll get it when you tell them.<br><br>Aboveall, it's the mindset of your friends and gf which can indirectly affect yourself and the things you do. You know them well, so you should be able to handle the situation.<br><br>Of coz it'll be good to involve your gf and get her to mix well with your groups of friends so that she knows who you're mixing around with and at the same time you guys have more things to talk about... it's not her leading her life, while you leading yours. Inject some 'life' into the r/s by involving her, so that the things you guys talk about to each other will gradually expand. She can also get you involved with her cliques... you get what I mean?<br><br>All the best...<br><br>Cheerz.</div>
