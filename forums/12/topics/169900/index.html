Nonetheless, my advice is for you to ask your gf calmly about what's going on.  If she's truly sorry &amp; repentant, then the ball would be in your court.  Take some time to clear your head.  If you believe that she's Not gonna do it anymore, you'll hafta decide whether the relationship means enough for you to overlook 1 mistake.<br><br>Ultimately, humans all make mistakes.  All of us have hurt our partners 1 way or another.  True, she's chosen to hurt &amp; humiliate you in the worst way possible, but it could be a mistake that she regrets &amp; won't repeat again.<br><br>It all depends on how well you know her.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by selling84:</div><div class="quote_body">thanks for all the replies...think i have to talk to her tat is the only way out... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote></div>

If she insists she's innocent.. aiyah.. that's worst.. u can expect any honesty from her towards u anymore... Don't torture yourself man.. There are still many who are worth ur efforts n love... and she has never loved u anyway... so what for u do too much???
