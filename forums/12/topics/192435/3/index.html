I have to do something about it, I have to confess. But how? Im not trying to make myself sound pathetic or anything, but i would really not love again if this girl dies or anything, because i really cant find myself having feelings for anyone anymore because they are not her.  I wanna ask her out one day, some day special. And i would wanna confess to her on that day, But how? How can i do it to make a sucessful one? </div></blockquote>You love an "ideal girl" and she doesn't exists. You have placed your "ideal girl" into the body of that girl.<br><br>How I know? You do not have a relationship with her but you are overwhelmingly in love with her.<br><br>So you are just setting yourself up for a big disappointment. Not that it is a big deal because everybody went through what you are feeling now.<br><br>I want to tell you to "wake up" but what's the point? This is your time, you might never feel this way again for the rest of your life. So enjoy it but do take care and do not neglect your studies or work.</div>

If tio reject then let it be , you 2 can still be friends and still try to woo her from there . I've been through your stage and i understand how you feel . All i can say is if you fear rejection , then forget about her being your girlfriend . ai pai jia eh yia</div>

Why cant you two remain as friends and understand her better first ? You know her for how long only and you already cant wait .. not trying to pour cold water but i dont think she wants to be with you . ONLY solution now is be friend with her back . Try to be more open , giving her replies like "haha" and "lol" . showing her that you two still can be friends after everything fails instead of making the situation worst .</div>
