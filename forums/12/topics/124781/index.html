            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I am a male, 31 years of age. IÂ’ve been married for almost 4 years now. I have been quarreling with my wife quite often e.g. at least once in a month average. Some quarrels are quite bad while others are not so bad. All these quarreling have been going on after one year of our marriage.<br><br>I have quite a bad temper and she is stubborn to the core. If I raised my voice a little bit sheÂ’d go berserk and start to mention the Â“DÂ” word. We had some fights before, but I must say that I was being forced to hit her because she would pushed me around and scratch me very hard on my neck, arms, thighs and sheÂ’s also very hurtful with her words. I would dare say that sheÂ’s the one started it first. She even kicked my spine when I ignore her questions! IÂ’d promised her IÂ’d never hit a woman but I guess I broke the promise. I feel really, really bad after that. I need to apologized profusely before she would forgive me, even if she started it all.<br><br>Third year of marriage, even more Â“DÂ” word flying around whenever I did something wrong. I was a smoker when we knew each other. After marriage, I promise her I will quit. But as usual, itÂ’s very hard to quit. IÂ’ve tried many times to quit and thereÂ’s a time I managed to stop smoking for about 3 months. However,  IÂ’ve started to smoke again whenever we quarrel. If you want to know what we are quarreling about, I will tell you. Most of the time, we would quarrel over trivial matters, really. Sometimes we would quarrel because she has her way of doing things while I have my own, IÂ’d give in eventually.<br><br>She earns more than I am. SheÂ’s contributed to the flat more than I am. She had more education than I am. But I am catching up, as I am about to complete my studies. Somehow, I always feel that she would threaten me with the Â“DÂ” word whenever we quarrel, just to make me give in? Or does she really mean it? I would always worry and feel bad whenever she mentions the Â“DÂ” word, hence, I would apologize to her eventually. Sometimes, even both parties are in the wrong, I would still apologize while she would most of the time, not apologize. I really donÂ’t know.<br><br>Recently, weÂ’ve got ourselves a maid. Actually, we had a maid almost a year ago but we send her back in less than a week because my wife accused me of having a thing or two with the maid. I swear by the name of GOD I am innocent. She accused blindly just because I was being too kind hearted that I actually take the maid out to buy stamps for her postage to be send back to Indonesia. I was in disbelieved. Ok, we send the maid back. Then now, after a year or so, weÂ’ve got a new maid. She starts to suspect this and that again. Saying I was too kind to her and all that.<br><br>Almost two days ago, the maid was complaining that her alarm clock donÂ’t work anymore. So my wife took the clock and does some monitoring. The clock is still ticking but it will stop after some time. I was home after a soccer game and she starts to complain to me that the maid has lied. My wife said she put the clock on top of the TV and set the time correctly but after about 45 minutes, the maid pointed to her that the clock failed again. So my wife accuse the maid that she had deliberately place the battery slightly out of the battery compartment. I told my wife to investigate further and without notice she accuse me of not believing in her and trust the maid only.<br><br>ThatÂ’s fine. So I took the clock and went into the bedroom and set the time correctly and monitor it myself. About half and hour later my wife came in and told me, Â“Hey look the clock has stoppedÂ”. I didnÂ’t notice until she told me that. So I told my wife Â“there, shouldnÂ’t have accused the maidÂ”. She got mad. I was wondering what would have benefited the maid by actually telling my wife that the clock has stopped? Is it that if the maid tell my wife that the clock is spoilt she donÂ’t have to use another clock hence need not wake up on time in the morning anymore?<br><br>I was trying to stress my point to her but she just wonÂ’t listen, as usual. She even suspects me of stopping the clock deliberately. I was again, in disbelieve! Then she took the clock and put it on bedside table. She wants to monitor it again. Early in the morning, she told me Â“look! The clock is workingÂ”, which is indeed true. I tried explaining to her that maybe the batteries are not in good working condition anymore. But she refused to accept it. We had a quarrel. And as usual, she starts to hurl words, which really hurt my feelings like Â“I am not worth itÂ”. Then, I got really worked up and asked her if she mean, Â“letÂ’s divorceÂ”? She replied, "yes, why not?".<br><br>From that moment onwards, I knew something is going to happen. And that something is that the Â“DÂ” word will no longer come out from her mouth ever again. And I will initiate the divorce petition to end this, forever.<br><br>However, I do not know if this is the right thing for me to do as I have daughter. Sorry if this thread is too long but I could still go on some more but I guess that wouldnÂ’t be necessary. Thanks for reading and I hope to see some of your views.<br><br>1.	Should I apologize, again?<br>2.	Divorce<br><br>I think I am now ready to choose option 2 as I canÂ’t take it anymore. But I just need to see what your thoughts are before I really make the decision. Thanks.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i have something to contribute here that might be helpful..<br><br>In the past, when i quarrelled w my bf, i always threaten him with"break" cos i know then he will give in to me and i will win, no matter wad...<br><br>Until once, he asked me whether i am taking him for granted and always using break to scare him.. i denied promptly of cos, and even said if u think i am threatening u only then let's break then. it doesnt matter to me....<br><br>After hearing this, he said no i dun wan to break... ok then i decided to be really mean, i told him if he beg me ok den i wun break with him.. to my surprise, he actually kneeled and beg me not to break up...<br><br>from then on, i never ever use the "break" to threaten him anymore.. cos i seen how mean i've been to him and how much he loves me....<br><br>we've now being happily tog for abt 2 yrs and still very happy... more compromising and so we seldom quarrel...<br><br>My advice is, maybe you should prove to ur wife that you are "worth it", cos i used to think my bf is not worthy of me also.. but not now of cos... Prove to ur wife you love her alot, her sacrifices and her marriage to u are all worthy...<br><br>I suggest u ask her if her "D" is serious, not in a tone as in daring her to D you, but in a heart-to-heart manner... talk abt the consequences and what u all really wan... Never raise ur voice in the talk.. if she gets upset, remind her to cool down gently...<br><br>Lastly, i hope u all will stay tog and work things out... as i see u still care alot for the marriage...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Prove to ur wife you love her alot, her sacrifices and her marriage to u are all worthy...<br><br>I suggest u ask her if her "D" is serious, not in a tone as in daring her to D you, but in a heart-to-heart manner... talk abt the consequences and what u all really wan... Never raise ur voice in the talk.. if she gets upset, remind her to cool down gently...<br><br>Lastly, i hope u all will stay tog and work things out... as i see u still care alot for the marriage...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> </div></blockquote>I've talked to her about how easily she pop the D word, as gently as I can be. She didn't give me a direct answer most of the time, instead, she would say "it's all your fault, i don't care, you must say sorry" and "sorry" is the word I use the most whenever we quarreled. Of course I do care a lot for my family, that's why I would always give in to her, just to save the marriage. Yes, I've kneeled down when she pop the D word for the first time, in front of my dad and I was crying my eyes out, in front of my dad. My dad was so upset and angry with me and scolded me for being so useless that I need to go to such extent. What do you think my feeling was at that time? My wife? She's not that forgiving. She'd need sometime to cool down and then forgive me. Unfortunately, the D word kept popping out like popcorns since then. As if she knows if she use the D word, I would give in. I really don't know. Thanks for sharing though.</div>

If that was the case, she wouldn't have marry me in the first place. She married me for who and what I am. We've known each other for more than five years before tying the knots. So she know very well who I am and what I am capable of. Even after we married, I never stop upgrading myself. She even told me that she's glad that I am upgrading myself.<br><br>I really don't know. Must I really be earning more than her, have higher education than her so that she would not use the D word anymore? This is absurd. I've asked her this question before and as usual, no answer. Maybe no answer = yes? I don't know. I would really like to find this out from her.<br><br>Frankly, if any party uses tactics such as threatening to divorce or break up in a marriage or a relationship over trivial matters, then I think it's time give up and move on? Agree? Of course I wouldn't mind at all if she uses the D word if I commit adultery or having an affair with another women or I am an alcoholic or I fool around or anything. But I done no sin, never cheat on her or anything at all. I really don't know. I do know how long I can last. I really don't.</div>

I don't know how long this will go on. As you can see those who've replied so far advised me to seek professional help and 'divorce' is the last option, which I agree. I will seek professional help and see how it goes. I must try whatever means to fix this. I don't want my daugther to suffer. I really do want to make this work. If all else fails, then divorce is the only choice. However, as you've suggested to me to find happiness some where else(if we were to divorce), I doubt I want to go through this again. I will never, ever, want to get involve in any kind of relationship with any women anymore. My focus will purely on my beloved daughter only. She's my precious. No one else comes close. Thanks.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Even if she might get the custody of the child, the judge could also grant you visits to your daughter. You know, absence makes the heart grow fonder. Try visualizing yourself 10 years from now,  do you want your daughter living in a family full of quarrels (she'll turn out to be rebellious, I tell ya) or do you want her to live peacefully with both her parents vying for her affections (Seperately, but she'll be thoroughly spoilt with no proper guidance) ? Let's say you are both divorced and each now having new spouses after a while. Do you not think your daughter will be tramautized? Do you think you'll be spending more time with your daughter or your new girlfriend? Or do you think her mother would spend more time with her boyfriend or her own flesh and blood? What makes you think that her stepdad/stepmum would accept her? If even if so, do you think your daughter would not suffer from the aftermath of the divorce? She'll be scarred for life, I tell you. At least both you and your wife are parents to your daughter and not some outsiders. And I believe your daughter is still young so she might not know what's happening to both of you. Once the mental scar is there, it's very difficult to remove.So either way, you've got to solve asap and please stop playing the victim here. A marriage is for two persons to work it out not one. Remember this phrase? "It takes both hands to clap".<br><br>I understand your wife is feeling very insecure. I have this feeling that your wife is only trying to 'sa jiao' that's why the divorce has yet to be finalised. Maybe you've not been paying much attention to your wife? Another thing is, seeking professional help is also another great idea to revive your marriage. I advice you to see a family therapist or something. They can help you create new powerful anchors and bring both of you back to the first time you fell in love with each other. They will do this continously for each session until these great feelings came flodding back and both you might successfully fall deeply in love again.<br><br>This is only just a small advice from me,take it or leave it<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

The real problem is this;<br><br>She kept using the D word so freely almost everytime when we quarrel over trivial matters. To me, this is not healthy and not a good thing to say or hear. She could simply say it, just like that. I really don't know how to explain to you my feeling when she say that. So, this is the problem. I really want to know why she'd pop the D word so easily. I really do want to know. I guess this is what I want to find out for now.<br><br>I strongly think that she has no other suitor outside. I hope I am right. If she really is seeing someone, I would beg her to tell me, so that we could divorce peacefully and she can go to the man she always wanted. This my thought only. For now, I still think that she is faithful to me, and so am I to her.<br><br>Thanks though.</div>
