She could simply say it, just like that. I really don't know how to explain to you my feeling when she say that. So, this is the problem. I really want to know why she'd pop the D word so easily.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Oyster Omelette:</div><div class="quote_body">Even if she might get the custody of the child, the judge could also grant you visits to your daughter. You know, absence makes the heart grow fonder. Try visualizing yourself 10 years from now,  do you want your daughter living in a family full of quarrels (she'll turn out to be rebellious, I tell ya) or do you want her to live peacefully with both her parents vying for her affections (Seperately, but she'll be thoroughly spoilt with no proper guidance) ? Let's say you are both divorced and each now having new spouses after a while. Do you not think your daughter will be tramautized? Do you think you'll be spending more time with your daughter or your new girlfriend? Or do you think her mother would spend more time with her boyfriend or her own flesh and blood? What makes you think that her stepdad/stepmum would accept her? If even if so, do you think your daughter would not suffer from the aftermath of the divorce? She'll be scarred for life, I tell you. At least both you and your wife are parents to your daughter and not some outsiders. And I believe your daughter is still young so she might not know what's happening to both of you. Once the mental scar is there, it's very difficult to remove.So either way, you've got to solve asap and please stop playing the victim here. A marriage is for two persons to work it out not one. Remember this phrase? "It takes both hands to clap".<br><br>I understand your wife is feeling very insecure. I have this feeling that your wife is only trying to 'sa jiao' that's why the divorce has yet to be finalised. Maybe you've not been paying much attention to your wife? Another thing is, seeking professional help is also another great idea to revive your marriage. I advice you to see a family therapist or something. They can help you create new powerful anchors and bring both of you back to the first time you fell in love with each other. They will do this continously for each session until these great feelings came flodding back and both you might successfully fall deeply in love again.<br><br>This is only just a small advice from me,take it or leave it<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div></blockquote>Are you crazy? Of course I will take it(your advise). They are great. You see, divorce is always the last thing on my mind. I dare tell you, I've never mention the D word, not even once. Why? Because I know it's not right, and it's something trivial that we are quarelling about, not because of either one of us are having an affair elsewhere or we cheated or anything that would be equally serious. Nothing of that sort.<br><br>Thanks. I will seek help from a family counselor.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by troubled_soul:</div><div class="quote_body">I am a male, 31 years of age. IÂ’ve been married for almost 4 years now. I have been quarreling with my wife quite often e.g. at least once in a month average. Some quarrels are quite bad while others are not so bad. All these quarreling have been going on after one year of our marriage.<br><br>I have quite a bad temper and she is stubborn to the core. If I raised my voice a little bit sheÂ’d go berserk and start to mention the Â“DÂ” word. We had some fights before, but I must say that I was being forced to hit her because she would pushed me around and scratch me very hard on my neck, arms, thighs and sheÂ’s also very hurtful with her words. I would dare say that sheÂ’s the one started it first. She even kicked my spine when I ignore her questions! IÂ’d promised her IÂ’d never hit a woman but I guess I broke the promise. I feel really, really bad after that. I need to apologized profusely before she would forgive me, even if she started it all.<br><br>Third year of marriage, even more Â“DÂ” word flying around whenever I did something wrong. I was a smoker when we knew each other. After marriage, I promise her I will quit. But as usual, itÂ’s very hard to quit. IÂ’ve tried many times to quit and thereÂ’s a time I managed to stop smoking for about 3 months. However,  IÂ’ve started to smoke again whenever we quarrel. If you want to know what we are quarreling about, I will tell you. Most of the time, we would quarrel over trivial matters, really. Sometimes we would quarrel because she has her way of doing things while I have my own, IÂ’d give in eventually.<br><br>She earns more than I am. SheÂ’s contributed to the flat more than I am. She had more education than I am. But I am catching up, as I am about to complete my studies. Somehow, I always feel that she would threaten me with the Â“DÂ” word whenever we quarrel, just to make me give in? Or does she really mean it? I would always worry and feel bad whenever she mentions the Â“DÂ” word, hence, I would apologize to her eventually. Sometimes, even both parties are in the wrong, I would still apologize while she would most of the time, not apologize. I really donÂ’t know.<br><br>Recently, weÂ’ve got ourselves a maid. Actually, we had a maid almost a year ago but we send her back in less than a week because my wife accused me of having a thing or two with the maid. I swear by the name of GOD I am innocent. She accused blindly just because I was being too kind hearted that I actually take the maid out to buy stamps for her postage to be send back to Indonesia. I was in disbelieved. Ok, we send the maid back. Then now, after a year or so, weÂ’ve got a new maid. She starts to suspect this and that again. Saying I was too kind to her and all that.<br><br>Almost two days ago, the maid was complaining that her alarm clock donÂ’t work anymore. So my wife took the clock and does some monitoring. The clock is still ticking but it will stop after some time. I was home after a soccer game and she starts to complain to me that the maid has lied. My wife said she put the clock on top of the TV and set the time correctly but after about 45 minutes, the maid pointed to her that the clock failed again. So my wife accuse the maid that she had deliberately place the battery slightly out of the battery compartment. I told my wife to investigate further and without notice she accuse me of not believing in her and trust the maid only.<br><br>ThatÂ’s fine. So I took the clock and went into the bedroom and set the time correctly and monitor it myself. About half and hour later my wife came in and told me, Â“Hey look the clock has stoppedÂ”. I didnÂ’t notice until she told me that. So I told my wife Â“there, shouldnÂ’t have accused the maidÂ”. She got mad. I was wondering what would have benefited the maid by actually telling my wife that the clock has stopped? Is it that if the maid tell my wife that the clock is spoilt she donÂ’t have to use another clock hence need not wake up on time in the morning anymore?<br><br>I was trying to stress my point to her but she just wonÂ’t listen, as usual. She even suspects me of stopping the clock deliberately. I was again, in disbelieve! Then she took the clock and put it on bedside table. She wants to monitor it again. Early in the morning, she told me Â“look! The clock is workingÂ”, which is indeed true. I tried explaining to her that maybe the batteries are not in good working condition anymore. But she refused to accept it. We had a quarrel. And as usual, she starts to hurl words, which really hurt my feelings like Â“I am not worth itÂ”. Then, I got really worked up and asked her if she mean, Â“letÂ’s divorceÂ”? She replied, "yes, why not?".<br><br>From that moment onwards, I knew something is going to happen. And that something is that the Â“DÂ” word will no longer come out from her mouth ever again. And I will initiate the divorce petition to end this, forever.<br><br>However, I do not know if this is the right thing for me to do as I have daughter. Sorry if this thread is too long but I could still go on some more but I guess that wouldnÂ’t be necessary. Thanks for reading and I hope to see some of your views.<br><br>1.	Should I apologize, again?<br>2.	Divorce<br><br>I think I am now ready to choose option 2 as I canÂ’t take it anymore. But I just need to see what your thoughts are before I really make the decision. Thanks.<br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Interesting.<br><br>Your marriage barely stand a year and petty quarrels litter across your love. What is the basis and reason for the marriage then? I am sure such thingy DO happen frequently in your BGR as well? Or is it because of the 'marriage-can-change-everything-phenomenon'?<br><br>Could you visualise how weak the foundation of your love? How easily the word 'Divorce' could be used, even in petty arguments?<br><br>Immaturity? What do you think?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The cusps of your marriage-problem lies with continuous attempt to resolve problems through surface-dissolving of issue and not actually taking on the roots of it (zhi biao bu zhi ben).<br><br>You <strong>THOUGHT </strong>it was compromising; it's actually a alternative version of avoidance. There are virtually zero communication - communication to sort martial issue out, speak like matured couple and resolve them mutually. Too much 'You' and finger pointing is around - like what we do to our annoying siblings. By now, you ought to realise marriage don't survive on that kinda thing for long before it hit the iceberg and start sinking.<br><br>Why do I say it's an alternative version of avoidance? You GAVE in because psychologically and emotionally, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>you wanted to avoid further trouble</strong></span>. It eliminate the need for you to communicate... about the damage of your love and thus with weak communication, this marriage produce very fragile marital bonds that is easily shaken and undaunted by the subject of divorce.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Individual ego has to be dissolved for mutual love to thrive</strong>. </span><br><br>Have you ever realise WHY your wife is so paranoid/possessive/insecured? Even way before you both were offically married? Her personality on WHY she is like that? Touch on them and mould them into positive channels?<br><br>'Aiya... she is like that one lar...'<br><br>These are issues to be worked out and a divorce could give you nothing ultimately. If external factors are involved (say a third-party), depending on case by case, probably divorce is the final resort. But if it is about personality - my question is, then knowing that she is LIKE that and YOU are like that during BGR stage, why get married in the first place? (A repeat of my paragraph two)<br><br>Since you both are married - then do what a married couple would do in face of a crisis. Work them out and smooth the rough edges. IMO Personality indifferences are the worst reason to end a marriage. Cause in the first place, what's a BGR for then? One way street?<br><br>P.S: And of course I know why it still happens. Since you need that mental stimuli to review your marriage. I am giving pieces of thoughts to digest. Don't call it game over if you didn't do what is possible to work things out. Always attempt alternatives.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dont divorce.  there are bound to be problems and quarrels in a marriage.  why did you get married in the 1st place?  go talk to your wife nicely.  you have to try!! marriage only fails when both parties give up.  tell each other your expectations and problems.  there must be a reason for her sudden change in behaviour.  remind her of the good loving days.  you have already come this far.  if push comes to shove, go for marriage counselling.  you have to be patient.<br><br></div>

Yes, she has agreed for us to go for marriage counselling, which I am glad.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>im a 16 year old kid and my family have problems as well, my situation is very much like yours. my dad is hot tempered, and my mother is stubborn as well. my dad suggested for both of them to visit a psychologist but it did not happen in the end. the only thing holding them together is me, my lovely sister and brother. however, things are changing for them, my father has been giving into my mother over trivial matters. this saves a quarrel, which is very much advisable. at this point of time, my mother would then realise that she was wrong, and although stubborn, she knows that my father has been right all the time. therefore, they now communicate more easily. there are still some minor disagreements but they clear up quickly now. my father will only step in when my mother gets too bent on having her way which my father feels is wrong. most of the time, he is right.<br><br>this might sound abit confusing but my main point is, although it lowers your pride by having to keep on giving in to your wife, it saves the situation sometimes. by stating your point and then allowing your wife to have it her way, you leave her room for thinking about your point. instead of going head on with her. once she finds out that she is wrong, she will tend to find out the reasons why, and you being right, will definitely cross her mind. hopefully, this will open her up to having more faith in you.<br><br>I believe faith is most important in a relationship. Divorce is said to be the last resort, i believe it should never even be thought of, divorce is just like suicide, by divorcing, you are actually killing the love, faith, and trust that you both had. yes, these times are dreading and stressful.  once they are over, you will be able to reap your benefits.. your fruits of labour.<br><br>i do not think you would want to deprive your child of having a happy family right? every child has a right to be with their parents and live a happy life with their family. I am not trying to be biased here, but most of the time in situations like this, men are tend to be more cool in thinking than to just jump to conclusions. i say this because my parents are living proof, posting in this forum has already shown your determination in trying to solve the problem. I respect you for not making hasty decisions, and trying to make sure that every step you take is the best solution. I wish you an everlasting and happy marriage. Hopefully this aids in solving your problem.. like it has done for my family.</div>
