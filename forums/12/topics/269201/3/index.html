Your work is probably drudgery and toilsome - with all that deadlines, distraction, noise, unhappiness, anger, frustrations and all sort of unpleasant moods and situation shrouding you like some malicious spirit, attempting to break your spirit.<br><br>Does he knows about your frustrations at work?

Yes, it's true, these are people's problem, but I am somewhat implicated because these are my love ones too. Sigh. Perhaps, next time, I should just keep everything to myself.'</span><br><br>And of course, you are only but a human - you can only take so much stress before you collapse emotionally.<br><br>These realities are realities of a love relationship in an urban city; stress comes in several form of dimensions and they will seek for the 'line of least resistance' - hoping to crash at the spot where your vulnerability lies and crumble your love through external means.<br><br>But does that mean that this is a sure fail? Not necessary.<br><br>Since you two are unable to control individual constrains in life, communicate and decide the best way you could compromise and work out something that you could keep the life of your relationship flowing. (If you two share the same religion together, both of you could seek for solace in your faith through prayers. Or speak with your religious leaders if possible).<br><br>You see, what happens is that both of you are facing challenges in life; it's just that each of you were hoping that your other half could provide you the avenue to alleviate this frustration from your state of life and the condition it brings. Therefore, how would it be possible for anyone of you to afford the emotional luxury to tender those sensitive needs when in your perception, both your visions have been blotted out by all these immerse problems, acting as a barrier to enjoy your relationship?<br><br>Sometimes when we are so overwhelmed by all these distractions in life - we tend to lose focus and forget that the basis laws to happiness in love is not about the tangibles - it's about being in our real self and communicating likewise in this form. The next time when he starts this again, cuts him off with a momentary kiss. Or put a finger to his lips and embrace him.<br><br>There are always no definite answers to problems and frustrations in life; but surely, there's strength in support.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

And because he is your boyfriend instead of providing a strong support for you, you became his pillar of support; you are tired of listening to his whining.<br><br>You came here for advice because you thought you still loved him and you are confused. But actually you are slowly losing patience with him. You thought as a girlfriend you should be a pillar of support because of your beliefs as a girlfriend in a relationship.<br><br>After all, a man should be strong enough to take care of you.<br><br>He's not the man you used to know. He has become your mommy's boy.<br><br>You are tired. Try to change subject everytime he tries to whine. Talk something fun. Do something fun like sing a song together.
