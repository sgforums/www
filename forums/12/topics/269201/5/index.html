            <div class='col-md body'>So, TS, what do you hope to achieve by telling us your problem with your bf? Do you hope that your bf will change for you? From what I see - unlikely.  He is what he is. That is his character.<br><br>Since he is such an irritant to you by complaining or sharing his problems , which wasn't his, to you, why not dump him. That would then solve all your problem. You can find someone who don't burden you with his problems since you dislike so much of listening to them.</div>
