            <div class='col-md body'>You may not like to hear this, but speaking from real life experience, don't marry a guy like that.<br><br>My father has a character like your bf, he likes to bother about other people's problem. And damn he comes home once or twice everyweek drunk and repeat repeat and repeat other people's problem and problems not relevant or stuff in the past over and over and over and over again. And when things get out of hands, he'll start making trouble, break glass, attempt to commit suicide... my mother got so sick of it that she can't be bothered when he wants to commit suicide, then he'll start complaining to my mother, "You just don't care do you? I want to go and die, you also don't care!"<br><br>And same like yout bf, he is damn generous, even though we are quite poor, we used to be quite okay, but he gambled, so to settle his debts we even sold our van and house. Now things are starting to get stable and back on track. But he is still damn generous, no money still want to treat other people, something still go steal my sister's money. And yes, he does not work, he used to earn $300 a day, but after he married my mother he quit his job and lived on my mother.<br><br>But one thing for sure, he dotes on me a lot whether he is drunk or not. Recently, his character is getting better, when I was younger, very young, he used to make me knee on the floor, beat me with a belt... then went downstairs to mingle with his friends... while telling me to knee all the time. But when he's not drunk, he'll buy me whatever I want, give me whatever I want.<br><br>Ya, just my 2 cents, hope u dun mind.</div>
