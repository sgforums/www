Your work is probably drudgery and toilsome - with all that deadlines, distraction, noise, unhappiness, anger, frustrations and all sort of unpleasant moods and situation shrouding you like some malicious spirit, attempting to break your spirit.<br><br>Does he knows about your frustrations at work? Or do you choose to avoid sharing as you prefer to keep your time together as musically sweet as possible?<br><br>From his POV he's likely to think along this line:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">'I want to share with my girlfriend some issues in life, but she seemed to be irritated with the notion of me sharing with her. Yes, it's true, these are people's problem, but I am somewhat implicated because these are my love ones too. Sigh. Perhaps, next time, I should just keep everything to myself.'</span><br><br>And of course, you are only but a human - you can only take so much stress before you collapse emotionally.<br><br>These realities are realities of a love relationship in an urban city; stress comes in several form of dimensions and they will seek for the 'line of least resistance' - hoping to crash at the spot where your vulnerability lies and crumble your love through external means.<br><br>But does that mean that this is a sure fail? Not necessary.<br><br>Since you two are unable to control individual constrains in life, communicate and decide the best way you could compromise and work out something that you could keep the life of your relationship flowing. (If you two share the same religion together, both of you could seek for solace in your faith through prayers. Or speak with your religious leaders if possible).<br><br>You see, what happens is that both of you are facing challenges in life; it's just that each of you were hoping that your other half could provide you the avenue to alleviate this frustration from your state of life and the condition it brings. Therefore, how would it be possible for anyone of you to afford the emotional luxury to tender those sensitive needs when in your perception, both your visions have been blotted out by all these immerse problems, acting as a barrier to enjoy your relationship?<br><br>Sometimes when we are so overwhelmed by all these distractions in life - we tend to lose focus and forget that the basis laws to happiness in love is not about the tangibles - it's about being in our real self and communicating likewise in this form. The next time when he starts this again, cuts him off with a momentary kiss. Or put a finger to his lips and embrace him.<br><br>There are always no definite answers to problems and frustrations in life; but surely, there's strength in support.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers  </div></blockquote>Yes, he knows about my stress and frustration at work and of cos the long hours too.  but i rarely 'whine' about them, ie i rarely repeat my stories or my problems. i told him cos i think there is a need to communicate, to let him understand me as a whole, but i try not to let it affect our relationship, by not whining about them.<br><br>it came as a wonder, that he seems to be like so unaware of that, and kind of surprised him when i told him off that night.  he keep repeatly asking me, 'is work your problem'.  and i keep repeating yes. then he asked, 'is work your only problem', and i keep repeating yes.<br><br>or maybe is it me? that i rarely complain and whine, hence he underestimated the amount of stress i am facing?  but i really do not believe in persistent complaining and whining, for it kills most relationship.<br><br>btw, he is a capricorn</div>

But actually you are slowly losing patience with him. You thought as a girlfriend you should be a pillar of support because of your beliefs as a girlfriend in a relationship.<br><br>After all, a man should be strong enough to take care of you.<br><br>He's not the man you used to know. He has become your mommy's boy.<br><br>You are tired. Try to change subject everytime he tries to whine.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by galfriend:</div><div class="quote_body">since when did i whine to my bf? you are too presumptious.</div></blockquote>sry for the misunderstanding.i wasnt refering to you but the replies of others who say that it is ok for bf to whine to gf.<br><br>i read before men are from mars,women from venus those kinda books before and ur bf's behaviour isnt really typical of a man aint it. Anyway not to put him down but i tink it is more of a "self" problem on his part. Perhaps he's really concerned abt others,always trying to find solutions for them and by sharing wif u all these, he may feel its like sharing his "achievements" with you.<br><br>does he have low-self esteem or suffer from inferiority complex so he's doing all these to make up for his insufficiency?</div>
