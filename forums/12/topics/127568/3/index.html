Look for someone else! And you won't continue to imagine how things might work out with him instead.<br><br>It's funny how many ppl always think there's only one for me etc etc but the real truth is there's alot more than one person for ourselves. It's all a matter of how you try to make things work. Sure, sometimes we get tempted even in a relationship. But we must remember that the world does not revolve around ourselves.<br><br>Beware your karma.</div>

I haven't heard from him since 1994 or so.He told me he was married which i already knew. Turned out to be a kind, intelligent, hardworking man. I hope he is doing well. It was good to know that he has found himself a nice relationship and a decent job. I don't think any good could come from my barging into his life again.He was a perfect gentleman, and a good friend to me.<br><br>After all these years i still feel so nostalgic about the whole affair.I cant seem to forget him.I tried to throw away all the things that keep reminding me of him. But have no heart to do so. If i did it, i would feel i lost something valuable.  Sometimes i do feel that he keeps thinking about me as i heard that he was not really into his current marriage.Why is this crush lasting so long for me?<br><br></div></blockquote>sorry no offence but a broken r/s even when mended will nv be the same. Ever wonder why his parents disapprove? Even today, would they change their mind? Is he a goody goody mummy boy who at his mum mercy? Some things even over years nv change. The most important thing is do u really love him or is it u cant get over for losing him for such a lame reason back than then u keep hoping a miracle and self indulging in beliving u still miss him?<br>Memories forms the greatest part of a person's life. Good memories are often hard to forget... Sometimes, it probably upset u even more when u realise life w/o him seems no longer the same and prob u will indulge even further into this crush thing. I once posted a thread.. that is some sort like urs today... it was like a almst 6 years painful journey... I realise I allowed myself to live in the past, tts y i m feeling pain from the result of past. Try breaking away from it, know more people... perhaps than u realised ur crush isnt really a crush animore. don turn it into self obession, to someday wake up realising thr wasnt actuali the main reason u aint able to throw away his things.</div>
