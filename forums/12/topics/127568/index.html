            <div class='col-md body'>I can understand how you feel right now. I have been through that too. I still kept the memories of my first love which is more than 10 years. She's not married to date. And I was on the verge of going back to her few years back but I did not. I understand that it will not be the same anymore. You cannot just rekindle the same kind of feelings that you used to have.<br><br>You have a worse situation than mine. Do you want to be the third party? Are you sure he is really the ONE, or are you rejecting choices because you are holding on to the old memories? Your present state is not about wanting to be with him, the important thing is you must learn how to let go. I know it's gonna be hard but you still have to go through it. You'll be grateful when everything is over because it makes you a better person, stronger internally. Memories are for savoring, don't let it eat you up. I know it because I kept it in a small corner of my heart. My heart is not big but it's enough for all the good memories.<br><br>Hope you able to pull through this one. Whatever your decision is, walk through it with no regrets. You are suppose to understand why you make that decision, not regret it.<br><br>All the best. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

And he could have been a good catch... Your judgement was quite a good one...?<br><br>However, in reality life defines otherwise... And should you have been living with him.. He might not appear to be such a 'perfect' guy afterall... Pick yourself up and move on...? It's sweet to see this guy again, moreover he still being someone you're interested in....

            <div class='col-md body'>Handling sweet memories from the past can be torturous. I myself go through it everyday. I see the girl which i had sweet and cherished memories with, flirting with other guys, being so cheerful without me in her life. Shes in my class, my classmate, seeing her everyday tends to make me regret my decisions to come clean with her. But, although i really wanted to return back to the past.. But i realise one thing.. No matter how hard you try, your past will never return, by trying to ask that guy friend of yours to betray his wife, even though you two may be very happy together, but will you ever understand the agony of what that wife will be going through? Marriages are sacred.. Understandably, guys, with their raging hormones, would most probably end up in a shotgun marriage, but still, how no matter how much the guy doesn't like the lady anymore, she has permanently become his responsibility. Are you an irresponsible person? If that guy really goes to you and divorce with his wife? Ask yourself, would you trust a guy that is willing to sacrifice a happy marriage just to be with you? If he could sacrifice happiness, why wouldn't he do the same to you? Everything exists for a reason. If Fate declares you both together, you both would end up together. Stay friends manz.. If you really can't control your feelings, go clean of him, find a better guy. Hes not the only star in the sky..

You're no longer 19. Let go. Even if the marriage isn't going well (is this from him?), he may not be planning on getting a divorce but just game for a little thingy on the side. Guys in these situations are really good at getting 'victims' like you - still living in fairytale world, reminescing about what could have been, finding reasons to explain away the little bits of contact you have with him. It will be a SELFISH act on your part, you've said it yourself.<br><br>If you're thinking happily ever after now, knowing he's married, perhaps you might want to think again. First, assuming he doesn't dawdle about for another 1-2 years before deciding he wants to go ahead with the divorce, there could be another 3 years of hell, if his wife doesn't divorce him based on adultery. During the separation, she can choose to live under the same roof as him, if he doesn't move out. Can you put up with that? Knowing that there's a possibility they could reconcile during the 3 years you're hanging about waiting for the decree nisi? Remember, you have all the facts in your hands now to decide NOT to go further into this mess ... he's MARRIED. No two ways about it. Who cares how badly the marriage is going.<br><br>If you've been pining for him for so long, if he tells you he's planning on divorcing his wife, what's the additional few years wait for you so you can both start life together IF he's really intending to start his life afresh?</div>

Bear in mind, he's chosen of his own free will, to marry this girl for monetary reasons. The selfish decision was made at his wife's expense because he wanted something for himself and his siblings.<br><br>Anyway it does appear you seem to have decided, if he wants, to get involved with him coz you're trying to explain away the comments made by other forumites here.<br><br>A final little bit of advice I hope you'll take into consideration ...
