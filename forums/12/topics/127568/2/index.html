            <div class='col-md body'>Oh please, Galtwenty.  Don't hope to bump into him.<br><br>I don't know if you are in love with him or you are in love with the memories.  Like you said, it was so sweet then.  That was then.  And now is now.  The fact that he is married should give you closure to any hope of a relationship with him.  Someone once said "we do not marry the person but we marry the illusion (impression) of the person".  Like when you meet a person, you think he is such and such a person but of course later when you eventually live together, you will definitely find out that it is not the case.<br><br>The same for men to women.  I have had many family male friends telling me that when they first met their wives, they all appear timid and nice.  Then after a few years of marriage, the cats have become tigress.<br><br>Your friend tells you he is unhappy with his marriage.  Well, of course.  This is life.  I have been with my husband for 25 years.   Were they all beautiful 25 years?  Of course not.  There's bound to be ups and downs.  It is for both of us to want it so much to make it work.  So, if your friend value his marriage or family (if he has children), then he should put in effort to make it work.  Getting married to jumpstart a career or support his siblings do sound like a lame excuse to get married though.  I mean you said he is unselfish but seriously, you really think so?  There are other means to have a career.  It may take a bit of hard work and a longer walk so taking a short cut is the easier way out?  So, what does it tells you of a person?  Sorry, I am not being judgemental (I have no rights, anyways) but simply asking bare facts as you have stated.<br><br>Anyways, for his wife's sake and his family's, I hope you will let go and let it be but a beautiful memory for you and move on.  We are all women (or humans for that matter) so please don't start a stir.  I like some of the post herein and very good points too (Moderator and someone else).  You may wish to re-read to reinforce what is morally right.<br><br>All the very best to you, Galtwenty.</div>

They are, after all, a part of our life history and what can erase that?  Is it shallow modes of reasoning to believe that because one reminisce about the past, it means one is unhappy with the present?<br><br>Besides, can we really be happy everyday?  Errr....what's that phrase?  Ups and downs?  Peaks and valleys?  Even if we want to, life throw a variety of cards on our plates everyday.  Some find it challenging and some find it interesting.  I find it as a learning process.  Everyday, I am learning to be a good person by learning how to deal with different situations and people that cross my path.  Of course I am no angel.  I have my flaws and I admit it to myself and be willing to work harder to correct it.  I believe admission of one's fault is the first step to remedification.  Yes?<br><br>It is alright if you can't see past your current obssessions because I believe one day you will.  We grow up everyday, don't we?  Sometimes, it is costly, sometimes it is not.  My intent is not to hurt but as a third party view looking through the window.<br><br>Nevertheless, I wish you all the best, Galtwenty.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Galtwenty,<br><br>After reading your posts, it seems to me that you still want to cling on to your past, and hope for a miracle to happen.<br><br>You know that HE is your "forbidden fruit". But, the more you can't get it, the more you wanted it. Just like some people said that they dun marry their true love, they only marry the second best. Why? Because they are not able to be together with their "true love" that's why, they thought that the one they married is not their true love. Ironic.<br><br>All his actions, seems to indicate that he still has feeling for you. But, this is wat you THINK! You are making too many assumptions here. Sometimes, wat we think are not the truth. The only way to get the truth is to ask him.<br><br>Don't think. You THINK too much.<br><br>Shouldn't you be glad that you have memories, and sweet memories of the times that you have spent together? Haven't you think even further, that if your parents never stop you in the past, wat will become of you? Will you guys be happily married? or Separated unhappily?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by GaLtwenty:</div><div class="quote_body">how were u able to leave happily when u are still thinking of someone else?</div></blockquote>It was difficult....  see one every day and thinking of the other...  But when you are with your wife, you asked yourself... is she thinking of someone else like me?  Is she is, well it is ok for me to think of other.. but if she is not, then it most unfair for her to get a half bake husband. So I asked do I love my wife which is of course yes, that why I marry her instead.  But how about the other one, well since I already married, I must decide to have a clean break and that what I did.. FOr me is simple.. I look at my wife and I say she is my love one, I should be and I am happy. I still love her so much and because of the guilt I carried for thinking of someone earlier, I have to be patient and love my wife more. Who asked me to wrong her first.  You know like making up for it. When you think about it, hey this is not a bad thing to hold and keep a family.  Because I was at fault so I have to always be the first to say " I am sorry " in any situation.  To forgot the other girl, I alway look forward to meet my wife and remind me that I got a wonderful wife..When you do that you find the love for the other girl just vanished into thin air. We are married for 21 years already and I sincerely hope it can last another 21....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
