I am grateful for these lessons, but also, I wish I am someone who is more forgetful, someone who can just let go of the past without hanging on to it and re-living the memories everyday in the present so that I would not forget all those precious scenes.<br><br>The past is precious to me, and yet it is also almost too painful for me to bear. That is the irony, I want to lose them so that I would not remember a single thing, yet at the same time, I am afraid I will forget them, that there will be nothing to remind me of the happy times I have had in the past, so I am trying to hang on to them by replaying the scenes again and again in my mind.</div>

Some choose to try to forget their past, while others choose to try to deal with it. Personally I choose the latter. I try to deal with my past, no matter how painful it may be.<br><br>I think I was also inadvertently pricking upon others when I said that true courage comes not from denying the past, but from facing up to your past. I guess I was unconsciously insinuating that people who can't deal with the past are not courageous.... which is not the case.<br><br>I guess courage also comes from being able to stop living in your past and learning to embrace the future. If the ability to forget the past allows you to do that, then I suppose it isn't all that bad.<br><br>My apologies.</div>
