We are the sole decider to decide if we want to be happy or not? Even if the whole world are to treat you like a god/goddess, but if you choose to remain unhappy what can they do? On the other hand even if the everything is not going smoothly for you, you can still remain a happy person so basically it about are we willing to let go and move on or remain on the spot and linger about the past.<br><br>People can give us any advise or consolation, ultimately, the decision is up to ourselve and not other.<br><br>Also painful memory is something that gave us the experience and ability to handle the problem when it happen again in the future to us or to other.<br><br>A life of plain sailing is not a life that is enjoyable because it a incomplete life where we won't get to taste the sour, sweet, bitter and hot in life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
