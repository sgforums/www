            <div class='col-md body'>I think your bf is really good to actually ask you along... The fact that he even tells you he is meeting his ex is good enuff testament to his love for u. We guys know that gals can get jealous over such things. However, he has believed that you will understand him enuff to not doubt him.<br><br>4 yrs of relationship is not something simple. If u do not trust him, why bother of thinking abt marriage in the first place? I'm sure u are still pretty heated up about ur bf asking u to go home to spend time with his ex. I'm sure any other gal will (and I hope he understands that), and I think he knows u will definitely be angry. But he feels the need to help a friend, be it a guy or a gal. Friends are still friends. I think ur bf is really very good, though he really angered u this time.<br><br>Just trust him. From what I see so far, I think he is a good guy. I wish you luck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I sense great insecurity on your part. You better do consider properly before marrying. Marrying will not help you cure insecurity. You have to find the root cause of the problem, i.e. the lack of trust on your part etc before commiting to him. Otherwise it will do both of you no good.</div>

I reckon your bf is a vvv nice guy who dun like to see his friends getting hurt or what... that's why he ask u to go home first when e 3 of u meet.... n by proposing to you... he is telling you how much u mean to him, how much he wants you (and not her) to be part of his life.... Do give him the trust... n by accepting the proposal, you're doing yourself a great help<br><br>I understand how u feel, jealousy, afraid of losing him... I can see that your bf's ex is trying to get him back too... It will be good to actually tell your bf how you feel abt it... do let him continue to see the ex (though not too frequently, n best if you can go with him, let e ex accept you as HIS gf) n always remind him not to be tempted to give in to her....(in case she tempts your bf).</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i feel sorry for you in a way... alot of people in the forum seems to be saying that you are wrong somehow.<br><br>i would have done the same if this happened to me.... it is so humiliating to be asked to be leave first. it means, even if it is only that moment, she is the most important.<br><br>every woman wants to be the most important woman in her man's life... at all times. especially when he is the most important man in her life..  justifable isnt it???<br><br>your reaction to the situation was wrong.... even though it is normal to feel jealous.<br><br>men - cannot control. because they dont like to be controlled. men - also cannot let them go to freely.. because we dont know what they will end up doing... or what other women may do to get them.<br><br>in the situation you had, you should have been supportive of his trip to see her. go with him, console her if you can or at least show concern. show that you are on his side and you are with him, as a couple.that is why people are called PARTNERS in relationships.<br><br>by chasing him away now, you are pushing him into her arms... which might happen, since he needs a listening ear or consolation and she is available...<br><br>GET HIM BACK NOW ! DONT GIVE HIM AWAY TO HER !!!<br><br>try telling him that you feel humiliated when he chased you away, especially when you wanted to help her WITH HIM. blame him for not showing you more consideration and make him feel guilty about it...<br><br>then when he apologize, forgive him and ask him not to do it again. let him be grateful and know that you are magnamious.<br><br>next, if he wants to help her, show concern by talking about her and what he intends to do about it. that way, you can win his affection and monitor the situation.<br><br>as a woman, you must have the upper hand. that means you should try not to show your temper or jealousy outwardly but stay on the outside and watch things.<br><br>kind of like playing poker.<br><br>be smart... now !<br><br></div>
