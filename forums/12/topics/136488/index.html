Not that he wants to betray you, but he may have some valid reasons of his own to do so.You must respect his perspectives/views on things and along with respect, trust him to handle things properly for you and him.<br><br>Both of you are still single and hence, there's really no obligation towards you in how he wants to direct his life.<br><br>In addition, the more you try to control the way things go, the more control you're giving away. Not talking Zen here, but read the AA forum for a while in your spare time to learn some precious lessons on loving and letting go. Doubt him, do not. Your role is to love and trust, never to doubt? Agree?<br><br>Be calm, gal. There is a reason why she IS his ex and you ARE his choice now.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

But if you go to the extent of ordering / threatening / confronting him in adhering to your wish, you are no longer loving him more than you love yourself.<br><br>If it does his conscience better in meeting her, trust him and let him do so as he wishes. You do love him more than yourself do you?<br><br>Fear casts out love, gal.</div>

However, I must also remind you that your bf will be so greatly proud of your confidence in him esp. after you've displayed your insecurities.<br><br>He will also marvel at how you do and can manage your thoughts and emotions logically to trust him. Though, trusting him seems like something that go against your mind and will, yet it shows him that you're giving him full control at the driver's seat not because you're forced to or you have to, but you want to as you want him to be happy and comfortable with you. I am sure that girl would be so impressed by how self-contained you are.<br><br>Anyway, do so if your heart tells you to. If you do feel better by going with him, go too. Yet remember, you're not her. You are standing beside him, with him and he is with you. Know this fully in your heart and soul, and your mind will be calmed when you allow your love for him to take over.<br><br>Once you do love someone more than yourself, you'll never do anything that puts him to shame or discomfort.<br><br>Sleep tight, gal.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think at this moment the most essential thing is for you not to jump to conclusions.<br><br>Y? In situations as such, most relationships hit the rocks precisely because one jumps to conclusions, one then overeacts and in the process pisses his or her partner off. Of course avoiding this isn't easy, because it involves emotions which is difficult to control. HOWEVER, for a relationship to pull through an obsticle like this, keeping a cool mind is essential. In the esscense, playing it smart.<br><br>I think you should let your boyfriend know how u feel and tell him sternly that while U r firmly behind everything he does, there is a limit to it. IT STOPS THERE! dun go on harpping over it after that cause u'll just make him all disillusioned and the biatch will claim him with arms wide open.<br><br>Pls. Do not make the same mistake I made. I got paranoid and started smsin my gal (she used to be mine) 24'7 abt that guy. She got sick and tired of it all and she just left!</div>

Obviously, he's shown you enough respect to tell you about it.  He could easily have gone to see her secretly like you had 'suspected' he would.  But he didn't and even asked you along to make sure you know what's going happen.  You don't own him even if you are in a relationship.  Here's a guy who's trying to keep thing transparent with you but you've choosen to ignore that.  And believe in your own pre-concieved notions instead seeing what is actually going on, right in front of you.<br><br>The guy asked you to go home because he sees the tension between you and the ex.  Would you rather have stayed and potentially gotten into a situation where you would have definately regretted later?  Think about that.  You're the one who's in the wrong here but he's getting the brunt of anger.<br><br>BTW, guys don't get soft-hearted, they just get horny.</div>
