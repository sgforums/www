            <div class='col-md body'>U need to make the time to exercise if you wanna lose any weight. How about changing your schedule, taking a run before taking lunch ? If your really hungry maybe u can take a snack on the way home, something healthy like a fruit or pao perhaps half and hour before your run . Running speeds up your metabolism so your body will consume more energy in the few hours after so you'll continue losing fat.<br><br>Try to make your run at least 20 minutes long because thats the minimum time the body takes to dig into its fat stores, otherwise youll just be using up all the available muscle glycogen.Frequancy also helps , running twice a day will help you to lose that weight fast.<br><br>A good supplement will be to get a dumbell to use at home. Ask a friend who is knowledgeble about this matters to teach u the proper technique.</div>
