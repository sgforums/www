Wanna sms, let him waste that cash. Wanna call, would never pick up. Wanna ICQ, will never reply back. The list goes on. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The greatest turn off and insult to someone is pure ignore - trust me.<br><br>Cheers</div>
