If he doesn't want you, nothing can make him stay.<br><br>2. Stop making excuses for a man and his behavior.<br><br>3. Allow your intuition (or spirit) to save you from heartache.<br><br>4. Stop trying to change yourself for a relationship that's not meant to be. Slower is better.<br><br>5. Never live your life for a man before you find what makes you truly happy.<br><br>6. If a relationship ends because the man was not treating you as you deserve then heck no, you can't "be friends". A friend wouldn't mistreat a friend.<br><br>7. Don't settle. If you feel like he is stringing you along, then he probably is.<br><br>8. Don't stay because you think "it will get better." You'll be mad at yourself a year later for staying when things are not better.<br><br>9. The only person you can control in a relationship is you.<br><br>10. Avoid men who've got a bunch of children by a bunch of different women. He didn't marry them when he got them pregnant, why would he treat you any differently?<br><br>11. Always have your own set of friends separate from his.<br><br>12. Maintain boundaries in how a guy treats you. If something bothers you, speak up.<br><br><span style="color: red;">13. Never let a man know everything. He will use it against you later.</span><br><br>14. You cannot change a man's behavior. Change comes from within.<br><br>15. Don't EVER make him feel he is more important than you are... even if he has more education or in a better job. Do not make him into a quasi-god. He is a man, nothing more nothing less.<br><br>16. Never let a man define who you are.<br><br><span style="color: orange;">17. Never borrow someone else's man.</span><br><br>18. If he cheated with you, he'll cheat on you.<br><br>19. A man will only treat you the way you ALLOW him to treat you.<br><br>20. All men are NOT dogs.<br><br>21. You should not be the one doing all the b ending ...compromise is a two way street.<br><br>22. You need time to heal between relationships...there is nothing cute about baggage... deal with your issues before pursuing a new relationship.<br><br>23. You should never look for someone to COMPLETE you...a relationship consists of two WHOLE individuals...look for someone complimentary...not supplementary.<br><br>24. Dating is fun...even if he doesn't turn out to be Mr. Right.<br><br>25. Make him miss you sometimes...when a man always know where you are, and you're always readily available to him - he takes it for granted.<br><br>26. Never move into his mother's house.<br><br>27. Never co-sign for a man.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">28. Don't fully commit to a man who doesn't give you everything that you need. Keep him in your radar but get to know others.</span></div></blockquote>those which i highlighted.. it somehow gives me the feeling that you have some unpleasant memories of the past which made you came up with this 28 tips<br><br>the 3 which i highlighted, i personally think and feel. if there's no trust, have to put a leash on the guy , no point, keeping with in radar is the same as in treating a person as a pet (regardless of gender)<br><br> you have yet to see or come to know of some guys which are happy to let their gfs know more ppl regardless of gender, as long as each other happy can liao, just not seeing or borrowing another person's man/ lady, is something like well...sometimes maybe only that party understands. like best pals once before so ya..<br><br> not all guys are like that, some gals also do that, but only when driven to the wall. I only can say maybe half the guys tell or threaten ladies la, so it's up the ladies' six sense to sense if you trust the right person or not.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Think I've already seen these tips in sgforums before and I commented it then also. Or maybe I'm wrong, might have been a different forum. In any case, this thing is pretty extreme in nature and advocates male bashing as if all men were bad.<br><br>Like someone has said, it advocates the notion to distrust all guys and quite honestly, if a relationship is going to be based on the above rules, I seriously doubt the relationship would work out.<br><br>The thing about all this extreme feminism, they think they're doing good by being so anti-men, but really they're more trouble than anything.</div>
