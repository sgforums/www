The salary is peanuts compared to people (in the same job as me) in other companies. Job satisfaction is something I haven't felt a long time ever since two years ago.<br><br>Looking back, if I was in the job that I wanted to do six years ago, I would probably have undergone pay cuts, retrenchments scares, unearthly hour wake-up calls to attend to customer requests, etc, during the years the economy wasn't doing that well.<br><br>Why compare with your friends, the more you compared, the more inferior you will feel. Since you are in your mid-twenties, you had plenty of time to achieve  what you want in your career. Just list down the goals, determine which are long-term ones, which are short-term ones and make the effort to go for it.<br><br></div>

And as for the question have I achieved what I want in my career, definitely not, I'm an under achiever. But tell you what, be positive and don't be so hard on yourself. I know of very smart people and they can't take achieving less than what they should and they commit suicide, how smart is that to place an unnecessary burden on yourself that eventually lead to illness and in their case, death?</div>

Then, I chanced upon Robert Kiyosaki's works and realised that owning a business is the best way to become rich, and allow me flexible time to do things I've always wanted to do.<br><br>Thankfully, I have a mentor who owned a multi-million dollar business before and he has selflessly shared his experiences in the business world with me.  Now, I am a proud shareholder of a company, helping 2 friends with 1 new business, and starting another business through which I am confident will bring me a fortune and leverage and allow me to live a life different from my peers.<br><br>I have never been officially employed, and I do not think I will be looking forward to be employed, now that I have seen what's on the other side of the fence...</div>

In life it's often not that tight a $ issue I'm after... No doubt the more the merrier  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> , but I just need to find myself within a comfortable spending power...

I must say my current life is quite a 'happy' one, though not quite moving along any particular direction yet....<br><br>And... Mmm...
