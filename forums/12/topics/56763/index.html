Yes, you do not fear to talk to her, rather its kind of reserve psychology of gathering attention that in the end, puts you in a bad position.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Though its not impossible, its rather difficult to change impression overnight unless continuous reinforcing of opposite-meaning message is send to the other party over a period of time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In simple: If she has bad impression of you, whatever you do, it will deemed as bad impression even though it may seriously meant nothing to you. Its not about her not knowing your sweet, sensitive, good side - rather she do not want to give you the chance to. Only if she allow herself to expose to your good, sweet, sensitive side continuous and she must feel that you ain't what you SEEMED to be at first, then probably you might have a chance. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Forget about stalking - its exactly the same effect you will be giving her like you acting an identity to chat with her. If there is a top ten worst ways to chase girls - stalking rank the top few position.<br><br>P.S: Key word: Don't try too hard. Many times, its a real turn off. Be yourself around her and try to capture the opportunity around her and behave naturally. With little skill and lots of luck, she may give your impression a second check?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Btw: From what dance school ar? Se-ka-li I know her. Hiak hiak <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Cheers</div>
