T-T how can someone so perfect exist? i am average-looking, frizzy hair, no life, have bad grades and my parents don't love me as much as her parents do. i've also never had a boyfriend before, and she is the same age as me! she will have a bright future because of her beauty,smarts and personality...and i'll have nothing.</span></p>

              <p>Why so hard to get boyfriend? Nowadays a lot of desperate guys. You don't go to coed school? Just be very nice and super friendly to a guy. Sure sure he will be horny. I got a lot of guy friends - very desperate and horny. You want to get to know them? Want also cannot because i am not singaporean.</p>
              <p>Want friends? Go make a facebook acc then add 1,000,000 strangers as your friend. Am very sure out of that 6,000 would accept your friendship request.</p>
              <p>Want good grades? Study hard and ask your teacher a lot of questions.</p>
              <p>Not pretty? You are not 30 years old for goodness sake. You are still young. Go do facial. Got pimples? Go to beautician and get it sucked out. Go to stylist and perm your hair blonde. For girl - the magic of Mabeline make up can make you pretty.</p>

              <p>I am assuming here this is a real problem for you. Hmm it appears it's eating you up inside and destroying your confidence and outlook. Comparing can be beneficial or a torment, depending on the individual.</p>
              <p>I have to agree with 'speakoutfor' - it appears to be heading towards the right direction. Not a motivational guru but I can give yah my thoughts.</p>
              <p>Despite the flaws and setbacks, I believe (I mean really believe, not because I watched a fairy tale happy ending) that the outcome you desire is the sum of two parts - the right thoughts and the right actions. If you had the right thoughts and implemented the right course of actions, eventually, you will have the desired outcome, similar to any projects we undertake.</p>
              <p>It's great you are comparing yourself to your cousin actually (despite the torment) cause you had given yourself a benchmark and role model to work towards. I suggest, as opposed to shying away from your cousin, get to know who she is, what she does, and how she does what she does, because apparently whatever she is doing is giving her the results you want.</p>
              <p>Then do exactly what she does, :). The right actions should give you the results desired, and if it didn't work, change your actions until you get the right results. Plus, you get to mingle with her friends and figure what they are doing 'differently'. A major makeover of your image can help, for example.</p>
              <p>Hope it helps. If anything, comparing yourself to your cousin can make you a better person. Jealousy is a torment to some but a burning desire for others.</p>

              <p>And I'm sure to find contentment with your life, you'll realize your passion and interest, something that you can be proud of.

              <p>i very long never see her alr. the last time ive seen her was when i was 5-7 years old. i had also thought that she was beautiful at that time. but no jealousy since i was very young.</p>
              <p>she lives in malaysia and i live in singapore. but my grandmother, who is also from malaysia, will occasionally come visit for a few months or so. she'll sometimes mention my cousin about how pretty she is, how smart and how independent she is :( and then i'll feel like shit.</p>
              <p>also, ive seen my cousin's photo in my grandmother's phone. she looked even better than the last time i've seen her. my grandmother also said that there is a lot of people who say that shes pretty, so im not the only one who thinks so. </p>

              <p>The moment you start comparing, you're likely to be in for a disappointment. Firstly, for example this guy A, everyone envies him because he has everything, looks and money. But since I know this guy A inside out, I realize he's not always happy. He's really troubled deep inside. There are deep troubles he never told anyone, but on the outside, everyone thinks he's happy.</p>
              <p>And this guy B, everyone thinks he's great and successful and doing alot of charitable deeds. But slowly the lies came apart, and we realize he is actually a conman and the charity money he gave is only a tiny tiny percentage of the money he scammed from his close friends and others. Currently they are trying to get this guy B to court and eventually to prison.</p>
              <p>My point is, why compare when you can only see a certain aspect of another person? That would be unfair comparison. Secondly, what makes you think that the future won't change? For example, the guy actually sleeps around with other girls and got AIDS and pass AIDS to your cousin and both die before 20? What I am trying to say is the moment you do comparisons, you're likely to sell yourself short. Why be so unfair to yourself?</p>
              <p>Here's what you should do. Live life on your own terms. Do what makes you happy, go into a career that you enjoy doing.</p>
