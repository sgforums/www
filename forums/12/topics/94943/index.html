I am courting this girl now, she like me too but she kept telling abt the guy she used to like and going out with him and so on. Jealously took place of course but if you really start thinking abt it; you'll find tht she's being honest to ya.<br><br>One thing you've to keep this relationship going is to have trust. Without it either party will suffice. Tell her you already had me, why are you<br>seeing/flirting with this guy. Am i not caring enough or are you not sensitive enough about how i felt ? If she apologize to ya, make sure this doesn't happen again; monitor her closely. Building up trust from dere, if she insists on seeing tht guy even after you had confronted her.. .  thn i guess it's time to really let go.<br><br>You have to get to know what's the reason she's contacting tht guy suddenly. Was it becuz he lives nearby and thus she tink tht having a bf living near her would be great. If tht's the case, she lacks sense of security.. she must be thinking tht oh, he lives so near me; i can walk with him to sch and after and have this really close relationship since he's living next to her.<br><br>Some girls seek companion by searching for guys living near her. Let her know how you felt and pray tht the answer would be smth tht u thought of. God blessed.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

It's like a classic puppy love to me.<br><br>Power struggle within relationship is common, especially when security issue is involve. To enter into power struggle with your partner is when you start having this 'You can't do this, but I can' mentally, 'I want to be above you, I want to grasp the relationship'. Regardless, both of you desired to capture certain form of stability within the relationship by exercising conscious control - until one party gives in. Rather unhealthy to maintain relationship this way.<br><br>Why does she accept you in the first place? I truely doubt its for love.<br><br>Disagree?<br><br>What if I were to say that guy whom he has a crush on decide to chase her, do you truely think you stand a chance against his invasion?<br><br>P.S: Is she a Libra?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
