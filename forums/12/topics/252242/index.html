She also say she dono why, and dono how to let me go in. Coz its too tight n painful for her. Is it normal for a girl 1st timer to be painful? We have lotsa foreplay tough, but somehow it just comes dry after awhile...<br><br>Just FYI we are both of legal ages..<br><br>Can you give me some advices? Thanks &amp; i really appreciate alot..</div></blockquote>Perhaps giving her more foreplay - at least min 30mins till she's sexually aroused, than as you lick her (if you're open to the idea) till you get her wet enough, than you finger her first, but for 1st time you insert, do it gradually while she's relaxed, thus it will the pain she will not close up her walls inside which bar you from entering  (meanwhile you lick her to give her more pleasure - divert her attention elsewhere in this case, more orgasm) than you can slowly finger her till she like it, than you  enter her.<br><br>Lol.<br><br>For alternatives, or better ideas, PM me privately as this is afterall a public forum with some people still underage, thus it's not convenient to pose the details here.</div>
