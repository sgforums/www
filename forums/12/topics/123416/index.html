I feel so trapped again. I had hanged on to this current project in hope i would be posted to a better one. Now all hopes are gone and i just want to quit. But to quit would post another set of problems, mainly money. really don't know wat i should do and i don't think i can accept another one year of useless experience.<br><br>I know many people would say i am lucky i got a job in this industry that others are dying to get into etc. but seriously, without the proper exposure, i would be no better than a freshie and still more expensive to hire. I really wonder if i should just give it all up and start anew in other job, another industry if i am not happy in wat i am doing.<br><br>i also got other issues like family and other stuff that have been bugging me to bits. guess all these is really getting too much for me to handle that's y i chose to rant here.<br><br>life sucks. thanks for listening. i'm gonna go back to my tequila and hopefully die a painless death for this meaningless existance is just a waste of my time.</div>
