              <p>Hello People :D</p>
              <p>I am extremely worried because of my cca. I have not been attending it for months. Yes, you got it right. 2 months in fact. The problem is I AM LAZY. I am in scouts and you all know that Uniform groups are very hectic and lots of PT. What makes matter worst is that I am obese. I am like standing at 90+Kg and really find it difficult to cope with the footdrills and so on. I just can't balance and at the end get a earful from the Sirs. I am worried because i intend to go to a prestigious JC and get a Scholarship for my dream university in UK but they require a excellent CCA Record. I just feel like quitting scouts and taking up some Photography club or light stuff but i still like scouts because it's fun .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PLEASE help me in this mind-breaking dilemma :D</p>

              <p>It's good when you have an aim to go a good JC and ultimately, garner a scholarship to that dream UK uni..if u can have that aim, aim yourself to finish what you have left..it's mind over matter right now..just finish the CCA..get those points..do well for your O's...sometimes, u dun even need those CCA points..tell yourself once you get into that JC u wanted, you will enter a CCA that you ultimately like and put your heart into it...get a good post in the exco...and things will go smooth for ya... good luck to you... and if u wanna pursue law in uni, i can get you a scholarship...</p>

              <p>Only solution. Don't be lazy and do it ffs. Contradicting yourself saying want a new CCA but you still love scouts and shit. And even hope to get into a 'prestigious' JC. Or getting a scholarship into your 'dream' Uni even.</p>

              <p>Well, I was in a similar predicament to you back in sec sch. Skipped my cca training, got fired and couldn't be bothered to get another. Then smoked my way through the rest of sec sch life. Luckily I got alot more active in JC...</p>
              <p>Don't repeat my mistake. If you really want a good CCA record, then work for it. Joining CCA for the mere sake of records is useless though, it shows how shallow a person you are. Since you do like scouts, stick with it and get committed. Even if you get into say RJ or HCI without your CCA, if I were the scholarship interviewer I would never give you that scholarship, because you don't show an aptitude to commit, to show you deserve the scholarship.</p>
              <p>What you need isn't advice on your CCA. What you need is a self reflection of what your dreams are and how much blood, sweat and tears you are willing to put in to get there.<br> I can tell you one thing: at this rate, forget the UK university you want. Some serious housekeeping is in need here. Harsh but true.</p>

              <p><br>i would proudly tell my child that i was a scout. there is a lot more to scouting then you think. by you saying the above i assume you are not a scout or have a bad experience with scouting? i would say that unless you are a real scout please refrain from making such comments. oh ya and being a real scout is more than putting on that green uniform and beret, there is much more to scouting than that.</p>

I have seen frens who get to good foreign universities when they are not the cream of the crop or having astounding CCAs. (They have $$) All JCS are pretty good in their own way too. It doesn't mean you need to go to HCJC or RJC just to get ahead in life. If you have the right material, you will go far. (I am always ponning CCA back in my own secondary sch too)</p></div>
