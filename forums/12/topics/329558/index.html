              <p>I've been trying so hard to conceal my 'disability' but to no avail. Everytime I open my mouth, something always comes out wrong &amp; it makes people look at me funny, sometimes even angry or they don't understand me at all.</p>

              <p>to be honest, there <em>could be</em> such a thing as no talent....</p>

              <p>but u still can be good at something else... Os are pretty hard to survive on nowadays especially if you cant do sales...</p>
              <p>and job hopping is bad enuff without the jobs sacking...</p>
              <p>so ... what are u good at ? if u cant do sales and u cant do detailed work... what abt reception jobs, customer service or even manual labour ?</p>
              <p>surely there must be something ???</p>

              <p>Go take up upgrading classes to increase your knowledge. I recommend some management studies.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Join public speaking clubs.. like Toastmasters etc. To help you gain more confidence in public speaking and presentation.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>not knowing u well.. (or at all), there's nothing much i can do except wish you good luck.</p>
              <p>i always have faith that everyone can do something.</p>
              <p>look at the disabled... if even they can hold down a job, why cant you ?</p>
              <p>look at the mentally challenged.... if they can hold down a job too, why cant you ?</p>
              <p>if u have truly hit the bottom and believe that there's no further way down... then <em>surely </em>the only way to go is up ?</p>
              <p>other options u may not have tried includes :</p>
              <p>1) hawker assistant</p>
              <p>2) fast food outlets</p>
              <p>3) restaurants</p>

              <p>Why can't you do office job? There are many office jobs like admin assistant which don't really need much talking (or at least not to stranger).</p>
              <p>And many jobs in retail don't need much talking also. I had worked as sales assistant in Watson before and the job required more manual work (like pricing, packing, cashier, etc) than customer facing.</p>
              <p>Shyness can be overcome, you just need to talk to more people to build up your confidence. Start with your friends, colleagues first.</p>
              <p>And if you know you are blur, than just note down all the outstanding tasks and do them one as a time</p>

              <p><br>what constitutes to failing in life?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>not earning a million bucks by the age of 30?</p>
              <p>not commanding a monthly salary of $10,000 / mth?</p>
              <p>not excelling in your studies/job?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i'm sure that you're not perfect in your studies/job and fail short of expectations. please do us a favour and go kill yourself first. to add on, please get your parents in along with you since they fail to bring you up properly, thus failing in life. thank you have a nice day.</p>

              <p>Self confidence is what you lack. The only was is to interact more with other people. If you hide yourself at home everyday and socialise little, you will tend to be shy and scared of strangers.</p>

              <p>if you think you suck at sales then don't talk so much, it'll work better that way if you fear offending the customer.</p>
              <p>just make sure you give the customer a good smile and greeting and then ask the customer what he/she wants and let the customer take it from there. sales is also about listening. if you haven't noticed, retail staff who received awards are not the ones who can talk well but the ones who showedthat they care about their job &amp; customers or at least put up the act.</p>
              <p>and keeping quiet applies to most industries, most people don't like staff that talk so much unless you're entertaining.</p>
