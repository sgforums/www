            <div class='col-md body'>hi tlrEd,<br><br>When a girl tells everything abt any problems like relationship, family or work to a guy, the guy may wonder why in this world that this lady telling me her situations. Is she telling me that I m good enough to solve her problems in her life. This maybe the misunderstanding often guys created.<br><br>Few years ago, I too have a crush on one of the gals I know, but she've a boyfriend already. She told me everything abt her life and I thought she has feelings for me. However, I do like her but I dun have the heart to break up a relationship that have already made its foundation. I remembered once she told me that she has problems wif his boyfriend but I know that she loves her boyfriend very much. But, I took one step back becoz I dun to be the third party in a relationship. Now I still kept in contact wif her as bro/sis, and I have still treat her as a very close friend (totally no love for her). For liking her at that period of time is just temporary, it will die off easily as time passes by.<br><br>Maybe you have a unique character in you that attract a guy's attention. I think you can find a guy that will provide the love of ur life.<br><br>------------------<br>"A relationship is like a rose,<br>How long it lasts, no one knows;<br>Love can erase an awful past,<br>Love can be yours, you'll see at last;<br>To feel that love, it makes you sigh,<br>To have it leave, you'd rather die;<br>You hope you've found that special rose,<br>'Cause you love and care for the one you chose."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmmz.. mine's the opposite of yours... i always hear people out in irc... in the end mi helping results in them liking me... for mine maybe bcoz mi too kpo then they all thot i have liking for them coz so concerned..  i tink for your case it's coz when some guys see a girl distressed, it's their nature to feel for the girl and causes the surge of need to protect the weak one to rise... and when thru irc, the anoymous friend u r talking to possesses this aura of secretivity that causes poeple to b more curiious and wanna find out more.. as time passes, they might discover more about you and this curiousity juz might turn feelings.. furthermore, u might b a reallie nice girl that they can even feel it thru irc... maybe it's your point of view.. maybe it's your values... your passion for feelings... or juz how u look upon life.. that they feel that they have found the perfect partner that suits them and stuffs.. well, u neva knoe...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The way I figure it is when two people share problems and experiences, it somehow draws them both together... guys have a tendency to feel this a lot more... especially if the girl is rather cute and, at the point in time, vulnerable.<br><br>It seems to set off some trigger in the guy's mind that says "Go on... she wants you"<br><br>Fun isn't it?<br><br>As for BabyAcid's case... perhaps girls are a sucker for Sensitive Nice Guys? The line between helping out friends and being nice to them because you like them is very thin.. and easily overstepped.<br><br>What do the good folks in the forums say to this?<br><br>------------------<br>Don't like what I'm saying?

            <div class='col-md body'>maybe it makes it better if you let the guy know you treat him as a friend and dats all, before you tell him your problems .. i guess by tellin him straight out that you dun like him that way, theres a bigger probability that he wun misunderstand.<br><br>and i guess, as PPD said, it helps to have girl friends to confide in .. those who can guide you .. because i guess that experience counts for a lot, especially in relationships, on what to look out for ..<br><br></div>
