              <p>What flame? Duhhh !!!  When did I ever claim I am always right? Just because I retorted some of your posts does not bring everybody else into the picture ok? You are the whos restricted, not accepting what ppl say to you. Quit putting words into my mouth !!</p>

              <p>Now, I am offering genuine advice to TS' predicament here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just a sidenote, I am not an advocate in marrying foreign girls. I only recommended TS try wooing Malaysian girls. I personally do not consider Malaysian girls as foreign cos Malaysians have been living among us for as long as i can recall. You dont consider your neighbour as foreign do you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is a fact that with TS' income cap, it'll be very hard to get a local gf, needless say marriage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some of you go against the idea that TS go find a wife overseas, then how you tell me? What other advice can be offered in TS current state?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unless TS can magically double or triple his earning capacity overnight, or some nice lady is gracious enough to accept him, the chances of him scoring a local gal is beyond minute.</p>

              <p>First of all, i did not put words in your mouth. You do not have the open-ness of the mind when it comes to giving opinions and if you wld want me to show you all your posts, then i can do it to show how you dismiss all other ppl's opinion and flames ppl back.</p>
              <p>On 7/8/11 at 11.37AM, you quoted Aneslayer's post on the part of repenting. where he said "You mistook repenting as being sorry. Many have not come to terms even when they are sorry. Having the resolve to accept the responsibility, repair the damage and stay back on course, is repenting" but u openly dismisses his own opinion on his own issue and flames him back by saying "You are repenting but you are not sorry? Then why may I ask, why should anybody else cut you any slack? It is only your wife whos forgiven you.. To hell with your pretense and your stupid ideologies. You are nothing more than a disgusting filthy animal.</p>
              <p>Now aint that great? Let everybody here feast their eyes on the sickening bastard you turn out to be. As far as i'm concerned, anybody here is entitled to run you down"</p>
              <p>First you shot down his opinion by saying that anybody here is entitled to run you down, then u flamed him by saying that he is a disgusting filthy animal.,pretense and your stupid ideologies.HOW IS IT THAT OTHER'S IDEOLOGIES ARE PRETENCE AND STUPID WHILE OUR MR XIAOGOUGOU OFFERS GREAT IDEOLOGY AND GOOD GOLDEN ADVICE?</p>
              <p>"personally do not consider Malaysian girls as foreign cos Malaysians have been living among us for as long as i can recall. You dont consider your neighbour as foreign do you?" -As quoted from xiaogougou</p>
              <p>i am so sorry that anyone who is not a singaporean is considered a foreigner whether they are malaysian or china chinese or american or from whichever nationality as long as they are not holding a IC that states that they are singaporean. Even a malaysian wife is considered a foreign wife.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Some of you go against the idea that TS go find a wife overseas, then how you tell me? What other advice can be offered in TS current state?"-As quoted from xiaogougou</p>
              <p>We/I already did advice TS to try and up his salary cap. Please do not act as though only you give sound advice and we are not giving any. By asking ask what other advice can be offered in TS current state, do you mean that we are not giving any advice other than the same as yours? You totally come across as a person so full of yourself that you simply think that nobody's way would work other than yours. If it is only your way that will work in life, i do not see why you are whining about life in the first place.</p>

              <p><br>if both parties agrees on nth extravagent on marriage, i too tink that it might be possible with 1.5k. Problem is the possibility of finding such counterparts in sg. If already married, 1.2k of take home could mean a really hard life, but definitely can still survive. It all depends on how the expenditure is planned.</p>

And I believe 1.2k will make you save nothing, in fact, you got more loan and creditors going after you. No money is ok, at least can act and collect some at orchard road or end up in some govt homes, it is those who earn pathetic income that suffer the most, want to do this and that also got constrain, and these are the people who are alway struggling to breath above the water.</p></div>

              <p>I ord-ed in the year 2004. That was the same year my poly friend ORDed. I went to uni, he went to work with starting salary $1.7k/mth. Neither of us have any rich family background.</p>
              <p>Year 2011<br>I'm in an engineering job, earning pittance.<br>My poly friend is running 3 businesses, one of which has an annual turnover of 600k and still growing profitably. He's 30 years old this year, married with a fully paid up HDB, a SUV and 2 kids.</p>
              <p>When you have a will, you will find the way. This friend of mine set his target to earn lots of money when he ORD. He knew what he wanted, he fought very hard for it, of course not without consequences. But the arduous journey paid off.</p>
              <p>Question is<br>1) Do you know what you want?<br>2) Are you willing to work very very hard for what you want, even if you need to sacrifice a huge portion of what you have now (for e.g. free time)?</p>

              <p>First of all, i did not put words in your mouth. You do not have the open-ness of the mind when it comes to giving opinions and if you wld want me to show you all your posts, then i can do it to show how you dismiss all other ppl's opinion and flames ppl back.</p>
              <p>On 7/8/11 at 11.37AM, you quoted Aneslayer's post on the part of repenting. where he said "You mistook repenting as being sorry. Many have not come to terms even when they are sorry. Having the resolve to accept the responsibility, repair the damage and stay back on course, is repenting" but u openly dismisses his own opinion on his own issue and flames him back by saying "You are repenting but you are not sorry? Then why may I ask, why should anybody else cut you any slack? It is only your wife whos forgiven you.. To hell with your pretense and your stupid ideologies. You are nothing more than a disgusting filthy animal.</p>
              <p>Now aint that great? Let everybody here feast their eyes on the sickening bastard you turn out to be. As far as i'm concerned, anybody here is entitled to run you down"</p>
              <p>First you shot down his opinion by saying that anybody here is entitled to run you down, then u flamed him by saying that he is a disgusting filthy animal.,pretense and your stupid ideologies.HOW IS IT THAT OTHER'S IDEOLOGIES ARE PRETENCE AND STUPID WHILE OUR MR XIAOGOUGOU OFFERS GREAT IDEOLOGY AND GOOD GOLDEN ADVICE?</p>
              <p>"personally do not consider Malaysian girls as foreign cos Malaysians have been living among us for as long as i can recall. You dont consider your neighbour as foreign do you?" -As quoted from xiaogougou</p>
              <p>i am so sorry that anyone who is not a singaporean is considered a foreigner whether they are malaysian or china chinese or american or from whichever nationality as long as they are not holding a IC that states that they are singaporean. Even a malaysian wife is considered a foreign wife.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>"Some of you go against the idea that TS go find a wife overseas, then how you tell me? What other advice can be offered in TS current state?"-As quoted from xiaogougou</p>
              <p>We/I already did advice TS to try and up his salary cap. Please do not act as though only you give sound advice and we are not giving any. By asking ask what other advice can be offered in TS current state, do you mean that we are not giving any advice other than the same as yours? You totally come across as a person so full of yourself that you simply think that nobody's way would work other than yours. If it is only your way that will work in life, i do not see why you are whining about life in the first place.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>And why the hell are you on his side? Are you advocating what hes done ? For you to be agreeing with him just speaks of what kind of a person you are.</p>

              <p>I could call him or you,  a bastard, a baffoon, a rotten piece of shit off the drain a million times as I like and I would feel nothing wrong about it. And There is NOTHING you can do to stop me.</p>
