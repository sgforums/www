              Trrsnider,
              It is ok to disagree what I have ...I meant it as a metaphor but the meaning has been interpreted ''literally'' lah. 
              
              However, It does not detract from this - to use another is an insult to onself and insulting another. 
              
              Being Self-honest about it matters, dont say love, when it is not love. These are needs, expectations that one expects that the other give. When it is mutual and agreeable, it is at its best a mutual benefit scheme.
              
              I lament the use of the word love , when certainly it is not.
              
              Whatever, it is, it is my predicament and my ''opinion''. Rite/wrong it always subjective and relative to the one in or not in it.
              
              You are free to be what resonates with you, just ignore and lump it lah.

              <p>We have moved on from marriage. Marriage is another relatioship, same as but perhaps more formalised than going steady, co-habiting, defacto etc.</p>
              <p>Real relatioships between a woman and her man must be based on love and caring for each other.

              <p>And if you wanna meet real decent chaps, that cant be a more wrong place to look too. Because none of them really visit any clubs to begin with.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now I'll be wary of those pple who are over friendly to you. Living in an asian society, I know well enough when someone is too friendly, it typically means that fellow has an agenda up his sleeve. Better be safe than sorry.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> i go clubbing because, i enjoy most music, love dancing, like the atmosphere and get to mingle with other singles who are on the same wave length and want to mingle too. only pitfall is that sometiems the music is too loud and you can't really talk. but i'm interested if there are other places i can meet locals and/or foreigneers who want to mingle. maybe u can tell me where i can go to mingle with single guys etc.?</p>

              <p>$1.5k can count yourself lucky that you are most to likely to get a good girl. The higher your salary, the choice is larger and includes more bad characters. Higher some more lagi worse.</p>

              <p>It is not that you cannot start a family, as a guy earning only 1.5k, you need to be responsible if you really want a family, you dun want to end up your childrens having to work partime to support their own studies, you dun want to end up you childrens and wife having to suffer with you eating only rice and chilli or cans foods or maggi mee for lunch and dinner. All these you hv to ask yourself, can you provide a decent living for your family and their future. If you think you can do it with a household income of only 1.5k, by all means, but dun end up having more stress and jump river or reservoirs.</p>
              <p>But if you do not want other to suffer with you, then remain single like me, tho earning more than 1.5k, i prefer to stay single, cos I do not need guys and also do not want to harm them because I know my temper, not happy only, chop them</p>

              <p>The question is.. do you really want your child to be born into poverty ?</p>
              <p>Yes.. no money.. everyday eat maggi.. got good values.. so what ? They are still suffering..and they had no choice.</p>
              <p>Responsible parenting starts before the sperm fertilise the egg.  Family planning is pre-emptive.. not reactionary.</p>
              <p>Don't anyhow pop one out.. then realise no money for diapers.. that's very irresponsible. OK ? Good.</p>
