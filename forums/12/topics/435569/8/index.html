              <p>okay with all that tide against me, maybe i need to change my view a little. cost of living is higher in singapore?</p>
              <p>what i am impressed about singapore is its friendly people, the level of technology is quite advanced - here the politicians talk about stuff, in your country they actually do stuff! but i really can't understand the local problem and the excessively sexist views expressed that everything depends on the male for economics of the family. relationships are then only for economic reasons and the family is not set up on love and attachment. (ok i am a romantic!). i think love and respect should be the basis of any ST or LT relationship. otherwise we are no less than machines. gals don't let the guys intimidate! but please guys (i do love guys - and am not gay) don't think i am a bra burner .... a woman's libber..... i don't think men and women are equal..... they are different and each contribute hell of a lot to any relationship.</p>
              <p>i don't have a problem of being the main income earner, but if so i expect my partner to chip in and do much more around the house and for the kids (i am yet to have!).  hey singapore gals speak up, do you share this view?</p>
              <p>the australian government is not a benevolent organisation. it is a system set up for doing stuff which needs to be done collectively. money does not come from thin air. it comes from us and is redistributed to us (spending dist. is different to funding dist.). the bottom line is what the central organisation does is what its people want. otherwise that organisation ceases to exist.</p>
              <p>i apologise if i offended any local macho guys, but please think it through rationally and guys think what it would be like if you were a gal and gals think what it would be like if you were a guy! if you can appreciate and understand the other's thinking each one is set up on the road to good relationships.- whether it man/woman, worker/boss, service providor/customer....etc.</p>

              <p><br>Because we are still an Asian culture after all, many of the traditional expectations remain. A guy's income cap is regarded as the grounds for stability and is mostly the basis on whether the guy's dependable or not.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Due to development and urbanization, women are now liberalized and very much educated. They seek equal rights as men but shirk away their traditional roles as carers for the family. However, the expecation of a man as the house's breadwinner remains. . This acts as a double edged sword for many guys such as TS who earn below the 2k cap, in having trouble finding them signficant other.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Great that your government distributes wealth !! In Australia, you can depend on state welfare. One is never truly penniless and anybody in need could find the adequate assistance they require .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore our government does not share wealth !! They hoard it. Although they pretend to sanction some welfare packages, but all these will be leeched back by their unfavourable policies eventually ~~</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In Singapore, it becomes an ironic, vicious cycle where the rich becomes richer and the poor becomes poorer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What do you hope to come out of a situation when people are left to fend for themselves ??</p>

              <p>C'mon girl.. all these idealistic rants.</p>
              <p>Don't you wish you can marry a man who will take care of you for life? So you can focus on raising your baby.. and enjoy a good life all without having to break a sweat nor lift a finger ?</p>
              <p>I've travelled many places.. no matter how well evolved the culture is in that country... women will always be looking for men who can provide adequate or better resources. Especially those who are well aware they are well endowed.</p>
              <p>In Singapore.. women are not required to cook.. because of the abundance of delicious food every corner you turn.. and domestic chores are carried out by cheap, foreign domestic maids/help. The car, equivalent to price of a home, is but a symbol of status.</p>
              <p>In a country where every convenience can be bought ....All you need.. to have a good life is... <strong>money</strong>. That's the currency that spans all languages, geographical boundaries and culture.</p>
              <p>Now .. if only men can carry babies in their tummy.. the world will be a truly wonderful place.</p>

              <p>of course money can't buy happiness. But lets be realistic, you will need money to hire a babysitter so you and your hubby can have a break, buy diapies and feed them food after they are weaned off your boobies 2 years after that cute little bundle is born, yes ?</p>
              <p>Now you don't want to be slogging your ass off trying to make ends meet.. while your hubby cooks clean and launder your undies now would you ? By the time you get home.. and he's ready for jiggies.. you'd be all shrivelled and exhausted.. really.. you just wanna turn your back on him and go to dreamland...that poor chap will be wanking himself off your wedding photos.</p>
              <p>Of course...happiness is not all money.... he must have great personality.. huggable.. jiggable.. and all the sugar and spice... yes ? But wouldn't it be great if he have em all.. and the moolah too ? Wonderful yes ? Now why would you settle for less ?</p>
              <p>True.. some men are not marriage material because they are already married to their work. There are plenty of single millionaires out there ready to prove my point. </p>
              <p>Now, if you can just find yerself a well rounded.. well balanced man..your Vjayjay will be yelling..ohh baby baby !!! Nothing wrong with that.. it's all primal instinct.</p>

              The question is not whether another would accept u or let alone marry you. Can you accept someone who earns a higher .. or lower and still accept or marry or whatever.
              
              One has to understand that, money is good tool to be used for ... but when money uses  ...then it is neurosis. 
              One can earn even 10 k a month or  ... but it can all be lost when something not so savory transpires.
              
              There is no security outside of oneself. It is an illusion. When one is secure within onself, whther one earns  ...? is irrelevant. One would see thru the illusion of  and yet be balanced.
              
              PS - Lest it is misconstrued that it is wrong to prioritize on the basis of money, my implication is that if one feel so, be it so, but it is never ok to impose it on another to fulfil/prop one's position
