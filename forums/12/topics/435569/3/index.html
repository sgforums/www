              <p><br>No lah, taiwanese dun eat durian one lah, but they got lots of durian's head guys with spiky hairstyle. Taiwan foods are very much added with persevatives and many other food chemicals, so people use to get sick after eating it, even the plantation use lot of pesticides, and because of AVA corruption, and the ever change of govt and councils, most farmers can go beyong the limit use of chemical and pesticide, just give some money to the official plus one gal, everything settled.</p>
              <p>When I go back to my house in taiwan, I only buy foreign foods, even rice also order from cambodia</p>

You should look for sg girl as your gf or wifey, they are more stable, able to make good decision, educated, able to help out financially, understandable and inline with your needs and culture.</p>
              <p>Having a third world gf is as easy as ABC, but nothing to be proud of, you might have to slave inorder to support her and her family, but having a sg gal, your own local gal as gf is something you should be proud of, someone who can think and give proper advices to you. For every successful man behind stand a successful woman</p>

              <p><br>You do realize the remarks were focused on you and you alone, not directed towards any other sg gal. Look at how sore you are by throwing lame insults over just a nickname i assume.</p>

              <p>However, all the comments i made about you are NOT insults. Because those words simply depict what you are and what you portrayed yourself to be !! </p>

              <p>Have we heard other country girls coming to run our country women down? Why is it that you are so desperate to bad mouth them? Isnt that a sour grape?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Look tart, before you start pointing fingers at others, take a piss and look at yrself in it. You related how you conned other guys and laid flat out every justification possible and then a second later you come calling with all that purity and being a nice gal garbage.

              <p> </p>
              <p>But the hard fact is that most sg women simply gauge a guy by his income cap. Full stop. Finito. End of story. Insert credit to continue. Most women here simply lose interest immediately when they hear his salary figure, let alone to have dates for them to develop further.</p>

              <p>*NOTE*</p>
              <p>You are NOT a loser if you have a foreigner as a wife. You ARE only a loser if you used money as the basis for making her your wife.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Besides, those pple who resort to using money to get a mail order bride are mostly uncles or ah peks that have no hope in getting any girl here. They are already losers, are they not? I dont think those foreign girls, having to marry someone twice their age need to come here to realise that loh..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you talk about mail order brides, most of them are from very humble backgrounds, they dabbled mostly in agriculture back home, they had very little education, if any. Unless they got the means to survive outside on their own, they would still very much have to rely on their husbands to provide for them or they are capable enough to find another guy to support them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If not they also LL have to stick to their husbands here.  *shrugs*</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I reckon most of us guys would rather believe a girl from a simple background is not as devious and calculative as those brought up in a country where such qualities are imbued in the girls here.</p>

              <p>Oh... ad hominem and name calling. You don't mind being juvenile and immature then.</p>
              <p>You mistook repenting as being sorry. Many have not come to terms even when they are sorry. Having the resolve to accept the responsibility, repair the damage and stay back on course, is repenting.</p>
              <p>I believe you have an inferiority complex. Putting other people in bad light just to make self feel better. Sounds like mastubating your ego... Well do what you lust then.</p>
              <p>You left a question unanswered... "<span style="color: #333333; font-size: 14px; line-height: 16px;">What purpose/s does it serve to stop people from living their life to the subjective fullest?"</span></p>

              <p>Nevermind lah, next life try again, this life plant more blessing seeds, so next life you will be super wealthy. Normally, it is not your earning, but your love that bride-to-be is desperado for. Initially they probably look for the wealth, thereafter, they usually will lost their sanity of true love in the eyes of wealth. Many wealth husbands are sick of their wife and wife tired of their husband, according to episode of tv serials...you ought to be patient to your bride-to-be, give them a period of abt 10-15 years for true love to blossom <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
