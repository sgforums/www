              <p>1) Money is important - i think that is hard to argue against. How high on the 'important list' though for each person may vary.</p>
              <p>2) Can $1.5K pm be enough to survive (whatever that means to you)? For you and a partner and perhaps more later on? If yes, then work to finding someone who will accept you and the situation. If no, then u'll have to concentrate on changing your situation.</p>
              <p>I have faith that there are still people around who will accept your situation, based on your income. As mentioned before, your personal traits will also play a part.</p>

              <p>Sorry to disappoint, i do not have a tendency to put ppl down. Those I do put down are weasels who had it coming to them. Mainly over here, they are (1) Analslayer, a disgusting, guiltless, pervertic bastard, (2) Angel, a shameless, self centered, hypocritical tart, why should I ever be sorry to any of these cretins? Both of them in particular are miserable excuses for human beings, they have done plenty of wrong to those around them and after they die, they'll rot in hell !! So what are a few insults to them, when they absolutely deserved it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am only sorry if i never get the chance to whoop their asses upside down, inside out !!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You know you're just like a broken record. Keep repeating and whining, xiaogougou is restricted this, xiaogougou cannot support his argument that, xiaogougou loves to run pple down .. sobbbbzz... waeee waeeee waeeee  ~~~</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What else do you have to say? Do you have any creativity at all ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are just a balless sore loser who cant win over me in a previous argument and now you come here to whimp like a sick old dog with a limp.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What a soreass you are ~~~</p>

              <p>Most girls don't mind a guy earning 1.5k but they look at the future too. If she suffers now for a better tomorrow, most don't mind and will suffer along with him.</p>
              <p>But seriously for the guys who are bitching about how materialistic girls are, do a role reversal; if you are female, do you want to be stuck with someone who only moans about his income and how crappy it is instead of doing something about it and if you want to live the rest of your life hand to mouth?

(ok i am a romantic!). i think love and respect should be the basis of any ST or LT relationship. otherwise we are no less than machines. gals don't let the guys intimidate! but please guys (i do love guys - and am not gay) don't think i am a bra burner .... a woman's libber..... i don't think men and women are equal..... they are different and each contribute hell of a lot to any relationship.</p>
              <p>i don't have a problem of being the main income earner, but if so i expect my partner to chip in and do much more around the house and for the kids (i am yet to have!).  hey singapore gals speak up, do you share this view?</p>
              <p>the australian government is not a benevolent organisation. it is a system set up for doing stuff which needs to be done collectively. money does not come from thin air. it comes from us and is redistributed to us (spending dist. is different to funding dist.). the bottom line is what the central organisation does is what its people want. otherwise that organisation ceases to exist.</p>
              <p>i apologise if i offended any local macho guys, but please think it through rationally and guys think what it would be like if you were a gal and gals think what it would be like if you were a guy! if you can appreciate and understand the other's thinking each one is set up on the road to good relationships.- whether it man/woman, worker/boss, service providor/customer....etc.</p>
