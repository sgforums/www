              <p>1.5k is consider poor class, the meridian wage was set at 2,600 anything below is poor class, from 2.600 to 10000 is consider lower middle class, then above 10000 to 25000 is consider middle class, 25000 to 50000 is consider upper middle class, then above 50000, is consider rich class, which most minister earns.

              <p>Please don't any o how abuse the word "hypocrite" ok .</p>
              <p>What a man can buy with $1.5k is different from what a woman can buy with $1.5k. Have you ever thought about that ?</p>
              <p>Now.. if a woman goes for a richer man.. she is a gold digger. If she is rich and accepts a poorer man.. she's a sugar mommy. WTF.. there's no winning this one !!</p>
              <p>So.. based on that problem above.. a poor girl must go for a poor guy ? Then it's to TS advantage to go for a poor girl.. Africa got A LOT of poor female... but wait.. is TS a bigot ?</p>
              <p>But then again.. if TS goes for poor females because it's to his advantage.. isn't that EXPLOITING her situation ?</p>
              <p>OK. that's tough.</p>

              <p>Then,</p>
              <p>All girls have a father. Their own fathers are probably borderline or outright assholes.</p>

              <p>Since girls are very impressionable.. so go blame it on their fathers and brothers. ( Even male friends too ) for ruining your life for ya. - Cause and effect.</p>
              <p>So if a guy has money.. she is more likely to be able to tolerate him better.</p>
              <p>So, the bigger the asshole you are.. the more money you need to make any relationship work.</p>

              <p>Bravo, well said, keep that 2 cents in my piggy bank.</p>
              <p>1.5k is consider poor class, the meridian wage was set at 2,600 anything below is poor class, from 2.600 to 10000 is consider lower middle class, then above 10000 to 25000 is consider middle class, 25000 to 50000 is consider upper middle class, then above 50000, is consider rich class, which most minister earns. For me, i am between 10 to 25k. 4k need to work harder.</p>

              <p><br> TS got a problem of belittling himself, he should be proud of what
