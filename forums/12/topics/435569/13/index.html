              <p>At earning $1.5 it should be courting and building a stable future stage. Depend on the work TS can do, it should increase as time goes on. Otherwise it is TS own doing.</p>
              <p>But he still can get married. All he needs is a sense of responsibility that is comensurate with his status in life. There are people with low income, who has wonderful families, and also poor with terrible attitude and dyfunctional families.</p>
              <p>We should not tell anyone you are poor, you should not have children. Or tell children you parents are poor, you should not be born.</p>
              <p>If you are given a lemon, make lemonade, or throw it back and say no, thank you, you find something else better.</p>
              <p>Life is life, each and everyone should make the best of it, out of the circumstances we are thrown into.</p>
              <p>Make it, or not does not matter, as long as it is lived well. And it is all in the mind.</p>

              <p><br>i really look down on them! they will do anyhting to get attention, talk loudly and even if you give them a sidelong glance they happy like fuck coz they got the attention already, they have to touch you here and there in the train to get your attention, wait for you at coffee shop to get your attention, stand in front of you and as long as they stand in front whether you look or not (they poresume you will) theya slo happy. sometimes i really pity them, their minds and bahaviour, in a country alreayy opened up to the whole with their well known cheapo labor and land, but their cualture is really way back, and for thousands of years i say its really way back - babarians <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>I dun really look down on them, sometime, i pity them, cos they are born in a society unlike us, whereby parents do hv the time to care, the govt dun give a damn about their well being and education, and the society at large are able to exploit them without remorse, eventually they find themselves neglected and therefore created a character of seeking attention and all other bad habits, which they themselves also do not notice it, and therefore subject to being look down and outcast by people who think they are high up the human chain.</p>

              <p><br>If hell is not empty, I will not enter enlightenment, people can talk abt ying yang and all those stuff of cause and effect, but you need to fully understand and appreciate it before you truly enjoy the meaningful of it, if everyone seek the good, what happen to the bad, and within the good, lies the most bad, same to bad, within lies the most good.</p>
