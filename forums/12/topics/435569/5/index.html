              <p>I think in today's society, your situation does make it abit harder to find a gf. However, instead of stressing about it, try to improve your situation.</p>
              <p>At the same time, try and make your personal qualities stand out and use them to attract someone u like. It's not so common these days, but i think there are still people who like another for who (rather than what) they are.</p>

              <p>i think we shld be realistic. ultimately, marriage means living together and it means living in singapore.Be it where the bride comes from, they live in sg and they adhere to the living standards here. However simple a living they might agree to, having a substantial/sufficient income to maintain living is still impt.</p>
              <p>Bringing in a bride from another country may or may not be the solution too also. We cannot be sure that they will not use income as a judging guide and we cannot ensure that they wont be influence be us, fellow singaporeans. So best thing to TS is to try and increase your income. Living in sg is totally not easy, more so for starting a family.</p>
              <p>Also, lets stop flaming xiaogougou for we all know how restricted his mindset is when it comes to accepting other ppl's opinion as compared to his whereby only his is right while others are all wrong even in a no right or wrong scenario.</p>
              <p>This question TS posted in here is in the first place a question/problem subjected to different ppl's opinion. Lets remain a open mind on its discussion.</p>

              <p>i think we shld be realistic. ultimately, marriage means living together and it means living in singapore.Be it where the bride comes from, they live in sg and they adhere to the living standards here. However simple a living they might agree to, having a substantial/sufficient income to maintain living is still impt.</p>
              <p>Bringing in a bride from another country may or may not be the solution too also. We cannot be sure that they will not use income as a judging guide and we cannot ensure that they wont be influence be us, fellow singaporeans. So best thing to TS is to try and increase your income. Living in sg is totally not easy, more so for starting a family.</p>
              <p>Also, lets stop flaming xiaogougou for we all know how restricted his mindset is when it comes to accepting other ppl's opinion as compared to his whereby only his is right while others are all wrong even in a no right or wrong scenario.</p>
              <p>This question TS posted in here is in the first place a question/problem subjected to different ppl's opinion. Lets remain a open mind on its discussion.</p>

              <p>What flame? Duhhh !!!  When did I ever claim I am always right? Just because I retorted some of your posts does not bring everybody else into the picture ok? You are the whos restricted, not accepting what ppl say to you. Quit putting words into my mouth !!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, I am offering genuine advice to TS' predicament here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just a sidenote, I am not an advocate in marrying foreign girls. I only recommended TS try wooing Malaysian girls. I personally do not consider Malaysian girls as foreign cos Malaysians have been living among us for as long as i can recall. You dont consider your neighbour as foreign do you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is a fact that with TS' income cap, it'll be very hard to get a local gf, needless say marriage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some of you go against the idea that TS go find a wife overseas, then how you tell me? What other advice can be offered in TS current state?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unless TS can magically double or triple his earning capacity overnight, or some nice lady is gracious enough to accept him, the chances of him scoring a local gal is beyond minute.</p>

What about after marriage when you have kids? What do have to give to raise a child and give them education? It is a killer to bring up children in Singapore in case you are not aware..</p>
