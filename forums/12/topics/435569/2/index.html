              <p>For one, they share a similar culture to us, its easy to engage them in conversation and yet they do not share a similar upbringing which deprives them of the arrogance many of our local girls have. They are extremely faithful to rships and they take care of a guy's needs. They do not ask that you are rich or poor, so long you make a decent living, all they ask for in return is your love for her, thats it. My gf is malaysian and shes such a girl.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For local girls, well, most of the time, they would go think about what you could do for them rather than what they could do for you. And no matter how nice a guy you are, if you do not fit that income cap, you are automatically out of the list. Its even worse than going for a job interview =\</p>

              <p>Dont get too close to Angel pal. Shes a typical example of a sg gal. Overly pragmatic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, shes a living enigma as well. She contradicts her own words all the time. One moment she'll be bragging how to exploit guys and how she rather marry for money above everything else and the next second you find her blabbering about some true love crap.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>One things for sure, shes exceedingly self centered and practises a me-first attitude. She gives me the impression that she'll sacrifice anybody by her side as long as her interests get threatened.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BEWARE. Such a person with a double face / personality is very dangerous and someone you ought to be wary of.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are genuinely looking for decent girls, i think you may wanna fix your sights on Malaysian girls.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For one, they share a similar culture to us, its easy to engage them in conversation and yet they do not share a similar upbringing which deprives them of the arrogance many of our local girls have. They are extremely faithful to rships and they take care of a guy's needs. They do not ask that you are rich or poor, so long you make a decent living, all they ask for in return is your love for her, thats it. My gf is malaysian and shes such a girl.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For local girls, well, most of the time, they would go think about what you could do for them rather than what they could do for you. And no matter how nice a guy you are, if you do not fit that income cap, you are automatically out of the list. Its even worse than going for a job interview =\</p>
