              <p>Of course its not ALL about the money girl.</p>
              <p>You can still love a bum. Just can't live with one.</p>
              <p>Of course you can marry a guy without a dime to his name..</p>
              <p>But PLEASE.. make sure he can cook, clean, take care of your young uns. ..too...Unfortunately, guys with all those skills are far and few in between..</p>
              <p>When Ya can't have the best of BOTH worlds.. at least hve the best in one !!</p>
              <p>Don't just pick him b'cus he's good in bed.. OK? Good.</p>

              <p>great... we are now no longer focused on money alone.</p>
              <p>other things matter.....</p>
              <p>marriage is a balance. love, living standards, income, expenditure, children, no children, parents , relations, eating, exercise, a home, more homes, renting, transport, holidays, work, etc.........etc</p>
              <p>each couple will have to make compromise and ensure the partner is properly accommodated. then and only then will the marriage have a chance of going the distance. remember its not all about money!</p>

              <p>Aiya, sista, Even the cheapest you can find, typical
              singaporean, you know lah, all very thrifty, kiasi and kiasu one,
              got money also said no money, that is why u often see couples
              quarrel over money rather than love. No money, no honey leh. Given
              a choice, unless all singapore men are poors, we are sure to go for
              the best choice mah, dun want to end up having to do the laundry,
              wash and sweep floor, cook 3 meals, go wet market only, change
              diaper, go school with childrens and all those forever no
              return nonsense. Can get a guy who can give me a private house, a
              car, some maids, me dun heckcare what he do, die of Aids
              better.</p>
