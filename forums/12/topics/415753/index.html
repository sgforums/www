              <p>Since you took the risk, you must ensure you will win the game.</p>
              <p>Instead of letting him be, start to put a rein on him. When he said he gotta take it slow, what he means is that he is just going to stay like this and play around. If you don't do anything, he will definitely take things his way - which will ensure that you will lose for sure.</p>
              <p>However, since you want him to stop playing around, make sure you do not play around anymore as well.</p>
              <p>Anyway, if he refuses to be reined, that means he is unwilling to stop playing around. In that case, just throw him down and not be one of the girls played by him.</p>

              <p>Your issue is a classic case of Universal Law of Attraction at work. People in our lives act as 'mirrors' to let us see more clearly the issues within us that need to be resolved/healed. Most people have HUGE personal blindspots, and are unable to see personal faults/weaknesses, so need an external party to play that role.</p>
              <p>Since you agree and understand now that both you and him have the same faults, yet you only choose to find fault with him. Are you doing anything about your own inner issues?</p>
              <p>As long as you choose not to improve yourself, you'll naturally continue to attract similar men into your life, even if you break up with your current bf. Don't just take my word for this, try it and observe. :)</p>

              personal faults/weaknesses, so need an external party to play that
              role.</p>
              <p>Since you agree and understand now that both you and him have
              the same faults, yet you only choose to find fault with him. Are
              you doing anything about your own inner issues?</p>
              <p>As long as you choose not to improve yourself, you'll naturally
              continue to attract similar men into your life, even if you
              break up with your current bf. Don't just take my word
              for this, try it and observe. :)</p>

That is why I was manage to trick them, take their gifts, chop them hard hard in dinner and shopping, later go hotel, he go bathing, I go home. Later when he call up, just said house got problem, need to go back, then he will %^#$*(&amp;&amp;*FU_)**k^^$%#$$, just off the iphone lor.</p>
