              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Seek professional advice if you really feel you must as a mother and tread with your options carefully. He has social anxiety disorder as you have said or it could yet be just another case of being an introvert. And there's nothing wrong with being an introvert. Tim Cook, Steven Spielberg, Warren Buffet, JK Rowling, Charles Darwin, Bill Gates, Albert Einstein and Mahatma Gandhi are all introverts.</span></p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Just make sure you don't force anything on him that he doesn't like and g</span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">o see what he likes / loves / appreciates then take it from there.</span></p>
              <p>Good luck and stop worrying so much.. it's not like he's doing drugs, sleeping around with girls or chain smoking or drinking like a fish.</p>

              <p>I suffer from the exact same thing including panic attacks. I've been to the psychiatrist and psychologist but I feel it does not really help me that much. Is your friend currently in school or finding a job? I feel that if he has great friends, he won't be too awkward or  anxious around them. But anyway I would recommend getting help because this is a mental disorder. Is this phobia able to be cured? Hopefully yes. CBT may help him.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              <p>Dear All,</p>
              <p>I am new to this forum.</p>
              <p>I am facing a problem which is affecting me greatly. My son ,age 17, seems to be suffering from social phobia ( social anxiety disorder ) for quite some time.</p>
              <p>Initially, I thought he is just feeling shy as a normal person. However, it seems to be more than that. He always avoids going to dinners and family gatherings with me and his dad. He even fears to go down to the nearby shops and buy groceries. </p>
              <p>He also does not go out with his friends and always stay at home during weekends. I'm really worried for him as I wonder how he is going to find a job in the future and settle down.</p>
              <p>Is this phobia able to be cured? I am considering to bring him to see a psychiatrist for consultation but I'm worried whether the records will be kept confidential and whether he will have problem finding job in the future due to this. Will there be such problems?</p>
              <p>I am looking forward to your kind advice and will be grateful to you.</p>
              <p>Thank you,</p>
              <p>Gladys Wong</p>
