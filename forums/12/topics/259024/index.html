            <div class='col-md body'>Just to share something I have read recently in a book...<br><br><strong>The First Element of Chemistry: Different Interests</strong><br><br>Happily married soul mates always have different interests. Certainly they have many shared interests, but quite often they have many more different interests. Generally it is only after a few years of living together that they discover their many differences. They don't realize it in the beginning.<br><br>When couples fall in love, they don't go around saying,"I met the most incredible person. She is so different from me." Instead they tend to say the opposite. They say this because they havent yet discovered how different their interests are.<br><br>One reason wy we are attracted to people with different interests is because we are stimulated in their presence. They are so different from us that something new inside us gets stimulated. When someone is the same as you, you are not necessarily stimulated. If we just wanted to be with ourselves, we wouldn't need a partner at all. Trying new things actually gives you more energy and makes you more attractive.<br><br><strong>The Second Element of Chemistry: Complementary Needs</strong><br><br>Soul mates basically have something that their partners need. This mutual dependence creates healthy emotional chemistry.<br><br>Emotional chemistry frees us from being limited by our unrealistic picutres of what our ideal partner will look like or be like. When a man is able to experience the thrill of feeling needed by a woman, he is no longer caight in pictures and expectations of what his ideal partner should look like. He will simply enjoy the pleasure of making little romantic gestures and feeling her responses. When a woman experiences a man treating her in a special way, she is free from fixating on how her ideal partner should look. She is free to follow her heart and not get caught up in unrealistic expectations of perfection.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>The Third Element of Chemistry: Maturity</strong><br><br>We are usually attracted to someone who is at the same level of maturity as us. We cannot fully recognize a soul mate until we are ready. We need to know ourselves first before we can recognize the right person for us. As we become more mature, we gain greater wisdom and self-control. If we have negative addictive habits, eventually we feel motivated to clean up our life. We start reaching out to get support from others who are also putting their lives in order.<br><br><strong>The Fourth Element of Chemistry: Resonance</strong><br><br>Soul mates have similar values that resonate. It inspires us to be the best we can be. When we are with our parter, what is most important to him or her resonates with what is really important to us. You are able to see the good in your soul mate and respect and his or her values. To have similar values does not mean you will necessarily think and feel the same way about issues. You will be able to respect your partner's viewpoint and admire where he or she is coming from.<br><br>Sharing values makes us compatible with someone. It helps us to overcome the challenges that come with any relationship. When we experience the inevitable ups and downs, we can always get back up when deep in our souls we resonate with the highest values of our partner. This compatibility allows us to make compromises without giving up who we are or what is important to us.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Women Are Like Waves</strong><br>As a woman becomes more vulnerable in the rs, then quite naturally her feelings tend to rise and fall. For many weeks she may feel very loving and happy, but the suddenly, after the wave reaches its peak, the wave crashes and she hits bottom.<br><br>When a woman's wave crashes, she has very little to give, temporarily. This is when the man has to continue giving his best without expecting an immediate return. <strong>He has to remember he has the power to provide for her happiness. </strong>When a man assumes he cant provide for a woman's happiness, he will become discouraged. A man can minimize his discouragement and frustration by understanding that women are like waves and by having many positive memories of times when he has been successful. Then instead of feeling he cant do anything, he knows exactly what to do and has realistic expectations about the outcome.<br><br>When a woman's waves crasher, she will temporarily lose her ability to be as loving. she is suddenly not as self-assured, receptive and responsive. At those times, the man makes the mistake of trying to fix her. He tries to talk her out of feeling the way she does instead of taking the time to be more considerate and supportive in a way that works on venus.<br><br><strong>Rather than giving solutions, a man can be most successful if he provides increased understanding and empathy.</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If Woman are like Waves...<br><br><strong>Men are Like Rubber Bands</strong><br><br>To move into a woman's life without losing his sense of self and sense of autonomy, a man moves back and forth between feelinga  strong desire to get close and a desire to get away and be on his own. The more intimate a man becomes with a woman, the more he will sometimes feel a need to pull away.<br><br>When a man pulls away, it is very important that she not pursue him or try to get him back. She must be careful not to be rejecting when he returns. A man needs to feel that she freely accepts his tendency to pull away.<br><br>Women mistakenly assume that more intimacy is better. When a an pulls away, a woman thinks something is wrong and want to experience more intimacy.<br><br><strong>The wise woman learns to give a man his space and trust that he will once again find his hunger to bewith her on his own. She understands that "absence makes the heart grow fonder."</strong></div>
