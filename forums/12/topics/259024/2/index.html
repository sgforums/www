            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by rainee:<br><strong>If Woman are like Waves...<br><br>[b]Men are Like Rubber Bands</strong><br><br>To move into a woman's life without losing his sense of self and sense of autonomy, a man moves back and forth between feelinga  strong desire to get close and a desire to get away and be on his own. The more intimate a man becomes with a woman, the more he will sometimes feel a need to pull away.<br><br>When a man pulls away, it is very important that she not pursue him or try to get him back. She must be careful not to be rejecting when he returns. A man needs to feel that she freely accepts his tendency to pull away.<br><br>Women mistakenly assume that more intimacy is better. When a an pulls away, a woman thinks something is wrong and want to experience more intimacy.<br><br><strong>The wise woman learns to give a man his space and trust that he will once again find his hunger to bewith her on his own. She understands that "absence makes the heart grow fonder."</strong>[/b]</blockquote>This is quite true. I'm very much like that.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Got this from one of another forums I go to...<br>The 'C's you need in a relationship<br><br><strong>Care/Concern</strong><br>What is it that you need most when you are down, depressed or unhappy? No matter how frustrated you are, a simple word of care and concern from your other half can always calm your emotions. Although ideally that's the case, it still takes a lot of patience to endure a series of verbal attack before the concern can get through.<br><br><strong>Communication</strong><br>Something which couples should constantly emphasized on. Guessing can only get you that far but it can never beat communicating effectively. It's easy to talk but to communicate is another thing totally. Communication involves listening and processing as well as speaking but it's rather common for couples to skip a part or two. However, failure to communicate well has been responsible for the downfall of countless relationships. Heard before that the best couple is one whether one is mute and the other is deaf? But can't remember it's the guy who is mute or the gal. Although it would appear that no communication is the way to go, which is why they are supposedly the 'best' couple, but personally I think such a rumor only shows how hard it is to master communicating effectively between a couple. Either way, take your pick... it's either you want to know how the other person or totally ignore that person.<br><br><strong>Compromise</strong><br>It's never easy to strike a balance in real-life situations... not easy but not impossible. The point of balance in a relationship is to compromise. Actually, its also term it as 'respect' but since it doesn't begin with a C, so I can only mention it in the explanation text itself. In any case, to compromise is not to simply 'give-in' or 'surrender'... it's more to understand and respect the other person for their reasons, and also for them to understand and respect you for your decision to compromise and not simply because they are 'right' and you are 'wrong'.<br><br><strong>Contentment</strong><br>First of all, let it sink in that no one is obliged to love you. Secondly, accept the fact that there will always be someone better out there, both for you and for your other half. Lastly, combined the first two points and be contented with the fact that you have someone who loves you and that he or she is willing to be with you despite knowing someone better is out there.<br><br><strong>Confidence</strong><br>So what if you are not tall enough? Doesn't have a fantastic figure or is not Miss Universe quality? What is important is that he/she loves you for who you are so having a bit of confidence, both in yourself and in their choice (Note: YOU) can go a long long way. Of course, if there is a dark secret which you feel that they should know, it always helps to bring it out into the open first. (See Communication)</div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Control/Consistency</strong><br>No one likes to be subjected to frequent hot and cold treatment so the best way is to keep it at a certain temperature that you know you can maintain. Although it seemed pretty illogical to ask someone to 'control' their emotions, but it's exactly such lack of logic which is responsible for the varying treatment. One of the worse things to happen is to be all fired up and toss oneself headfirst into a relationship, only to realize how tiring it is to keep up all the things you are willing to do for them. Maybe there are some people out there who could actually maintain that high level of romance but unless you are one of them, don't argue with me. Besides, such people ARE maintaining at the level which they could know they could keep up with so it's better to ask yourself about your capabilities then.<br><br><strong>Contact</strong><br>No matter what people say about long distance relationships or long period of absence, about how the both of them don't mind and that distance doesn't matter, nothing... and I mean NOTHING beats your significant half standing right before your eyes and hugging you. To an extent, for you to be simply holding their hands and looking straight into their eyes already renders all the phone calls and video conferencing worthless. DoesnÂ’t mean that phone calls and other forms of communication are worthless, but they should only serve to fuel your desire to have that physical touch, no matter how small, when you see them again. This is what itÂ’s called the real meaning of 'distance makes the heart grow fonder'.<br><br><strong>Creativity</strong><br>If you are a boring person, no one is going to blame you. In fact, it's because you are boring which is why whatever 'stunt' you pull will be even more touching, for you to go the distance to do something for him/her. It's not a disadvantage to creative and spontaneous lovers and its good that they could frequently spice up their relationship so either way, a little creativity goes a long way to keeping the heart of your lover with you.<br><br><strong>Commitment</strong><br>ItÂ’s the Big C... something which every girl on Earth hopes to have from their guy. For some reason, it would appear that only guys have problems committing to a relationship? Commitment to a relationship is the most important C. It acts more like a catalyst to spur on all the rest of the 'C's on the list. However, to be willing to commit to a relationship takes a lot of effort and there is no other way to it, either you are in or you are out... doing so half-heartedly only gives rise to 'regrets' and 'suffering' for both parties.<br></div>
