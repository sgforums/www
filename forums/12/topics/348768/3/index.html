              <p>In secondary education, we know them as Form Teachers, but in
              Temasek Poly, We know them as Careperson and our class as our
              caregroup.</p>
              <p>I'm very upset about my careperson. You see, My class is very
              competitive and mainly my course does alot of coding and I can say
              very proudly that I am able to grasp it better than most people. In
              year 1, I wasn't paying attention in class during programming
              lessons, why? Simply because the pace was too slow for me and I was
              always 1 question ahead.</p>
              <p>So, in poly, your careperson should be your best friend if you
              need or meet any problems.</p>
              <p>But for my case, no. Though my results do not reflect that of a
              top student, simple because my maths wasn't good and for some
              subjects, the teachers don't like me because I like to disturb them
              in class. But my GPA is standing at more than 3.2++ and this
              semester is the best chance for me to break into the director's
              list.</p>
              <p>I don't have the study face, my classmates all very hardworking
              but only because I can use half the time they take to accomplish
              exactly what they can do.</p>
              <p>My careperson's impression of me is not very good, one of my
              friend told me that even he feels that she doesn't like me maybe
              because I'm famous for being late.</p>
              <p>You know whats the thing that makes me most angry? She blatantly
              told another classmate A that she feels that I have no talent
              whatsoever and another classmate B has more talent than me.</p>
              <p>What I feel is, it's all bullshit! Classmate B only has better
              result than me is because my maths subjects were badly done and my
              elective subs also pulled me down if not my gpa would have been
              higher than his.</p>
              <p>For this year, which is my second year. I started to grow more
              and I tell say confidently, for 70% of my projects, I was the head
              of creativity, I taught my teammates new ways to implementing codes
              as well as coming up with ideas to solve problems.</p>
              <p>All of my teammate appraised me as a very creative mind and not
              only that, my communication skills tutor told me that I am a very
              natural speaker, in my presentation and all, I am able present very
              well even said that I am a very fast thinker.</p>
              <p>Another tutor told me that, if all my classmates went for
              university interview, he would have the most confidence in me to
              pass the interview.</p>
              <p>The thing now is, why doesn't my careperson see all these? How
              am I not talented compared to Classmate B? My programming skills
              are about the same level as him though I might lose but not more
              than half an inch.</p>
              <p>My presentation skills are better than him, in the sense that I
              do not need a que card to remember what I have to say, I can even
              walk into a presentation unprepared and still present better than
              everyone else.</p>
              <p>Not only that, Classmate B is generally not willing to share
              codes with others while I like to help people.</p>
              <p>Okay that aside, for today, I submitted my assignment, sadly
              this subject's tutor is my careperson. I TELL YOU. SHE IS THE MOST
              BIASED TEACHER EVER.</p>
              <p>One group was generally filled with top students, gpa from 3.9
              to 3.3 and initially she already said that she expected that group
              to do better than everyone else.</p>
              <p>Our group only had me and another friend and a guy who is very
              weak in everything. Basically, this project was done by me and my
              friend.</p>
              <p>For the concept of the assignment, I thought of it because I
              feel that it would guarantee us an A simply because no one has ever
              done it and its a very unique idea. Then our assignment had to
              implement Artificial Intelligence, I made a very good 1 but wasn't
              given credit for it.</p>
              <p>I mean, wtf is the meaning of this? I work so hard and thought
              up of so many creative ideas, even many of my tutors recognise my
              abilities but why won't my careperson see it?</p>
              <p>And because of her biasedness against me, I will probably not do
              well for her subject even though half the assignment was done by me
              and I CAN SAY CONFIDENTLY THAT OUR ASSIGNMENT IS 10 FOLDS BETTER
              THAN EVERYONE ELSE.</p>

              <p>Agenda,</p>
              <p>I'm sorry you're getting so many negative replies, but you do seem to have a bad attitude. You fail to realise that your life in poly does depend on your peers and your teachers, to some extent. And you do admit that your maths subjects were "badly done", and that you're "famous for being late" and you like to disturb teachers in class. These are your faults.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless, I know that it sucks to have biased teachers. The fact that your careperson told your classmate that another classmate is better than you makes me very nervous. That's a horrible thing to do. I'm going to Temasek Poly this year, and that makes me apprehensive.</p>
              <p>However, if you want approval from your careperson, you have to improve your self. And even then, you may not get it. Too bad.</p>

              <p>TS, this is called suay to have such a biased teacher. That's why in university exams, you are not allowed to write your name in exams papers, only matric number so that the examiner will not be biased. I feel that even for project work and thesis, names should be omitted.</p>

              </p><p>first of all, i'd just like to tell you to be a man. dedicating such a long post to complaining about something that no one really cares about but you only proves one thing - you're too much of a wuss to do anything..</p>
              <p>i didn't read the entire thing because you lost me at the "i'm upset about my careperson.."</p>
              <p>yes, girl, keep whining. maybe your knight in shining armor will finally come and deliver you from the evil witch that is holding you captive in a tall tower..if only you'd let down your long hair. did you say you have long hair? because i can imagine you being a loser with long hair..</p>
              <p>seriously...just do something instead of pissing and moaning. the world doesn't revolve around you...</p>
