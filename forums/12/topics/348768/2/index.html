              <p>Best thing you can do now, is to well, do nothing. Wait for the next sem and then start sucking up to your careperson to change her attitude towards you. Or, quit poly.</p>

              <p>Goes to show that you have been late for quite alot of times..that brings to poor time management..Anyone, let alone teachers, do not like latecomers especially if your later arrival is going to disrupt lessons or something.

              <p>That is just WHAT YOU THINK. Everyone's opinions differ. Then again, you didn't give your teacher a good first impression. You have only yourself to blame. Quit whining and make a concerted effort in getting good grades. The fact that you repeated shows that you didn't get good grades. If you are as good as you claim(which i seriously doubt), you wouldn't have repeated.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I were a repeat student all the more I would make multiple attempts in changing a(or any for that matter) teacher's mindset towards me. I wouldn't care how long it takes to change their mindsets(even if I never will), I will still take all the "abuse" and strive to do the best I can without causing troube. You apparently, DO NOT. You are a problem student. Change your horrendous attitude.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I really wonder whether you have any friends in your class. You must be such a loner. Which kind of person besides a loner blasts his coursemates and teachers on the internet?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You know what? TOO BAD! You brought this onto yourself. What a loser. You created this mess(in school and on this forum thread) and it is just too bad that you will bear the brunt of your stupidity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Expect no sympathy from us and your coursemates and your teachers. In fact I feel sorry that your coursemates and your teachers have to endure such a TARDED student with multiple social disorders. Go see a shrink. Oh wait, don't torture him/her. Anyway with the mindset of yours any shrink would turn you away. Don't waste time. Why don't you just dig a hole in the ground and bury yourself in it? Then finally you can live in your own deluded sense of reality and your own fantasy world.</p>

              <p>In secondary education, we know them as Form Teachers, but in
                  Temasek Poly, We know them as Careperson and our class as our
                  caregroup.</p>
              <p>I'm very upset about my careperson. You see, My class is very
                  competitive and mainly my course does alot of coding and I can say
                  very proudly that I am able to grasp it better than most people. In
                  year 1, I wasn't paying attention in class during programming
                  lessons, why? Simply because the pace was too slow for me and I was
                  always 1 question ahead.</p>
              <p>So, in poly, your careperson should be your best friend if you
                  need or meet any problems.</p>
              <p>But for my case, no. Though my results do not reflect that of a
                  top student, simple because my maths wasn't good and for some
                  subjects, the teachers don't like me because I like to disturb them
                  in class. But my GPA is standing at more than 3.2++ and this
                  semester is the best chance for me to break into the director's
                  list.</p>
              <p>I don't have the study face, my classmates all very hardworking
                  but only because I can use half the time they take to accomplish
                  exactly what they can do.</p>
              <p>My careperson's impression of me is not very good, one of my
                  friend told me that even he feels that she doesn't like me maybe
                  because I'm famous for being late.</p>
              <p>You know whats the thing that makes me most angry? She blatantly
                  told another classmate A that she feels that I have no talent
                  whatsoever and another classmate B has more talent than me.</p>
              <p>What I feel is, it's all bullshit! Classmate B only has better
                  result than me is because my maths subjects were badly done and my
                  elective subs also pulled me down if not my gpa would have been
                  higher than his.</p>
              <p>For this year, which is my second year. I started to grow more
                  and I tell say confidently, for 70% of my projects, I was the head
                  of creativity, I taught my teammates new ways to implementing codes
                  as well as coming up with ideas to solve problems.</p>
              <p>All of my teammate appraised me as a very creative mind and not
                  only that, my communication skills tutor told me that I am a very
                  natural speaker, in my presentation and all, I am able present very
                  well even said that I am a very fast thinker.</p>
              <p>Another tutor told me that, if all my classmates went for
                  university interview, he would have the most confidence in me to
                  pass the interview.</p>
              <p>The thing now is, why doesn't my careperson see all these? How
                  am I not talented compared to Classmate B? My programming skills
                  are about the same level as him though I might lose but not more
                  than half an inch.</p>
              <p>My presentation skills are better than him, in the sense that I
                  do not need a que card to remember what I have to say, I can even
                  walk into a presentation unprepared and still present better than
                  everyone else.</p>
              <p>Not only that, Classmate B is generally not willing to share
                  codes with others while I like to help people.</p>
              <p>Okay that aside, for today, I submitted my assignment, sadly
                  this subject's tutor is my careperson. I TELL YOU. SHE IS THE MOST
                  BIASED TEACHER EVER.</p>
              <p>One group was generally filled with top students, gpa from 3.9
                  to 3.3 and initially she already said that she expected that group
                  to do better than everyone else.</p>
              <p>Our group only had me and another friend and a guy who is very
                  weak in everything. Basically, this project was done by me and my
                  friend.</p>
              <p>For the concept of the assignment, I thought of it because I
                  feel that it would guarantee us an A simply because no one has ever
                  done it and its a very unique idea. Then our assignment had to
                  implement Artificial Intelligence, I made a very good 1 but wasn't
                  given credit for it.</p>
              <p>I mean, wtf is the meaning of this? I work so hard and thought
                  up of so many creative ideas, even many of my tutors recognise my
                  abilities but why won't my careperson see it?</p>
              <p>And because of her biasedness against me, I will probably not do
                  well for her subject even though half the assignment was done by me
                  and I CAN SAY CONFIDENTLY THAT OUR ASSIGNMENT IS 10 FOLDS BETTER
                  THAN EVERYONE ELSE.</p>

              <p>Every one(including the teachers) are human and show biasness to a certain extent. That cannot be helped.</p>

              <p>However setting up a thread to blast his/her peers and teachers is absolutely out of place. Who does he think he/she is?! At the end of the day his scores are given by his/her teachers.</p>
