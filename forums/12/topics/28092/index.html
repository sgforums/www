U know it but we r constantly making this same mistake to find the ONE perfect person. The ONE may not exist at all...do w u wanna take the chance? Imagine a Lifetime to search for a Perfect person? A saint?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Maybe not. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  I din look at ur profile, aint quite sure abt ur age....r u young? ur BF? Nah...anyway...it doesnt matter. One can be uncertain in Life, no matter how old u may be....juz tt age is the "measurement" eveyone uses to gauge how mature a person is. It may not be true but pple out there who may wanna see it this way still exist. A lot i promise <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> They may be ur family members.<br><br>If u r thinking of patching back with him, u need to find out wat's it abt him ur family members dun like, let he feel welcome. It may jolly well be this reason he's leaving u?!? If not, if he's meant to be urs, he'd be urs in the end. Dun u agree? Some pple juz live their whole Life in the hope of meeting tt Perfect ONE but <span style="font-style: italic;">Fate plays a Fool outta Man</span>, they may end up with juz the most "normal" person or even like ur case...used to be someone u broke off with. Nobody knows. But one thing for sure, if the timing isnt rite, u cant force ath to be Rite. It may get worse..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> <span style="color: darkblue;">See it this way, juz like in "Sassy Girl" They may be apart for yrs...during this time, they can have many chance in meeting better ONES but they din coz Love still exists, it din die out..... In the end, they met each other. Since Love was btwn them both, Love grew again. The attitudes/maturity/thinkings may improve for the better as well.....hahahaha <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> Wanna be the Sassy Girl? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </span><br><br><strong> <span style="color: red;">"There's no Perfect one to love but the One u love to be perfected</span>" </strong></div>
