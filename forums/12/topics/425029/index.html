              <p>Mmm.. sounds familiar... haha</p>
              <p> I have talked with a senior colleague before on this and he told me that his mum do this to them because his mum is a housewife and serve her dad when they are young and did all the housework alone. Now with her husband pass away, sons and kids all married or moved away, they feel very lonely and useless. She thinks that she can feel more useful by feeding their child, caring for them, serve them even tot they dont need it.</p>
              <p>You can say they can get a life themselves. Yes, perhaps, if they are healthy enough or they have accompany. Sometimes it just not as easy as you think to mix around when you are old. You might have illness that prevent u from moving around normally and the life outside is much much different. She might not be ready, or even think about making new friends by the time she is now...She might be sacred especially when their loves one is leaving one by one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The above might not apply to your case now, but think about it. It makes me pity for those housewife  when i heard it. Hope u treasure your mum and bear with her sometimes. Cheers :)</p>

              <p>The only problem is, she is very lonely. No love from her husband, no love from her own child.</p>
              <p>Show her a little bit of love occasionally, so she don't have to work so hard to earn some love from you.</p>
              <p>Every mother is afraid of losing the love of her own children.. instead of giving her reassurance through your action... you are showing your disgust .</p>
              <p>Once a while bring her out for lunch or dinner. Give her a little update when you can.... She will ease up eventually.</p>

              <p>You all need to understand the TS's suffering also lah... guys being guys, they don't like being nagged at or under "police" monitoring 24/7...</p>
              <p>My advice is very simple, take a chance to talk to your mum to say that what she's doing is not something you like. Because it invades your privacy and gives you the feeling that she cannot trust you. Ask for her to be understanding because what she is doing is making your life miserable as you cherish privacy alot.</p>
              <p>Because if you don't talk to her, and nobody else would, the problem will persist, so i think the best you talk to her directly maybe she think differently. Maybe she think that her actions is to make you feel protected and happy but in this case, your thinking may be different from what she perceived.</p>

              <p>Similar to what happened to me. Firstly, you have to move away the mindset of being control and keep your temper cool at all time, afterall she is your Mum. Secondly, you have to have a little bit of charge to show. Like taking the initiative to buy foods home to please your parent. Slowing you would understand the bond of family values.</p>
              <p>Even better, extend that to your friends and this may make a better place on Earth.</p>
