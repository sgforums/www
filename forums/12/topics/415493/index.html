              <p>With these grades, frankly speaking, you're extremely lucky that they even give you the option of retaining. They can just kick you out with no questions asked.</p>
              <p>There's no perfectly correct or wrong answer here. It all boils down to this: if you retain, can you promise to work harder and buck up on your studies?</p>
              <p>If the answer is 100% yes, then by all means ask to be retained. Work harder next year. In fact, use the December holidays to revise your Yr 1 lessons.</p>
              <p>If the answer is less than 100%, then please leave your JC. Even so, should you go to poly, then please promise yourself that you will work hard there.</p>

              <p>Agree with you. <br><br>With so many Us, i dun think its at all appropriate to waste more years in JC. JC guys need a couple of Bs to get in to local unis with A level cert these days. Probably will get all Cs in the end and make a big u-turn back to poly if he continues to be in JC.</p>

              <p>Do another year. I'm also a year 1 student like you and I must admit that sometimes I do play a lot. But I always make it a point to do my assignments and revise, though I feel guilty for being too ill-disciplined sometimes. There are days when I spent the entire day playing in the early part of my JC life but I have to struggle to do my work till midnight and it sucks. My mid-year was sucky so I decided to put in more effort for my promos and managed to get some Bs and Cs. I did consider taking the poly route around June and like you, I was confused over whether I was the JC type or not. (I knew I played too much occasionally and I somehow feel if I stopped, I should be able to make it)</p>
              <p>It seems you are in the same dilemma as me. I am a Science student (PCMH is my combi) but I always score excellent for my History (around 96% percentile) and my PCM isn't bad but not top of the notch. But trust me, science subs are manageable if you look at the questions and understand them. Arts subjects are more subjective and even though I do think if I had taken the Arts stream, I will do better, I do have my reservations about scoring well ALL the time.</p>
              <p>At least, if you study and understand the science subs, you wouldn't score too bad (maybe just scrape thru' if it's a tough paper, but hey, you will still pass if u study).</p>
              <p>All the best!</p>

              <p>I just found that that i need to retain one more year for
              JC.Now i am troubled on whether if i should retain or go poly.</p>
              <p>The reason for me retaining is most probably due to me playing
              too much.For the first half of the year, i focused on being a good
              archery quarter master.However,during the june holidays, i decided
              to devote my all on studying.At that time, i always study with my
              ex archery captain,who was two years my senior.</p>
              <p>Results for mid year:</p>
              <p>Chem U 30/100</p>
              <p>phy C 55/100</p>
              <p>math S 44/100</p>
              <p>geo S 44/100</p>
              <p>Gp D 50/100</p>
              <p>However after the june hoildays , my captaina nd i became a
              couple.Most probably due to the affection that took place during
              the hoildays.During this period, i didnt reallt focus on studying
              for around 1 month.</p>
              <p>During the second month , something happened to our relationship
              and we broke up 1 week before the Promos.</p>
              <p>In the end i got this for my promo</p>
              <p>Gp E</p>
              <p>Math U</p>
              <p>Phy U</p>
              <p>chem U</p>
              <p>geo D</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know that it is obvious that i retain largely due to this
              problem.But because i had never tried my best in JC before, now i
              dont know if i am the JC type.I fear that even after i give my
              best,i will till end up with sucky grades.</p>

              <p>Poly life is slower, but not truly easier than JC life.</p>
              <p>Indeed, a poly dip holds more weight than an A-lvl cert in general, but it is not truly that much better, if you cannot get into a uni.</p>
              <p>To be honest, remaining in JC or switching to poly will not make you regret. It is not doing enough to make a turnabout from your current situation that will be sure to make you regret.</p>
              <p>If you want to remain in JC, you will have to accept by now that you will have to put in a lot of effort and have adequate discipline. From your one year experience, you should know what is expected of you.</p>
              <p>If you want to switch to poly, you will need to know what degree courses you will want to take up when you enter uni. It will be pointless for you to take up a diploma course which you have no interest in, or does not lead to the degree course which you want to take up.</p>
              <p>If you think poly is slackier, than you are greatly mistaken. A lot of people do not have adequate discipline in poly, and stray off, due to the many temptations and less pressure in poly life. As a result, they do not do well for their diploma. In poly, you will have to self-discipline, as there is less peer pressure in most (but not all) faculties as compared to in JC.</p>
              <p>Summing it up, here are the questions you should ask yourself:</p>
              <p>1) Can I instill discipline in myself if I were to continue my studies in JC?</p>
              <p>2) What degree course do I wish to take up?</p>
              <p>3) If I were to continue in JC, what should I do and what should I NOT do?</p>
