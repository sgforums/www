            <div class='col-md body'>BECKHAMS IN CRISIS<br><br>'I did sleep with Becks'<br><br>Smile ... Rebecca and Becks on night out<br>Pictures: BIG<br><br>From MICHAEL LEA in Madrid<br><br>DAVID BeckhamÂ’s former personal assistant told yesterday how she bedded the England skipper Â— in a bombshell phone call to her brother.<br><br>In her dramatic heart-to-heart with goatee-bearded John, Rebecca Loos confided to him for the first time that she HAD shared a fling with Becks.<br><br>The emotional brunette broke down in tears over the line as she blurted out: Â“I had an affair with David.Â”<br><br>Rebecca, 26, had kept the alleged liaisons secret from her family Â— but spoke out after explosive evidence emerged about her relationship with the star.<br><br>John, 28, hinted his sister was left heartbroken after her friendship with Becks crumbled when she was axed as the Real Madrid starÂ’s aide.<br><br>John said at the four-bedroom house he shares with Rebecca and their parents in a posh Madrid suburb: Â“She was very upset when she parted company with David and Victoria last year.<br><br>Â“She became very down and she cried a lot. At times she looked heartbroken.<br><br>Â“I thought it was because of professional reasons Â— but IÂ’m now beginning to understand that there must have been more to it than that.Â”<br><br>John added: Â“IÂ’d no idea Beckham was cheating on Victoria with my sister. I am overwhelmed with shock. My parents knew nothing of this. I would have known if they had.<br><br>Close ... she listens to the hatted star<br><br>Â“The first I knew something was up was when Rebecca rang home early this morning and woke me up to warn me.<br><br>Â“At first, she wouldnÂ’t tell me anything and she wouldnÂ’t tell me where she was, either. All she said was she was abroad with a friend.<br><br>Â“But I have spoken to her since and she has confirmed that she had an affair with David. She hasnÂ’t gone into details about the relationship.Â”<br><br>He added: Â“If there are text messages between the two of them, I donÂ’t see how she could really deny an affair took place.Â”<br><br>Rebecca is known among MadridÂ’s elite upper classes as a pretty, intelligent and likeable young woman.<br><br>She is renowned as a supreme organiser and excellent communicator, speaking several European languages.<br><br>As a youngster she harboured dreams of a modelling career and had a portfolio of professional photographs taken.<br><br>But instead she opted for the business world Â— first in banking and then in PR. BeckhamÂ’s sports management firm SFX head-hunted her to help him settle in Spain after the 28-year-old starÂ’s Â£25million switch to Real Madrid.<br><br>Rumours of an affair first surfaced last September when the pair were spotted enjoying nights out in Madrid.<br><br>Multi-lingual Rebecca was hired as an interpreter and PA. But their relationship is said to have switched from professional to personal as lonely Becks increasingly relied on her for company.<br><br>They were seen last year laughing and chatting intimately as they partied shoulder-to-shoulder in the early hours at MadridÂ’s ultra-trendy club Ananda.<br><br>At the time reports were already surfacing that BecksÂ’ marriage to wife Victoria, 29, was in trouble.<br><br>High metal security fences surround RebeccaÂ’s home, leaving callers to use a video entry-phone intercom.<br><br>Relaxed ... happy Rebecca chats away<br><br>A large terrace covered by an awning can be seen from the roadside. Outside is a fleet of cars, including a vintage Jaguar XJ40, a four-wheel drive Honda and a classic Mini.<br><br>Speaking at the gate of the luxury house yesterday, John said: Â“RebeccaÂ’s a very pretty and intelligent girl. Lots of people say so and I suppose David has seen that as well. I can well imagine heÂ’s going to get a bad Press now and my sister may be branded a marriage-wrecker.<br><br>Â“She for one knows her life is never going to be the same again after this. But she has insisted to me she is not the person who exposed the affair. She says she feels betrayed and hurt herself by whatÂ’s in the papers. She has denied totally co-operating in any way.Â”<br><br>Told that Beckham was denying an affair with Rebecca, John replied bitterly: Â“That doesnÂ’t surprise me.Â”<br><br>And he added: Â“RebeccaÂ’s made no mention of an apology for Victoria or the children. At the moment she is far too upset. She is distraught.Â”<br><br>Oh brother ... John tells all<br><br>John and RebeccaÂ’s parents are away in Australia. Last night one neighbour said: Â“She is a lovely girl and IÂ’m not surprised Beckham found her attractive.Â”<br><br>At around the time of the alleged fling Â— last September Â— Rebecca and Beckham were pictured smiling and chatting during a night out with pals.<br><br>Rebecca was also seen with Posh on September 13 as the singer held son Romeo during a Real Madrid game. The day before, Rebecca and Posh went shopping in Madrid.<br><br>Another time, Rebecca was at the Bernabeu stadium Â— this time with four-year-old Brooklyn Beckham, to see David score in Real's 3-0 win over Mallorca. Victoria was working in New York.<br><br></div>

Please leave me alone."<br><br><span style="color: red;">However The Sun today alleged Loos confessed to her brother John she had been Beckham's lover during a telephone conversation.<br><br>"I have spoken to her ... and she has confirmed that she had an affair with David. She hasnÂ’t gone into details about the relationship", the newspaper reported John as saying. </span><br><br>Beckham moved to Spain last year after joining Real Madrid but his pop star wife and two young sons, Brooklyn and Romeo, have not yet relocated to the Spanish capital, spending most of their time at the celebrity couple's mansion in Hertfordshire, England.<br><br>Posh,29, is thought to believe she has a better chance of reviving her flagging musical career in the UK than Spain. Although she and her husband often travel to be together, their long periods of separation have fuelled speculation their marriage could be on the rocks.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">As the News of The World scandal broke Posh jetted off for an Easter holiday in Switzerland with her parents, brother and sons reportedly clashing with paparazzi at LondonÂ’s Heathrow airport.<br><br>Beckham, who has a couple of days off, is expected to fly out to join them.<br><br>It is not yet known whether the couple will take legal action against the News of the World.</span><br>NEWS.com.au with AFP<br><br></div>
