Firstly, find out whats wrong in your r/s.. what has changed the laughter and the enjoyment, the companion, the communication and everything... Secondly, you are so down and feel emptiness in you that this girl B appears in time.. to let you have the feeling like what you had for your gf, A, when you first started dating.. Are you sure that you realli like her?? oR jus out to get a companion be cos of the r/s you are in now that causes it??<br><br>You are in dilemma? I jus feel that you dunno what you wan! Indecisive!! Inferior!! Insecurity!!! If you end with girl A becos of girl B who can give you more fun and enjoyment in the r/s then go ahead.. Well.. i bet this will happen again with girl B if the flame dies down in her n you.. No communications.. no feelings.. no chemistry.. the cycle will go on and on.. from one girl to another..<br><br>Talk to girl A about the r/s.. discuss on what's the problem.. what's the cause of all these.. must resolve even if yo planned not to be with her.. at least.. you wanna "sentenced her to death" at least.. you give both you and herself.. a good explanation or reasons.. for this! And still can be friends..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Keep your options open. Wait for one of them to ask you to commit. If none of them asks your committment, you are still in the green zone which is good. GIrls do it too.</div>
