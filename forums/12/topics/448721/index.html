              <p>
              </p><p>ok, I've met this girl through some friends. We kind of hit it off the 1st time we've met but there was no contact for a few months. After that we kind met up more often through group outings for 2 weeks and everytime the both of us would branch out from the group and have supper or dinner with just the 2 of us. During these 2 weeks, we text each other often and become closer &amp; naturally my affections grew for her.</p>
              <p>On one fateful night, after our group outing, i send her back and i decided to confess to her cause I really liked her and she's everything i look for. She rejected me saying that we need to be friends 1st and know each other better.</p>
              <p>I took it seriously that she really wanna know me better 1st, thus decided to be just friends with her. </p>
              <p>During the next few weeks, I text her around 2-3 days frequency and called her once or twice. Her replies didn't seem to be avoiding me at all and were pretty positive. Thus i really believe that this girl really just want to see how things goes, however, i've tried asking her out for a few times as a friend and many times she just said she's not available.</p>
              <p>I was very confused and decided to ask her whether she has something to say and eventually she told me that she was very scared when i confessed to her cause to her, we barely met each other and that i'm like a normal friend to her and she hope it stays this way. That blew my mind cause at 1st, she said it was fine and that we should hang out and know each other better, now she's saying that it's not fine and she doesn't want to go out with me anymore. She even said to some pple that i couldn't face the rejection and have became persistent but i know it's wrong cause i became friendly cause of the way she reacted.</p>
              <p>I've stopped contacting her ever since and she didn't contact me too. Unfortunately, we did bump into each other 2 times. She came up to say "Hi" 1st and i tried to initiate a conversation but I could feel that it's never the same again. What makes it worse is that she was with a guy on the 2nd time and I jolly well know that the guy is interested in her as this guy went through a bad patch recently and needed a rebound. </p>
              <p>Ever since this incident, i was very depressed and my life changed. I couldn't eat or sleep well, my work is also affected.</p>
              <p>I really don't know what to do. on 1 hand, i wish to move on as i really don't wanna be in this state anymore but on the other, i want this friendship to work out and as much as i try to forget her, she still holds an impt part in my heart. I don't know how to start again as it's been so long I've contacted her and i'm not really sure if she's still scared of me.</p>

              <p>Yr heart should hv more than 1 gal, and that include your

              <p>The hurt is your self inflicted hurt, nobody is hurting you,
              stop hallucinating and keep to the real world.</p>

              <p>ok, let me rephrase that.</p>
              <p>you are ready that the hurt is self-infliceted but what i meant to say is that it came from her actions. it might be on purpose or not but still, it came from her.</p>
              <p>in regards to the place in my heart, of cus i dnt mean it in a general term lah. i'm talking abt the romance part. in general of cus got other gals lah, my niece is  the other one, hehehe, always brings a smile to my face when i think of her :)</p>

              <p>my gosh, stop calling me lame because i'm not at all.</p>
              <p>I'm just inexperience in this because I've nvr felt so strongly abt a lady and got my heart so broken b4.</p>
              <p>it isn't a blessing in disgue and she didn't turn me off completely, tht's y i'm so dam upset as her actions made it worse.</p>
              <p>she shldn't have continued to flirt, be friendly with me and even wanted to go out if she didn't meant that at all after she rejected me. </p>
              <p>I really would have rather did what u said, by acting in a way to make me forget abt her once and for all.</p>
