Working in a pub?  If I guessed it right, then I think it's not a suitable working environment for you.  The pay may be good, but the environment might be too messy for an innocent and vulnerable girl like you.<br><br>I do know of a few companies that hire part-timers, in particular, students to work for them after school.. example, Levi's, Popular, Minitoons, ice cream stores etc.. they are really flexible de.. I was going to suggest tuition too.. but having one very bad experience before.. I wouldn't encourage you to go for that.. coz many agencies make the tutors lie in order to get an assignment.. it's something against my principles.. and I believe you won't do it either.<br><br>Be careful girl.. you may be desperate to earn back the money that assho|e cheated from you.. but watch out, dun take up a kind of job that will not help you solve your problem, but make things worse and hurt yourself instead.  Some companies try to trick students by telling them they have to pay a certain start up amount first before they get any assignment etc.. never believe this kinda crap.  </span></div>
