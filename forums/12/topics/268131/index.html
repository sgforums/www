            <div class='col-md body'>Since you said he's a a-hole I doubt he will pay up. I used to lend a lot of money to friends and bunk mates, some of them paid me back while some didn't. I don't mind then because I'm not in need of money at that point of time but things changed in my family and now I'm not getting allowance from my parents. With that little bit of NSF pay I'm actually facing a problem now. HP and INTERNET bills is stacking in my drawer, my insurance and installments of my PC I hardly got any money left when it comes to end of the month.<br><br>I sms/call my friends who owe me money and none of them reply and if any, they also give lot of excuses. I can tell you it's easier to borrow money from friends than asking them to pay.<br><br>Maybe your dad is right, "Ren bu wei ji, tian zu di mie" when it comes to helping people do think twice as some people are not worth helping.<br><br>Well no matter what, please be strong and think of the bright side of life. You're young and you got a promising future, be glad that the jerk is now gone at least you've seen through him, it's not a bad thing afterall.</div>

There may be plenty of greedy and materialistic people in this world... makes me think of that singaporean girl who asks me about 5Cs and then when I tell her that I am not working, she says oh you must be rich, dun have to work, then I said no I am very broke and she started pouring insults and in the end stop talking to me, lol... That kinda open my eyes about them huh, it says alot about them. Come on if someone is broke, they work, if someone dun work, then they need to have money, so I don't understand why people believe that anyone can be broke and not work at the same time, it's logic right, i might be wrong anywayz, and the funny thing is how a simple test like this totally reveal people ugly faces. It's funny how easy to test people out you know, some people couldn't even pass the first test, so these people shouldn't belong in your life dude, they dun deserve you man, they are not true friends, get over it. I'm just saying that yeah there are materialistic and money faced people all around, but dun let those dikheds cause you misery huh, coz despite the dikheds there are still nice people around, and you're still young I guess, money is rather hard to come by, but I think that once you get pass the down periods of life, you will get a taste of the up periods of life later on, I just hope when those times come to you, you won't grow arrogant and become another pretentious person. Just dun need to get bothered with those pretentious rich people wannabe huh, yesterday I was at Orchard and 2 young guys keep boasting and talking big and then I realize they are probably working part time at $5/hour jobs. All the boasting here and there, I was thinking in my heart, wtf you guys dun have to be so fake man, or was it my girlfriend who is sitting beside me that you guys are trying to impress, i know my girlfriend's hot but you guys dun have to be so fake man. I just tot u don't have to pretend or talk big to be another person, it's your life, keep it real man. There's too many fake people around, dun join the crowds. It's ok to be broke, just understand that it's only a temporary situation, you're NOT alone and things will get better ahead.</div>

Even siblings can be chao kuan.<br><br>For your relationship with ur dad, it's great you don't think like him. After all,  you have enough education in you to know that being mean doesn't lead to happiness.  Try to view everything in a compassionate light, and try to protect yourself from the resentment of people around you.<br><br>Friends who demand money from others (for whatever reason) are childish at best. It's neither rude nor uncaring not to contribute (whether for charity or for friends' presents), it simply means that you have ur own priorities. Taking care of yourself is not selfish. (Selfishness simply means not considering other peoples' wellbeing in your own actions.)<br><br>Above all, you need to protect and serve yourself before doing the same for other people.<br><br>Likes others said, studies is an investment towards better living.<br><br>More importantly, your attitude in your life makes a difference. Let the bitterness go.<br><br>If you cease being bitter, and stick to your principles, you will find a shining light wherever you go.<br><br>Good luck!</div>
