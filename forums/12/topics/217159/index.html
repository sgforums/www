Don't get me wrong. There are rare cases though.<br><br>If a girl likes you, she makes it easy for you to touch her heart.<br><br>If you put in effort to try create chemistry even though inside you are hoping she will accept you, it's going to be a mistake. You are going to miss a lot of fun meeting other girls. Plus, if she did not like you to begin with, you are simply wasting your time. In time to come, you will find that it's better to put effort to someone who does respond to your efforts.<br><br>doko</div>

I'm not saying you can't treat this other gal nicely or even in a special way, but you have to make sure that this other gal know that you are only treating her as a platonic friend (close, but still platonic). And you must help your gf understand the why you are treating this other gal so specially. help her trust you.<br><br>I really hope you handle this situation carefully, and not HURT these two gals.</div>

If there is no chemistry, guess you could go ahead to do whatever you said.  But after a reasonable time the person still has no acceptance, then I think you better move on.  YOu can't force love out of anyone.</div>

You have to consider your own fellings for that person. Are u willing to just forget about that person?Are u lying to ourself by saying u have no more feelings and have moved on?Sometimes its just not so easy.I know of someone who is literally clinging on. This i agree that he should just forget and move on,but if you look at it form a different prespective,its really not his fault,she has really made an impact on his life which he jus canot forget.This type of thing I don feel that there is such things as worth it or not.Just follow your heart and listen to your feelings and ask yourself "Is this what you want".</div>
