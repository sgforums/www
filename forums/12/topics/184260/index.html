Have him / her refer you to the school counsellor or a psychiatrist... Personally, I feel that there's a need for your parents to worry about you at this point... They're your immediate family members and adults... It'll be easier if they know about it and hence can help you cope with things... I think it'll be quite unfair to keep them from things... Not letting them worry about you now doesn't mean that they won't have to worry about you in the future... You're a part of the family, they should be working your life out together with you if they can offer to...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Talk to your parents (especially your mum?)... Let the closer members to you know as much about it as possible... If you can let us know, why not let them know too..? Besides, it's a good time to communicate with them now...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Solve everything together as a family. Take this time to improve family bonding. You can talk to school councellors first though. Other things you can try out include keeping a diary, drawing and reading. Use these to distract you, as well as pour out your feelings. If you have a soft toy, it would be nice if you talk to it. No doubt like talking to a wall, but at least, you say out what's bothering you and you will feel better.</div>
