You can be colleagues, that's about it. Because if both her and your ricebowl are at stake and if you go and she won't, she is very likely to want you to break your bowl rather than hers.<br><br>Each man for himself.<br><br>Live strong!</div>

They come and go in our lives -- we can't stop them. Blessed is the person who could find one friend for life. As friendships fade and die off, though an explanation would be in order, there are times when it really is not necessary. And sometimes, laying the reasons out in the open may just aggravate the hurt on both sides, so some people just choose to let nature take its own course. When that happens, move on and open your heart to let other friends enter.<br><br>Don't take it personally, but you really ought to change your nick. Misery attracts misery.</div>
