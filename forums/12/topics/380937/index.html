            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>there was a girl whom i loved deeply with all my heart.  my love and care for her was genuine.  i wld be there for her.  almost every night i wld be by her side, when she's alone in another land.  she was going through tough times, and i tried my best to be with her.  to keep her company, to hold her hand and tell her everything wld be ok, to have faith and keep going.  </span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>most of the time, she wasn't with me though physically i was with her.  she was wrestling with her past, with herself.  sometimes i provided the calm amidst the storm, other times i stirred up a bigger storm.  </span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>i felt side-tracked most of the time.  my motivation to be with her dwindled by the day.  occasionally when her attention was brought back to the present and she was reminded of and acknowledged my existence, i felt happy yet sad.  i wanted to leave many times, but somehow every time i decided to leave, i would see or hear something to remind me of her, which made me feel compelled to turn back to her once more.  hence our story extends episode after episode.  every time you thought it's the end, something would spring up, leaving the story 'to be continued'.</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>like her, i asked myself where is this going ?  the flame dims and relives...  so many obstacles seem to pop up all the time to try and extinguish this fragile flame.  </span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>i feel tired, so does she.  what to do ?  she asked if i would be hers.  i hesitated, not because i didn't love her, but because the past hurts made me disheartened.  </span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>to be in a committed relationship, besides love, trust is crucial.  recent happenings have caused me to lose the trust in her.  i'm so deeply hurt by a recent incident and discovery, that i can't feel love for her anymore.  overnight, i feel that this is a stranger i'm waking up to.  who is she ?  why is she telling me one thing, but doing something else behind my back ? was she lying to me all this while ?  why was she so selfish to keep me like that ?  many questions flooded my mind.  the recent incident is traumatic.  i was shocked to discover the truth.  the heart which once flowed with love for her is blocked.  i don't know what / how to speak to her.  she says i've turned cold to her suddenly.  i can't help it.  i don't recognise the face of one whom i once loved dearly.</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>one major obstacle is her past, which came back time and again to haunt her and sabotage us.  this is one area which she couldn't give me firm assurance.  if she hated her past so much, why is she engaging it ?  what is she trying to tell me by her actions ?  does she even have any respect for me ? where does her heart lie ?  why was she part of the hurt that the past caused me ?  why did she allow me to be hurt, if she indeed loves me as she claimed ?  why didn't she do more to protect me from being hurt ?  what does she take me for ?</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>sometimes, when we do things, we have to think what is the impression we are giving others by our actions.  what is the impact of our actions.  actions do speak louder than words.  </span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>i hate to be lied to.  i really hate it.  </span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>
              </span></p><p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>don't try to manipulate or influence me with pretty words.  i don't buy it.  show me with your actions that you really mean it.  </span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>i feel betrayed.  i have lost trust in her.</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>initially i returned to say yes to her.  unfortunately i discovered a grisly truth.  it's traumatic.  my heart is blocked.  i can't feel anything now.  i can't recall how she's like, how we used to be together, the love we once had for each other.  i can't feel or recall any of that associated with her</span></p>
              <p><span style='color: black; font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>the stuff that i see going back n forth between her and her past is too disgusting for me to bear.  their faces are ugly, and yet their mouths sprout love.  it's a defilement of something sacred.  </span></p>

              <p style="margin-left: 72pt;"><span lang="EN-US"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">do you know that when you were engaging the past whether in frolic or whatever, you were hurting the one watching silently nearby - the one whom you claim to love.  why allow the past to obstruct and distract you from the present - this is something i failed to understand.  if it's water under the bridge, why engage with it ?</span></span></p>
