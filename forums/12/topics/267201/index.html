When u feel like commiting suicide, always tell yourself that suicide=bring hurt to love ones, which many of us does not want.</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">I cannot define ur feeling of mental stress, but you can calm yourself by telling yourself <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  everyone encountors mental stress, because of work and other things, try to make yourself feel part of 'enjoying' the stress with others. Try telling your friends u are stress, they will tell you the same thing, that is where you might think that he/she is not telling the truth, so try not to tell everyone about stress, becos, he/she might not believe you.</span><br><br><span style="color: violet;">Pain...Physically or Psychologically?<br>Physically i cannot do much, psychologically, you need to look on the bright side, maybe try telling yourself that if this happens, you can be better at certain things</span><br><br><span style="color: orange;">Tip: Use that someone as a good form of motivation for you to do better in life</span><br><span style="color: darkred;">YOU CAN TELL US, Aunt Agony@sgForums</span><br><br>Hope you gain something from this,i also believe that other forumnites would be able to assist you better.<br><br>EDIT: I am not a veri good at giving advice, if you feel that these advice does not suit your need, please do not follow, Should you experience crisis that requires professional attention, please call any of the hotline available <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=238593" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</div>

It's not a really happy society around us isn't it?<br><br>To resolve your dilemma, I would recommend you to have a change of your environment even just for a while. You might want to consider going on a holiday to travel to another environment for a few days. Best is to join a tour group and at least you will meet new company for your holiday journey.<br><br>IF the money is a problem, then the cheapest way to get out of it all is to Sleep, sleep and SLEEP it all away. Reason for sleeping is because dreams does have a healing effect on our emotions...and that is also another form of changing your environment for the time being.<br><br>Good Luck and hope that you will at least feel better for your own sake. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

Don't stop here carry on reading, this is not meant to be a flaming session....<br><br>First, u say the only reason u are still living in this wretched world is because u will like to chase someone... when i was reading this I was like LOL LOL.... u know what dude, there are a lot of emotion turmoils in r/s. Since u cannot even handle ur negative emotions in ur normal life, what makes u think that u can handle the vast complexity of the love ocean? I AM NOT TELLING U TO END UR LIFE.... pls carry on... this is my story...<br><br>When i first embarked into a r/s, i am very hopeful and confident that i will get the girl -- I am a very proud person and wants to win everything in life at that time.... but then i was rejected  by her. At that time, i hit the rock bottom of my life cos i am being defeated miserably first time... i want to commit suicide too....<br><br>HOWEVER, if i committed suicide that time, u won't see me here writing to u. That time, i am asking myself, what if i committed suicide, what are the complications? Such act of mine will solve my problem.. ya it will... but then how about my family, my friends, my relative... ur death serve no purpose to the world but it serve utmost importance to ur family, especially ur parents.. if u do have kids ... will u want them to commit suicide?<br><br>Be it u come from a broken family and/or have bad PR skills (i don't know ur background, i am quoting the worst possible scenario that u could be in), what matters most now is whether u want to change ur future... not looking back at ur past...<br><br>If u really like the girl, pls for god sake overcome ur emotion problem... no girl will want to have a depressed and pessimistic guy.. for the sake of her, pls change ur mentality, u want to be with her and u will change urself for her....<br><br>Ok after saying so much, <strong>IF</strong> u are just an attention seeker, i will like to give u a BIG F@CK U... waste my time<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps you need a quiet environment to sit down and think through all you have done, to organise and clean up your internal mess. Only when you can calmly face the past can you attempt the present.<br><br>Nothing is perfect in this world; there are bound to be failures. Either you get laid back by failures forever, or you bounce back from them. With each failure, you grow. The trials of life are not thrown to you without any reason.<br><br>What is keeping you in a sane mentality is a glimmer of hope, the hope that you can get someone to love you. What worries me is what if this hope bubble gets burst... What will you do? I'm not being pessimistic, but I think you should bring yourself up together before you can share your life with others; do you want to share/throw your mental burden to someone you love? To me, your hope is your goal. Why don't you set more goals in life than just in chasing someone? Surely there are many things in life for you to aim for.<br><br>Suicide is definitely never a solution. It just brings about more problems that you may never know... Life is so short, why must you end it shorter.<br><br>Regards,<br>eagle<br><br>Advertisement:<br>Tests are small matter: Come to Homework Forum to clear your doubts before your tests.</div>

You can suddenly feel all suicidal for a random moment, right?<br><br>The fact that you're still alive now has shown that you're still strong enough. We're all usually stronger than we think we are.<br><br>Do you have any friends you can talk to? Any good friends, and when I say good, I mean the type that will not say "Aiya, don't be so sad lah." or "Why so stupid? Got so many girls out there!", I mean the kind who will share your pain and really find a way to help you. If you do, go to them. You're not a burden; you're a friend who's worth saving to them.<br><br>It sucks to be putting on an act in front of everyone, doesn't it? Just to protect others from yourself.<br><br>If you have a blog, use it to spell out your emotions. Don't care what others say, because they will never understand.<br><br>Then, at the same time, you should be looking around for someone who can help you better than us or your friends (I hate the term "Professional help". Makes you feel like a mental patient.). Healing is a long process, but you can afford the time. You always can.</div>
