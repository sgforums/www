            <div class='col-md body'>Dear TS,<br><br>i can understand how you feel,by the way,are you currently working or studying?what are the methods that you have tried other than those that you have mentioned?<br><br>there are much things that need you to be accomplished,for example,concentrate on your career,take up some courses to for you to improve yourself or get some intersting hobby or sports to occupy yourself.....make yourself more valuable by doing charity work,helping others,who are more in need of survival and sick,try earning more money to give your parents or siblings for holidays,etc.....help others will make you a better person and also feeling better inside out.<br><br>why do you not believe in religion?honestly,go and try to meditate every night before sleep or anytime for god to give you a blessful life or imagine that you are talking to HIM....i did just that and work well for me and many others,and to tell you the truth,i'm not a christian,go ahead and try my method,if you trust me....<br><br>i'm not going to tell you much further because down here we can actually only advise you that much but in reality,it is up to you......give yourself a chance and most importantly,give others a thought too before jumping the tracks or popping the pills........<br><br>Terence</div>
