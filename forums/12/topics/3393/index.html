Or you a normal person?<br>You should already thank god to give u a life, Enjoy it coz life is short.<br><br>Try to think positive...  love is juz a side dish... u can do without it.<br><br>Think of pple there at Africa... aren't they very wosre off...<br>Many children are born with aids... they live to die....  they can't even have a touch of love . They do not have a chance to be educated.... they starved... and are being discrminated by others....<br><br>Wat i mean to live life to it's fullest is to pick up new skills, lke learn another language. I used to think money is very thing... yes it could be . But i would rather be rich in soul than rich in money.<br><br>Do some charity work n u will feel sooooo much better.. u will feel needed coz you can bring a smile to someone....And that's the best thing in life</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>giving u guys another POV.. well another way to look at things... if ur parents dun love u, they wun want to give u an education.. they can save the $$$ and ask u to go and work to help support the family.. the reason y they wan u to study is becoz when u study, u can then earn a good living next time. Just ask u, between a white collar and a blue collar job which one u think is more enjoyable. I'm not saying that u must be a desk bound job, coz a sales man is consider a white collar job.. so without a qualification u think u can get a white collar job?? I doubt even a private company will wan to raise u to a high level.. Ur parents wan to see that u have a bright future and a comfortable life.. this is their hopes on u.. this is the love the shower upon u... yet u say that they dun love u... If they dun they wun have even born u into this world, and raised u till u are this old... It's love that is shown on u all the while.. They dun say it openly, coz we, asians do not have that habit... But we do show it thru some dreaded ways like being nagged at... being scolded at.. These are signs of love my dear.. So do not let them down anymore... Coz u are not only hurting them to see their children in this state but also more importantly u are hurting urself, by not able to gather urself together and create a future that's out there for u...<br><br>SOrryz I know I nagged like a father...<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)

            <div class='col-md body'>i believe not all parents are like tat. And not all pple there thinks money is evrything.<br>I used to be someone who thinks that money is everything. I want to drive my own BMW 5 series by age 25 , and everyone will look up at me . Be jealous of me .<br><br>But i do have to work my butt off to get that money.... i do not want to live life like this..<br>I want to enjoy my life.... i want to learn magic.. i want to learn other languages.. i want to learn piano n saxophone.... finally , i want to help those who are in need...<br>My parents are happy with what they have now. They want me to be educated is to be a morally upright person , not the money i can get in return. Know what is most important in life. They want me to be rich in character , soul and mind , not juz in money.<br><br>I do understand why some pple thinks money is so important , i've been thru that stage. And i had realised i was wrong. Not all wrong , but partially.<br><br>I think i am already rich enough becoz , i have eyes to see how beautiful the starry night is . I have ears to listen to beautiful music...  i have  voice to speak up for myself... i have hands to feel the softness of wool ...<br>Not all of us are that fortunate... WE are normal pple , n juz want to be better... but how abt those poor pple doesn't have a choice in life? ( those in africa n thailand)<br><br>Live life to its fullest.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>peacedude, This is one thing for sure.... your parents will never hate you. They raise you all these yrs n this is wat they get in return? " MY PARENTS HATE ME!"<br><br>One day , when u become a parent urself, how would u react if ur child says that u dun love him?</div>
