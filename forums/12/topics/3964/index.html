            <div class='col-md body'>I understand ur situation... IT's just like an artiste having some 'news' abt him or her.. then fans begin to distant their support... But hey.. even when u'r not given a chance to air out ur feelings.. that's not the end of the world. It also shows that they are not so close to u.. and also not ur true frens.. becoz if they are true, they will stand by u all the time.<br><br>Anyway if u wanna win some of ur frens back, I suggest the best way is to wait for a while to let the situation take some rest first.. then maybe u show thru' ur actions on how sincere u r actually.. To show them ur true self.. As they say actions are louder than words. I think when they realise they made a big mistake they will not believe in wat the ??? person on the net says.<br><br>Stay happy always....<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>
