              <p>Perhaps she is just lonely. Her bf is not with her.</p>
              <p>Even tho she may not harbor any romantic thoughts on you. You should feel flattered.</p>
              <p>Any female will delight in the companionship of a nice gentleman.</p>
              <p>As for merry making, the more the merrier. Who knows, you may find her girl friend to your desire. You wouldn't know who might come your way when you keep the door open.</p>

              <p>Well my suggestions to you is that you do not go for her la... just because she seldom talks about her bf and her bf is overseas, you have no right to try and take advantage of her situation and jio her...</p>
              <p>Maybe she just does not talk about her bf, but actually they are very close. Maybe it is just this period that they quarrelled, and therefore she seems down and out. Anyway, chinese new year is coming and i think (if she is chinese and the bf is chinese) then he would probably be back and they would be meeting up more, that is when you would feel that you are being "used" and that sucks.</p>
              <p>Dont go for attached girls even if her relationship is rocky or on the verge of breaking up or the bf is overseas. You should just be a normal friend to her. No neccessary to tell her you love her or what, just be there for her and keep your mouth shut. Only when she is single (in the future, maybe) then you tell her how you feel. At the same time while being by her side, try not to focus on her too much and instead if possible look for other girls that are single.</p>
              <p>Your mindset must be right. You cannot keep thinking of her. The more you think the more you want her to be yours, and the more impatient you get the more wrongs you do. That is when everything cock up, and she tries to distance herself from you.</p>
              <p>I am also sure, if next time you happen to be overseas working, and your gf is alone in singapore, you would also not want someone else to have designs on your gf right?</p>
              <p>So, i hope you seriously consider my points here and make the right choice. There are so many girls out there, look for one that is truely available. I am sure you can find one.</p>

              <p>I was in this situation before. My current gf was still with her ex when i told her i like her. She was already having lots of problems with him and their relationship was on the rocks. However i told her to try to solve all problems by cooling down and have a good talk with her ex.</p>
              <p>But then, soon they broke up and she was with me shortly. When we were together, we had many problems... often quarrelling... and she was very stressed as her ex still keeps hounding and stalking her. Mostly the problems are from her, due to mood swing and stress.</p>
              <p>I was lucky that we both held on and i never gave up on her everytime she wanna break up. Nw we are looking to get married le.  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>To TS: and from experience, are you able to take what comes next? I went through hell and endured many crap from all over. My gf cried for no reasons in the middle of the night, keeps saying break up, breaks down for no reasons, mood swings etc.</p>
              <p>The big question here is are you able to take it? How long can you take it?</p>
              <p>I have gone through it and i can tell you the process hurts very much but if you can endure it, its lovely at the end. But... for how long need to endure, no one knows.... and i went through a very painful 4 months before she got her true self back.</p>
              <p>Thats when she is truely loving and know what she wants.</p>

              i just got to know she has been with her bf for 10years from a reliable source. so i guess i can forget it liao.. maybe avoid her for a while to tone down my feelings a bit.
              
              just now i felt so awaken.. we went to take the bus together again.. this time she
              didnt iniate a conversation.. stood side by side quietly for at least 5mins but i was chatting on my mobile msn lol.
              
              Then i asked her if i can ask another friend along and discussed a while about the next outing with our colleagues.. after that both of us stone again for another 10mins before she alight from the bus. i really dont know wat else to talk to her about.. i pretended to be chatting on msn again till she alight from bus...haizz

              <p>pardon me, but I think you are the most complete idiot in the world.</p>
              <p>So what if she has a 10 years bf?</p>
              <p>All relationships are meant to go through tests to see if they are truly what they are meant to be.</p>
              <p>If you truly believe she's the perfect one, then by all means go out with her and know her better. Maybe you will find out she IS the one you like, or you find out she is NOT the one you like. And if you believe sincerely you can make her happy, then go ahead and woo her.</p>
              <p>It is ultimately the gal's decision on which relationship she wants. No one put a knife on her neck and force her to be with you. If she decides you are the one, she will make the decision, and if she decides you are not, she will also make the decision.</p>
              <p>In love, everything is fair game, until a couple gets married (that's when moral obligations come in, after you made the sacred vow). Before that, they are all tests to see if the relationship can withstand those tests.</p>
              <p>Some of the people here will flame me for making this statement, but my stand is, if two persons are meant for each other, no matter who tries to come in, that party will not succeed. If one side wavers, then the relationship is not meant to be.</p>

              <p>That's when it is true love, to withstand pressures becoz you know she is the one</p>
              <p>Love should not be smooth-sailing. If it is too smooth-sailing, it's not tried and tested.</p>
              <p>If one is not even able to endure those painful processes and be determined to win the gal/guy one wants, then that is not love, but just infatuation.</p>
