              <p>forget about the malaysians....most of my friends whonmarried malaysian gals all end up having a hard time and life.some were assaulted by wife and another one virtually being starved from body builder in NS to skeleton.others were dumped after years of serious relationship.</p>
              <p>malaysian gals prefer guys who own some kinda property,,,this is more pronounced with city gals or gals who have worked in the city.so far i have never met with a nice smiling sweet malaysian gal.most think they are worth a million dollars and like spore needs them type of attitude.:(some who are nice are already taken</p>

You must try to behave normal. Treat her as your normal colleagues. Move on. Do something like jogging, excerises, eating....time will heal. Good Luck!</p></div>

              <p>Hseng,</p>
              <p>Very interesting topic. I am a Malaysian and I tell you Malaysian Chinese women are a handful. I don't know much but I do know one thing, what they like is a game or a wild goose chase. Be very careful of that.</p>
              <p>There are two case: Case 1 - The girl likes you but doesn't like you enuf to accept you, so she leads you on and tricks you to like her even more. In the end, she got it all figured out, how to reject you while making you feel you still have a chance. This makes her feel so much better knowing that her market value is beefed up and boost her own self esteem.</p>
              <p>Case 2: She doesn't like you at all, so she brings her best friend to go after you and cover her arse. Her best friend will continue to have total fatal attraction for you while you continue to struggle to escape her powerful radar. While you are distracted by her hideous friend, she goes out on her own to strengthen her rship with her current bf.</p>
              <p>Dude, you are Case 1 - it is not so bad for you. You can still bring yourself together. The best thing to find a proper relationship is to be friends with the gal not to chase her like Olympic Gold Medal. Answer is do you want to find a life partner or a trophy case?</p>
