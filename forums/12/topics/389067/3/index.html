              <p>Hseng25,</p>
              <p>I understand how you feel... a deep sense of regret for not taking action. Who knows what might happened if you did skinny-dipping with her?</p>
              <p>Im not going give you an opinion or shove mine down your throat. Your own answer is the most important.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself this very simple question: do you want her? After that, do what you feel like doing without being influenced by others' decision.</p>
              <p>That's all I'd say.</p>
              <p>Peace out</p>
              <p>edit: if you want my opinion, from what I see... she's very into you. Question is: will you take the chance?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi RhIuvW. Yes I've decided to go for it... but slowly.... This type of girl really very hard to find nowadays. She's a simple girl but yet very fun and nice to be with. Of cos i need to get to know her better. Its hard to say if she's into me as she is very friendly with everyone of both sex. I actually tried asking her out on weekends and she said she and her friends are not free. Obviously she's still avoiding to go out with me alone. And even she IS into me, then more reason for her to avoid going out with me alone so she won't feel any guilt or feel unfaithful to her current bf. As I've experience this before when i was with my ex still.... and i went out with a girl who asked me out when i know she likes me but i didn't break up with my ex that time for her by the way.Thanks for everyone's opinions and sharing. I'll be going out with her and a colleague this friday. Hope everything goes smoothly and pray she'll one day agree to go out alone with me!</div>

              <p>In simple term....You can try but prepared to get burn....</p>

              <p>There is a possibilities that she will come back to her senses why she is with him in the first place.....</p>

              <li>Update...
                                  
                                  On Friday... our lady colleague said she got sore throat and another guy colleague who i asked had fever so in the end just both of us went for dinner. I actually wanted to cancel the dinner but she says its ok so we went ahead.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              <li> On our way for dinner, she was a little quiet while i was struggling to call a cab. (Couldn't' get a taxi!!) And finally we somehow managed to get there. We chatted and happen that i  just asked her about her BF.  
                          She described her bf who is also her first BF as "Fat &amp; not handsome and someone she couldn't imagine herself to be with". Reason why he managed to win her is because when she was working in KL.. she was lonely. She didn't have much friends and he would always ask her out and accompany her all the time and gradually they got together. 
                          Then 1yr later, she decided to get a job in SG but her bf refused to follow her as he is not willing to part his family and friends. They have argued a couple of time about this issue and her bf still insists in staying in KL.</li>
              <li><br></li>
              <li> Then she told me how much her fat bf loves her etc etc.... And i asked her "Wa not bad ah.. so means u love him very much la?" 
                                          
                                   She replied in low tone " Ok lor"
                                          
                                  I asked her what she means by "Ok lor" and she simply repeat again " Ok lor" (Actually asked her 3 times).
                                          
                                          Getting no where probing on her further.... she changed the subject and asked about my previous relationships instead and chatted about other stuff. </li>
              <li><br></li>
              <li> Then we took a taxi back. Thats when she got very naughty. Teasing me, poking my shoulders, basically we laughed throughout the whole taxi ride. She seems to find a lot of fun teasing me while to be honest i a little irritated at some point cos her mouth can't stop teasing me LOL. After sending her back, i thanked her for coming out for dinner thru sms and she replied " Of cos... such friendly girl like me hard to find". 
                              
                              Next day after work, we sat on the same bus with one of our colleague. And she described to him how fun it is to tease me and what she teased me about. I got kinda irritated and just pinched her. It seems she's quite comfortable with me now.</li>
              <li><br></li>
              <li> I told my close friends about our outing. They advised me to go ahead since right now... the ball is currently in my field. How am i going to grab it ... is up to me now. Of cos there are chances of failure. But if i can be patient enough and willing to put time and effort and show how sincere i am to her... she might consider. After all... Its a battle for her hand. And i am pretty sure i really want her more than any other girls.
                                          
                                          I'm going for it!!!!  </li>

              <div>
              <ul>

              <p>Confirm not about $$$. I'm earning enough to afford a Car and a house and a family. She did mentioned her BF dont have much $$$ otherwise she wouldn't have to work in SG.</p>
              <p>Its because her BF was lucky to spend lots of time with her in KL while she has no friends there with only him to rely on.</p>

              <p>Having fun means she's more open to me. Which is very important step for communication.</p>

              <p>Confirm not about $$$. I'm earning enough to afford a Car and a

              otherwise she wouldn't have to work in SG.</p>
              <p>Its because her BF was lucky to spend lots of time with her in
              KL while she has no friends there with only him to rely on.</p>

              <p>Having fun means she's more open to me. Which is very important

              <p>When you ask her about her bf, and she said "ok lor", that means that this is just a relationship of convenience, and not one built on actual foundation. The first thing she did was to say her bf was fat actually shows quite a lot.</p>
              <p>Think you should ask her out and continue with it until both of you become really comfortable with each other. But take your time. The time will come when there is the need to express those feelings. Let it happen naturally.</p>
              <p>One question you need to ask yourself is, are you very sure you are the one who can make her happy for the rest of your life (since you are of marriageable age). If so, then by all means go ahead in your pursuit. In fact, I think she having a "ok lor" bf is also good, as it would keep potential suitors, who are stupid enough not to pursue a gal that they like just becoz she has a bf, out of the door.</p>
              <p>And it doesn't really matter (like Fcukpap mentioned) that she views security as one of her criteria for the one she wants to be with for the rest of her life. Marriage cannot only depend on love, bread has to be part of the consideration, to be truly practical</p>

                  <ul>
                  <li>Update... On Friday... our lady colleague said she got sore
                  throat and another guy colleague who i asked had fever so in the
                  end just both of us went for dinner. I actually wanted to cancel
                  the dinner but she says its ok so we went ahead.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <ul>
                  <li> On our way for dinner, she was a little quiet while i was
                  struggling to call a cab. (Couldn't' get a taxi!!) And finally we
                  somehow managed to get there. We chatted and happen that i just
                  asked her about her BF. She described her bf who is also her first
                  BF as "Fat &amp; not handsome and someone she couldn't imagine
                  herself to be with". Reason why he managed to win her is because
                  when she was working in KL.. she was lonely. She didn't have much
                  friends and he would always ask her out and accompany her all the
                  time and gradually they got together. Then 1yr later, she decided
                  to get a job in SG but her bf refused to follow her as he is not
                  willing to part his family and friends. They have argued a couple
                  of time about this issue and her bf still insists in staying in
                  KL.</li>
                  <li><br></li>
                  <li> Then she told me how much her fat bf loves her etc
                  etc.... And i asked her "Wa not bad ah.. so means u love him very
                  much la?" She replied in low tone " Ok lor" I asked her what she
                  means by "Ok lor" and she simply repeat again " Ok lor" (Actually
                  asked her 3 times). Getting no where probing on her further.... she
                  changed the subject and asked about my previous relationships
                  instead and chatted about other stuff. </li>
                  <li><br></li>
                  <li> Then we took a taxi back. Thats when she got very
                  naughty. Teasing me, poking my shoulders, basically we laughed
                  throughout the whole taxi ride. She seems to find a lot of fun
                  teasing me while to be honest i a little irritated at some point
                  cos her mouth can't stop teasing me LOL. After sending her back, i
                  thanked her for coming out for dinner thru sms and she replied " Of
                  cos... such friendly girl like me hard to find". Next day after
                  work, we sat on the same bus with one of our colleague. And she
                  described to him how fun it is to tease me and what she teased me
                  about. I got kinda irritated and just pinched her. It seems she's
                  quite comfortable with me now.</li>
                  <li><br></li>
                  <li> I told my close friends about our outing. They advised me
                  to go ahead since right now... the ball is currently in my field.
                  How am i going to grab it ... is up to me now. Of cos there are
                  chances of failure. But if i can be patient enough and willing to
                  put time and effort and show how sincere i am to her... she might
                  consider. After all... Its a battle for her hand. And i am pretty
                  sure i really want her more than any other girls. I'm going for
                  it!!!!  </li>

                  Brother Hseng25, 3 words to describe your latest situation: Ho Say Liao!
                  
                  
                  Seems like her relationship with the KL boyfriend is shaky due to long distance, bf being unwilling to shift, and the manner of how the relationship started. Most long distance relationships do not last, regardless of whether there's a '3rd party' or not.
                  
                  
                  My advice for you would be to step on the accelerator slightly and try to create more opportunities to go out with her, if possible just the two of you, if not then group outing is fine too. Develop naturally and when the time is ripe, strike. If she continues to go out with you, chances are she has some feeling for you too. Some girls are put off when guys do not take action after too long a period.
                  
                  
                  Saw some forumers posting about marriage, which i think is too early to mention. After two persons get into a relationship, they still need time to see if they are suitable for each other as a lifetime partner. One step at a time bro...

              <p>as I've said, do not worry about the boyfriend. What's the point in probing about her boyfriend here and there. He's not the one you want. You are your biggest obstacle. A very simple question: do you want her? That's all that matters.</p>

              <p>Hi guys.... guess what.. i've confessed to her on msn on tues actually. I'll try to keep it short. She replied me " no chance liao la, hahaha ". I asked her if she didn;'t have a bf now would she consider me... she refused to reply at all. Then changed topic. I asked her why when i call her.. she will keep teasing me and why she speak to other guys so normal... so refused to reply again. I tried asking her out.. she simply kept saying she's busy.
              Next day i annoyed her by calling her auntie cause she kept teasing me. I went to write a letter to her ( waste my money on crayons and colour paper Zzz ). I wrote " Morning beautiful!" I'm sorry for calling u names but i miss the way u tease me so much. I passed to her this morning personally and i went back to work. 
              In the evening, i tried calling her but she refuses to reply. We exchanged some sms and finally she picked up the phone. I just straight away tell her that i'm sorry and that i really like her very much. She laughed at me and said " I have a bf liao and our relationship is very stable, we might get married soon. Sorry but this is the truth." And she continues laughing as though as if it was a joke. 
              I asked her again that if she would consider me if she didn;t have a bf... she immediately replied NO before i could finish my sentence. And told me not to cry later... and said that i will get over it very quickly. I felt like sh** after we hang up the phone but after a while... i laughed at myself...why did i have such strong feelings for her at the start and after she cruelly rejected me.. i feel so much relieved and actually feel good but at the same time sian because i've been defeated badly.
              I took some time to think things through just now.. and simply sms her that " wa u really damm pro.... if i didnt had feelings for u at the start,,, it will be a whole different story. But i certainly hope we'll still be friends" She replied " yaya.. friends always"
              So i guess its a lesson learnt. I was too emotional at the start and i should have known not to chased someone who is attached be it overseas or not. But i am still surprised i actually dont feel that bad. I am laughing to myself actually. Maybe i also have to thank her for cruelly rejecting me so i can move on fast.
              Well a really good lesson learnt!</p>

              <p>Sadly, you just met with a player and you got burnt. Or she really just treated you as a good friend. Either way, the good thing is you have finally found closure and relief from all of this. Yes. The moral of the story is to not get involved with an attached girl. The only thing that I can say now to console you is this:</p>
              <p><em>Why give up a whole forest just for 1 tiny beautiful flower?</em></p>
