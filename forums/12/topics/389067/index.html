              Yeah i agree, no one is perfect lol. But she is someone whom i'm looking for. She's not very pretty nor she has a body that turn heads. Its her personality that attracted me to her.
              
              Today at office she looked deep into my eyes when we talked a while about work stuff. Usually she doesn't do that. Maybe i a bit sensitive but i really hope this friday dinner with her will be a sweet one!

              @Maxtor
              
              Well you are partly right but I've decided to go ahead otherwise i wont know what the outcome be. It really sucks if u hold back everything thinking " Wa cannot la..Wa impossible la..etc" If everything so negative then how to be successful in other areas of my life? 
              
              In the end its the girl's choice and doesn't mean i will tell her i want chase her or be her boyfriend during the first date. Of cos i respect her relationship and like i mentioned i will take it easy. Be a friend first then say. I'm not those type who like one girl die die must make her mine.
