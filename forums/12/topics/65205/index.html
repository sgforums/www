Soon, another ger stepped into my life, i got attached but we broke off months ago. Because i was attached.. she kept it to herself, waiting sliently for me for 2 years.

Then of course, this feeling will definitely sink in BECAUSE its only friendship for now among the couples. You see, you both expressed feelings towards each other - yet you both ain't together in a relationship (for some reasons though).<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Not only you - if I were to go out with couple friends only, plus me. I would somewhat feel extra.<br><br>She can talk alot with friends, yet she doesn't call you. There are two reasons:<br><br>I) You are someone she loves as a crush, not as a friend. This creates a psychological barrier of getting real easy with you BECAUSE there are bound to be stress when speaking with you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>II) She likes you and feel that maybe you suspected something as well. When you feel awkward on her side, you react awkwardly without knowing it. She, in turn, sense it, and will remain passive mode.<br><br>All I wanna say is that: Caring for friends? Isn't it the first step before love? Your sensitivity ain't intuition-based because if you are - you would have already discovered that she liked you long ago. You are just thinking far too much and your sensitivity comes from focusing too much on what had took place (she likes you, etc) and the fear about it.<br><br>P.S: <strong>Without being in the actual relationship itself, you will never know what is it like with her.</strong> Try this: Go on a 1 v 1 date instead of a group date. Make her feel comfortable with you and you with her as well. Then extend this to another few more private dates. See how this goes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
