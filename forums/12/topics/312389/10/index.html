              <p>vk, 1.5 yr ago, my dad died of cancer. that period made me learn more about cancer and i would like to share it with you if it interests you.</p>
              <p>one of the things i would do when i have cancer is to soak in a bathtub of 4-5 pints of 3% hydrogen peroxide daily. More oxygen in your body kills cancer cells.</p>
              <p>I would radically change my diet from the normal meat/salt/carbo to veg/potassium/juice diet. these are largely based on the gerson therapy that uses carrot-apple organic juices, veg diet and coffee enemas to detox your liver and blood. i have 2 books that may interest you. One book covers the science of cancer and case studies of severe patients who survived (including cervical cancer patients). The books will help you to understand how cancer works and how to treat them naturally by going back to a nature diet. Other than the 2 books, I've a few mp3 recordings of interviews on the gerson therapy broadcasted on 938live in 2006.</p>
              <p>I'm currently downloading a "Healing Cancer Naturally" mp3 and a series of video interviews with a Dr Richard Schulze on incurable diseases which I would be glad to share them with you once they're in. Apparently, there is a missing interview document on the net on "How to stop and reverse cervical cancer" which I hope to find in these recordings.</p>
              <p>If your case hasn't reached a late stage, your chances of recovering naturally is much higher.</p>
              <p>Let me know how I can help.</p>

              no dear, it didnt feel like a fever.
              
              i mean, my body temp is higher and i dont feel cold at all.  Even in really cold aircon temp, I need to be in singlet, shorts and flip flops plus a fan blowing at me. Anything else and you will find me sweating.

              <p>it's not nonsense. we all have cancer cells, mutated cells going on everyday in our body. Fyi, our T-cells clean them up for us everyday - that's what our immune system is for. but when we constantly take foods that are pro-cancer and not pro-immune, their numbers grow and eventually overwhelm our immune system.  cancer experts even acknowledge that after chemo, though scans don't pick up cancer cells, that's because their numbers have fallen below detectable levels, it doesn't mean the cancer cells aren't there. they are still there in your body but in smaller safer numbers. if you continue with a pro-cancer diet and lifestyle, cancer recurs. believe it or not, it's up to you.</p>

              <p>it's not nonsense. we all have cancer cells, mutated cells going on everyday in our body. Fyi, our T-cells clean them up for us everyday - that's what our immune system is for. but when we constantly take foods that are pro-cancer and not pro-immune, their numbers grow and eventually overwhelm our immune system.  cancer experts even acknowledge that after chemo, though scans don't pick up cancer cells, that's because their numbers have fallen below detectable levels, it doesn't mean the cancer cells aren't there. they are still there in your body but in smaller safer numbers. if you continue with a pro-cancer diet and lifestyle, cancer recurs. believe it or not, it's up to you.</p>

              <p><br>Note that food doesn't really help in stopping the growth or division of cancer cells. And I really wonder what do you mean by a cancer-free lifestyle.</p>

              <p>Put down the source, speaker and studies of those stories and experiments you've heard like what i'm doing and let pple judge and decide for themselves. Are you a conventional medical student or practitioner in the field of modern western medicine? Let me guess, to you the best and less-risky results with treating cancer is conventional chemo, radio and surgical methods? is that what you suggest vk should turn to period? if you think you've got better cancer remedies that could help vk, put it forward here. i'd like to learn something new also but not unsubstantiated opinions to screw pple's minds.</p>

              <p>i'm now listening to the 6th mp3 audio clip and brenda michaels testifies about her cancer experience. At age 26, she had cervival cancer and she underwent hysterectomy on her doctor's advice. Later, she developed left breast cancer and her oncologist took it out. A yr later, her right breast developed cancer too and it was gone. She hit bottom. The cancer spread to her lymph nodes. All through those years, she had turned to many doctors and oncologists but cancer still returned. Her life changed dramatically when she came to know about natural healing after that. vk, listen to her cancer story. it inspires me. i hope it can inspire you too.</p>
              <p>I searched the net out of curiosity and found these few.</p>
