              <p>You have to take meat also. Some common mistake people make when they have cancer. Go totally vege. With those chemo they kill your good cells. You need protein. Just eat healthy with enough vitamins and nutritient.</p>

              the power of sheer faith. </span></p>

              <p>Let's not be so particular with 787180 and similars as I think there is some unfound logic or whatever you call it,...you know? The Yins and The Yangs. I think so far we have a lot of Yangs the positive and support in the normal way. But in the school of moderation, we do need the Yins like 787180, a bit of "leg pulling" maybe? I think sometimes there are some individuals in our midst that simply cannot accept the fact that such a terminal illness could fall onto someone whom we are acquainted with. Especially, when VK is asking 787180 for that 60k comitted earlier (just a mention for humour sake). So, I believe none of us are that heartless.</p>
              <p>Well, as for VK, I hope that you will pluck your courage here and fight this battle. Don't ever feel alone as you can see all of us here are rooting for you in one way or another.

Go for cheomtherarpy and eat the medicine. You need ur family support as well . Apply for counselling as most singaporean cannot take the blow that they themseleves had cancer.

                 Dragon Leaves
              Used to cure cancer. The leaves are boiled in water for hours with rock or raw sugar to produce a herbal drink.  
              
               
              
               
              
              
              
               
                 Wheatgrass
              Rich in chlorophyll to clean your blood it is used to cure cancer
              It has also many other minerals and there are claims that it clears your mind and even reduces fat in your body.
              You need a special juicer that can extract juice from fine soft grass or use a mortar pounder
              To mask the raw taste of the juice we recommend mixing it with Yam Bean juice.
