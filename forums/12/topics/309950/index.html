              <p>No, not AWOL in NS but resigning from my current job.</p>
              <p>As some might have known, my job requires me to fly. Decision for this year, stay rooted and get the driving license and degree which I have been lacking.</p>
              <p>Somehow, as I have mentioned before, life is never a bed of roses. My boss (which I still address) now just chucks me aside in the office, blocking me from all information, and not assigning anything for me to do. The once so called "brother colleauges" are giving me the cold shoulder. No talking, and even in a hostile environment. The feeling is like being a scab, the dry piece of skin which one would flick away when the wounds start to heal. As long as I am on payroll, I am supposed to perform duties, regardless of my status. I will perform the duties, as a professional in my field.</p>
              <p>Somehow, I feel sadden and disappointed by their actions. I am just leaving, I did not kill their family members nor <br>snatch away all their property. Why do they have to behave like this? They are my seniors, management level, not technician level or lower level of the office pyramid!</p>
              <p><br>I just lifted myself from the pity party of being single, yet a new challenge comes in for the work environment. Looks like I need to read a little more.</p>
              <p>Does people behave like this when they leave?</p>
              <p>God bless</p>

              <p>Got the exact treatment from past ex colleagues too. cold treatment.i try to rationalise that people dont want to get any closer to others that will eventually be distant. At the end of the day, it still boils down to human nature.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However, i often thought the opposite. when there are colleagues leaving i alwys tried to make them very comfortable instead. Mine is indeed strange behavior. when i leaving, felt very left out.</p>

              <p>thats working life. i have this opinion that when one is leaving, the so called colleagues thought they no need to entertain you anymore, cos since you are leaving, why should they waste time on you?? that what i felt.</p>
              <p>i was cheated to join this company. i joined the current company mainly because it promises 5 day work week. When i met the boss, i expressed that i wanted to study, so i need a five day work week( cos my previous job was a rotating shift work). I thought he was a nice man, saying no problem for it. My contract of appointment even states mon to fri. But the first day i came for work, my direct superior ask me to work sat whole day! she said i can 'choose' one weekday off.</p>
              <p>I am not being fussy here, but like TS, i already make decision to free up my time to upgrade myself. I have wasted many years working blindly and i was lacking behind in terms of my education and my social life. I have no choice but to work until i find another job.</p>
              <p>I tried not to mix with my colleagues, cos i know i will not be long in this company, but my superiors have high hopes on me.( cos high turnover rate). if i hand in my letter, i think my situation will be exactly the same as you.</p>

              <p>some of my colleagues are forever stuck in this rutt and they are envious. So they create this wall. Most of the colleagues I have, have civil service attitude like that of the 80s with an entitlement air about them. Non stop complaining and total lack of even supplying basic service because they know they will not be fired even for not working. The boss do not have strategy or vision and when things go wrong, they look for people and new staff to blame.</p>
              <p>What I find is that the boss are unprofessional and incompetent. If anyone wants to know which organziation and dept I work now, PM me. Please avoid unless you want to switch off your brain, don't expect promotion/increment and expect to pick up boss sh!t all the time only to be blamed that the clean up is not fast enough. And the boss salary is on the high end of the super scale but he choose to do easy things to pass his day until he retire or hope that the organziation offer him to return to work until he is 85 carrying on the same salary.</p>

              <p>My eyes are dry. It was never wet. Took MC to go IT show today. Haha!!!</p>
              <p>My close friend asked me this: Can you lift your head high up and leave without any guilty conscience? Can you look at the people who are cold and hostile in the eyes without fear? Are you ready to face the next challenge in life?</p>
              <p>My Answer: YES. This is good enough.</p>
              <p>I have done my job professionally and created backups in case of extreme screw ups by the higher ups. I did not take any information that belongs to the company. I have never been "kelong" by vendors nor do I overclaim any amounts!</p>
              <p>I cannot figure out why bosses and colleauges behave like that, neither will I go trying. I can leave without a guilty conscience. This is good enough for me. I wished to leave on a good note, but too bad things turn out this way. Neither shoud I be affected by them. I am better than I think, if some read on one of my post. Face Reality, do not be afraid to try or change!</p>
              <p>The bosses may be incompetent, bias and unprofessional. They may screw up, but I will still wish them well. When one day i look back in my life, I have nothing to fear at all.</p>
              <p>Thanks people!</p>
