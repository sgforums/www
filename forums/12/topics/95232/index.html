            <div class='col-md body'>Well... i dunno the characteristics of ur gf so can't be sure whats she's trying to do...<br><br>it might be a crush, so she felt she have to get to know this guy..otherwise it will keep bugging her and she cannot concentrate on you. And they stay so close together, the urge will keep getting stronger lo.U should remember the last time u have a crush on someone else... its those kind of feeling lo. Keep trying ways and means to try to know that person, and stealing glances. As she says it a crush, her interest for him might fade after she knows him. OR she might felt this other guy might be more suitable or she likes him more.<br><br>Anyway, it's only 2 months into your relationship. I bet both of you have never discuss is this for real ? For long term commitment? If so, then i would say both of your options are still open. Cause the understanding between the both of you are still not strong enough. If you decide that you want to be a stayer, you have to make your intentions really clear to her. otherwise she might also think that you are still shopping around.<br><br>You have to relax... If the guy is hitting on her, she decided to go, then wish her all the best and be happy for yourself. Cause you did not waste a lot of time. 2 months to know that she's fickle-minded is not long actually.<br><br>At least she's being honest with you, or she's trying to make you jealous. Some gals likes to do that .. make their guy jealous and stuff... Cause they are craving for attention... making the guy worried a bit..<br><br>Mayb it's just really friendship. Anyway, before you guys are together, is she a very friendly and sociable person? I felt she is.. thats y she could make friends with people so easily... if thats the case, dun fret. Cause u know she's friendly even before you are together with her. So whats the big deal of her making 1 new friend? She won't think she's wrong.. she will feel that y r u so petty and unreasonable..<br></div>
