Back in dec, during a gathering i bought a gift for my female friend as i had a slight crush on her, i did not pass the thing to her directly as we seldom talked and i was kinda shy, so i ask a friend of mine to pass to her instead and said it was anonymous, however the gift was rejected. She did not take to that idea well, and i think she managed to find out i was the one. After that incident we did not met for 1 or 2 months, i wanted to let things cool down, as i knew i made a mistake, should not have done that stupid gift thing sighz.<br><br>then i heard from my friends that she might not go for gatherings to avoid me (awkward or hates me?). I mean its okay if i got rejected i can accept that but theres no need to avoid each other. Recently i msged her and ask how was her results etc. but she gave me 1 liners and doesnt seem interested in talking, i think the incident is still in her mind, man what should i do? should i apologise to her? i dont want to lose a friend..pls help </div></blockquote>no...never apologise. U did not do anything wrong. Do u feel u did anything wrong? Think about it: U bought her a gift. It's for her! A goodwill from YOU but she did not appreciate it. If she's just a 'friend' now to you, that means she is the same status as your other male friends. If she is REALLY your friend and appreciate the friendship, if any, then i do not think she should think that way. It's HER problem, not yours. Therefore, you should not kneel down on your knees and apologise to her. If she doesnt want to see you, she's not really a good 'friend' after all.</div>
