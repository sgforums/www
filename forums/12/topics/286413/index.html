Nausea causing vomiting will follow suit as well. It usually takes me more than half a day to recover.<br><br>However these attacks rarely comes. (roughly twice a year)<br><br>For me i tried cuttting down on cheese and chocolate consumption.<br>Looking at glaring lights, eg comp screen at long periods of time might also trigger an attack.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So when you do go to a doctor and they give you advice that is on the back of what, 10 years medical training and god knows how long in practice, you ignore it and assume the answer has to be something else or someone with no medical knowledge whatsoever can give you a better diagnosis and treatment? I'm sorry but... you're never gonna get any better if you're just going to ignore any good and educated advice you're given.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Go to a doctor to have a piece of mind because the forums can't help you. Of you are not satisfied - seek a second opinion - neurologists happen the be the medical specialists you want to talk to. Auras could be an indication of brain disorders or just a result of a migraine.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Told you all she is suffering from Attention Deficit Syndrome liao. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Hi, Sweetday, back with one of your imaginary problems again? Eh, wait I see this one before also. So what is next?<br><br>Start posting how your hubby call you stupid and your mother in-law treats you badly and blah blah blah again right?<br><br>At first when I first started reading your post back in CNA forum that time I also pity you and even told my parents about you. Then I remember my father purposely register himself there to send you a helpline and even ask you to call him so he can refer you to the family centre since he know some people there. But what did you do? You never call him. Never mind you never call him you didn't even reply to his private message and didn't even call the family help centre line for your problem but every other day you keep posting looking for attention. Waste our effort and time. You are really a living parasite! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"></div>
