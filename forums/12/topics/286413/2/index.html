            <div class='col-md body'>Hi TS<br><br>Migraine is very common now a day especially when people that are under stress and bad tension. It will also affect your vision sometime. The Flunarizine that the doc gave you is to relieve from the pain u got from your migraine and it is safe to take it. So donÂ’t worry too much.<br><br>First of all you need to give yourself a tab on your shoulder becos u have been working very hard for your family and your company <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> . I think your relationship with your hubby and your colleagues plus the workload from your company and home are overwhelming you. That is why you are mentally stress.<br><br>Is there a way you could reduce your housework and workload? U also need to fix the relationship with your hubby and your hostile colleague. Bring the workload/housework down to your comfort coping level plus working in an environment that has a harmony relationship will help to cure stress. Go figure out a way, u donÂ’t have to rush, just take your time to settle an area at a time. While at the time being if migraine hit again medication is the only way to go.<br></div>

You imagined all the problems and then post them just to garner sympathy replies. That feed your ego and makes you feel good. All your posts here were exactly as they were back in CNA forum. Too bad CNA forum board don't keep track of posts. After above a certain amount posts will disappear or else I would copy and paste all your post there over here and then forumites can compare. In any case no need to copy and paste. By just doing a search on your 'alba' here can see all your past posts regarding all your imaginary problems.<br><br>And do not pretend you can't type in proper english hor? All these 'agony' posts you are posting were purposely typed in lousy english just to throw off one's track. Look back to some of your past post especially like this one <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=208463" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=208463 </a>can tell you were actually well-versed in english.
