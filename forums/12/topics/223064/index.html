            <div class='col-md body'>I have a good friend, let's call him 'A' and I known him in the unit when we were still serving in NS.<br><br>He was from JC but his A level result was not good enough for him to go local university so he ended up in a poly after ORD.<br><br>I have to say that he had very little close friends during his time in the army and I am one of his close friends and many of whom in the unit don't like him. To be frank, he have a weird character.<br><br>I know that he is not that good at socialising and I thought that things might get better for him after he entered poly as he is the only guy in the class with 16 other girls.<br><br>From what I know his relationship with her classmate could range from just normal friends to not-so-good relationship between them as he did told me things (mostly negative) about his classmate when I meet him for supper. The only close friend he have in the poly is another guy from the same course.<br><br>He have many disputes when doing projects with some of his coursemates and sometimes the lecturer have to intervene the dispute but I have heard many of his side of story but knowing what kind of person he is so I didn't side with him actually.<br><br>There is an incident whereas one of her coursemates accuses of A flashing his privates to her but my friend strongly denies that and in the end a lecture intervenes and the matter was put to rest. However what I think is that how come the girl is too wicked enough to accuse my friend of such thing as it is a very serious accusation but looking at my friend's weird character I feels something fishy about this incident. I don't know whether is it my friend is really foolish enough to flash his privates due to stress or what.</div>
