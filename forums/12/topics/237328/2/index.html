There are always pitfalls in life and i wont promise you that you will never encounter any more hardships in life after this, but only that you understand that you are now a wiser man and better prepared to face life's challenges with a keen eye perhaps even helping someone else in the future with a similar problem.<br><br>As for your sense of lost towards Love, i have only this to share:<br><br><blockquote><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Does Truth Love exist? Will i ever find it?<br><br>Yes it does. And no you will not find it.<br><br>It will find you.</span><br></blockquote>Physical expression of love isnt always measured with wealth and lust, remember after all you are expecting to grow old together to the end of your days together.<br><br>Learn to appreciate others. First with yourself then with those close around you and most importantly your current family and that which you will create and belong to in the future.<br><br>I hope you will be able to overcome your aching heart and gain new perspectives in life.<br><br>best regards,<br><br>L.i.P</div>

It is good advice, I hope you use it!<br><br>It is not "never love a girl" it is "never try to buy a girl's heart with money"<br><br>It she likes you when you are penniless, I doubt that she will leave you because you have made it and become rich. If she likes you because you have money, chances are she will leave you if you become poor.<br><br>So the choice is yours.<br><br>Before you had the experience you were so brave as to go for a girl and now after being armed with all the experiences you turn coward? Duh!<br><br>If you think that no girl will want you because you have lost all your savings and all girls will not like a guy who has no savings; I submit that the problem lies with you that is why you get cheated so easily!<br><br>You have in your own head the idea that guys must have money (for girls to cheat) than they will love you.<br><br>Hello, most people that are married and most people having relationships with girls are happy in the situation. They are happy because girls are not like your ex(s). It is your own attitude problem, you expect girls to be like that that is why you go for these type of girls. You are too blinded to go for decent girls that are everywhere. So please don't blame the girls, just blame yourself and go look for decent girls for a long term relationship.<br><br>The type of girls you like are only for play play. They play with you because you have money to give them? Then play with them and give them the money. If you know that you and them are only playing, you will not be spending so much for play play would you? They are not for long term relationships! Only decent girls are for long term relationships.</div>
