              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>My enthusiasm lasted for a year, 2 years in fact. The enthusiasm
              to do well in my studies, to double or even triple my results. It
              worked for the past year, and that kepy me going for so long...but
              now that all goes to crap. Today is probably one of the worse days
              ever, I got backstabbed in my bad subjects, defeated in my worse
              and my ego took damage from all sides.</p>
              <p>Okay so you're probably thinking "Oh God it's another one of
              those students with bad results" and there are probably many other
              threads like this, but still I have to release my anger and fear
              somewhere. Yesterday and today I received my end-of-year results,
              and it was when I was supposed to reap the results of the entire
              year of hard work, but instead al I got was misery. Winding
              back about 4 months ago, when my Mid-year exam results
              was as terrible, I told myself "Its okay, I just have to stop
              playing video games and study like Jack the dull kid and it will
              improve." I did, changing my lifestyle and gave up any temptations
              that might distract me. The race went on for 4 months, intense
              studying and constantly taking blows and buffs from tests, and my
              enthusiasm never died out as much as it did today. But now during
              the exam, it did, the once highly motivated enthusiasm just died
              out..completely, and it backfired into hatred, boreness and any
              negative things. Everyone in my class did well, with the exception
              of a few including me, I even flopped one of my most trusted
              subjects, everything just went horribly wrong, and it makes me
              think whether the effort was worth it or not.</p>
              <p>I have a terrible CCA record, no outside talents and I'm not
              exactly fit physically, my only chance I got is at studies and now
              even that's gone too. There are 2 video game discs beside me now,
              and both of which caused me to fall into a deep addiction before, I
              originally told myself never to play them again but now the
              temptation is just so high. I don't get it, study hard, study
              smart, it just doesn't work. I wondered who to blame, the school?
              the education system? then I realised it was mmy own fault. The
              enthusiasm is gone, and there's still a week of school to go. The
              feeling now is terrible, and I am even thinking of playing truant,
              something I never did in my school life before. Its that bad. I
              just want to know if anyone here knows how I can build up my ego
              again, because it dropped from an original 1000 to a negative 500,
              and if this keeps up things are going to get worse for me.</p>

              <p>actually, personal experience, you do worst if you concentrate on it without any other sources of relaxation. maybe you are like me, maybe you arent, but cramming to study is the worst way of studying for exams?</p>
              <p>if you play games, den you should lesson how much you actually play them, for me i just lessen the amount of time i spend to play games by half, and use the extra time for study, not Cutting off all sources of temptation?</p>
              <p>about your CCA problems, did you think of buying a Wii? Wii is proven to actually help in excercising and still you get to play games, isnt that killing 2 birds with 1 stone? x3 of cus it wont help you suddenly be able to run 2.4kms but at least you get some excercise x3</p>

              <p>Would you mind to be a little more specific on how you define "Most"? When you say "Most", it doesn't means, "All". Something is wrong, isn't it? When it isn't "All", it means you ain't putting in enough effort.</p>

              <p> I think you read my message wrongly. By "most effort", I meant that I studied harder for this examinations than any of my others. And no, I don't feel guilty, of course its not a 24 hours mug but certainly not a 30min study and 1 hour break kind of thing. Also I have improved but slightly, and deproved in some better subjects from the mid-year, and considering that I only have an examination and a prelim left I'm not sure if I can improve enough for the "O" levels, especially since my results are much lower in proportion with my peers. Furthermore each time my enthusiasm recharges it gets hit time and again by tests and diminished by a school examination, and each time it does my interest lessens.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hmmmm, can you tell me how you study? I have been through your situation through O levels. So the feeling of being disappointed in sec3 and O level has a really really huge gap. As of now, if you cannot limit yourself to the hours of playing computer games, then keep it away permemnantly. Or ask your parents to help you. If your school is not strict in the system of promoting to sec4, talk to your form teacher, HOD, whatever it takes to make you got to sec4. For my school it was signing contracts. So maybe this might help you. Get help don't study independently. As if you have problem just ask! And don't ever listen to your teacher if they say the textbook is useless! It is never useless. Some has the information you one, and if it doesn't have get a guide book or meet the teacher, or friends who score As. This is what i am doing for my O level science(retake). I only can hlpe you in your maths, the rest i sucks at it. Hope this will enlighten you a little. =]</p></div>

              <p>it was also that time when i realised who my true friends were. there were some who didnt want to be in contact with me because they were going to jc and i was not. however, the ones who stuck by me motivated me to continue on, so i retook my o levels. this time, i did well and scored As.</p>
              <p>I took a diploma because i knew what i want to do and dont want to waste time with useless subjects. i found the course i like and did really well in it and now i am studying in an ivy league university. </p>
