              <p>u said u study hard... what is ur definition of studying hard?<br><br>time is not that impt... u can study 2 hours and another student study for 8 hours.. in the end the student that study for 2 hours can learn more....  it is about how u study, did u really understand and memorise the neccessary part?<br><br>for maths, practise makes perfect... i in sec 4 now, and because i keep doing differentiation and integration (maybe u haven learn, add. maths) now i can do a complicated differetiation with just 2 steps of working in lesser than 30 secs... i am not here to show off, some might be better than me at this but my point is, did u practise?<br><br>for geo and ss... did u rmb examples? it is impt to understand story, but it is more impt to understand why did it happen this way... why not the other way? examples and understanding is very impt...<br><br>science... i am not sure how i study.. i just flip through my textbooks and search internet... and my suggestion to u is...<br><br><br>pls study ONLY when u are energetic, alert (usually in the morning)...<br>some ppl say drinking of coffee or caffeine drinks will deteoriate ur rate of studying... but to me, as long as u focus along with the high energy u are feeling, then u can study A LOT in like 2 hours...<br><br>what i do is everyday that i have to go to sch i wake up at 3 am... wash up and go to mac to eat then i study... this is only alright if mac is near ur house.. if not nvm... and the meal i have in mac is always must have coffee... so i study 2 hours everyday b4 sch.. when i come back home i will either play or sleep... thats my way.. just my suggestion and how i did it...<br><br>one tip, try not to study in groups (with friends)... trust me...<br>try not to have a clique (so that u dun owe anything not being with them)..<br><br>if u afraid to be alone, bring a earpiece or headphone... listen to song while studying.. dun be scared to be alone... i always do things myself and without friends.. jyjy</p>

              <p>Thanks for the help, yeah I don't usually hang out in groups to study and I don't listen to music while studying as it will only distract me. I just need a strategy to be able to get a decently safe result for the "O" Levels and compete with some others who apparently play, play, play and fall asleep during lessons and yet still score well.</p>

              <p><br>Well its 7.00PM and I've already done some revision today, but the results keep pricking at me. Anyway its not that bad that I failed everything or whatever, and I'm still in the express stream, but it's just very dangerous for the "O" Levels.</p>

              <p>Hi Anthiadon,</p>
              <p>Please don't give up so easily! You still have a year before your "O"-lvl, so you still have some time left. If you find yourself really badly in need of help, perhaps you may want to look for a tutor for help. </p>
              <p>On a side note, some of the students may look lazy in class, but they may actually work very hard at home, or have specialists tutors helping them out. </p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
