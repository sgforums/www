              <p><br> Ah thanks for the tips. Well basically I do understand what the
              concepts and formula is, but when the questions pop out they become
              a totally different thing in my mind suddenly. Formulas run into my
              head and I don't know which to use, eventually resulting in a
              mental block and affecting my other questions.</p>

              <p>It seems to show u lack practice since practice should give u more confidence doing questions and knowing the correct formulas to use etc.</p>
              <p>If u can't afford tuition, feel free to post any questions u have in the homework forum and people there will do their best to help u with ur studies.</p>

              <p>Yoz yoz yoz.... I was in your shoes before. Last time, there was this game called final fantasy. Fucking hell, this game is fucking addictive, and the whole class (guys only, not the girls) played this game. Everyone was playing, trying to discover secrets etc. It was so fucking addictive that I spent hours and hours from morning to night NON-STOP playing. Skipping meals, not wanting to bath etc just to play that damn game.</p>
              <p>My results suffered, but I did not fail. I just did badly. Then I woke up, because my results were not satisfactory.</p>
              <p>So, here is my method.. how to stop game addiction. If the game is a console like PSP, PS2, PS3 etc, you bring the console to your cousin house, and let it stay there for the entire year. Dont ever bring it back until you finish your exams. The initial days are painful, but you will get used to it.</p>
              <p>If its PC, then you uninstall the game and the disc, you just throw it away, or bring to cousin house again.</p>
              <p>You must have determination never to touch these games again. After awhile when the addiction died off, you will not want to touch them again. Just like now I got PS2 just few metres away from me, I have never touch it for the past 3 months.</p>
              <p>You can do it. Next year is O levels, just kick the game addiction and study like a dull jack!!</p>

              <p>It is the time of the year, when the results of your efforts or the lack of it is evident.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, what's done is done. There can be no turning back of the clock. If you had done well and the results shows, congrats.</p>
              <p>If you had not done well at all, played truant all the time, you only have yourself to blame and absolutely no one else to blame.</p>
              <p>But if you had done your best and the results are less than desired, or even failed, there are reasons that you must be prepared to understand and correct.</p>
              <p>Reading and memorising is not the correct hope to pass exams. It is understanding the subjects matter, analysing it and come to terms with why something is done that manner, that will help you excel in exams.</p>
              <p>Maths are about formulas. Understand how the forumula is derived at, so that no matter how you approach it, you will always get the same answer. Practice makes perfect, not memorising it.</p>
              <p>Science on Physics, chemistry or biology is about names and terms, based on logic. Always ask why, during lessons or find answers to it, so that you can understand how such laws or principles came about. Memorising the data will kill you. Understanding will help you to relate to any questions asked.</p>
              <p>History is about a timeline, a sequence of events, divided into epochs. It does require abit of memorizing but not difficult so long as you can place events during its epochical timelines.</p>
              <p>I would love to go on, for there is more, but in summary, you must critically analyze the subject and NOT just memorise, for our human brains are not computers, incapable of binary formating and mining of info.</p>
              <p>As said, what's done is done. But always remember, you are NOT stupid, not even by a long short. You are only stupid if you allow your family, your relatives, friends, and others to say you are and you personally believe it.</p>
              <p>It is ok to make mistakes, for only by making mistakes will we learn. It is easy for me to talk now, but I am sure if you had failed, your parents would be disappointed and some worse, may take extreme measures, and may not understand.</p>
              <p>They do have a right to be disappointed, for they placed great hopes in you. BUt it is not the end, nor will they even actually contemplate abandoning you. No parents will ever abandon their child. Threats will occur, but in time, parents will get over it.</p>
              <p>Some kids are just better at scholarly subjects, and other kids are just great with their hands. Just because if you tried hard at academic subjects and did not make the grade, it is not the end of you. There are other avenues for success in life, a bit tougher, lots of luck but still avaliable if you believe in yourself and your capabilities.</p>
              <p>If everyone's a lawyer, our country will be bored to death and will have to pay a hefty imported price if we want other aspects of life fulfilled. Our country needs all the various abundant talent in human kind for our society.</p>
              <p>So do not EVER despise yourself, or look down on yourself, AND never give up on yourself. Each and everyone of us has a gift inside us, that will benefit ourselves and others,  just waiting to bloom if given the opportunity.</p>
              <p>You are special, just as everyone of us all are, and meant alot to some people whom are already in your life, as well as those others yet to come.</p>
