              <p>yes there are money minded women around the world...And its also the reason why men work hard to earn money too....</p>

              <p>My point is in Age old days, this works and now that women have been granted gender equality, </p>
              <p>its time to move forward ..But in Singapore, its still backwards..thats my point</p>

              <p><br>What is gender equality to you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Does equality mean that both men and women contribute to a marriage equally?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Does your gender equality extend to women having the right to select their spouses based on their own criteria (which is basically what men had been doing for centuries)?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even if the criterion could be as shallow as selecting a spouse based on beauty or money?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> Gender equality works both ways unfortunately.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But when a man select a woman based on looks and suffer greatly because she is not sympathetic to him - it is her fault for being unwifely.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But when a woman selects a man based on material wealth - it is also her fault!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The individual takes the consequences for their own choices. Why let the rest of the population bear the blame with unfair generalisations?</p>

              <p>Your tone tells of a self-esteem that is challenged. It seems like you are trying to justify your relationship.</p>

              <p>First of all, congratulations on having someone who is so understanding and willing to accept you for who you are.</p>
              <p>But, what then is your real purpose of this post? I mean how do you relate or rather elaborate that Money is NOT EVERYTHING here? What did she offer you that you had rejected? If money is not everything here, then what is?</p>
              <p>Besides, telling us and not telling us I find this post is demeaning yourself more than anything. I know a lot of rich families who are one childed and seems to me, your babe's family is of this category. And going along this line, I think you will stand to inherit an hugh business empire - so what else is there to say? Also, I do not think her family will let her remain in a poverish state. So it isn't your call to refuse.</p>
              <p>Just don't start something you cannot finish and don't be childish.</p>

              Melbournite, in what ways are the women in Singapore different from the other countries other than the appearance? There are many kinds of men or women in this world, eventually you will realised that men or women are pretty much all the same regardless of which countries they resides in...you just need to bump into the right one for the right kind.
              
              I'm happy for you that you have found love in overseas. But to truly appreciate love, it has to work in both ways/directions. Strains will show in the relationship if one end is not giving enough regardless of the amount of love that was invested into the relationship.
              
              And how would you define love itself? Is love somebody whom you are physically attracted to, or intellectually connected with, or financially dependable for, or someone who needs you, or someone whom you simply cannot ignore/left alone, or someone whom you just spent too much time together with, or someone whom you have no choice to but to be together with?
              
              For me, my love is for someone whom I cannot simply ignore/left alone with.
              
              IT's true that money isn't everything, and guys don't just earn money to feed their women in Singapore. The power to provide for their loved ones is still the basis needs for supporting any love relationship...be it in the past or present. (Don't believe in MOVIES)
              
              No matter how much emotional/physical love you are able to provide for your loved ones, your love will never be completed unless you have that piece of financial love to provide for your loved ones. Financial love is not luxuries, it's gives individuals a sense of security and confidence in the relationship.
              
              If your women is able to provide you with all the above, are you confident to provide her with the above too?

              <p><br>owning properties costing $700K means rich people?  ah, now that we know your definition of rich, it makes things easier for us to comprehend.  at your definition, soon singapore is full of rich people too!  At least those boon keng hdb dwellers will be!  cos their HDB flats cost &gt; $700k too!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Perhaps you are really average joe (or pehaps below-average joe?), never seen such money in your life eh?  read the newspapers then.  Such 'rich' people are everywhere! </p>
