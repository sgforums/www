I am referring to the latter.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>LIke the "beo, plan, strike" strategy.  Hey, whatever OK - when u guys approach gals, make sure you make gals feel comfortable in the first place then from there gradually gauage how is she, don't just strike without any "plan" or when she is not ready.  I don't encourage guys when they see the gals they like on the streets , straight away they approach the gals (unless you are so tactful so good in gauaging is the gals are OK with your approach).<br><br>You guys gotta smile to the gals first (please smile politely not sleazily hor).  Then after smiling see if she feels comfortable with you, if she does just speak to her in one or two sentences to begin with, be spontaneous don't force anything out of yourself when you speak.  If she responds positively to you, well done - half of your battle is won!  For eg, you notice this gal at the bus stop many times and you wanna talk to her.  Smile to her, if OK then you talk - like "hello, you going out for CNY shopping?"    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div></blockquote>I think you're referring to 'flirting'? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ?</div>

IÂ’m only stating down things I observed.<br><br>There is little others can teach about approach. You have to go out there and experience it yourself.<br><br>But there is a universal truth.<br><br><strong>Men tend to Â“magnifyÂ” that fear of rejection in their head.</strong><br><br>Before we approach, we imagine all the worst scenarios that can happen.<br><br>The product is nervousness and anxiety. Fear of the uncertainties.<br><br>Next time when you see someone you feel like approaching, try imaging this in your mind.<br><strong>That fear is like someone sticking a nail into your leg.</strong><br><br>You canÂ’t move. That wound is too deep.<br>It hurts like crazy. You know you have to get it out<br><br>Right now, you have three options:<br><br>1) Try to pull it out slowly. Move the nail bit by bit, this is going to hurt a lot.<br><br>2) Patiently wait for someone to do it for you, <strong>painlessly. </strong><br>(You know as well as I do. That is not going to happen)<br><br>3) Take a deep breath, give it a sharp pull. ItÂ’s going to bleed like hell, but you will feel relieved after just one second.<br><br>I will prefer the third option.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its very simple.  Just chase after girls that display a high level of interest in you and the chance or rejection will be zero.  If you really want to try your luck and chase after a girl on the street that has zero interest.  Then prepare to be rejected and even called a creep/pervert by the girl or her friends.<br><br>The general rule of thumb to follow is:<br><br>1.  Chase after girls that are just as beautiful as you.<br><br>If the girl shows a high level of interest.  You will have zero chance of being rejected.  You can rest assure that the relationship will be a happy one with both sides willing to give way to each other.<br><br>2.  Never chase girls that are more beautiful than you.<br><br>Unless you have something that the girl wants eg. a big fat wallet, she's going to reject you outright in the most rude manner possible without even giving you a chance to practice being Mr. Personality.  Even if by some slim chance you get her number, be prepared to pay and pay through your nose just to keep her interested in hanging out with you.  She's going to dump you sooner or later for a better guy because of all the criticism from her friends as you are not exactly the arm-trophy she can show off to her peers.<br><br>3.  Never chase girls that are uglier than you.<br><br>They will tend to treat you badly and try to dump you first anyway due to their inherent inferiority complex of hanging out with a handsome guy.  Criticism and gossip by their friends will make them dump you even faster to avoid being dumped first.  (in their minds)<br><br></div>

What is "lesser" gal? Not as pretty? Not as voluptious? Anymore? Is that the pre-requistes? What kind of "same standards" are we talking about?<br><br>Note that all individuals are not the same. We are not clones... well technically we are, a head, body, legs, hands, etc... but thats not the point. Every individual possess a unique quality about them. Its up to us to discover and to understand AND to really appreciate them for their qualities that makes them NOT "lesser" but "morer" (got such word......?) and its also the same thing which had us locked into assuming we are forever with the "lesser" people when we would not even bother to find out we are actually with the "better"?<br><br>Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder. Now I am obsessed with looks, tomolo I am ogling at body. The next day I am fascinated with the brains. Values and mindsets keep changing and modifying. What may seem to be a treasure to us now may be going to the Jurong incineration center tomorrow.<br><br>Its in the mentality and mindset. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
