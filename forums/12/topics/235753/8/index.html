I read the updates you peeps have given and I think to myself, "What is going on?"<br><br>Then I re-read the original topic of discussion and come to give out a few comments based on what I have noted:<br><br>Why guys/gals go around noticing, ogling, looking, anything but not making a move?<br><br>1. They could be scared.<br>2. They have no confidence it will work out for they have done it and got the result they don't want.<br>3. They only wanted to compare.<br>4. They have no real interest actually, just something of an eye candy.<br>5. They may have tasted a version of such and the relationship ended badly. (similar to 2)<br>6. They may be waiting for the other party to move instead.<br>7. They are observing and planning so in the future they really go ahead?<br><br>Ever wonder what is the real intent of the person attempting to approach you or someone? Friendship? Curiousity? Dating? Desperate? Whatever?</div></blockquote>intent of someone approaching me or someone -  it all depends really.  If it's something spontaneous, casual, sincere, not sleazy, then I will respond rather well and may not question the intent, or may take it that they are just trying to make friends.  but if I come across people who look, stare and kind of sleazy I will question his or her intent - I will think this person is questionable and I have to be careful, and sometimes I think it is possible that their intent is not a good one, like they may be undressing a gals on their minds when they look at the gals.</div>

The thing is not all can see it so obviously. Some are slower in detecting whether the person is genuine in making friends or eying sheepishly.
