RElationship needs to be managed well.  Think most of the time a lot of things can be discussed and sorted out.  so don't be discouraged.  If two persons love each other very much they will definitely put in their utmost effort to let the relationship work out.</div>

But one thing we gotta be very clear when it concerns the affairs of the heart, that is there is such thing as acceptance or rejection.  Before any approach, think it is very important to know what one should or want to do if the consequence is acceptance or rejection.  Acceptance means something to look forward to and go ahead to go into relationship and enjoy each other's company.  But if it is rejection, we (including females)  must have the mental preparation to deal with this.  Of course, we will be disappointed, sad, angry, depressed and so on in the beginning.  But we should not allow ourselves to be in this state for too long.

They could be scared.<br>2. They have no confidence it will work out for they have done it and got the result they don't want.<br>3. They only wanted to compare.<br>4. They have no real interest actually, just something of an eye candy.<br>5. They may have tasted a version of such and the relationship ended badly. (similar to 2)<br>6. They may be waiting for the other party to move instead.<br>7. They are observing and planning so in the future they really go ahead?<br><br>Ever wonder what is the real intent of the person attempting to approach you or someone? Friendship? Curiousity? Dating?
