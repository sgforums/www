Now I finally understand what you really mean.    Just did a quiz or whatever you call it -  according to the expert, the result I got is I pamper the guys too much so much so that he becomes unreasonably demanding, "ba dao"!  OMG, think I better do something to change!  No wonder I am taken for granted and receive unreasonable demand and expectation, oh dear!!!!    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Hey, gals have to do their part, too.  Sometimes when we do our part we also face problems from the guys. Some or rather majority of men are rather possessive, they are either aggressive  possessive or passive possessive!!  I do come across not possessive type, but quite rare!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote>I think the point is the "first move" or the initial phase of courtship goes a long way towards dictating the kind of hopes and expectations both parties will have in the relationship over a long period of time.<br><br>Look at it this way, assuming a relationship came from a guy persistently wooing a passive girl, it really isn't all that hard to understand such relationships, in the long run, will have every inclination to turn into one whereby the guy will be possessive and wants to dictate things(of course, I'm not saying every relationship that started out this way will end up like that, but the chances are there). This, in turn, can be attributed to the fact that both the guy and the girl share the consensus that the guy should do the lion's share of the work in the relationship and I really don't blame the guy for being overly possessive in time to come because that's how the relationship started off, mind!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> I mean, it really wouldn't make a lot of sense for such girls to talk about wanting equality in a relationship if they didn't pull their weight to sustain it - selective equality doesn't exist!<br><br></div>
