            <div class='col-md body'>hello people,   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>there are some guys who just enjoy "beo" gals but with no intention at all to make any move.  there are some who "beo" and body language tells wanna to approach but afraid or lack of confidence to do so.  I am referring to the latter.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>LIke the "beo, plan, strike" strategy.  Hey, whatever OK - when u guys approach gals, make sure you make gals feel comfortable in the first place then from there gradually gauage how is she, don't just strike without any "plan" or when she is not ready.  I don't encourage guys when they see the gals they like on the streets , straight away they approach the gals (unless you are so tactful so good in gauaging is the gals are OK with your approach).<br><br>You guys gotta smile to the gals first (please smile politely not sleazily hor).  Then after smiling see if she feels comfortable with you, if she does just speak to her in one or two sentences to begin with, be spontaneous don't force anything out of yourself when you speak.  If she responds positively to you, well done - half of your battle is won!  For eg, you notice this gal at the bus stop many times and you wanna talk to her.  Smile to her, if OK then you talk - like "hello, you going out for CNY shopping?"    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>
