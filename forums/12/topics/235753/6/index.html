Yeah, its the "norm" that guys have to make the first move and such. Its been like that since the age of mankind. To take lead and know where he's going.<br><br>Sure, some guys may be put off should there be some gals who made the first move, BUT some guys do appreciate the guts those gals have for doing so. Its a matter of choice. Besides, how can the gals tell if the guys they approached are irked by their first moves? How can the guys tell if the gals are irked by the guys' move? We do not know. We have no way of telling. Its a 50/50.<br><br>In this case, we are talking about total strangers trying to make first moves. So its a no brainer guys should take the initiative. However with the society moving up in the trend, we won't be surprised should the gals make the first move on total strangers.<br><br>I can pretty much approach any stranger and talk to them, yet I chose not to. Does that brand me a wuss? To some out there maybe, but to me it doesn't matter for I have no reason to approach anyway.<br><br>Time moves. The world moves. We should too.</div>
