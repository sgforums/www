              <p>That feeling is probably "lingering".</p>
              <p>Despite the fact that you knew he is not the one for you, you still long for him to be closer than a friend somewhere in your heart, and that is why you couldn't let it go.</p>
              <p>This feeling is impossible to totally get rid of, so don't bother getting another bf just to try to make yourself feel better. You will only succeed in making yourself feeling even worse.</p>
              <p>Just leave it be, and focus your attention and time on other stuffs in your life. As time gradually passes, you will start to have less of this feeling, and if you can stay away from this guy, all the better.</p>

              <p>Fantagf is right. For you to love him for 2 years and not give up on it despite the fact that you were rejected by him before, your feelings for him run really deep. No matter what you do, these feelings would not go away easily, and there would always be a bit of it in your heart.</p>

              <p><br>Agree~</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you lost a good friend, it feels almost like a family member died, or even worst because you tend to tell most of your stuffs to your friend &amp; trust him more compare to some of your family members imo.</p>
              <p>Gotta be a hard time for you. You can be friends, but i don't think it will be as close as before since you still love him.  In the future, the sight of seeing him with another girl.. will you be able to accept it without giving them both 'black face' or have that hurting, betray feeling?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I suggest you put this it on hold 1st before consider whether or not to continue with this friendship, or at least wait for the feelingsto fade away before anything else.</p>

              <p>In short, he is not willing to try. I feel sorry for you in this case, for you should have given up on him 2 years ago.</p>
              <p>To remove all romantic feelings for him and remain a good friend beside him is impossible. If you are talking about remaining associates, then I will say it isn't that impossible, but <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>good</strong></span> friends - no way.</p>
              <p>Move on with your life. It will be tougher than you thought for the two of you to be anything more than distant friends.</p>

              <p>Yes, move on , but if u look it will always be looking, seeking , be in a position to share, abundant, overflowing </p>

              <p>sigh, i would give anything to go back to what we were like in
              the past. i feel so distant to him now, like i dont know this guy
              anymore. while trying hard to pretend nothing has happened and we
              are still good friends (we have common friends, thus we still see
              each other).</p>
              <p>can i still get over him for good in this way? hes my first by
              the way. makes it harder yea?</p>

              <p>If you are going to continue to see him, then there is no way you will totally get over him. Most people will not forget their first love, thus you can stop trying to forget him.</p>
              <p>You should only be worried if you keep thinking about him non-stop and it is affecting your daily life.</p>

              <p>yea, that was what i thought too. i think he just isnt that into me, and maybe its the same for me. </p>
              <p>those 2 years werent really waiting, i wasnt expecting anything to happen anyways. </p>
              <p>maybe our relationship started all because he was jealous and i was stubborn, not so much head over heels kinda love. its so funny now, how we can act as if nothing has happened, trying to be normal as possible. </p>
              <p>its human nature isnt it, we just want things our way so stubbornly without taking a step back to get the clearer picture first?</p>
              <p>i wont force myself to remove the  feeling completely, cuz i know it wont happen. just happy to know that we are still friends. </p>

              <p>Be serious if u  are going to be married tomorrow or next week. Otherwise, my suggestion - just <span style="text-decoration: underline;">flow</span> and enjoy the journey, forget the goal, the destination. It may work or it may not work. It is worth when love is an unsung song of the heart.</p>
              <p>U are here to celebrate and enjoy living - hope u can relate to that.</p>

              <p>Sorry to be the bearer of bad news but uhh the guy probably never really liked you.</p>
              <p>Back in high school, my ex waited for me for over a year after we broke up (we dated for a grand total of 1 week) but yet I never took it to get back with her. It was only when I saw her getting close with this other guy that jealousy set in real bad, and I had to ask her out just to squash my jealousy. Till today, I'm not sure if I got back with her because I truly liked her again or if I just didnt want another guy having her.</p>
              <p>I know this probably isn't something you want to hear, but seriously, get over him. You might not even have liked him when he asked you out- it's just human nature to want to have that sense of victory; after all, you DID wait for him for 2 years- surely that's what you want?</p>
