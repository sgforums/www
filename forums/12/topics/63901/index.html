            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><strong>The concerned parent, understandably, wants her daughter to enter a highly ranked school. Both parents want to provide the best education for their only child. </strong></blockquote>The best does not necessarily mean a high ranking school? Why do you judge a school based on previous batches' results? There is no wisdom or logic in that. A school should be chosen based on how you feel in the school, and its equipment.<br><br><blockquote><strong>This "competition" among parents is not really new. But the symbols of superiority are: a place in a top ranked school, a Grade 8 piano pass, a scholarship. </strong></blockquote>Oh yes ofcourse, its the Asian mentality, so that Mrs Chong can tell Mrs Lee down the road that her daughter is in RAFFLES JUNIOR COLLEGE!! And Mrs Lee will nag her daughter to get into some other school with a fashionable Christian name to compete. Its bullshit.<br><br><blockquote><strong>With all the pressure now being put on children to excel beyond their limits, there is little wonder why there are growing numbers running away from home, suffering mental breakdown or committing suicide after examination results are released. </strong></blockquote>ANd why there is so little creativity and shitty ads, don't forget that. And conformist generally unquestioning minds, which as adults, are sent to world conferences to sit down and shut up while other delegates have the courage to clear inqueries. Its the same in company meetings.<br><br><blockquote><strong>If you send me to an art class, my sketches of human form will still look like the stick figures representing "the Saint". </strong></blockquote>Oh did you design the Saint's T-shirt? Great design.</div>
