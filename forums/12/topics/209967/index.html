She doesn't love you anymore. You are too available to her, too predictable and you have become boring to her. That's why. You always call her. You never give her space to breathe. That's why she see you until sian liao. That's the way the female mind works. The truth is that she has already gone tired long time ago.<br><br>I understand why you are confused. She is not trying to run away from the problem. The problem is you, im sorry to say this. She says she wants to break because she has lost feelings for you already. Now you understand why she never allow you to go to her house, sms u back or phone you back? The answer is because the r/s is heading downwards. She wants to get out.<br><br>When she lost feelings for you, you being nice to her, makes her lose respect for you more and she loses even more feelings for you. No, you dun control her and dun call her 10 times a day. You leave her alone. She doesn't want to see you already. Ok?<br><br>She is already 23. She shd be able to think for herself. Your feelings for her is very high but she doesn't care about you. Do you care for someone who doesn't give a damn about you? Come on, be strong. Get a job and stop treating her too nice anymore. Make yourself happy. Making a girl happy doesn't make you happy.<br><br>Make yourself happy. Wait for her to call you. See if she will call you. Start finding other girls. You are still so young. All you need is just one good girl. Life is too short to be sad because of one girl.</div>
