He will share with you when he deemed as the right time to speak. Guys is different from girls because of the nature of guys - to speak up a problem is like admitting to their weakness or lack of potential to work things out. Instead they chose to ponder and go through the option in their mind and rather to be left alone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Girls are much different; girls wants people to know about their plight, about their problem because they feel better speaking about it. They feel its better to get it off their chest and they feel that exchanging views, or simply trashing it out to their best friends, etc makes them feel better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Don't worry... he will speak up when the time is right.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

And to allow him to - you have show him your sincerity. Don't think too much, have an early night. You are worrying far too much.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

In such that he is treating you coldly , no longer the caring and understanding bf he once was ?<br><br>You did mention that he have some problem but didn't wana say and needed time to think ?
