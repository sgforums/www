But at the same time giving wrong signal to the guy make him thinks that she like him as well. High expectation plus never satisfied.<br><br><strong>There another kind who is afraid that by accepting the guy so early the guy wouldnt treasure her that much, thinking "cheey so easy to get her to be my girlfriend, not fun at all~" by playing a kinda of game that make the guy feels that he goes through hardship to get her to be her girlfriend, he will treasure her like diamonds.</strong><br><br>Just my imagination thoughts.</div>

But at the same time giving wrong signal to the guy make him thinks that she like him as well.

It was 10pm, and the buses cross the bus stop every 30 minutes...<br><br>The first bus was at 10pm - it was old condition, the seats were torn and there were dirt on the seats as well. The color of the bus looks rusty and the driver looks kind of old and rugged. Though there are several passengers in the bus, she decided to wait for another half an hour for the next bus...<br><br>The second bus came at 10.30pm - it was slightly better in condition, but there was no air-condition in there as well. The color of the bus is not that bad, though it's not been washed for quite some time, and as the girl entered the bus, she smelt the old stench of the bus (which most have) and decided to wait for another 30 minutes for the next bus...<br><br>The third bus arrived strictly at 11pm, and she saw that this bus was clean, inside and outside, newly waxed and polished, and the driver was in a smart uniform. The seats were new and it was air-conditioned. There were several passengers inside as well, and they all look quite clean. She thought to herself, the past two buses were old and rusty, but the third bus is fresh new, what if I wait for another bus, it might come in much better... so she decided to let the bus go and waited...<br><br>At 11.20pm, it started to rain heavily and the storm came in and she was drenched from head to toe, since she did not take an umbrella with her... She waited for the final 10 minutes and the next bus came, the last one to be exact, and it was even worst than the first bus. The driver was smoking and had a lot of unshaved hair everywhere, his tummy was bulging out and he stinks. The seats were not only rusted, but most of the seats were going to be broken anytime. There were no passengers in there at all, and the color of the bus was like those in the wreckage.<br><br>Lesson of the day: Be satisfied with what you have, good things will never come to you as humans are never satisfied.</div>
