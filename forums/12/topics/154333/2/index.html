It was 10pm, and the buses cross the bus stop every 30 minutes...<br><br>The first bus was at 10pm - it was old condition, the seats were torn and there were dirt on the seats as well. The color of the bus looks rusty and the driver looks kind of old and rugged. Though there are several passengers in the bus, she decided to wait for another half an hour for the next bus...<br><br>The second bus came at 10.30pm - it was slightly better in condition, but there was no air-condition in there as well. The color of the bus is not that bad, though it's not been washed for quite some time, and as the girl entered the bus, she smelt the old stench of the bus (which most have) and decided to wait for another 30 minutes for the next bus...<br><br>The third bus arrived strictly at 11pm, and she saw that this bus was clean, inside and outside, newly waxed and polished, and the driver was in a smart uniform. The seats were new and it was air-conditioned. There were several passengers inside as well, and they all look quite clean. She thought to herself, the past two buses were old and rusty, but the third bus is fresh new, what if I wait for another bus, it might come in much better... so she decided to let the bus go and waited...<br><br>At 11.20pm, it started to rain heavily and the storm came in and she was drenched from head to toe, since she did not take an umbrella with her... She waited for the final 10 minutes and the next bus came, the last one to be exact, and it was even worst than the first bus. The driver was smoking and had a lot of unshaved hair everywhere, his tummy was bulging out and he stinks. The seats were not only rusted, but most of the seats were going to be broken anytime. There were no passengers in there at all, and the color of the bus was like those in the wreckage.<br><br>Lesson of the day: Be satisfied with what you have, good things will never come to you as humans are never satisfied.</div></blockquote>Next time take a cab?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Nay.. I'm PLAIN LAZY...<br><br>Contradictory to what Yun has brought up, I'm talking about a 'satisfied' girl.. Not a 'seemingly satisfied' one...<br><br>Though more of a rare scale (subject to changes with age and culture background), it's more of a 'nature' for some...<br><br>But it really depends on how you define 'satisfied'? I define the 'satisfied' as 'fulfilled' but YET one can still WANTS MORE... If you really do your thinking on that part but not just based on 'theories' alone.. It's really not that hard to imagine...<br><br>And of course, if you would rather define 'satisfied' as 'completely fulfilled' leaving no room for 'satisfaction' anymore... I think there really ain't much of a ground for arguement in this sense? It's just like saying a man who has 'filled his stomach' won't be hungry... Or a fat guy won't be thin... Just a 'correct statement' but which doesn't mean anything much deeper within itself..?<br><br>And err... Referring back to my previous paragraph... The case where one can be 'completely fulfilled leaving no room for further satisfaction' is probably a rather unrealistic practical situation..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  So much for 'theories' huh...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Taken from my ai ai's blog <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>"<span style="font-style: italic;">Student : Teacher, I'm confused, how can we find our soul-mate? Can you please help me?<br><br>Teacher : (Silent for few second, than he answer) Well, it's a pretty hard and easy question.<br><br>Student : (Thinking hard) Huh???<br><br>Teacher : Look on that way, there are a lot of grass there, why don't you walk there but please never walk backward, just walk straight ahead. On your way, try to find a beautiful grass and pick it up then give it to me. But just one.<br><br>Student : Well, ok then... wait for me... (walked straight ahead to the grass field).<br><br>A few minutes later...<br><br>Student : I'm back.<br><br>Teacher : Em, well I don't see any beautiful grass on your hand.<br><br>Student : On my journey, I found few beautiful grass, but I thought that I would find a better one, so I didn't pick it up. But I didn't realize that I'm at the end of the field, and I hadn't picked up any. Cause you told me not to go back, so I didn't go back.<br><br>Teacher : That's what happened in real life.<br><br>What is the message of this story?<br><br>* Grass - is the people around you<br>* Beautiful Grass - is the people that attract you<br>* Grass Field - is time<br><br>* In looking for your soulmate, please don't always compare and hope that there will be a better one. By doing that, you'll waste your lifetime, cause remember "Time Never Goes Back".<br><br>It applies the same in finding your ideal life partner, your suitable career or business, therefore the moral of this is LOVE &amp; grab hold of the opportunity that you have now, don't waste time!<br><br>~There Can Be Only One~</span>"</div>
