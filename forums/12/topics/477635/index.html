              wish for 2014 is that HDB's officers would be more humane in their treatment of
              low-income workers like me looking for a rental unit from the HDB. When I went
              down to the HDB last week to apply for a rental unit bringing with me all the
              necessary documents as told by the staff, not only did I not get to apply for a
              rental unit, I was given a dressing down by one of their higher ranking
              officers. Instead of being <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">assessed</span> </span></strong>based on my documents provided, I was
              simply judged and questions like, ‘When you reached 55 in another 5 years time,
              how will you be able to save for your minimum sum, you will have difficulty.’
              ‘If your relatives have the means to lend you the money to pay for your new
              flat, then maybe you can approach them for shelter.’ There was simply no attempt
              to understand my plight, just a callous attitude of, ‘I’m willing to burn my
              few hours to talk to you.’ and better yet, '‘I’m just an employee here, and I’m
              just doing my job, it’s not my own Company.’ And I had to keep reminding him
              that my <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">immediate situation</span></strong></span> was in looking for a cheap rental unit from the
              HDB as I couldn't afford the high rental cost dictated by the resale market, but it was to no avail. Mr Koh, if I wasn't desperate I wouldn't have
              bothered to go down to the HDB. Please don't treat us like a second class
              citizen. So, I knew it was a fruitless and disappointing trip, but it wasn't
              that. It was the condescending attitude and the tone emanating from the
              Officer's tone.</span></p>

              Your story is very vague...first you have a new flat, then second you already have a rented flat and third now you want a cheaper rented flat. So what is the real story here? You need a cheaper rented hdb flat while awaiting for your new hdb flat?
