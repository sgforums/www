              <p>Hi NEWater,</p>
              <p>perhaps you should take a break from online gaming and try out things such as fishing, cycling...etc. Playing online games for long period of times can be bad for both your physical and mental health.</p>
              <p>Since you are out of army already, are you waiting for entry into a uni? If yes, you could spend some time reading up first beforehand, so as to be able to better understand some of the concepts and facts before the semester actually starts.</p>
              <p>As for getting a gf, I won't blame you for looking for a foreign girl, but it will be better for you to look for someone whom you can meet up with. Sorry to say this, but many "girls" online are actually guys... Besides, it will be easier for you to develop your relationship with a girl when the two of you go out together, rather than by killing monsters together online. Even couples who meet through online games also have real life dates to maintain their relationship.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Yeah, I'm quite familiar with the G.I.R.L (Guy In Real Life) thing. I've seen enough of those, masqueraded as one before and I can tell the subtleties of which one's 'for-real', and which one isn't.</p>
              <p>But that's besides the point, I guess. *shrug* I'm already studying, and working part-time. So on top of churning out 5-page papers for school and dozens of press releases for work, I only have Sunday for R&amp;R. </p>
              <p>As for the 'outdoors' thing, eh, it's difficult for me to try stuff outdoors. I've been as good as crippled ever since I enlisted, because I've gotten really bad knees during the 2 years and the army has refused to treat me, nor take responsibility for it. So I have to live with the fact that my legs can't handle prolonged standing for more than 15 minutes. All the time that I have left is for myself to be sat down and just go furiously away at my keyboard to maintain that 4.0 GPA from last semester. &gt;&lt;</p>

              <p>TS, at the level you write, I don't even consider you fair intellectual - I have met many SG girls who are far more intellectual than what you claim to be. They tend to be PSC scholars, doctors and even lawyers as such. Even with such ladies you need to get off your high horse and appeal to them in a fun and smart alec manner, yet be kind and sincere ie. intellectual sarcasm, verbose but entertaining anecdotes with wit and humour, and display a high level of comprehension with a twist of charm... anytime you receive a "huh?" response - that means she's not for you.

No girls if any, desire only high-IQs. All desire high EQs. If you add high IQ to the mix, then she looks at it as a bonus. All females are built that way.</p>

              <p>It seems to me that the real problem is your lack of understanding of human attraction. Every man on the street is an intellectual. The differences between men are minute when you look at people closely. You pride yourself on your "intellect" but you must recognize that there are many types of quotient. EQ and AQ are just as important as IQ. The girl dumped you because you failed to attract her, and personally I think it's due to your lack of confidence. You need to move out of your social shell and find the self that you lost to your "intellectual pursuits". </p>
              <p>True intellect does not survive in front of an LED screen. You are an intelligent person, but you aren't a wise person yet. Don't give up or get depressed, if you believe you can do something, you'll do it. If you failed, you didn't believe strongly enough.</p>
