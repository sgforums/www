            <div class='col-md body'>Howbout a story? :<br><br><strong>The Two Pots</strong><br><br>A Water Bearer in China had two large pots, each hung on the ends of a<br>pole, which he carried across his neck.<br><br>One of the pots had a crack in it while the other pot was perfect and<br>always delivered a full portion of water. At the end of the long walk<br>from the stream to the house, the cracked pot arrived only half full.<br><br>For a full two years, this went on daily, with the bearer delivering<br>only one and a half pots of water to his house.  Of course, the perfect<br>pot was proud of its accomplishments, for which it was made.  But the<br>poor cracked pot was ashamed of its own imperfection, and miserable that<br>it was able to accomplish only half of what it had been made to do.<br><br>After 2 years of what it perceived to be bitter failure, it spoke to the<br>water bearer one day by the stream.  "I am ashamed of myself, because<br>this crack in my side causes my water to leak out all the way back to<br>your house."<br><br>The bearer said to the pot, "Did you notice that there are flowers on<br>your side of the path, but not on the other pot's side? That's because I<br>have always known about your flaw, so I planted flower seeds on your<br>side of the path, and every day while we walk back, you water them.  For<br>two years I have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate<br>the table.  Without you being just the way you are, we would not have<br>such beauty."<br><br>Each of us has our own unique flaw.  But it's the cracks and flaws we<br>each have that make our lives together so very interesting and<br>rewarding.<br><br>You've just got to take each person for what they are and look for the<br>good in them.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's another :<br><br><strong>Life is a Do-It-Yourself Project</strong><br><br>An elderly carpenter was ready to retire. He told his employer of his<br>plans to leave the house building business and live a more leisurely<br>life with his wife enjoying his extended family.<br><br>He would miss the paycheck, but he wanted to retire. They could get by.<br>The contractor was sorry to see his good worker go and asked if he could<br>build just one more house as a personal favor. The carpenter said yes,<br>but his heart was not in his work. He resorted to shoddy workmanship and<br>used inferior materials. It was an unfortunate way to end his career.<br><br>When the carpenter finished his work and the builder came to inspect the<br>house, the contractor handed the front-door key to the carpenter. "This<br>is your house," he said, "my gift to you."<br><br>What a shock! What a shame! If he had only known he was building his own<br>house, he would have done it all so differently. Now he had to live in<br>the home he had built none too well.<br><br>So it is with us. If we build our lives in a distracted way, reacting<br>rather than acting, willing to put up less than the best. At important<br>points we do not give the job our best effort. Then with a shock we look<br>at the situation we have created and find that we are now living in the<br>house we have built. If we had realized that we would have done it<br>differently.<br><br>Think of yourself as the carpenter. Think about your house. Each day you<br>hammer a nail, place a board, or erect a wall. Build wisely. It is the<br>only life you will ever build. Even if you live it for only one day<br>more, that day deserves to be lived graciously and with dignity. The<br>plaque on the wall says, "Life is a do-it-yourself project." Your<br>attitudes and the choices you make today will be your life tomorrow,<br>build it wisely.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Here's a long piece.<br>Hope it inspires you guys out there. It did, for me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><strong>Be Realistic: Create a Miracle!</strong><br>By  Harald Anderson, Copyright 2004<br><br>What is it that you really want in your life?<br><br>Money? Status? Success? A Prosperous Business? A Loving Relationship?<br><br>Now let me ask you a super blunt question: Why donÂ’t you have it yet?<br><br>A few months ago I attended a seminar. One of the speakers began his<br>presentation with what I initially considered a very confrontational<br>remark. He paused very dramatically and bellowedÂ… Â“What lies do you keep<br>telling yourself?Â” Although the room fell deafly silent, we all knew<br>that his question truly touched a nerve. That question has echoed in the<br>hollows of my mind ever since.<br><br><strong>Â“What lies do you keep telling yourself?Â” </strong><br><br>Â“YouÂ’re calling me a liar?Â” Â“All the lies?Â” Â“How much time do you have?Â”<br>Â“ThatÂ’s not a lie, thatÂ’s the truth!Â” The responses that were firing up<br>to that question were racing through my mind at the speed of light.<br><br><strong>In Life We Can Have Results or Reasons. If you are not getting the<br>results you want, your reasons are the lies that you keep telling<br>yourself</strong>. You can try to argue with that statement but its kind of like<br>wrestling with the wind, it will keep you real busy but you really wonÂ’t<br>get anywhere. Lies create the idea that we are powerless to make things<br>any different than the way they are.<br><br>I hate to admit it but we are all liars. We love our reasons and will go<br>to extreme lengths to hold onto them. After all, our reasons are our<br>stories, which define us. Those experiences Â“made us who we are today!Â”<br>ItÂ’s just the way things areÂ…Â…..<br><br>Results or reasons. Which do you have more of? If you answered reasons,<br>its time to analyze the lies. I speak from experience. I spent the first<br>thirty years of my life studying what I should believe in. Studied all<br>the great reasons. Read all the great philosophers, not once did anybody<br>ask meÂ…..Â”What is it that you want to experience with all these ideas?Â”<br>So I got a little top heavy on reasons and a little short on results.<br><br><strong>The problem with having so many reasons is that eventually these reasons<br>create a logic of limitations. </strong>They are like a virus that creates Â“a<br>storyÂ” that runs in the background of your minds hard drive. Whenever we<br>see something that we want to create, the first thing we bump into is<br>these beliefs (reasons) that have shaped our experience thus far. And so<br>the battle ensues.<br>Possibilities vs. Limitations.<br>The Grudge Match.<br>It's like a counterproductive stealth message has been implanted in your<br>mind, Â“You never seem to really win at anything, so donÂ’t expect much<br>here!" This message brought to you by your sponsor, Â“limiting lives is<br>what we do!Â”<br><br>We all search for meaning in life. However sometimes life is<br>meaningless. It just Â“is.Â”The critical moments that shape our lives are<br>when we define our experience and declareÂ….Â”what this means is (fill in<br>the blank).Â” If the statement that we make at this crucial moment, in<br>filling in the blank, even mildly disempowers us, we empower the logic<br>of limitations to control our perspective from that moment forward.<br><br>DonÂ’t believe me? Here are some famous examples for you to try on for<br>size:<br><br>Oprah Winfrey was fired from one of her first jobs as a television<br>reporter and told that Â“She wasnÂ’t fit for TV.Â” How do you think she<br>defined that moment? After his first performance on the Grand Ole Opry,<br>Elvis Presley was banned from returning and told, Â“You ainÂ’t going<br>nowhere son!Â” At that crucial moment do you think the King of Rock<br>created a message of possibility or limitation?<br><br>Life just is. Sometimes when we look for meaning we might want to<br>remember that.<br><br>WhatÂ’s your story?<br><br>Have you ever been fired, rejected, heartbroken, mistreated, insulted?<br><strong>How did you define the moment? I only ask, because that agreement has<br>shaped your reality. Be Careful What You Agree With! The Results Can Be<br>Lethal. </strong><br><br>Now what did you say you really wanted in your life?<br><br>Listen carefully and youÂ’ll hear those reasons whispering their logic of<br>limitations! ItÂ’s no big deal if you hear the Â“storiesÂ” from time to<br>time. The question is what are you going to do about it?<br><br>Mark Twain once commented that Â“life does not consist, mainly or even<br>largely of facts or happenings. It consists mainly of the stream of<br>thought forever flowing through ones head.Â” Our REASONS create our<br>definitions and create the energy of our life. Change our definitions<br>and you change your experience. Change your meanings you alter your<br>destiny. Life does not give us what we want. Life gives us whatever we<br>expect. Life just is. The meaning that we attach to the events of our<br>life defines our experience and creates the thoughts that allow us to<br>create abundance or limitation.<br><br>When I was a kid I absolutely loved to read the cartoons and comics in<br>the back of the newspaper. They made me laugh with glee. Now those<br>cartoons were essentially a picture being defined by a clever or witty<br>caption. One day I got the bright idea that I was going to change the<br>captions on those cartoons and see if I could make them funnier. IsnÂ’t<br>life the same way? Your pictures are your experiences. Your captions are<br>your beliefs. Do you have the courage to change your own captions? ItÂ’s<br>your life after all. The only limitation we possess is the idea that<br>there are limitations. Did you write your own captions or did you allow<br>someone else to write them for you?<br><br>We all have a huge investment in what we have come to know. However,<br>sometimes what we know has nothing to do with what we need to know to be<br>successful. Sometimes what we know has nothing to do with what we need<br>to know to be happy! To change all of that you need to locate your<br>limiting beliefs and say goodbye to them. Change the captions of your<br>life. Reasons or Results.<br><br>Marilyn Voss Savant writes a weekly column for Parade magazine. She is<br>acclaimed as the person with the highest IQ on record. When she was<br>asked by one of her readers about life, she responded with Â“Â“Feeling is<br>what you get for thinking the way you do!Â” True poetry. To that I would<br>simply add, be careful what you agree with itÂ’ll mess up your focus.<br><br>Consider this for a second: How many beliefs were you born with? How<br>many beliefs do you have today? Along the way you have acquired a lot of<br>baggage that is weighing you down. The problem most of us run into is<br>that we believe in things that are Â“just not soÂ”, but we lead our lives<br>in alignment with those lousy definitions and experiences to make them<br>Â“so.Â” It might be BELIEF-ECTOMY time.<br><br>One of the central tenets of the personal development movement is that<br>we become whatever we focus upon most. Fifty years ago Earl Nightingale<br>published his bestseller Â“The Strangest SecretÂ” and made us realize that<br>our focus creates our destiny. Web poet, adventurer and philosopher Mike<br>Dooley of www.tut.com has eloquently modernized and improved upon this<br>statement when he states,<strong> Â“Thoughts Become Things. Choose the Good<br>Ones!Â”</strong> Most people donÂ’t get what they really want because their focus<br>is fuzzy at best. Do you really know what you are focused on? Before you<br>answer that question too quickly recognize that your focus has been<br>responsible for creating your life up until this point. Your agreements<br>shape your realityÂ…. <strong>so be careful what you agree with</strong>.<br><br>So what is it that you really want? My advice is simple. Be Careful What<br>You Agree With and Then Focus, Focus, Refocus and Refocus some more. And<br>when you think you are through focusing, focus again. You wouldnÂ’t drive<br>to your destination fixated on the rear view mirror! Reasons or Results.<br>Be Realistic: Create A Miracle!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>BE PATIENT<br>This is a true story which happened in the States.<br>A man came out of his home to admire his new truck. To his puzzlement, his<br>three-year-old son was happily hammering dents into the shiny paint of the<br>truck.<br>The man ran to his son, knocked him away, hammered the little boy's<br>hands into pulp as punishment.<br><br>When the father calmed down, he rushed his son to the hospital.<br>Although the doctor tried desperately to save the crushed bones, he<br>finally had to amputate the fingers from both the boy's hands.<br><br>When the boy woke up from the surgery &amp; saw his bandaged stubs, he<br>innocently said, " Daddy, I'm sorry about your truck." Then he asked, "but<br>when are my fingers going to grow back?"<br>The father went home &amp; committed suicide. Think about this story the next<br>time someone steps on your feet or u wish to take revenge. Think first<br>before u lose your patience with someone u love. Trucks can be repaired..<br>Broken bones &amp; hurt feelings often can't.<br>Too often we fail to recognise the difference between the person and<br>the performance. We forget that forgiveness is greater than revenge.<br><br>People make mistakes. We are allowed to make mistakes. But the actions we<br>take while in a rage will haunt us forever.<br>Pause and ponder. Think before you act. Be patient. Forgive &amp; forget.<br>Love one and all.<br>If you judge people, you have no time to love them.<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
