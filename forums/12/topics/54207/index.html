            <div class='col-md body'>Based on the surface, this is what I see. Sorry no sweet nothings, just my 2 cents worth...<br><br>You mentioned you cant get a gf since the last r/s. You should know the reason why. Is it bcoz you were inflicted with alot of hurt/pain that's why subconsciously you feel you're not ready for a r/s?<br><br>How old are you? Are you in any hurry to find yourself a partner?<br><br>You want a gf - you like the idea of someone special being around to love and care for you. You envy those out there in the streets walking hand-in-hand. You cant help but wonder why is it that you can't be like them. You want a gf for the sake of wanting one, becoz people around you have partners, but not you?<br><br>You can't commit - becoz you don't want to be tied down, you want to enjoy singlehood life. You dread having to be committed to your partner and be responsible towards the r/s.<br><br></div>
