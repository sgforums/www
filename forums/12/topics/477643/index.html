              <p>Hi, I've been surfing this forum for quite some time as guest and frequent the Aunt Agony section. So, I decided to post my problem here. Maybe you guys can give me some suggestions or advices? It will be good to hear more advices to reflect on myself. </p>
              <p>One of my biggest problems are being too gentle and obedient ... as I'm told and I will be taken advantage of in the work force. I was actually quite shocked when I kept hearing people saying that I am too gentle because I didn't really think of it. But thinking about it, it's quite true since I really did grown up like that ... I've always been a good kid, very well behaved, never scold people before, considerate and polite according to most of the testimonial I got from my teachers even though I am not academically inclined so I don't fall in that good kid = good result category.  Unlike them, I work in a ordinary work force which is the retail sector. But then, i'm not ignorant of what goes on in the world, nor would i call myself a really innocent guy, but people are telling me i have to toughen up in order not to get taken advantage of ... However, I don't know how? <span style="line-height: 1.231;">My mum was mad at me when I say it's okay to be obedient what. </span></p>
              <p>When talking about that issue, I don't know is it because I always have that mind set since young so I don't mind doing more works since it will be beneficial to me by letting me learn more things in the progress ... <span style="line-height: 1.231;"> I don't know ... but </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">if I don't get works to do or purposely go and eat snake, I'll feel guilty since I am taking the salary from the company and I think I should make use of the time to do my job properly </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">which probably makes people think that I am a easy target for bullying?</span></p>
              <p>So ... is this a bad thing? </p>

              However amongst that group of people that u left a good impression on, some would feel that it would be taken advantaged of in a realistic setting.
              
              In other words they feel that your qualities whilst nothing wrong is too idealistic and detrimental to your well being in a realistic setting.
              
              These people are in fact trying to help you.

              I'll cite an example.
              
              There was a manager who was not in control of her work and always needed help.
              Ah Tan out of sympathy helped her out with her problem.
              Whenever the manager had a problem she remembers Ah Tan and goes to him for help.
              
              1. The problem was never solved. The problem being the manager was not in control of her work.
              
              2. Ah Tan always helped the manager out. As such the manager did not need to solve the problem. There is always Ah Tan. 
              
              It is good to help....just make sure they do not make it a habit and take it for granted.

              <p>1. The problem was never solved. The problem being the manager
              was not in control of her work.</p>
              <p>2. Ah Tan always helped the manager out. As such the manager did
              not need to solve the problem. There is always Ah Tan.</p>
              <p><strong>It is good to help….just make sure they do not make it a habit
              and take it for granted.</strong></p>

              <p>yea agree, it will be a big trouble if it ends up that way. But luckily my case is not that extreme. Even though I do help people, but depends on certain issues. </p>

              <p>Yea brought up that way so for me to change now, it's actually quite hard ... I do agree though being bullied is better than bullying others. Don't know about others but I will feel very bad when I hurt other people. </p>

              <p>Hi, I've been surfing this forum for quite some time as guest
              and frequent the Aunt Agony section. So, I decided to post my
              problem here. Maybe you guys can give me some suggestions or
              advices? It will be good to hear more advices to reflect on
              myself. </p>
              <p>One of my biggest problems are being too gentle and obedient ...
              as I'm told and I will be taken advantage of in the work force. I
              was actually quite shocked when I kept hearing people saying that I
              am too gentle because I didn't really think of it. But thinking
              about it, it's quite true since I really did grown up like that ...
              I've always been a good kid, very well behaved, never scold people
              before, considerate and polite according to most of the testimonial
              I got from my teachers even though I am not academically inclined
              so I don't fall in that good kid = good result category.
               Unlike them, I work in a ordinary work force which is the
              retail sector. But then, i'm not ignorant of what goes on in
              the world, nor would i call myself a really innocent guy, but
              people are telling me i have to toughen up in order not to get
              taken advantage of ... However, I don't know how? <span style="line-height: 1.231;">My mum was mad at me when I say it's okay to
              be obedient what. </span></p>
              <p>When talking about that issue, I don't know is it because I
              always have that mind set since young so I don't mind doing more
              works since it will be beneficial to me by letting me learn more
              things in the progress ... <span style="line-height: 1.231;"> I don't know ...
              but </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">if I don't get
              works to do or purposely go and eat snake, I'll feel guilty since I
              am taking the salary from the company and I think I should make use
              of the time to do my job properly </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">which probably makes people think that I am a
              easy target for bullying?</span></p>
              <p>So ... is this a bad thing? </p>

              <p>Obedient simply means you obey, without question. You don't question 
              means you either trust the persons giving the instructions or you are 
              under authority or you don't know what to question. there is no such 
              thing as too obedient  When we were young, we obeyed because we don't 
              know enough to question our parents and teachers. in the army, we don't 
              question because there are confidential info behind the orders so we 
              have to trust the wisdom of those giving the orders. Anywhere else, you 
              have to really think before you follow. Obedience is not a virtue 
              without thinking.</p>
              <p>Gentleness is a manner or quality of being kind 
              and amiable, moderate, not rough or violent. A quality which many people
               lacks in this rat race society. You can give a negative answer gentling
               which will help the recipient to swallow. So if you think first and 
              then put forward your opinion gentling, that is good. If you don't 
              think, what is the use of being gentle?</p>
              <p>When you do not speak against the evil when you should, you are guilty of being the evil colaborator.</p>
              <p>When you do not speak for the good of all when you should, you are guilty of being selfish.</p>
              <p>When you do not fight against oppression, you are weak.</p>
              <p>When you allowed yourself to be taken advantaged of, you are stupid.</p>
              <p>When you don't know what to do, its time you start thinking, talk to your close friends, your colleagues, your siblings...</p>
              <p>When your mom is mad at you for listening to rubbish and act without questions, think it is time you start thinking.</p>
              <p>If kindness, gentleness, honesty, ....are virtues, we can only see that there are not enough in our society, never too much.</p>

              <p><br> I do not think that being kind and sincere will give you a bad
              impression. On the contrary it will give people a good impression.
              However amongst that group of people that u left a good impression
              on, some would feel that it would be taken advantaged of in a
              realistic setting. In other words they feel that your qualities
