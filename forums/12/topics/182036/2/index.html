            <div class='col-md body'>Marriage is about guarding the sanctity of life (surely you don't want a bastard child, do you?).<br><br>With marriage, both of you will be friends for life.  An intimate one at that.  Sharing of happiness and grief.  You can't really share this with your friends, no matter how good they are.  The bond in marriage is stronger and implicit than any relationship.<br><br>You'll learn to accept each other's shortfalls.  Which in turn will make you mature.<br><br>You'll learn to make real decisions.  Not for your own sake but for your family.  Their well being is at your hand.  You'll be a responsible person.<br><br>Like religion, marriage will give you spiritual reason for your existence.<br><br>Being single won't offer you such opportunity.  No BS here.<br><br>Of course, if you want to keep your singles way of life, don't get into marriage.  Get yourself a plaything or a live-in partner.  Then get a bastard child.</div>
