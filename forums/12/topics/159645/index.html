And trying our very best to cope with whatever obstacles we hav to face n overcome.<br><br>Sometimes, we might unconsciously hurt / offend more sensitive pple ard us, but i can vouch that we certainly do not mean to be mean or hurt them in any way. Its just e usual but abnormal n unacceptable manner pple like myself commuicate and express my thoughts. A detestable n offensive behaviour dat I cant realli control, but i wil continue to try to learn e proper social conduct in order to fit into the society. Pple like myself have deeply rooted issues that have not been addressed n been ignored for so long n it has caused serious n permanent damage in our personal n work life. Our affected n mentally abnormal state of mind cause us to behave or speak in a manner that normal pple might either misinterpret our intentions or find them highly offending. (Its perfectly normal for them to feel hurt or offended cos its human nature to react defensively to our callous actions or words)<br><br>Just wana let those pple ive unintentionally hurt in 1 way or another that I sincerely wish to make peace and not war with them, but sometimes e way I communicate might b too extreme cos Im affected with this terrible mental problem - "Bipolar Disorder, Depression, and Anxiety".<br><br>I know Im not alone, there r pple who too are suffering from this terrible n incurable (believe me, e state n condition we r in sometimes can be worst off than physical illness). I know and admit Im not normal, but I have found comfort and feel good that I hav found this forum wer I can relate to some of e Xperiences I have been thru and even can give some insight to those forumites on ways to deal with them.<br><br>Its all becos I sincerely hope I can create a better karma by sharing n helping others with their problems cos I know depression is a terrible stage of life that might leave permanent scars and sabotage ur personal life. I feel that those affected or depressed by any problem shd voice out here without hesitation lest e depression becomes a long-term illness u hav to deal with<br><br>I know because Im in this condition because I have suppressed my feelings (be it anger or frustration and not expressing or even show my inner pain). I blame myself for ill-treating e child yearning for affection n comfort within me n that leads to me behaving so childishly with normal pple n drive them away with my callous n immature actions n words.<br><br>Sincerely hope the link above (hope every1 can browse at least abit of the contents) wld clear e unhappiness I have had with any1 who is feeling angry with my extreme words n action. "I truly have no intention to make enemity with any1 here, e onli thing I hope is to gain friendship n connection wif pple here in this forum, n also give e best advise I can think of to give solutions to serious probs faced by others which could lead to some possible permanent mental disability, tat u might hav to suffer n even for a long long period of time.<br><br>Worse of all, mentally disturbed r confused most of the times and we r living in a twisted world whereby every event and pple seems threatening n confusing to them n dats y the abnormal reactions they give. I myself have been in e terrible situation badly inflicted with terrible illegal drugs (e, ice, weed but never heroin) n did things that were highly risky n placed me in highly dangerous n tormenting situations.<br><br>I am now faced with a major obstacle that will totally shatter all my hopes I have held n I had brought this sticky patch upon myself by not seekin proper counselling, support and treatment, n not curing e underlying cause of my disorder. I hope pple facing similar xperiences like me wld immediately seek help from ur family or frens or any counsellors etc. Detect it early, get e appropriate treatment from an experienced n most qualified psychiatrist to remove e untreated inner pain suppressed within urself for so long..<br><br>Live ur life to e fullest n reach out to others, let ur trusted family n frens know wat is happening to u N why u r behaving so. Otherwise, get professional help n join support groups out there n u will not feel isolated or lonely anymore  .. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>(Not trying to gain any sympathy or companionship from any1 here, n defintely NOT trying to AA (attract attention <span style="color: blue;">cos its my last post here </span>n jus wan to let those depressed souls like myself aware tat they r not alone, and most mental illness can be treated if help is sought early. )<br><br></div></blockquote>Why last post <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>
