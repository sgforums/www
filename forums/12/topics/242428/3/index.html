Do u realise that ur friends have the right to go where they want, who they want to go with?<br><br>Let's face it, every individual is different in their own way. They can do what they want, and its frankly none of our business if they decide not to go out with us. Its not as if u never ask them go out. If they always reject going out with u, then just find some other pple and go out lah.<br><br>"Nolife", as u claimed some of ur friends are, can have different meanings to different people. For all u know, people are calling u "Nolife" for always asking them go out when all they want is to stay at home. They may think, oh because Gigabyte 14 has no friends and no life, so he always call people go out.<br><br>Anyway, if all ur friends always give u excuses when u ask them go out, maybe they just wanna be left alone bah. No use asking them out if all u get is constant rejection, because that's probably hinting to u that they don't wanna go out with u much.</div>

Do u realise that ur friends have the right to go where they want, who they want to go with?<br><br>Let's face it, every individual is different in their own way. They can do what they want, and its frankly none of our business if they decide not to go out with us. Its not as if u never ask them go out. If they always reject going out with u, then just find some other pple and go out lah.<br><br>"Nolife", as u claimed some of ur friends are, can have different meanings to different people. For all u know, people are calling u "Nolife" for always asking them go out when all they want is to stay at home. They may think, oh because Gigabyte 14 has no friends and no life, so he always call people go out.<br><br>Anyway, if all ur friends always give u excuses when u ask them go out, maybe they just wanna be left alone bah. No use asking them out if all u get is constant rejection, because that's probably hinting to u that they don't wanna go out with u much.<br><br>Sorry if i sound too harsh on u, but I am trying 2 let u see things from another perspective.</div>
