            <div class='col-md body'>I agree, finish your dip first and it will serve as a good back up.  ACCA does take a long time and in the mean time, yes its hard work doing this course that is not what you want to do but if it helps you get a decent job and pays the bills in the near future, I think it is wise to stick with it.  Besides, you have already done 2 years and giving up now not only means that you got nothing out of 2 years of sweat and $$$ spent you got nothing to tell your future employer.  Usually for junior positions and for that matter, what you studied dont really affect what you can apply and be employed to do.  only when you become very senior then your CV becomes really important bec you become like a specialist.<br><br>So in the mean time, stick with this and work on your ACCA next. This is the best move!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since u r in the last yr liao, just finish it lah.<br><br>ACCA got exemptions for poly grad who had studied accting n finance courses in poly.<br><br>ACCA not so simple lor, alot of my frens actually gave up in the second level cos the exams are hard to pass.  A few of them have tried at least 3 to 5 times before they cleared the paper.<br><br>I am not trying to discourage u but think it best to arm with a poly cert first rather then changing course in the midst.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>stick it to the end. i too was stuck in civil engineering course at singapore polytechnic, hated every moment of it but had to stuck it to the end. At least i got a diploma which i used it to apply for computer courses. in singapore, having academic qualification is extremely critical to your future. Since u are into the final year, better stick it through. After that, then consider other options. Good luck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>maybe you can go and ask the relevant staff inside your poly about starting a new course after finishing one...<br>see what type of exemptions they will be able to provide for you...<br>Guess this will help you decide on the choice of whether to continue or not...</div>
