As to your legal husband, explain to him your stand.  I am sure from begining of your relationship he would have already know your virtue in this.  There are always unforeseen circumstance that we must always be prepared for it lor...let say ( touch wood ) thing didn't go well and you decided to break up ...I say touch wood already ha ....  since there is no penetration, there is no comsumation of marriage and the law will declare the marriage and null and void and you will be still a Miss.  otherwise you will be a divorcee.... that is one thing.<br><br>Man, I know cos I am one... I can choose to respect my wife and do as she bid but then, if I lust, I may find all ways to circumvene the situation and get her to submit... it depend on how convincing my wife is to me...but when she lost her temple ...  everything she say goes...

            <div class='col-md body'>You may have registered your marriage, but have you gone through the solemnisation ceremony in the presence of the Justice of Peace and witnesses yet? If so, under Singapore law, your "boyfriend" and you are considered husband and wife. And under Singapore law, any party could apply for annulment of the marriage on grounds of non-consummation.<br><br>It is commendable that you respect your body, but you have to try to understand the feelings of your "boyfriend" as well. Have a good calm talk with him. He is probably frustrated and getting teased by his buddies, so explain to him nicely that you are not ready yet, and want to save yourself <span style="font-style: italic;">for him</span> (emphasise) on the big night. If he is all geared up and ready to have a go at it, just try to help him cool down a little through some "physical intimacy" without sex first. And if you still don't know what to do for "physical intimacy" without sex, you probably need to do some reading up. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Don't worry. Your "boyfriend" is unlikely to nullify the marriage just because you didn't give him sex before the big night. He's been patient long enough, a few months wouldn't kill him.</div>

How long has he been "wanting" and "waitign'.. and  It is only another 5 months.... so so I can't imagine why the guy cannot wait and is still insisting.... unless it is in a non-sxxual sense.<br><br>Maybe he just wanted to taste pre-marital sxx.... it would be different from sxx after marriage..... because it is "not allowed", it has a certain "thrill" elemnt not present in post-marital sxx.<br><br>there are those who say No TO pre-marital sxx but i have a slightly different view. SO PLEASE DON'T FLAME ME.<br><br>For him, he might think that it is a thrill of doing something a bit illicit. Since u r his "last" girlfriend this might be his "last" and maybe "only" chance of having pre-marital sxx. it might something that he really want to do.<br><br>Also his view might be that u guys are "already" married so to "keep" "it" from him is so "unreasonable". he has a point also and is a matter of perspective.<br><br>ultimately it is your own body so u should have the final say. And u shouldn't do anything against ur will whether u r married or not.<br><br>But I would advise u to hear ur hubby out and then objectively ask him why does he want to do it RIGHT NOW? is it to satisfy some urge? or maybe he wanted it to be a pre-marital experience? or whatever? ... and also at least allow him to "persuade" you and keep an open mind when he does that.<br><br>if u still insist on "keeping" it until the nupital nite then tell him firmer about that... and you have to explain to him why also...... remember in his view he is your husband so he "does" have some "right" over you.... so u have to explain to him why......<br><br>Maybe instead of all the way, u can work out something short of sxx to do together that is agreeable to both parties....... and then both of u can be happy.<br><br>Honestly in the long run this is a small issue..... when the two fo u look at it again one year from today u will think why u r arguing over this.<br><br>but to be able to work around this issue well will benefit your r/s in the long run.<br><br>Good luck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Casino<br><br>Frankly speaking I am not a very conservative person.  Therefore I believe I am not in the right stand in answering your question of sex before marriage.<br><br>However, I rise both hand to agree that if you dont want to and dont feel like to do it before marriage, dont.  It is not the question of whether he is a guy because I do know a guy friend who is still a virgin despire of his age(which I wont reveal).  As for his need, there are always two thing that are willingly to help him out on that issue. They are call the right hand and the left hand.<br><br>I have a suggestion, you can tell him since there are 5 more months to you both custom marriage,  you tell him you want it grand.  So fro now onward, for every times he request sex form you and being rejected, he will have to put $50 into your marriage jar.  If he requested and you almost give in but didnt, he will to put $100 into your marriage jar.  I believe that will give him the something to think about.<br><br>Regards<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Casino:</div><div class="quote_body">Have know him coming 4 yrs. Told him that I prefer doing it after customarry. But he alway use the point that he is a guy and there is need for him. </div></blockquote></div>
