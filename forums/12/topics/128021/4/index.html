Be it out of respect, love, or anything - certain principles are there to stay when you accepted the proposal. One negative similar example is when a woman fell in love with a man, whom she knows he cannot commit. This quality is ALREADY known right in the beginning, however, the woman still enters the relationship, hoping to change his mindset from within. Some succeeded in the change, many failed outrageously.<br><br>Exactly what is happening; your man knowing about your conversative nature, enters into a relationship with you, sexually unsatisfied, tried to convince you out of this conversative mindset.<br><br>You can stick to your beliefs, however, if this sex issue is still an issue during marriage AFTER your wedding night, it will definitely generate problems - Sex-related problems in a marriage. Not saying that giving in now will prevent such things later - there are definitely MORE to sex-then-marriage-then-lose them kind of thing. It should be the emotional connection that stimulates the love-making session (higher learning) and not the ultimate sexual release of lust during the wedding night (Basis Mars principle). <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The absence of emotional base in sex is dangerous for all forms of relationship.  </strong></span><br><br>A good way to handle this is to save it for your marriage night. After that, gradually lose that conversative nature and learn more healthy sex in marriage because I can bet with you; this conversative nature will subconsciously linger into your marriage life and <span style="font-style: italic;">may </span>cause the above problem.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Astrology Mode: On</strong></span><br><br>Saturn in 8th house/ruling planets in 8th house afflict Saturn.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I read all the posting, think spencer99 got his point. It is fair. But it is not that I dont allow him to do anything. In fact we did alot of thing, except sex. So he should know that I only want it to happen on wedding night.<br><br>If we are not chinese customarriage, dont said 5 years, even 10 years, I will still keep it.
