            <div class='col-md body'>i beg to differ from some of the opinions here...<br><br>try not to use marriage as a platform or reason to justify sex or making love (whatever you may call it)... do it out of love, mutual love... its simple as that, thats why its called making love and not just sex... if you do feel for him/her and be sure you get the same feeling back from her/him... why not? so what if he's ur husband or wife? if you arent willing, it can still be deemed as rape even if you guys are married... dont use marriage as a licence to sex... its more sacred than that...<br><br>and about this thing called virginity... imo it does not matter at all... personally i dont care if i see blood from my wife at all... what matters is whether she is 100% devoted to me at heart... whats the point of taking your partner's virginity but yet having shadows of your partner's heart not faithfully with you? imagine this cooked up scenario: you had her first time... 2nd time... 3rd time... 4th time... 5th time... 7th time... wait wheres the 6th? would you know it? without trust and faith that her heart is solely with me, even if my girl's first time is with me i wont feel happy at all...<br><br>just think about it... if you feel you found that man, i wish you a blissful marriage for every day to come in your life...<br><br></div>

My boyfriend who I am going to marry this September said that too. We quarrel over it often. He said I am too conversative and that not good for our marriage life ? Is it true ? I am 26. This is my 2nd relationship. My first relationship end because of that too. I trust my future hubby but I want to keep it for him on wedding night. But he claimed that since we have registered and is marrying soon, I should allow him to go futher then now what we are doing. Please advise ...</div></blockquote>Speaking from a guy, I say you keep it til the wedding bells. Your bf should respect your decision if he's truly loves you. Many guys will say, "If you really love me, you have to show it to me by giving it to me". That's bull, you know. If your bf is forcing you, maybe, you should give the relationship a second thought. Is he building it over the S thing? Even after marriage, you can reject any of his sex advances. But, do you think he's able to take no as an answer after your marriage? Give it a thought.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Casino,<br>i admire ur will to keep it til marriage. not many women can do that, either bcos they give in to their boyfriends and/or bcos they feel there is nothing wrong and that they are actually enjoying it or under peer pressure -- all my girlfriends are doing it, so why not me?<br><br>for the latter, it is not their morals gone bad... it's juz a change of times where modern women now know what they want.  if it is something that improves the relationship and brings the couple closer both emotionally and physically, why not?<br><br>so it is very subjective... if u r not ready, don't agree. communication is key. talk to ur bf and tell him that u r not ready but there is nothing wrong with u physically (or is there?). u juz want to wait, and stress that it is really important to u.<br><br></div>
