After ROM? After Solemnisation or After customary? Casino's bf/husband probably wants the date defined as earlier and hence an earlier consummation of the marriage..<br><br>I guess its really a matter of personal beliefs to defend and communication with the husband/bf..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>my advice is to keep it for the wedding night. This has been the value u cherished   so keep it.. dun give in.. we may feel obliged to but we really dun haf to ..if u decided to give in to his request, on the wedding night itself, u may feel bitter.. cos the wish of keeping everything for the night itself cant be fulfiled anymore.  worse if this affects u for quite some time.. there may be more disagreements in the future.. meanwhile u just try to do some stuff that will pls him or cheer him up a bit..pamper him wif other stuff like cooking a nice meal for him and stuff.. maybe<br>do more outdoor activities wif him so he wont haf much chance of asking it frm u?  main thing is get involve with activities that will get his mind off sex.. i think dat might help a little.. but watever it is, never never flare up and quarrel, talk things out nicely even when he starts to throw his temper.. it's not going to be easy u need lots of patience..all the best!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
