Diff ppl has diff wats of dealing with rejection.<br><br>In terms of love, there are also alot of reasons for people to reject u. But one main reason stays, that reason is at the moment of rejection, that person does not love u. (Being not ready to love u is also the same as do not love u at that point.)<br><br>It will depend on what u do after rejection or ur character that makes a person dun fancy ur company. If ppl reject u and u stil haunt her, of cos  u will be dreaded as a not so welcomed person.<br><br>If u cant handle rejection, how are u going to get on with life? WE face alot of rejection in many areas: in jobs, in sch, in love, at home, etc. Deal with it as part and parcel of life. I have been rejected a few times ( in terms of love).<br><br>If u dun have the courage to ask, and face the music, u are going to be alone forever. Of cos other factor comes into play as well. Its not bcos u ask then the other person got to like u, got to give u reply, etc.<br><br>Learn to deal with it. Like others say: its part of life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>agreed sometimes with rejection you will grow up.<br>In love life sometimes is better to get rejected a few times in order to treasure the next relationship that comes along.<br><br>For example a handsome guy goes after girls and never kena rejected, he never treasure them cos they are way too easy for him in the end all the girls left him, cos they feel he do not treasure them at all.<br><br>I too fear rejection in the past but now I face it like a man.<br>If kena rejected then must ask why kenna reject?<br>Is it that i was too straightforward, too blunt or the girl never like me at all.<br>Learn from it and improve.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You have to realise we as human deal with rejections day in and day out!!!<br><br>when you are out in the streets, someone hands you a flyer, which you didn't take ( you are rejecting that person)<br><br>when a sales person approach you to buy a product. "no thank you" (you are rejecting that person)<br><br>when you flag a empty cab and it doesn't stop. (you are rejected)<br><br>when you apply for any thing that didn't get accepted (you are rejected)<br><br>when you ask a gal out, and she says she's busy, (you are rejected).<br><br>Rejection is part and parcel of our life... but guess what you'll get over it!!! What matters is how you take it. like in the first few instances, if you are the one being rejected, what would you do? probably just shrug it off and try again. right?<br><br>But what about the last example. if the gal rejected you, are you going to die? going to hide yourself in your room and never come out again? Of course!!!<br><br>What i mean is of course you'll feel like "you going to die? going to hide yourself in your room and never come out again" but these feelings will fade. and what would you do? pick yourself up, pluck up the courage and try again! If  not you'll never get anything out of life!!!<br><br>Look at it this way. If you have met the love of your life and you know you two can be so happy together.... ; However because of the risk of rejection, you do nothing. and a year later she got married. while you two were chatting after her wedding she revealed that at that time (1 yr ago) she actually feels the same way about you and is waiting for you to do something, and since you didn't do anything, she took it as you were not interested!!!<br><br>How would you feel then? won't you kick yourself and hate your cowardice? wouldn't you give anything to turn back the clock to make the move?<br><br>What would you miss out in life, if you keep running from anything that may cause rejection?!</div>
