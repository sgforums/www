              <p>With such a low GPA score, it is impossible to get a place in local university. With that being said, I have decided to try whatever it takes to increase my chance of entering local university, and that might includes taking private 'A' Level exam.</p>
              <p>During my poly days, I have zero CCA involvment at all and the course I have in mind for university is totally different from the course I have studied in poly. </p>
              <p>I look around various websites/forums regarding "school talks" and it seems that I have to take private university or go for overseas studies. Unfortunately, I don't have the financial ability to do so.</p>
              <p>Now all I have left is taking private 'A' level or enrolling in private university. I want to take a shot at  private 'A' level before considering for private university.</p>
              <p>I will be going to NS in about a month. I thought of self studying the subjects during my free time but whether the circumstances will favour me is still up in the air.</p>
              <p>Finally, I hope sgforums member can give some advice.</p>

              <p>Not sure if taking private A Levels will help at all. Might be a better idea to start somewhere else lower than your current poly education, get some skills, and get work experience.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you can consider taking apprenticeship courses from ITE.</p>

              <p>so you gonna study for 2 years of A lvl stuff in NS? wahhh not easy man. in NS esp during ur training phase,once u go back bunk after a day's training at around 8pm? u straight away bath and sleep lor and wake up nxt day 5.30am.</p>
              <p>unless u in some slack vocation like RP.i know of a friend who did badly in his A lvls than take private As the next yr,guard duty nothing to do so everyday in camp like study lor. he got to nus after that.</p>
              <p>it will be super tough if u're in a combat vocation that always chiong sua. but i always believed anything is possible.so, no harm trying really.</p>

Clock experience and get your cert at the same time or later when you can afford it. Don't want to put you down but with your GPA, obviously you aren't the cream of the crop and experience might be a better way forward.</p></div>

              <p>Your poly you can even score 2.3, dont even think of A level.</p>
              <p>I am not looking down on you dude, but thats the fake. Poly is so easy and you get 2.3.... my friend get around that score too, but they play and play.. relax.. get low marks kpkb.. nv go study..</p>
              <p>My advice is, dont try lah... If you mindset think you really can , and really wanna work super hard, go for it.</p>

              <p>I don't have it to cut it out in the designing field so I moved on to programming. Initially, I have no problems with it but when I was attached to some other company to do programming work, I call it quit. The environment of this industry doesn't suit me and I will definitely be unhappy in this field. Finally, for networking, it was a neutral field of study for me, I have no problem with it.</p>
              <p>At the end of three years(it might or might not be late), I realised that I definitely don't want to work anywhere in the field of IT, Now I will ask then, what can I do with a IT diploma?</p>

              <p>My question to you again: so what if the environment of the chosen degree doesn't fit into what you want? Are you going to do a master to get into another line you think you want?</p>
              <p>You have programming skills - it's a skill. No one is asking you to do something you do not like but it sounds like you already gave up before you have even started in the real world.  No one can ever expect that work in the real world will be like the simulated world of academia.</p>
              <p>What is the discipline you want to get into? Why not investigate what you can do with the degree first before jumping into A levels straight in a hope to get into Uni?</p>
              <p>The way I see it  and you can tell me if I am wrong : do a basic bachelor degree at SIM  with your diploma - most bachelor degrees are nothing really nowadays in the real world, unless they are engineering/nursing/medical degrees but they mean alot when it comes down to applying for further study.</p>
              <p>Work hard in it and score well in it. THEN you apply for a master degree at NUS/NTU/SMU in something you want to do. Think about it and see what you think of it.</p>

              <p>I agree with fymk.</p>
              <p>You have to first ask yourself what in the world you want to do.</p>
              <p>What's wrong with IT anyway?  It is a very marketable skill and companies I know are always short of good IT people.  Even if you hated it during your Poly days, it shouldn't have been an excuse to slack off.</p>
              <p>There are many mirages out there.  Often times the job you take up is nowhere near what you thought it would be like.  You can't wait to find that perfect job. Worse, no point saying 'just because I don't like it I don't do well'.</p>
              <p>You have to make the best of what you have.</p>
