There are few side effects though, although they are usually not serious. Moodiness, headache, lethargy can be some of the symptoms. Loss of energy can exist too.<br><br>a) Drug theraphy<br>Nowadays, people knew the addictiveness and serious side effects of drugs. even with safer ones, drugs do not teach one to break bad eating habits or only temporarily stop the syndrome.<br><br>Stimulants like dexedrine and adderall is now discouraged because of addictiveness. It is the oldest form of diet pills.<br><br>Fenfluramine is similar to stimulants, but has less dependency probs. It suppress appetite.<br><br>Phentermine is similar also to stimulants, but has less risks too<br><br>Fluxetine or commonly called Prozac is the latest. It curb appetitie and elevate mood.<br><br>Phenylpropanolamine is also like amphetamines or stimulants.<br><br>The above mentioned drugs mostly increase serotonin in brain, curb appetite and elevate mood. However, they have various level of side effects and dependcy problems.<br><br>I heard the latest one is called Xenical, yet I discourage its use. It seems this drug is for seriously obese people. All of these drugs must be taken under supervision.<br><br>b) Exercise<br>Good idea, even for skinny people. Buld your body mass and muscle. For people intending to go on exercise regime, please consult a PT trainer. Exercise doesnt mean just warm up and run off. You might do it wrongly, and overexert your body. For light exercise, especially old people and pregnant women, Walk 2 click burns roughly 100 calories. Start with one click in one day, lasting 15 minutes, then build up the pace and increase the distance. Walking before meal can helps curb appetite.<br><br>c)Nutrition theraphy and diet.<br>Goes along with exercise. Now beside properly planned diet which I would not explain here, (cos it damn leceh) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> , nutrition theraphy is the mainstay of all weight management programmes. Why weight management, and not weight loss? Underweight people need to build up body mass and muscle too. So weight management balance the body weight and mass ,as well as maintaining it.<br><br>On the market, there are emergence of many weight management products. These type of products are recommended because of the following reasons.<br><br>Does not contain drugs. Usually those that pass through HSA are certified drug free.<br><br>Natural ingredients. Also, because these contain calories and other nutrients, they replaces meals. Like for example, taking maybe one packet of these products mixed with drinks act as a meal, as well as appetite curber (so that you wont go munching on snacks). Plus they give you calories, and therefore energy to enable you to carry on your daily programme. At the same time these products burn fats, but you still must eat at least one balanced meal a day<br><br>Safe effective. Some are used by hospitals.<br><br>They are weight management, not weight loss products, therefore, ideal for people of all weight and body fats, even for people who wish to maintain weight. These products complement your meals and body metabolism, unlike drugs which produce drastic change in your body.<br><br>HOWEVER, many people look for the wrong ones. You must dicern between Very Low Calorie Diet VLCD and Medium Low Calorie Diet<br><br>VLCDs in the market has one con point, which is that they induce  calorie intake of between 500 - 800 calories. This is below normal body requirement, and people develop rapid weight loss. The body will then experience a shock. There are high risks of epilepsy and fatigue. This can be experienced after long term usage.<br><br>The following are the side effects too. Lowering of metabolic rate as body system kicks in to reduce calorie burning rate. Yo yo phenomenon as VLCDs do not change bad eating habits. loss of lean muscle due to body using muscle protein as energy. This results in fatigue.<br><br>What bad eating habits can VLCDs induce?. Full liquid diet. Coz the products are liquid diet by itself, going totally without eating at least a balanced meal can cost people unable to regain habit of eating. Very dangerous.<br><br>MLCDs provide more than 1000 calories a day, long term effectiveness, gradual weight loss or gain, no side effects, no medical supervision and taken with normal meals<br><br>End<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Weight gainers are NOT pills. They are just proteins(whey blah blah) and carbs(maltodetrine blah blah). And i did not say they have no side effects, I said no serious side effects thats gonna put in a wheelchair or burst ur arteries or something. And for the slim 10 thingy, it wasnt a case of allergy, it was a case of the pill containing banned substances, I dont think u can get allergic to proteins and carbs anyway. But if u really think manufactured weight gainers are gonna land u in a situation where u have to take medication for life becauze the protein and carbs attacked your immune system, u can make your own weight gainers consisting of whey..oatmeal blah blah and mixing them with water..get other high in protein food and ur own ur way to gaining weight.<br><br>Yes, i do agree with u that looking for a nutrition expert is the best way to go but it doeznt fit him cauze he's worried about the financial part of weight gaining and nutrition experts advice dont come cheap.<br><br>I could eat 10 meals a day and becoming one giant fat blop or I can eat 1/2 a meal a day and be like a lamp post and still think that its my <span style="font-style: italic;">natural </span>weight.

            <div class='col-md body'>i almost took weight gainers and have a whole bunch of frenz who did<br>so i think i do have some more fatually true info about weight gainers<br>my take is to try not to take....<br><br>1) there ARE side effects<br>all weight gainers are very heaty<br>and you will have gulp down tons and tons of water<br>if not you will fall sick<br>another thing is that lots of ppl suffer from pimple outbursts<br>it you don<br><br>2) yea, supposedly weight gainers are purely protein (whey or anything else)<br>but for those who do know about biotechnology, the separation (filtration, distillation sort of crap) process aren't that good<br>especially when they are trying to cut down costs (bloody lots competition between GNC and the rest of the brands)<br>regulation is not as tight as it seems even in Singapore<br>so don't rely on government regulation<br>if u insist on taking, take only the more established brands<br><br>3) though weight gainers seem just like harmless proteins, you must not that it is not just what you take in but the quantity you take in<br>for those of your who studied bio, you should know that taking weight gainers will upset the natural balance in your body...<br>a lot of this protein is not absorbed<br>and people get stuff like brown pee.. from the excess protein<br>people who live long term on this stuff get kidney failure (some All Blacks guy died i think)<br><br>just remember, there are effective alternatives to weight gainers<br>adjusting your normal diet can do wonders!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>another thing, once you start on weight gainers, it's very likely that you will move on to worse stuff like creatine, adroxine and the latest stuff on the market, all these with all the potency (including side effects)<br><br>P.S. this stuff is not cheap  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> go spend the money on your galfren  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Got very useful; tips on mass gaining.<br>Also if possible read up on nutrition and gym alike from the libary.<br>The basic rules to weight gaining is to consume more calories than you would have spent.<br><br>For example a normal calories intake for an adult is about 2000 TO 2500 JOULES (IF i'M NOT MISTAKEN) per day. Any excess to that amout will be deemed as excess and excess equal to additional weight.<br><br>however weight gaining is more to that described as above, cos excess calories intake most often will result in gaining more fat than than pure mass.(remember do not use your weight as a judgement of weight gain cos muscle is heavier than fat)<br><br>The point is really simple, it all depends on what type of mass you want to gain in, fat or muscle?<br>The latter calls for weight trainng with a sound diet of high protien and carbo.<br><br>Its really a complicated process of nutritioning and exercise though if you ask me thats y I suggest you read up on some health or weight training magazines.<br><br>All is not loss though remember dun overdo anything, treat it as a trial and error process of nutritioning and exercising, and have fun doing it!!!</div>
