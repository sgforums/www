            <div class='col-md body'>i tried to eat so many stuff but still dont work. that's y i'm thinking of these weight gainers. it's just an xtra calorie provider, coz i believe i hav high metabollic rate. i get hungry easily but not much appetite.<br><br>of coz i dunno abt side effects coz i tot it's juz milk. juz like milo! i know it's expensive but i will do anything to put on weight.<br><br>so if there are side effects, how serious it is??? i mean weight gainer is simply made of carbs and similiar to powdered milk. this info is new to me.<br><br>ps:my shoulder is wider than my hips. i've got the mucsles but not the meat.</div>
