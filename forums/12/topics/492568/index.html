              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Hi all. This is a issue I wish to seek advice on, please no rude or insulting comments alright. I will not be listing names or anything here.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">So last year in june 2015, this guy posted a "work from home" job and I responded. At first, it out turned out normal and I wanted to know more. He asked me to communicate on skype and i did. We communicated via the webcam but it slowly turned very weird and creepy when he started asking me very sexual questions, to which I responded very coldly. When i tried leaving, he threatened me saying he has a video of me on camera and would post it online if I didnt listen to his demands. I was only 16 then. I got really scared so I did whatever he asked me to. He proceeded to take out his dick and masturbated on camera, forcing me to watch by "showing my face" but i closed my eyes most of the time. He promised me cash, I never got it but thats besides the point.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">After the first time, he started sending me very lewd messages like "watch me take out my cock and shake" and many more stuff. I said "no" countless of times but he was relentless. It got to the point where he said he wanted to meet, and he would delete the video he recorded of me on camera. I agreed to that and got a few of my friends to come. He never showed up and blocked me.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">A year later on 3april 2016, he messaged me again asking for blowjobs and to watch him "live". I declined all and told him i would report him to the police if he continued. He continued taunting me and even said "I still have the video of you and I watch it sometimes" I told him to delete it but he never replied. He made a lot more sexual comments and I was very traumatised and would continuously search online if he really did post the video. Why didn't I go the police? I wanted to but was so very afraid of what would happen. I've been through so much because of him and if the police were to come haunting me, I dont know if i would have been able to take it.</span></p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">Recently, I realised how I was avoiding this issue so much and it was affecting me very badly. My story was posted on an app, its not a social networking app, not facebook not twitter not instagram, not even a blog or anything, in hopes to somehow find any other girls who have contacted him via his job post because he did ask me "were you the one im supposed to transfer $380" to when I first contacted him. screenshots of the conversations with him and my story was. His phone number and the name he gave me (will not say it here) were posted which was the only info about him. I still have the screenshots and conversations with him. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">I guess after that post, some people got very agitated and sent him him threatening messages or sth which I had no idea of. The only intention of that was to seek out other girls who might have been affected. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">He made a police report against me using my phone number and others who threatened him as well. calling it harrassment. He posted it on Facebook and I saw it. What should I do or not do now? Should I make a police report against him as well? I have evidence of him threatening to circulate the video online and many more sexual and insulting comments, would that be enough? I just don't want the police coming at my door, prefer it if my parents didnt know.</p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;">If you study law or you're a police officer, or if you've been through the same experience, or anything, do help or give advice! im kinda desperate now. I called up a few pro bono hotlines i found, some say I should report against him as im a victim, some say i should ignore it since according to them, the police will just drop the case. </p>
              <p style="line-height: 19.696px;"><span style="line-height: 1.231;">Really at a loss now, have been crying so much these few months sigh. Please help! :(</span></p>

              <p>I'm really curious.</p>
              <p>I presume you both are on webcam, supposedly talking about a job and he took a screen capture of it. It doesnt seem to be anything you need to be afraid of if it does leak or anything.</p>
              <p>I mean, you are just there. fully clothed, maybe looking abit stunned/shocked that's all. It shouldnt be something that U need to worry about.</p>
              <p>So why worry?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Tat said, you should go to the police if he is causing you so much trauma with his harrassment.</p>

              <p>Hi Guys,</p>
              <p>I need some help.</p>
              <p>I visited a girl , who i found on craiglist, at  a hotel. On reaching the hotel, we just sat aound chatting for a while. Then, things got a little intimate, but we never had sex. It was just light cuddling and kissing. Nothing more. I had made it clear to her before meeting itself that i was not looking for sex ( sent her an explicit message). I left within 30 min. However, i did pay her some amount just for the time and company. </p>
              <p>As i was leaving the hotel, the staff stopped me and asked me if i knew the girl. I said she was a friend who i met online. They asked me my name and contact number, as they were suspecting some illegal activity going on in that room (they saw a lot of guys entering that room on cctv) and that they might call me if they need help/info. </p>
              <p>Since i never had sex , or never intended to (i have proofs of this interms of sms), did i do something illegal by visiting her? Did i break any law? I have been freaking out ever since this episode happened and have been sleepless at nights.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is there a cause for concern? </p>
              <p>Appreciate your help and advice in this matter. </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Yes just go to the police, if not the police will come knocking on your door since he reported you. the police will your keep your identity confidential, so don't worry. You should not be afraid of the video he have of you, you did not do anything indecent in the video, furthmore, he is unlikely to post that video of you, the video post as a evidence against him.</p>
              <p>Why are so afraid of letting your parents know? your parents will definately help you. Maybe a few nagging or so, but your parents are surely there to support you. </p>
