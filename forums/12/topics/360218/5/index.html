              <p>Women and Men are hardwired in very different ways.</p>
              <p>I noticed men likes to talk things in a rational and logical
              manner, while women like to talk about feelings and etc.</p>
              <p>Why do men like to go to IT shows, like fast cars and like to
              play games? while women are into Desperate Housewives, Soup Operas,
              and Oprah Winfrey?</p>
              <p>because it boils down to the topic of choice.</p>
              <p>An IT show gives you things in a 'straight forward' manner,
              which guys naturally prefer. Whereas the two ladies in the corner
              can talk about anything in the sun for hours, because why?</p>
              <p>they like to bring emotions into the frame, whereas us men(i'm
              guilty of that sometimes) prefer to take things at face value.</p>
              <p>Whenver i speak to a girl, I don't talk to them like when i talk
              to a guy. I bring out another set of conversation topics which
              elicits a positive emotional response from them.</p>
              <p>Telling stories that is a good way to continue the conversation,
              just like how Russel Peters, Dave Chapelle, or the legendary
              comedian George Carlin does it. Mirror their body language, the
              extra sound effects and such.</p>
              <p>However i would like to point out that asking questions like "Do
              you believe in God", things which requires some form of scientific
              proof or validation may only do well in a conversation with a women
              of higher education background.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, stick to easy topics which everyone can identify
              with. for example "Who cheats more? men or women?" I've tried this
              many times and never has it failed me.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>i think i can relate to that, being emo. thx for the suggestions but to ask someone whom i just know, especially to a girl, who cheats more, men or women, hmmm?</p>

              <p>but seriously, since u r talkative, i dun see why u cant find an interesting topic to talk about. And awkward silence is good, sometimes through the awkwardness u can see who takes the initiative. N u might find that u can click with that person more then anyone else. Then u go from there.</p>
              <p>No definite rules. The worst is seeing someone trying to fit into a conversation and lame attempts at trying to get the surrounding people's attention. Normally the quiet ones will notice that, and so does the people who are more sensitive.</p>
              <p>Somtimes its good to just sit there, observe, feed on the topics and then later, if ur mind is fast and creative, u can think of something to talk about , butt in or just be a smart ass. hahaha .</p>
