              <p>mm what i feel personally is that she wants me to always take the initiative to talk to her. but in my perspective its really tiring, i mean she could at least say hi when we see each other right, that isnt much to expect at least from a friend, its not like we do not know each other, cause we spoke before.</p>
              <p>ok so i assume that shes not really interested in talking to me then she shouldnt really suddenly change her attitude when i talk to her.</p>

              <p>mm to me yes i find it abit turn off. i mean lets say u talked to someone before, although u only chatted briefly but to you dont u already regard them as a friend? to me i feel that its only normal to say hi the next time when u see each other, instead of ignoring them until they come up to u.</p>
              <p>what u mean im v childish isit, diaoz.</p>
