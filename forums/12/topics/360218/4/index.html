              <p>i've been facing this problem for quite some time now. whenever i'm around with girls,  i usually keep quiet cause i dont know what to say to them. What do girls like to talk about in general? Please dont give me crap answers like Sex etc, thank you.</p>
              <p>i'm definitely not an unapproachable and act cool type of guy. I smile whenever i can, i laugh at jokes out loud even when i might be the only one around who find them to be funny. i'm a happy go lucky type of guy. I'm approachable but sometimes just dont take enough initiatives to talk, only to girls. I have no problems clicking with new guy friends but currently facing problems with girls. I can say hello, hi to them, but thats the farthest i can go. Have been in awkward situations where it seems like the girls were just waiting for me to speak up, but i really have no clue what to talk about with them so it might appear to them that im either just ignoring them or not interested to talk, i'm quite an emo guy so i actually care about how they feel.</p>
              <p>i've came across this quote somewhere in the buddhist forum section which i found to be very insightful: <strong>Sometimes one creates a dynamic impression by saying something, and sometimes one creates as significant an impression by remaining silent</strong>. So usually i dont actually speak much unless im with my closer friends. Any sincere advices would be appreciated much, thanks.</p>

              <p><br>I think your problem lies in taking it easy because you are lazy and prefer to throw the responsibility of having a good conversation into natural course.</p>

              <p>Women and Men are hardwired in very different ways.</p>
              <p>I noticed men likes to talk things in a rational and logical manner, while women like to talk about feelings and etc.</p>
              <p>Why do men like to go to IT shows, like fast cars and like to play games? while women are into Desperate Housewives, Soup Operas, and Oprah Winfrey?</p>
              <p>because it boils down to the topic of choice.</p>
              <p>An IT show gives you things in a 'straight forward' manner, which guys naturally prefer. Whereas the two ladies in the corner can talk about anything in the sun for hours, because why?</p>
              <p>they like to bring emotions into the frame, whereas us men(i'm guilty of that sometimes) prefer to take things at face value.</p>
              <p>Whenver i speak to a girl, I don't talk to them like when i talk to a guy. I bring out another set of conversation topics which elicits a positive emotional response from them.</p>
              <p>Telling stories that is a good way to continue the conversation, just like how Russel Peters, Dave Chapelle, or the legendary comedian George Carlin does it. Mirror their body language, the extra sound effects and such.</p>
              <p>However i would like to point out that asking questions like "Do you believe in God", things which requires some form of scientific proof or validation may only do well in a conversation with a women of higher education background.</p>
              <p>Otherwise, stick to easy topics which everyone can identify with. for example "Who cheats more? men or women?" I've tried this many times and never has it failed me.</p>

              <p>im quite a talkative guy, cant stand awkward silences so i will keep trying to keep the conversations going, even if the other person isnt responding much, cause i know some ppl takes longer to warm up to new friends but this only works for guy friends.
