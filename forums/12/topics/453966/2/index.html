              <p>Trouble is, the girl never say "I don't like you". She just flip flop and give the guy the wrong vibes.</p>

              <p>Why?</p>
              <p>1) It makes her feel wanted when a guy pursues her. Her market value goes up.</p>
              <p>2) If she harshly rejects him - it would make her look bad in front of everybody. Her image would go down.</p>

              <p>I don't have exact answers to all the doubts. I can only make comparison based on my observations.</p>
              <p>I think, it has a lot to do with our culture and what our society expects a lady to behave.</p>
              <p>Girls in Asia r expected to be less opinionated, less outwardly expressive about their likes and dislikes than guys. You'll notice that when a girl become outspoken, she is quickly smacked down by guys and attempts to silence her "noise" is swift and strong. Hence a lot of females become cryptic and/or passive aggressive.</p>
              <p>However, in the USA, girls r allowed to express themselves, and guys here seems ok with that. So, the girls in USA speak up, they have no qualms telling the guys to "knock it off!" or basically tell them to F off. </p>
              <p>If u want girls to speak up n clearly on their inner thoughts, then o ur society need to encourage freedom of expressions. Not a likely to happen as long as obedience and subservience are still highly coveted virtues in a woman.</p>

              <p>PICTURES: SHIN MIN DAILY NEWS</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Report: <strong>VALERIE KOH</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>AFTER eight years of marriage, she handed her husband the divorce papers last October.</p>
              <p>  The break-ups was anything but amicable, and on May 7, it took a nasty, violent turn.</p>
              <p>  The husband, Calvin, 37 drove to his wife's motor workshop in Sin Ming in a rage.</p>
              <p>  He stormed into the workshop, grabbed a chair and hurled it onto the floor.</p>
              <p>  Said his wife, Mindy, also 37: "He was shouting, 'If you want to play, I'll play with you'."</p>
              <p>  The New Paper is not using the couple's real names as they have yet to finalise their divorce.</p>
              <p>  When an employee, Mr Melvin Foo, 25 approached him, Calvin walked out of the workshop.</p>
              <p>  Once outside, he entered his black Peugeot.</p>
              <p>  But instead of driving off, he rammed his car into three second-hand cars - a BMW, a Mazda and a Volkswagen - parked outside waiting to be sold.</p>
              <p>  The incident was captured on closed-circuit TV.</p>
              <p>  Mr Foo said that after the rampage, Calvin came out of his car and confronted him.</p>
              <p>  "He challenged me to a fight and provoked me. We quarrelled for five to 10 minutes," he said.</p>
              <p>  During the commotion, Mindy remained in her office and called her father-in-law and brother-in-law.</p>
              <p>  "I wanted his family to see for themselves what he was like," she told TNP yesterday.</p>
              <p>  Mindy said Calvin remained agitated throughout the incident and hurled insults at her.</p>
              <p>  When police officers arrived and took Calvin's statement, he broke down in tears, Mr Foo recounted.</p>
              <p>  Mindy said that it has not been easy dealing with the aftermath of the incident.</p>
              <p>  "I was fine on the first two days, but on the third day, I broke down," she said.</p>
              <p>  "I don't understand how he could do such a thing to me. We've been together for so long"</p>
              <p>  She said it cost her $50,000 to repair the damaged cars.</p>
              <p>  She believes her husband's rage was sparked by her decision to stop paying for the instalments on the purchase of his car, which was bought in the company's name.</p>
              <p>  The couple used to run the company together before their break-up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="line-height: 115%; color: red; font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-family: Calibri;">Text message</span></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>  Mindy said Calvin had shown up at the workshop soon after he sent her a text message to ask why she had defaulted on the payment for his car.</p>
              <p>  She told TNP that since he had left the company, she felt there was no need to continue paying for the car on his behalf.</p>
              <p>  TNP could not get Calvin's reason for the rampage as he spoke only briefty over the phone yesterday evening before saying he had to visit his sick mother in hospital.</p>
              <p>  Mindy said she started the business in 2002, a year after she and Calvin started dating.</p>
              <p>  The company was initially registered under his cousin's name, but after the couple got married in 2004, the ownership was transferred solely to her husband while she continued working there.</p>
              <p>  After their split last year, she moved out of their maisonette in Balestier to her friend's home in Punggol. She also left the company.</p>
              <p>  "I offered to stay and help, but he told me to go," she said.</p>
              <p>  But months later, Calvin changed his mind and pleaded for her to return, she claimed.</p>
              <p>  She said she agreed to do so to protect the company's reputation.</p>
              <p>  During TNP's brief interview with Calvin, he gave a different account.</p>
              <p>  He said Mindy had asked to return and that he agreed only after she contacted frequently over the matter.</p>
              <p>  "I transferred the company to her out of goodwill in February this year," he said.</p>
              <p>  When probed further, he claimed to have done so to allow for a clean split.</p>
              <p>  Mindy also claimed thatv Calvin had cheated on her with another woman.</p>
              <p>  When asked about the matter, Calvin admitted to committing adultery, but said he had done so to facilitate their divorce.</p>
              <p>  Divorce proceedings are long drawn-out affairs, he said, so he cheated on his wife to end things cleanly and quickly.</p>
              <p>  Mindy said she hired a private investigator (PI) to keep tabs on her husband after they separated.</p>
              <p>  Her two handphones are full of photographs of the alleged mistress, whom she claims is from China, and Calvin togther.</p>
              <p>  They were taken by the PI, she said, as she showed TNP the images.</p>
              <p>  Calvin started going to China for holidays with his friends in 2009, but she never suspected anything amiss.<br>  <br>  "I would even tell him jokingly not to have flings." she said.</p>
              <p>  Mindy also showed TNP scores of text messages from him.</p>
              <p>  In some messages, Calvin would ask for favours. Other messages were spiteful, containing insults and vulgarities.</p>
              <p>  She said he would send her multiple messages every day since their break-up.</p>
              <p>  Two days ago, her Facebook account was hacked by someone who posted a message claiming that her company was going bankrupt and cease operating next month.</p>
              <p>  She said she suspected that Calvin was behind this, claimng that he had previously sent text messages to their customers, informing them of the impending closure.</p>
              <p>  This could not be verified with Calvin, but he also made several accusations about Mindy.</p>
              <p>  Among them: She has been harassing him at their Balestier home, ringing the doorbell late at night, shouting at him and frightening him and his mother.</p>
              <p>  Mindy, in turn, alleged that when she returned home to collect her belongings, the locks had been changed, barring her from entry.</p>
              <p>  The couple will meet in court next week as their divorce proceedings continue.</p>
