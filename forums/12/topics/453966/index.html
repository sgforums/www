              Can someone give me some advise?
              
              Is like there is girl one year my junior amd I like her, but then she rejected me saying that she will only make me hurt as she don't know how to love someone. But I really love her amd wanna get into a relationship with her and if possible even marry her.
              
              Cos of that I'm very stressed up as i.don't know what to do, cos I know that she has a little feelings for me as she's been posting on Facebook, Twitter saying thing like, she can't love anyone. Also she's somewhat similar to me in the sense like family problems and relationship problem.
              
              Cos of this thing it is affecting me greatly I don't have the mood to eat or do anything proper. And just today, I took my stress out on my friends, just cos they said they're tired n can't do project.
              
              Someone please do help me, or I may end up losing all my friends. Is there any suggestion so that I can be together with her? I don't mind if I may end up getting hurt. I just wanna be with her. Cos I do understand how she feels as I'm similar to her

              But thing is how should I tell her my feelings once again? She told me she's not good enough for me, she will only hurt me. But I kust don't think that way.

              Do you feel that she is good enough for you?
              If yes, tell her how you feel let her feel more about herself.
              Because I think she feels inferior..that's y she feels that isn't good enough.

              Firstly, before you go all crying and weeping on how you got
              rejected, please think of her feelings. The notion of &lt;being
              unable to love someone&gt; is a very deep one. If you really
              sincerely wish to be with her as you said, are you willing to go

              her insecurities?<br>
              <br>
              Honestly speaking, I don't think you are ready for a relationship
              as you don't even think for her fjeelings. How can you even say you
              love her?<br>
              <br>
              And you gotta ask yourself, why do you think you want to be in a
              relationship with her?</p>

              I.believe that I can erase her insecurities, as I did help.her a lot n she's better alr.  I'm also confident that I can tahan it.
              
              I dint know why do I even fall for her...I m thinking of getting back the ftiendship w her again. I wanna give it a try. To say the truth, I intemd to write like a letter n past it to her but then thing is how?
