              <p>Just want to share my story, pointing out the dirty doings of our ICA.</p>
              <p>I have a girlfriend that resides in Thailand. Last week she came to Singapore for the 2nd time but was deported back to Thailand. She was here looking for me but Immigration at Changi Airport stop her and refuse her entry in Singapore. She told them the reason and gave my contact number so that ICA could call to verify. Instead ICA put her in the waiting room for a long 6 hours and arrange a flight for her to go back Thailand. I did not received any phone calls from her after she was stop by the customs, they confiscated her phone and ICA did not give me a single call for the whole duration.</p>
              <p>On my side, I've been waiting for her arrival at the airport and notice that almost everyone from that flight had already exit the arrival hall except me. So I approach the information counter and asked for help, they told me she could be probably be held back at the Immigration side and gave me a number to call. So I did, i called about 200 times (this is not exaggerating, my iphone was at 95% and it went down to 20%) and there is no one to pick up, information counter said they could do nothing at all because they are not directly related with the ICA people, I did all I could, even approaching the security there, even the police refuses to help, saying that "it is not my job to help you, please go away". I was frustrated and helpless, it was suppose to be at 12.40am flight arrival time and i waited till morning 7am and still, no one was able to help me. So i went home and keep dialing the immigration office till about 11am, still no one answered the phone nor a call from ICA.</p>
              <p>Moments after, my girlfriend called me from Thailand that she is already back at home as ICA rejected her entry. I asked her why ICA do that, she says that ICA insisted her reason to Singapore was false and refuse to listen to her even her repetition of telling ICA she was here looking for me and could call me if they don't believe her. So at 6am, they escort her to board the plane without further questions and telling her she could not enter Singapore and will be given a warning that she is not allowed to re-entered Singapore for the next 6 months and chop her passport. It was the first time she encounter this incident, she felt helpless as well and tried to talk back to the ICA but they are that she has insufficient proof that I am her boyfriend.</p>
              <p>My main concern is,</p>
              <p>1. Why are ICA allowed to do things freely according to their "instinct" ?</p>
              <p>2. Where is the official proof from ICA that she is lying?</p>
              <p>3. There is no verification call to me from ICA.</p>
              <p>4. I waited like a fool outside the hall and totally helpless and not a single person could help.</p>
              <p>Putting aside our known mentality that most Thailand people came to singapore to seek jobs officially/unofficially, she is genuinely my spouse and I have every proof to show that we are in a relationship. If my girlfriend were to be a English or American, will ICA stop them? I would surely think no. This is a violent racist act against Thailand people, or probably some other nations as well, what angers me most is that I called ICA HQ this morning, the officer told me "the customs has every right to reject a person entry to singapore without any reason given, they have to accept it". Where is the transparency we have here?  Now that we are separated for 6 months, I'm not sure how we could deal with the emotional stress.</p>

              <p>When ICA places restrictions like this, people complain that it's racist.</p>
              <p>When ICA goes easy a bit, people complain that they are allowing in social ills. Don't believe me? I refer you to <a href="/forums/3518/topics/414909">this thread</a>.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>It happens EVERYWHERE. It’s called profiling.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Just like in USA, they tend to think all Asian girls are ‘working girls’. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>The customs officers actually ‘test’ you with questions to see if they are telling you the truth. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>I hate to do this but I switch to my American accent just to talk to them so that they will say “Oh you sound like a local” because they have this belief that Asians speak really terrible English (I kid you not. I still get remarks that it’s wonderful to speak to an Asian who can speak English in an accent they understand!)</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>Like the last time I had to fly through Detroit to go to Canada and the customs officer was asking so much questions and I half suspect he didn’t believe I was there for real work meetings. The good thing was that he used to be a trader at the CBOT that I was able to talk to him about commodities and the shift in market trend and how the fundamentals no longer influence the market that much anymore etc</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif";'>And he did make a comment before I left the counter that they don’t see much women in the line of work I’m in. </span></p>

              <p>I am sorry, but you lost my respect the moment you charge "racism"</p>
              <p>What makes you think that the ICA officers are "racists" ?</p>
              <p>You
               said that they acted on their insticts, and yet you lambasted them for 
              "racism" based on your own instict and prejudice that they acted out of 
              racism.</p>
              <p>What is this ?</p>
              <p>What gives you the right to insult them like that ?</p>
              <p>I think you are being childish and immature.</p>
              <p>To
               be honest with you, I think ICA officers did act based on suspiscion, 
              but not one based on racism suspicions, rather, one based on 
              anti-prositution filter.</p>
              <p>Your girlfriend fit the profile of a prostitute.</p>
              <p>A young single female who has been a "dancer" at a nightclub.</p>
              <p>One look and anyone would suspect that she is a hooker.</p>
              <p>You said, what about if someone is from America and Britain ?</p>
              <p>So you turned this into a racial issue.</p>
              <p>I answer it this way :</p>
              <p>What if the person is a Thai but is an old man dressed in business suit, or is a grandma.</p>
              <p>Will the ICA turn them back and deport them?</p>
              <p>No.</p>
              <p>Maybe you should ask the thousands of Thai visitors who have entered Singapore repeatedly without any problems.</p>
              <p>So
               instead of understanding the issue at hand, you become immature and you
               think ICA officers are racists. This is all without any proof 
              whatsoever. Did your girlfriend say anything about ICA officers saying 
              any words or any gestures which hinted racism? No proof and no nothing 
              but yet suddenly in your mind you think they are racists. This actually 
              proves that it is you yourself who is actually a racist. Otherwise why 
              would you be so racially obsessed.</p>
              <p>So please shove it and stop being so immature.</p>

              Wah you all very jia lak leh... TS I think under went huge emotional stress (put yourself in his shoes lah, wait a person for 6 hours, make more than 30 phone calls without any response - same like calling singtel customer service lah say not their problem this and that, etc).
              
              Maybe I am just bias against Singapore authorities lah. Alot of bad impressions based on previous experience, like a police officer acting like gangster (coz we play soccer at basketball court), then he call for backups, another 3 police cars came, really stupid case if not for the fact that the guai lan face police act gangster to scare us. Now I understand play soccer at basketball is a criminal offence along the scale of murdering someone, need 4 police cars...
