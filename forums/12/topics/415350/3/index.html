              <p>When my thai gf (now my wife) came last Sept, she almost got 
              deported. I waited more than half an hour but she never came out. Me and
               my family started to worry. I saw her luggage at the floor by the 
              luggage belt assigned to her flight. But luckily I got the ICA airport 
              office number from the information counter and called them, a lady 
              picked up and I explained that I was waiting for my fiancee and that we 
              were getting married in Singapore a few days later. She said my fiancee 
              is now in their office and they are doing some verification and she told
               me to call back in 30 minutes time.</p>
              <p>After 30 minutes, I called again, the same lady said my fiancee will be 
              coming out in 5 minutes and indeed, she came out in 5 minutes. Me and my family were so relieved.</p>
              <p>My
               fiancee told me 2 thai 
              ladies may be deported, one came with her boyfriend who looked like 
              Singaporean (they are getting married in Singapore about a month later),
               another one came to find her thai husband who is working in Singapore 
              (they are husband and wife in thailand).</p>
              <p>As me and my fiancee 
              walked away, I saw the boyfriend leaving the hall alone, he looked 
              really sad. The husband stood by the glass door, still waiting.</p>
              <p>2 other thai ladies were held up too, but they got through because they have work permit.</p>
              <p>So a total of 5 thai ladies including my wife were held up.</p>
              <p>I
               was afraid something like this might happen so prior to her arrival, I 
              gave my wife my NRIC information, contact number and notice of marriage,
               but the officers did not contact me nor verify the notice of marriage 
              as my wife tried to explain to them.</p>
              <p>Sometime after the incident, I
               learned from a friend that it's better to inform ICA first before 
              asking my fiancee to come, like what one of the forumers mentioned, be 
              held responsible if she did something wrong. I was lucky.</p>
              <p>But then
               again, I'm not sure of the criteria used by the officers to determine 
              who to stop and who to allow, but holding only thai ladies doesn't seem 
              right to me or maybe I'm missing out something.</p>

              <p>relax lah brother, we are just talking about our immigration policies. Like it or not, ICA go by the quota of foreigner gals being caught for doing pros, social visit overstayed or working without workpermit. Once their data show that thai gals are the most for this month, they start to screen thai gal more than the other gals, and if next month PRC gals get caught more than thai, they will screen the PRC gals more seriously. This is how it work, i got ICA top officers coming to my legal pub to drink, they told me and sometime give me tips...So guys, if you see many thai gal get into trouble at the immigration, call your PRC gal to come, and if PRC gal get into trouble, call your thai gf to come..you need to hv few gfs or wifeys to enjoy ya.</p>
              <p>Dun wan to marry Sg gal, sure suffer a bit wan lah.</p>
              <p>Oh, another thing, an agent told me, if you want your F gfs or wifeys to pass thru immigration smoothly, he advice them to take SIA.</p>
