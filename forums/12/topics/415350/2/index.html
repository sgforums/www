              <p>elindra, i also don't think ICA will do that, thats why i question her thoroughly. She is honestly not coming here to work, plainly just looking for me, paid for her air tickets, i just tell her to tell the truth, becoz there isn't anything to hide. As far as i know, she is surely clean from customs.</p>

              <p>ICA - will be happy to earn all the tourist dollar they can. I have friends and relavtives that visit singapore every few month totally no issues.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think before your call ICA dirty make sure your own girlfriend is "clean" first ! I think for this case - you are definitely going to end up slapping yourself in the face.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think there is more then meet the eye - possible she have some sort of "records" which end up she may be on the blacklist.</p>
              <p>As like you say - as far as you know ? What are the you don't know that is blocking her entry !</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ICA are right not to call you to verify - as i am sure every case there will be people to verify !</p>
              <p><br>Just do follow up action to try and see what reason she is being reject  and see if rejected.</p>

              <p>China, a favoured nation is not their target.  From the crime rate, we see there are more PRCs commiting crime in Singapore than other nationalities.     Just looking at crime alone, they are giving the impression that they foresee people from these countries will commit crime but not those from China.</p>

              <p>I hope i can provide you with some advice. Here goes:</p>
              <p>There are some ways to make your gf's entry to sg alot more smoother. Now, with your gf banned for 6 months, the immediate thing you can try to do is go down personally to ICA and seek help from the officers.</p>
              <p>You might be able to fill up some forms that request the entry of a particular person (your gf) and state how long is she staying, where is she staying (preferbly your home). If that is done, i believe she might have the chance to erase the 6 month ban immediatedly, though, i am not sure whether its possible.</p>
              <p>On yout gf's part, she should make it a point to memories all your particulars. Can she remember your birthday, your home address, your contact number etc? This are important during the questionings from the ICA officers. Little things like that determine whether they believe her or not.</p>
              <p>On your part, before her flight out of Thailand, you should send her a fax which contain the following to the ICA officers on her arrival:</p>
              <p>1. Your name</p>
              <p>2. NRIC</p>
              <p>3. Your request to the ICA to let this person enter for (any reasons u want to say)</p>
              <p>4. Your address and where will she be staying in sg</p>
              <p>5 Her relationship with you</p>
              <p>6. Your contact number</p>
              <p>7. Say thank u at the end of the fax</p>
              <p>Once your gf receive this fax, she should print it out and show it to the singapore ICA officer on her arrival. This can smooth her passport chop faster i believe. Remind her to also dress nicely, formally. And when approaching the ICA officers, choose the friendlier-looking officer!</p>
              <p>I hope u can see your gf again. Cheers.</p>

              <p>Just want to share my story, pointing out the dirty doings of our ICA.</p>
              <p>I have a girlfriend that resides in Thailand. Last week she came to Singapore for the 2nd time but was deported back to Thailand. She was here looking for me but Immigration at Changi Airport stop her and refuse her entry in Singapore. She told them the reason and gave my contact number so that ICA could call to verify. Instead ICA put her in the waiting room for a long 6 hours and arrange a flight for her to go back Thailand. I did not received any phone calls from her after she was stop by the customs, they confiscated her phone and ICA did not give me a single call for the whole duration.</p>
              <p>On my side, I've been waiting for her arrival at the airport and notice that almost everyone from that flight had already exit the arrival hall except me. So I approach the information counter and asked for help, they told me she could be probably be held back at the Immigration side and gave me a number to call. So I did, i called about 200 times (this is not exaggerating, my iphone was at 95% and it went down to 20%) and there is no one to pick up, information counter said they could do nothing at all because they are not directly related with the ICA people, I did all I could, even approaching the security there, even the police refuses to help, saying that "it is not my job to help you, please go away". I was frustrated and helpless, it was suppose to be at 12.40am flight arrival time and i waited till morning 7am and still, no one was able to help me. So i went home and keep dialing the immigration office till about 11am, still no one answered the phone nor a call from ICA.</p>
              <p>Moments after, my girlfriend called me from Thailand that she is already back at home as ICA rejected her entry. I asked her why ICA do that, she says that ICA insisted her reason to Singapore was false and refuse to listen to her even her repetition of telling ICA she was here looking for me and could call me if they don't believe her. So at 6am, they escort her to board the plane without further questions and telling her she could not enter Singapore and will be given a warning that she is not allowed to re-entered Singapore for the next 6 months and chop her passport. It was the first time she encounter this incident, she felt helpless as well and tried to talk back to the ICA but they are that she has insufficient proof that I am her boyfriend.</p>
              <p>My main concern is,</p>
              <p>1. Why are ICA allowed to do things freely according to their "instinct" ?</p>
              <p>2. Where is the official proof from ICA that she is lying?</p>
              <p>3. There is no verification call to me from ICA.</p>
              <p>4. I waited like a fool outside the hall and totally helpless and not a single person could help.</p>
              <p>Putting aside our known mentality that most Thailand people came to singapore to seek jobs officially/unofficially, she is genuinely my spouse and I have every proof to show that we are in a relationship. If my girlfriend were to be a English or American, will ICA stop them? I would surely think no. This is a violent racist act against Thailand people, or probably some other nations as well, what angers me most is that I called ICA HQ this morning, the officer told me "the customs has every right to reject a person entry to singapore without any reason given, they have to accept it". Where is the transparency we have here?  Now that we are separated for 6 months, I'm not sure how we could deal with the emotional stress.</p>

              <p><br>Firstly, you need to make sure that your Thai girlfriend was really on the flight to Singapore and she did arrived at Singapore Airport.</p>
              <p>Secondly, you need to tell us why she didn't try to contact you on her mobile phone, by calling or smses, to inform you about her predicament while she was being confined.</p>
              <p>As far as I know, ICA doesn't confiscate mobile phones. If ICA does that, they might also want to confiscate your girlfriend's virginity as well because she could be hiding an explosive device in her vagina.</p>
              <p>So, confiscating personal belongings is a very questionable doubt which you should implore further. Your personal belongings can only be confiscated or withheld by a Police officer and only when you have broken the law but definitely not when you were being held under suspect for illegal entry into a country. Only Police, not ICA people who does not have any form of authority to possess or repossess personal belongings.</p>
              <p>As long as she have a valid E-visa into Singapore which you could conveniently applied for her or she could have done it for herself, she can enter Singapore as a tourist without the need of declaring you as her boyfriend.</p>
              <p>And it's 12:40am arrival flight, ICA people are all almost half-sleepy already....why would they suddenly get so excited and awake to screen and detain your normal-looking Thai girlfriend?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But it's a nice story by the way if you're making this up, or you are being lied to by your Thai girlfriend.</p>
