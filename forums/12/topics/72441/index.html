Why did he go back before he put in for his PR application.. Hmm.. just realised.. it is not the PR application granting season unless you graduated in June. Anyway.. the point is.. he is.. SO OLD. Why let his parents manipulate him? Unless he needs his money. What makes you think that you can't go home tomorrow? Unless you are in different countries.<br><br>Talk to him.. Ask him if it is just his parents butting into your relationship of he genuinely doesn't love you anymore?<br><br>Basically long distance relationships are cumbersome.. and OH SO DIFFICULT to maintain. I can give you my exbf's number.. he will tell you all about it! Hehehe.. it was so painful.. so annoying.. such an awful experience. I've heard some people said they survived it.. but i'm not going back to it again.</div>
