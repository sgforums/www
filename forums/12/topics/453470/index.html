              <p>I know a friend just like Just Do It Lah. His father thought of a brilliant idea and then copyrighted it. From thereon the business flourished and then the father passed down the business to his sons. The son is able to marry a former miss world and live in big house with big car and many servants because of the father achievements.</p>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>Got Diploma in IT from MDIS, and was offered a job as Service Technician in Tai Seng. I was doing Sciences  this year, but thinking of switching to arts.</p>
              <p>I understand you concerns to business setup etc. as Singapore's startup is good, but I seriously buay tahan my "A" Levels anymore. I got some friends go through poly, 26 then NUS, some doing business startup. </p>
              <p>I got other frens who have migrated overseas and doing well down there. </p>
              <p>Worked a few labour jobs but realized I have academic talent on my side(I am JC alumni). </p>
              <p>The reason I am hardup for local U is because of my background. Both my parents well-educated and my Dad is doing good in his industry, so me stepping out into the workforce as a service technician might be a little awkward. </p>
              <p>My clear aim is Nanyang Business School or SMU Accountancy/Business</p>
              <p>I need an AAB for the above. I got 19 without CCA L1R5 during "O" Levels so I am confident of my ability.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any ideas?</p>
