Most guyz are able to get on with their lives so easily hey. Amazed. </div></blockquote>guys just try to act strong and most of the time they are successful. the only reason i'm in singapore is the girl i loved. i opted to stay for her and end up losing her and many other things even the way to go back. i don't regret that. she is the finest person that i have met so far .it has already been quite a long time but memories of her are still fresh. i just try to pretend strong and have a fake smile on my face and i'm the only one who knows the reality. after office i'm not in the mood to go home. i just roam around in this small island and when i'm tired i just go back and fall on the bed.<br>don't think that guys don't have feelings and emotions.<br>P.S. nobody will appease a weeping/crying guy as people would do for a girl. take my words for that</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well Miss.. i think that there are guys and gals alike who can just 'forget' a relationship just like that. as for me i can't. maybe it's because she's my first and only love? found her after like 19 years of my exciting but lonely life.been together since then but in this case she's more 'able' to let go of a relationship and continue with life unlike me. and what more i am the guy!! most times i feel i'm more emotional than her and that's bad..maybe it's cause my gal has gone thru 3 relationships excluding mine? sometimes i myself ask what u are asking and that's "why is that my gal can actually forget about it when the time comes instead of trying to salvage the relationship with me?" not that anything happened between us but from what i see, should anything happen, i'll be the one who get hurt much more than her.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm...so i guess guyz are juz able to conceal their emotions better than girls, but doesn't mean that they are less hurt, right??<br>Blame it on the society, or the way they are brought them, that guyz haf to try put on a strong front, esp at times when they feel vulnerable. It's not being hypocrite, it's juz the way man have learnt as they grow up. Something which i still find it hard to understand, but I juz haf to accept it. Maybe that's how man are supposed to be, i.e. stronger than woman, physically, mentally, emotionally?!<br><br>Whatever it is, doesn't matter which gender u r, esp if u r the one dumping a person, do try to show a little bit of compassion even if u no longer love the person. Try to understand that u may haf stopped loving the person long time ago, so it was easier for u to let go of the relationship, but it's not so easy on the person being dumped. Instead of ignoring the person completely, thinking that it will be easier on the person to forget abt u, haf a good talk and try to make the person understand that it is useless to carry on the relationship if one party stopped feeling the sparks. Takes two hands to clap. both parties haf to be happy, for a relationship to work. But NEVER, cut ties off completely and suddenly, and NEVER NEVER say "stay as frens", if back in ur mind, u don't intend to.<br>Don't say things which u don't mean it, juz to make the person happy for that moment. cos if the person does find out that u had lied, she/he will hate u for a longer period of time than she was happy. The world is small, esp in Spore, u will meet her one day, somewhere, some place. Not a nice sight, if she still can't forgive u for wat u did to her.<br><br>P/S. if my cooking was the problem, then...NEVER NEVER NEVER dump a person cos he/she can't cook. Enrol her in cooking classes instead....... Juz kidding. Cold sat morning makes me happy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most guys are poor listeners. Whenever you tell them about your breakup, they'll just go ya..., is it? really? But you did have a good bonk...right...at least...<br>But seriously they are not the least interested. Which is why women are better to talk to after a breakup. If you wish to have a good analysis that is.. If you want to have fun and forget about it, I'd say go out with the guys and have a ball.<br>I feel it's pretty good to analyse every break-up. Just so you have a rough idea of wat went wrong and try to make sure the next one turns out right. Just dun do it alone. Try discussing it with friends. Expose all details except for those in the bedroom unless of course they are close friends of yours. But the most important thing is to stop brooding and get over it. To pine for a lost love is a silly thing to do, esp if that person no longer loves you.</div>

I even flew back to Spore for a week juz to see him. Wasted my money. I din even bother to go clubbing. Wasted my time and opportunities to meet other pple. Anywayz, during tat week in spore, he asked for a break up. it's like we din even quarrel once before. and I even cooked dinner for him the day before the breakup. And after the mention of the break up, <strong>it took like 20missed calls to receive an sms from him. He asked me why i called so many times. So i said, if u answered the call the 1st time, I wouldn't need to call so many times rite?!!! </strong>Tsktsk. and the night before i was leaving spore, i asked if he could come over, he said OK. I waited the whole nite and he din come. Told me the next day that he fell asleep. wat the?!!! and i had to plead with him to send me off at the airport ok. another wt??!!! Feel so pathetic when I come to think of it. And I still haf no idea what went wrong.  Maybe my cooking was really bad... hehehe..[/b]</blockquote>no offence...but think u r the "sticky" type. do u call yr ex every now &amp; then ( as in a few calls a day?) cos some guys hated it (e.g. ME!!) and i really hated people who call non-stop...there must be some reason why a person didnt pick up a call (e.g.dont want to answer , not free to answer)<br><br>maybe he has another gal liao? did u ask him the reason for the breakup?</div>

Maybe I gave too much freedom, so he thot i din care abt him. aiya..it's over. Anywayz, I called him so many times that day cos I was leaving Spore the next day. It was my last chance that i could meet up with him so i called. Since then, i think i called him abt 2/3 times the following week, then later, i dun bother to call him anymore. now, we've lost contact.<br><br>I'm wondering.... After a breakup, should a couple remain friends or never to contact each other again?<br><br>If it's the latter, isn't it better for pple to be juz frens, then there won't be such thing as a  break up?? Have mutiple good frens then everyday is a happy day??!!! Person A breaks ur heart, go to Person B. Easy come, easy go....wat do u think??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>yeah , i think still can remain as a friend provided the other party wanted also...<br><br>just tell yrself that it is his loss for not "treasuring" u...there might be other guy out there more suitable for u.<br><br>he is not gentlemen enough to send u off in the airport...<br>u shd just forget abt him , keep yrself busy &amp; socialise more ( but dont rush into relationships yet)</div>
