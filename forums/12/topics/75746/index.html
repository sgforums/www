            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know what I am anymore. My EQ is low and I don't really like interacting with people. I prefer to stay in my room and keep to myself. I see myself as a heartless and emotionless jerk. There was a time when I was at my Grandmother's funeral. I didn't feel regret and I didn't feel sad, infact I didn't feel anything at all. I was still busy playing with my electronic Digivice toy I bought from 7-11 till the moment when the coffin was placed into the freshly digged hole, I didn't care either. When I saw my relatives crying, I asked myself. Why were they crying? What is there so sad to be about? Sometimes, I imagined what would I do if my mother, father or sister passed away. I didn't feel a thing and I didn't feel a thing either when people insulted me and my family but I do feel the rage not because they insulted me but because I wanted to get back at them.<br><br>There was a time in school, when my friend borrowed my newly bought Nokia 3650 to play with. He threatened to slam it on the floor and even threatened to use a screw driver to unscrew it. I didn't care, all I wanted to do was to get back my phone at all cost even if it means my phone is going to spoil. I hit him, I hit him real hard. I got back my phone but I am puzzled to this day why? Why didn't he hit me back or feel angry after that incident? I have a good friend, a really good friend indeed. When I was all alone doing a project work, he would even leave his group to join me because I was all alone. He would asked me out to play everynow and then, helped me with my homework and he would get back at people for me too. I don't know whether I treat him as a friend or am I just using him. I often treat people to drinks and I often lend things to people without terms and most oftenly, they wouldn't return me. I didn't mind, I really didn't mind at all. Then there was this time, I was at Orchard. A middle-age man came up to me to borrow $1 because he needed to go home, I gave it to him without question and 2 days ago there was this little boy that had lost his EZ-Link card to go home. A woman walked passed and just ignored him but I actually took out $2 before he even asked me.<br><br>I have a father, he is a nice person actually. He treats me pretty good and buys me whatever I wanted when I was young even when he does not have the money he would borrow from his friends to buy for me but everytime he goes out with his friends he would get drunk and start complaining, ranting and scolding my mother. I didn't know why but recently he got drunked and came to talked to me. I didn't know why, I shouted at him. I told him I was unlucky to have been born in this family. He was furious but after a while he broke down and said he had his own problems too and he cried. Its the first time I seen him cried. Am I in the wrong to shout at him? When I was young I remember he would beat me up with his belt and told me to knee down on the floor for no good reasons but still he treats me pretty good when he isn't drunk. I don't know anymore, everything is just so confusing. Am I truely a heartless and emotionless jerk?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
