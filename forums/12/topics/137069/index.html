            <div class='col-md body'>To minimise your pain during periods, stay away from cold food/drinks especially. Either consume warm or drinks at room temperature, you should feel much lesser pain when you're having your periods. Trust me, it makes a lot of difference when you stay away from cold drinks/food. Drink more water too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Avoid taking in too much meat and consume more vegetables and fruits in your daily diet. People who consumed more meat usually has a poorer tolerance and is more easily agitated than people who consume more vegetables and fruits.<br><br>Also take up an activity to relax yourself...be it singing, listening to music, movies, shopping and sleeping. Especially sleeping, make sure you have enough sleep and not less than 8hours everyday...else you'll feel stretched throughout the week when it ends.<br><br>Try to help yourself first before turning to a physician for help. Don't depend on medicine if you can solve it in a healthier manner.<br><br>I usually stay away from medicine cos it usually works on me for a few times before my body get used to the medicine and it doesn't works on me anymore...not to mention any potential side-effects that we may suffer in the future. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Ignore your brothers if you can...siblings are sometimes childish and wussy, cos they only dare to bully families and not those people on the streets.<br><br>Eat healthier and consume more plain water and take enough rest everyday. You should be feeling better in no time, try to pick up a hobby that doesn't requires any committment. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by princessdiana:</div><div class="quote_body">I have a feeling that all these cramps, headache and monthly mens really put female as a weaker sex.
