            <div class='col-md body'>My problem is a common one i guess. I bet you've heard it many times before, but the tension is killing me. I like a guy, who doesn't like me back.<br>I've tried everything to get over my crush. From giving myself hours of pep talks to beating up my pillow.<br>Basically, he is my close friend's cousin. We knew each other since last year but only became close since this year june. For some strange reason, he went out with me and my close friends, one fateful june day. Then after that, he got my number from my close friend and called me up.<br>From that day forth, we have never stopped talking. We have talked almost every night for about 1 to 2 hours. He did give me some FALSE hints on his feelings which i OBVIOUSLY misunderstood.<br>Because recently, he also started talking to another close friend of mine. Let's call her Sandy. Sandy invited him along to a trip in UK for ONE WHOLE MONTH and from then on, he's been talking about their holiday plans. How he's gonna try and sneak into her room at night.... don't worry, just for the company. How he's gonna hold her hand hug her like a bf hugs a gf. How they are gonna have so much fun... blah blah blah! He's now talking to her everyday and he's beginning to talk lesser to me.<br>We used to be quite close, but i really think he likes her as he keeps on telling me that he talks with her alot and how fun she is to talk to. Granted that she really cute and friendly, she really attracts guys like bees to honey. i am totally jealous now but there is no way in hell i am gonna admit that to him.<br>And of all things, i had to develop this stupid crush on him when he has no interest whatsoever in me! I can't eat, i can't sleep, and worst of all i can't study when my prelims are , not around the corner, but right in front of me!<br>What can i do to get over this crush. Ever time i think of them holding hands and giggling and hugging close together, i feel like tying both of them up and sending one to the north pole and the other to the south pole. Argh! I hope their hands freeze together in UK and then they can hold hands forever! Ok, i think i'd better stop before the webpage admin. reports me to the mental hospital. it felt good to get this of my chest, but i would appreciate some response if you didn't die of boredom while reading this. Thank you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>U really had a knotty problem.  Think it's only bcos u r totally disgusted and jealous abt the other girl "Sandy".<br>Juz to tell u an old saying, what is yours is yours and what not meant to be yours won't b, understood?  If that guy u said really gets along so well with the other girl and ignore u, it may b a blessing instead 'cos this type of guy dun give gals any sense of security, agreed?<br>Anyway, juz forget abt him for the time being and see if anyone better comes along.  Moreover, u should concentrate more on your studies now, u should b a sec4 student now, rite? ICQ me at 62617763 if u wanna talk.  I'm 8 yrs older than u, trust my advice...<br><br>------------------<br>Hope to b your frd forever, Mike signing off</div>

But I think it's just becoz he has a new interest on the new ger. It's normal for guys.. or rather for ost pple.. like u got something new.. something exciting.. u tends to prefer it.. Remember when u were young... u always carry ur new toy ard, and throw the old ones aside?? it's the same idea here.<br><br>However, from wat u say he only knew this ger for a short while and he possess such lustful and undesirable tots... I'm pretty sure if he's wif u, chance are that he is bound up to no good.... I think it's better not to gif him a chance at all..<br><br>Sorryz maybe I'm a little harsh in this.. but I think the situation really p****ed me off. sorryz...<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

I believe things will just dissappear.. But the sad part is that at the sight of him, or at the next conversation or outing with him/her, u will feel really bad, and u will have to start all over a again.<br><br>Unless u r able to confront him, amd make him reject or accept. Then I think ur heart will settle down and stop thinking of him/her anymore. Coz I think it's will be already 'dead' if he rejects u... he ehe...<br><br>But if u r connecting this qn with the problem that u haf posted at the beginning of this discussion, I think the best way is still to throw things at urself to do. then u will begin to forget him, and as time goes by.. then feeling will be gone...<br><br>Then again u can try telling urself that he is ur dream guy/girl. and u wun want to spoil his image in ur heart. Becoz when both of u are together, u will begin to see the 'dark' or negative side of the person..<br><br>Actually that's wat I'm doing... I had a very bad crush for this ger since Pri 4, and till now when I'm 20, I still have feelings for her.. but I told myself that no matter wat happens, I will not ask her to be my gf, becoz I dun want to spoil her angelic image.. hee hee..

Think it's impossible to ask u to forget all abt this guy, but try keeping yourself occupied with schoolwork perhaps, and go out more with friends so that u had pple to talk to and will not even had the time to think about this bad "crush" of yours.
