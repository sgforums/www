            <div class='col-md body'>Just put yourself in your best friend's shoes and think... how would you feel if you were him?<br><br>I was a victim once and i can't believe my best friend actually "stole" my girl. Why with ""? My ex gf felt guilty because my best friend came mess up the relationship and she got a crush on him, they didnt be together though. His attitude totally changed when he heard the news that we were together, he turn somewhat hostile to me but i didnt really cared much.<br><br>The sad case was... the relationship lasted for a week only. At that point, i hated him so much but there was nothing i could do. I forgave him eventually because he was someone close to me before. After two years, my ex actually came back and told me that she still loved me, i do admit i still have feelings for her but... i'm attached already...</div>
