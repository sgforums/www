            <div class='col-md body'>Yah I got an advice for you.....just go and do it, throw urself into action, don't think too much or it will paralyze you from taking action. I know you are shy and unconfident, you don't need to change urself into being confident first, it will take a lot of effort. Instead you just do it. Just do it. After a while then you will be used to it and realize it's no big deal. Just start.</div>

Try thinking of it this way, you'll have to work someday or other, why not try now? If it helps, maybe you could ask your friend or soemthing to accompany you? Or just take a deep breath and rush out everything. I just recently applied for my part-time job at Macdonalds just to try it out, well, the people were very nice, just that... I wasn't of age.</div>
