I found out like a few mths later, I was hurt as she was my 1st love and have not been thru it. But she swear that nth else gone beyond than just admiring him. It took me quite sometime to forget bout it..<br>and for the next 2 yrs things have been rocky and finally i left her 1 yr ago.. till this year march we start talking out again.. after 4 mths, i felt that we are getting along fine.. so i start asking her things bout what happened during the 1 yr we were not together, she keep assuring me that nothing happens.. i trust her initally.. but soon i began that things were not as simple as that, i took her hp and copy down a few guys no that i noe she is close to for the past 1 yr. and i sms them..<br>it hurts me a lot when it was other ppl who told me the truth, finally, she admitted it. it took me a lot of courage to say that she admitted sleeping with this guy. It was a very big blow to me. I felt hurt and betrayed. for the past 3 nights, i have try to sleep and everytime i close my eyes, i can see them together.. i felt very disgusted. I tried forgiving her and move on, but when the sun goes down and nightime, i juz felt very depressed.. it's been my 4th night sleepless again, i really wish to let it go, but it seems like she is not helping me.. i stayed here 3 yrs for her, i lost her now, i felt totally lost........</div></blockquote>from what i reckon.....that girl was just a plain kitty....or rather a pussy cat......the one that goes prowling when the husband cat is not around.....its a pity to hear of such things.....well you could say that she is a tramp in a sense of the whole thing.............going around doing other business with other people.....well its her upbringing i guess......won't be missing such people in life......just throw them into the bin and move on......not worth.....if someone really loves and cares....they won't mind if you went overseas and still be a virgin in the end when you came back........well you sure could say she is a flirt..........<br><br>what made you felt disgusted ????i understand how betrayed you might feel.....but disgusted???? as in sex??? come on........</div>

Yes,she suffers but if the threadstarter goes back to her. She may think' Hey,nothing what? The person I don appreciates at first comes back to me in the end'. Aiya,no need to worry one,heck care,heck care he will still be by my side! ' Hao Ma Bu Chi Hui Toh Cao... Btw,a gal who don care abt yr future eduaction and ask you to stay back for her sake is not a very sensible lady.. Plus when u both patch back,she is not truthful to you by informing you that she has slept with another man.. It's only when u go and check then find out abt it.( A question to threadstarter,did you claim her virginity in the first place?)</div></blockquote>Of course you don't go back so easily lah. I am saying if you do go back, you ought to be the superior person in this relation, the one who makes the decision and have certain control over the girl. and of course, you don't go back without grilling her for more secrets to be reveal to you, more honesty and more pain to her making sure that she will be sincere in the new relationship. You are not going back to be a dog but a master. And being a master, you can have more power to make sure such a thing will not happen again.<br><br>And speaking of truthfulness, seems quite natural for anyone to hide this secret wah. It is some black mark in her life and anyone would like to keep it hidden. Even husband and wife has secrets.<br><br>I feel that you should harp over this issue, but consider if you can have a good relation with her despite this black mark or its better to find another gal.</div>
