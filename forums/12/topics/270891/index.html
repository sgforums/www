I did too. My 4 years of Sec school was hell as a result of the bad choices i made. Often, I wish I won't see people from the past, and often, I try not to think about it. But I've learnt that its all about how I perceive myself. I tell myself to move on, that people have probably already moved on, and so should I.<br><br>Nowadays, i still see frequently in school the people who helped make my life hell in school. Yet, I can now stare them in the eye and smile before walking away. You really need to learn how to accept urself, before u can learn how to put away the past.<br><br>It may sound cheem to some, but its easy really. The more u go and think about the past, the more u won't let go of it. Why let past events affect ur future? Its just so not worth it.</div>
