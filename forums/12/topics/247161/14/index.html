            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm<br><br>I think those who expect people to react immediately when being molested<br>are probably either people who are very experienced in being molested (so they know exactly what to do) or people who have never been molested.<br><br>Most of the time, people don't EXPECT to be molested. Someone touches you. You don't cry out because You wonder if its an accident. You keep quiet. He touches you again. You wonder if it could be an accident a second time - you don't REALLY want to believe it ISNT an accident - especially if the person is an acquaintance or friends OR friends' friend. What if you made a mistake?<br><br>Because you kept quiet, he touched you a third time. This time it becomes clear to you, it isn't an accident. But because you didnt react the 1st 2 times, you suddenly become dumbfounded what you are supposed to do. You are embarassed at the possible consequences of what will happen if you suddenly confront the guy. What if he act blur? Afterall its dark in the cinema, you have no witness. You are scared he turn the tables on you - i mean if he is such a sneaky bastard to molest you, he can definitely act blur after that to. And how terrible that will be.<br><br>He continues to molest you. You feel guilty because you feel you SHOULD have made a stand. You SHOULD have reacted. But you didn't because you didn't know WHAT to do.<br><br>And in the end, people stand accusing that you are consenting to the molest, simply because they aren't in your mind when all these are going through your head.</div>

What does it gain? Isn't there a better way to resolve this?<br><br>My responsibility? Is for myself only. I cannot help others because this world runs on free choices. People can always have ONS, have complicated relationships, have unnatural relationships. So who am I to stop them or advice them? As you said, I am not a certificied social worker or doctor. My advice to anyone is just my views which anyone can reject. So why suddenly is the face that I am a female is used as a reason for me to make a stand? I am not a judge, I was not there, I am only taking in 3rd, 4th, 5th hand information. Nothing is accurate. I cannot make any stand because I really do not know what happened. However, I can say, it is disappointing to hear this happened and sad that Q had an unpleasant experience. But I would like to highlight, Q gone out with D on her own choice knowing she does not know much about this fellow. There are too many things that might have happened which was unknown. There is always a possibility of a nasty event. Although I say statistics is a b!tch, but most women are raped and molested by people who they know. There are many instances where a lady can take action to prevent further harm. For instance, on buses, its easy to get molested. You seriously think there is no choice but to sit there and let the molestation continue? The first time they go out, why must it be a movie, where its dark and things can happen. Why can't it be a coffee place for a short chit chat? Why didn't Q leave when she felt uncomfortable. No one can protect her other then herself. She has to know that.<br><br>Till this end, the event passed. If an apology is expected, say it. If something needs to be done, say it. Then what? Harp on it?  Things happen cannot be undone.  I had know guys on the net cannot be trusted. But how many more girls will always look otherwise? Look at Bar. Do you know D post there? And perhaps all the "nice" guys you see in AA, CC and other sites have clones in Bar. No one really knows.<br><br>So what exactly are you trying to drive at?<br>Has this gone far enough or you want to drive all the users out?<br>What is it you want?

Let it also be known I did not report to police even for the serious ones even thought that almost amounted to rape and I was totally not responsible for the event. It took many years to get over the trauma but it will never go away because its a disgusting thing. The years does not diminish the feeling of disgust, hate and bad feelings and I reserve a special hatred for people who does this kind of things and also people who chose to betray their loved ones.  But still it does not qualify me as a person who can make a statement about the situation for other women. Its always their choice.<br><br>However, as I said multiple times, no one can solve the issue for Q or VK. Q need to take action, close the case, and move on. I don't know why VK got so worked up.
