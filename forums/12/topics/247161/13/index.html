By telling yourself you are responsible for it and let is slide?</div></blockquote>I am only being fair to all the other users in AA.<br><br>Blowing up this issue. What does it gain? Isn't there a better way to resolve this?<br><br>My responsibility? Is for myself only. I cannot help others because this world runs on free choices. People can always have ONS, have complicated relationships, have unnatural relationships. So who am I to stop them or advice them? As you said, I am not a certificied social worker or doctor. My advice to anyone is just my views which anyone can reject. So why suddenly is the face that I am a female is used as a reason for me to make a stand? I am not a judge, I was not there, I am only taking in 3rd, 4th, 5th hand information. Nothing is accurate. I cannot make any stand because I really do not know what happened. However, I can say, it is disappointing to hear this happened and sad that Q had an unpleasant experience. But I would like to highlight, Q gone out with D on her own choice knowing she does not know much about this fellow. There are too many things that might have happened which was unknown. There is always a possibility of a nasty event. Although I say statistics is a b!tch, but most women are raped and molested by people who they know. There are many instances where a lady can take action to prevent further harm. For instance, on buses, its easy to get molested. You seriously think there is no choice but to sit there and let the molestation continue? The first time they go out, why must it be a movie, where its dark and things can happen. Why can't it be a coffee place for a short chit chat? Why didn't Q leave when she felt uncomfortable. No one can protect her other then herself. She has to know that.<br><br>Till this end, the event passed. If an apology is expected, say it. If something needs to be done, say it. Then what? Harp on it?  Things happen cannot be undone.  I had know guys on the net cannot be trusted. But how many more girls will always look otherwise? Look at Bar. Do you know D post there? And perhaps all the "nice" guys you see in AA, CC and other sites have clones in Bar. No one really knows.<br><br>So what exactly are you trying to drive at?<br>Has this gone far enough or you want to drive all the users out?<br>What is it you want? Did Q feel so violated that she needs to do this?<br>Did she feel so traumatized? What can be done?<br>Its not about the past but the future.<br><br>Are you being fair to the other users of AA?<br>Do you really want to raze AA to cinders?<br><br></div>
