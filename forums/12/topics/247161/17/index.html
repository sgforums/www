That's all I am asking, and I think we need to recognise this.</div></blockquote>Chin Eng,<br>I 2nd your views that you posted.<br><br>From a previous forum, there were also women who openly disclosed and acted s-lutty online. These same women, despite good advice decided to date "nice" guys and got into a lot of trouble because the guys are reacting to online persona. Thereafter started finger pointing and naming names and etc.<br>There was a really nice guy, who told me outright, as I am the one who do not attempt such foolish things. He said, the girls are asking for trouble doing what they do. Not that I agree, but in a sense, there is some truth. The thing was that I was the only one who warned all these people and all activities I organized are in groups and going to brightly lit places for a light meal and conversation. However, because people decided to act on their own after that, and I get blamed for it. I stopped all my effort to do anything for anyone.<br><br>Because no one can really and truly judge what went wrong and who was in the wrong. There are too many elements in a situation such as ShrodingsCat said, and I agreed. This happened to me as well but thereafter, I knew I need to learn. However, I also know that at Q's age and I've met many, these are the time the girls are seeking attention and alot of it.<br><br>It is a simple fact that online is more dangerous than real life because there are simply more people who can fake identities and appear 'nice'. There was once this girl who flashed some one her boobs on the webcam thinking she can get away with it but technology is good and the guy on the other end kept her picture and use it to threaten her.. She came to bar to complain and I just told her off. If anyone do not talk freely to strangers on the road, what makes you show your boobs to a stranger on the net. What makes anyone think that being on the net is safe. In fact, it is really dangerous because all of us use nicks and no one knows the real identity and there are lots of things kept hidden. It is a sexual pervert's paradise, isn't it?<br><br>Think about it girls.  If you do not go around getting into stranger's car when they offer you a ride or go to some guy's home after you are dead drunk, what makes you think the person you meet on-line is going to be any different? So each one of us bear some responsibility to make sure and take care of ourselves.<br><br>So I cannot say under such complex situation who is right and who is wrong.  Going forward, I hope people take note of the kind of "silent readers" lurking around forums and using multiple accounts. It is easy to get fooled.<br><br></div>
