Someone touches you. You don't cry out because You wonder if its an accident. You keep quiet. He touches you again. You wonder if it could be an accident a second time - you don't REALLY want to believe it ISNT an accident - especially if the person is an acquaintance or friends OR friends' friend. What if you made a mistake?<br><br>Because you kept quiet, he touched you a third time. This time it becomes clear to you, it isn't an accident. But because you didnt react the 1st 2 times, you suddenly become dumbfounded what you are supposed to do. You are embarassed at the possible consequences of what will happen if you suddenly confront the guy. What if he act blur? Afterall its dark in the cinema, you have no witness. You are scared he turn the tables on you - i mean if he is such a sneaky bastard to molest you, he can definitely act blur after that to. And how terrible that will be.<br><br>He continues to molest you. You feel guilty because you feel you SHOULD have made a stand. You SHOULD have reacted. But you didn't because you didn't know WHAT to do.<br><br>And in the end, people stand accusing that you are consenting to the molest, simply because they aren't in your mind when all these are going through your head.</div></blockquote>Strongly agree!!!</div>
