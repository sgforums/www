All i am saying, give the girl a break.  in your opinion, due to her posting in the forum, she maybe open minded. but that is just her online persona. even if she is open minded, she still have a choice of choosing who she wants to be with.

Stop pointing your finger at her.  what had happened is already more than what a nineteen year old girl should take.<br><br>P/s:  You people keep saying she is no saint.  saint or not, i do not know.  but i do know that there are instances whereby sex workers who were sexually violated were badly traumatised too.<br><br></div>

I bear some responsibility for placing myself in that situation. And for all the times, I always tell girls to be weary than to appear too easy for the guys. However, experience also show that no girl ever listen till the date she is violated.<br><br>However, as this case, no one forced Q to a movie date, no one forced D to invite her. No one force them to go without the benefit of a group.<br>However, no one can truly say for sure what is the motive of these two people. To me, both are at fault for placing themselves into this situation.<br>I am thankful I am once again reminded to be careful of net-friends. However, I also find it a bit over board that this is spinning into to much problem for everyone.<br><br>I would say that most girls had been molested one time of another in her life. I also know that D being mod makes it worse. However, as I like to get to the point, What do VK and Q want out of this exercise. Get it done and over and move on. Don't drag this on and make AA become such a negative space for the rest of the people.<br><br></div>
