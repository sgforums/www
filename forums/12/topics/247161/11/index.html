From my further conversations with her after (sorry, I didn't learn about all these threads until lately), I guess I could be wrong. She said she wasn't trying to encourage and lead me on. To that, I [b]owe her an apology. I'm truly sorry if I've misinterpreted you. I guess you were too quiet and casual about it so I didn't really know. I'm sorry. When I 1st asked her out, it was purely casual. No intention.<br><br>I agree with MOST here that I'm not a 'good' guy nor a 'saint' to start with. I also agree with the 'warnings' given with regards to me. Makes me think perhaps I really shouldn't be allowed to meet up with anyone online at all?  I've not and never for ONCE claimed that I'm a SAINT.. In fact, I dread it if anyone is to define me as so. I'm just doing a part which if humans have handled a better job themselves..

However, if one is to read your forum sgsexforums, one cannot but conclude that you may be an easy target, otherwise why would a 19 year old girl want to start such a forum, which to me is too heavy for a 19 year old girl to handle.<br><br>Males are typically predators.... why give us the chance to test if you are easy or not?<br><br>I neither know you nor the devil.... but this affair between both of you is going no where. If you want to report to the police, go ahead. If you want to shame devil, put his name down. Otherwise, I think the entire exchange in AA as well as your own forum is ridiculously pointless.<br><br>Please note that I am not taking sides, you think you got molested? No need to share so much details, what good does it do to you? You want to punish devil? Go to the police lah!<br></div></blockquote>I didn't start the forum la, me just helping to moderate.

This is particularly important because A GIRL moderates a sex forum... regardless of whether you google and post or write and post.... people will see you differently. Very likely you'd be seen as one who is INTERESTED in sex and may be WELL VERSED in sex. So there is no way to control how others think of you when you put on this hat. Typically the image that is conjured up will be one of an easy girl.<br><br>I sincerely hope that someone will accompany you to the police station because all these ranting is pointless and regardless of what happens next, quinsy is now synonymous to some one who's been molested. Is this a big deal? If it is.... march to the police station right now.... if it no big deal.... let go,</div>
