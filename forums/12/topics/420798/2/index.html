              <p>On her part, threatening to break up all the time shows an emotional unstability in your relationship and her lack of trust of trust in you. Or, she might be trying to "test" you like what some girls like to do. But she is childish to do so.</p>
              <p>On your part, scolding her with vulgarities is akin to degrading her and not respecting her especially when it is over small petty issues. You said it yourself they are petty issues. You are too hot-headed and not calm enough to handle couple quarrels.</p>
              <p>Conclusion: Either you sort things out with her gradually by talking and not escalating the fights, or you can just prepare to break up with her like you said and spare the both of you from the current agony you are facing.</p>

              <p>sounds like me and my wife! lol. Patience is key and if you really love each other, must give and take. Both parties stubborn is not gonna help at all. Be more mature too.....don't just say break up in the heat of the moment.</p>
              <p>Stop the vulgarities once and for all. You are disrespecting her parents as well. Since you're close to her family, one day you might call them pa and ma....think of how they'd feel if they see your vulgar sms-es to her.</p>
              <p>Petty issues are not worth the anger. If it happens again, you'll have to quickly talk yourself out of the foul mood and chuck it aside. It's way too childish to be even worked up by trivial stuff.</p>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>The word ''patch'' means fix, mend - one cannot patch one can only share what one is. Whether one acknowledges or rejects - it does not detract from what is or what one is.</p>
              <p>And many misunderstand, misconstrue and misinterpret this - beggarly ''love'' has nothing to share excepting wanting, desiring and woefully awash with needs/expectations.</p>
              <p>Till that understanding is available to one who purports to love - all one is or does is going to be in vain.</p>
              <p>One cannot find anything in a relationship if one cannot <span style="text-decoration: underline;">relate to what one is</span>. It presupposes the courarge to face dichotomizing,polarizing emotions within oneself. Relationship is born out of relating not the other way around.</p>

              <p>Actually this time the quarrel started when she got angry that I did not buy her dinner when I rushed to fetch her and forgot abt the dinner, and it evolved into a full fledge quarrel. Yes its annoying girls always like to say breakup everytime over small things.</p>

              <p>Yes I think what you have said is right. I should just walk away instead of talking more. But at that moment, its hard to think logically.</p>

              <p>Interesting suggestion from Professionals ... because its easy to cross the line ... But sometimes widen the circle, a person see more things and perhaps appreciate what we have I guess. Sometimes our biggest enemy is ourselves because we always thing we can get a better partner or better this/that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Here's a story to share.... my interpretation of "widen circle" helping:</p>
              <p>The other day I was talking to a colleague on the MRT who was teling me his wife worked from home cause they have 2 young kid. I told him he's lucky because his wife knows that its very stress for the husband to support family alone (like most SG women also feel so for their guys).  I shared with him another colleague had to support his family and 2 young kids all alone because his wife refused to work, and not even work from home or even part time. The wife also told this other colleague she expect to go on trips out of the country at least 1 to 2 times a year.  After hearing this, the 1st colleague told me he felt lucky and appreciated his wife even more.</p>
