              <p>Here is the summary:</p>
              <p>I am a guy, Chinese, 26 years old, I have a gf/24, we have been dating for close to 4 years already. She is a very caring, pretty and in short, my perfect other half. We see each other every other day during the week. And we spend quality time together during the weekends. I am very close to her family and she is close to my family as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now here is the problem:</p>
              <p>We seem to quarrel excessively over petty issues, like once a week or once every two weeks, and she will mention break up or threaten to walk out of the relationship which makes me blow my top and hurl vulgarities, curse and swear at her. Initially she will keep calling and smsing me to resolve the problem, but I was always too mad at her to sit down and talk. So the matter drags overnight and from the next day onwards, I will always be the one "stalking" her, but she will just refuse all my calls and SMSes.  </p>
              <p>Most of the time, she will relent after a day or two and we patched back and resume our "happy times" as if nothing has happened before, but a similar quarrel happens again before long and the same old shit repeats itself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This time it happened again and my gf asked for a breakup:</p>
              <p>My gf says the reason for asking for a breakup is that:</p>
              <p>1. I cant manage a small quarrel and give in to her.</p>
              <p>2. I cant stop scolding vulgarities at her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So I am confused right now, should I chase her back at all costs or let her go? Thanks in advance for all advices!</p>

              <p>Maybe you can google about anger management...it may help. Try to focus on love rather than hate, think about how she loves you....plus your happy times together etc. Make it an effort to improve your temper....she definitely deserves the best version of you!

            <div class='col-md body'><p>maybe the reason why she keeps breaking up with u is because you havent been giving her the attention she needs. and maybe after 4 years of being in a relationship.. it's getting boring doing the same old things. so i guess the only reason why she keeps breaking up with u is to threaten you so that u might take the initiative to win her heart again. but i get it from your point of view. it gets annoying when girls try to threaten to break up all the time.... so annoying.. </p></div>

              <p>Actually this time the quarrel started when she got angry that I did not buy her dinner when I rushed to fetch her and forgot abt the dinner, and it evolved into a full fledge quarrel. Yes its annoying girls always like to say breakup everytime over small things.</p>

              <p>Yes I think what you have said is right. I should just walk away instead of talking more. But at that moment, its hard to think logically.</p>
