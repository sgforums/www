He borrowed 5k from me before the break-up.<br><br>Your case and mine is very very similar.<br>My ex controlled and manipulated me the way your guy did with you.<br><br>We actually broke off before the money thing. I was the one who break off with him.<br>But he sweet talked me into patching back with him again.<br>Later on he admitted that he just want to patch back with me so that he can dump me.<br><br>I never see my money again, he refused to admit to his family he borrowed money from me. His family is quite well off and own several properties.<br><br>But during one of our meeting which he promised to settle the debt, he scolded me and told me the 5K was to recoup some loss what he had invested in me. He called me a whore for leaving him for someone else.<br><br>In the end, his arss shit behaviour made it easier for me to drop this guy outa my mind. I am now a much much happier person with a much happier life.<br><br>As for my money, I earned it back by now.<br><br>It was a very painful lesson I went through, thank God I survived it.<br><br></div>

Do you intend to stop the pain by applying treatment to it or you rather gain immune to the pain and do nothing about it?<br><br>Maybe, you are just indignant about the time and love that you spent on him.
