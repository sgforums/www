I will go near the sea whenever i have problems that I can't solve.<br><br>Than I'll just go to the beach/by the sea, let the sea breeze blow off my worries at least for the day..<br><br>last time i started off by going there regularly since the problems keep bugging me..but slowly as i start to think back, it's just part of growing up.<br><br>Take care and grow stronger.<br><br>If you feel East Cost is too crowded with no personal space, than you can try other parks with sea views.<br><br>I personally go to Kallang due to the real quietness of that park and to save me the trouble of squeezing with the crowd. Since when I'm troubled, i like to be alone.<br><br>If you prefer to have company, you can ask your friends who really care to accompany you there. You just need to sit there, think of nothing, don't speak,  just learn to appreciate the nature, and it will help you emotionally.<br><br>If you need company, let the gals know, they most probably wil accompany you. But if all else fails, than let me know, if you don't mind meeting me than I walk you the that quiet place. (make me the last resort as you are facing an emotional hurricane thus you need to have someone who care for you)<br><br>Perhaps after I have gone through your previous thread than I'll able to give you more advices.<br><br>Til than take care.<br><br>Be strong.</div>

By explaining, do you expect him to accept that it's his fault (Which i confidently doubt so). You should know better as this's not the 1st time, not the 2nd time, not the 3rd time....many many times...<br><br>Why struggle? What's the point?<br>You just ain't get used to your current situation.<br><br>Hard as it may be to you for all his actions, speeches &amp; texts to you, but that's the point of showing you all these....to make you feel difficult and not to reflect the faults/wrongs on him....<br><br>Ok...next he'll says or texts you that he's sorry and regretful for what he has done, blah, blah &amp; blah.....admit all the faults onto himself....<br><br>SO?<br><br></div>
