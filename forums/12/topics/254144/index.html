            <div class='col-md body'>You are hurting now, because you once love deeply. Like what the other posters here have said, you need time. As for how long will it take for u to forget him and completely move on in life, its all up to you.<br><br>While I don't know the story between you and your ex, somehow, I think that you have make the best decision for yourself, because you were stuck in a relationship that were leading to nowhere, and that you are hurting a lot from it. Getting out of it is the only thing you could have done. All you can do now is continue your routine. Go school/work, play your fave sports, or even take a short holiday abroad. Absorb all the beautiful scenaries abroad, go and visit some wonderful places, and get more knowledge about the places you visit. When you come back to Spore, while you probably hadn't forgotten the bad episode, you would have at least make urself more fresher, and probably on a faster route to forgetting.<br><br>Just remember this, u are not alone in this world. Your friends may have scold u for what u did in ur past relationship, but in the end, they care for u. All we can do here is to provide a "listening ear" and give u advice. They are the ones that provide an arm, a hug, and everything u need. They are the ones who care more about u.<br><br>Do take care girl, and hopefully, in a few days, weeks or months time, you will have walked out of this dark episode of ur life, and into a bright, new one.</div>
