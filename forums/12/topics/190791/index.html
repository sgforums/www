            <div class='col-md body'>I am seeking help regarding about this hex to cure him.  Someone wants to break us up as i am saying. Its been going on for months and i am getting desperate. Been to everywhere and done all i could but to no avail. The magic is working. There's a lot of signs and stuff esp whenever he is talking to me, he get agitated easily. Headaches and stuff which NEVER happen before. Thus, we are not meeting anymore to prevent this. And also, his ex was the culprit. He refuse to meet any single of us ( our friends) except for his ex. Weird huh. Been to many mediums - all of them told me the same story AND describe his symtoms but it is a powerful javanese magic. which binds him using his photo and DOB.<br>Pls contact me @ 97626828 if there's any help.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>besides<br>my bf never behaves this way at all. And we have been together for a long time. He is a happy go lucky/ out going person who loves to go out and surround himself with friends. Yet, after announcing that he wants to get married with me, he becomes really strange and withdrawn. He even had suicidial thoughts. But he's NEVER this way. Someone even sprinkle salt outside his door, heard voices calling him and shaky whenever he prays. he can't even control his moods and temper. Now, he is a shadow of his old self and i am getting really desperate. Going to places of worships to pray and seek help. But things are still the same. I am afraid that the only cure for him is for me to leave him. His ex loves him a lot and wanted him back. What do you think?</div>

And we have been together for a long time. He is a happy go lucky/ out going person who loves to go out and surround himself with friends. Yet, after announcing that he wants to get married with me, he becomes really strange and withdrawn. He even had suicidial thoughts. But he's NEVER this way. Someone even sprinkle salt outside his door, heard voices calling him and shaky whenever he prays. he can't even control his moods and temper. Now, he is a shadow of his old self and i am getting really desperate. Going to places of worships to pray and seek help. But things are still the same. I am afraid that the only cure for him is for me to leave him. His ex loves him a lot and wanted him back. What do you think? </div></blockquote><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet Natasha,<br><br>Well the way i see even he is not hexed, he is under effect of some spiritual influences. If its Javanese Magic as you mentioned, it will not be easy. I am sure those whom you seek help from turn you away or give you a price you cannot afford. Its been months, the magic has gone deeper, to remove it, its not easy. You should have seek Spiritual help from Reliable source when you first discovered it, chances of removing it is higher. At this present moment no point letting your mind run wild. My recommendation to you is simple, if you want to have a clearer picture of what is going on, book a session with me. If you do not like the idea of having a session with me, the best i can do for you at the moment is get an "Spell Breaker" Spellkit from me, just you got to cast the spell yourself with all the charged items you need &amp; instruction scroll provided.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos</span></strong></div>

And yeah i did. And I even bought him to see one ustaz previously but he stop going after a while.  i am afraid that he is that sort who leaves everything in God's hand. Whereas I am that sort who tries to put things right on my own. So, yeah i went to mosques on my own as such. I am helping on behalf of him. But my bf simply just prays.</div>
