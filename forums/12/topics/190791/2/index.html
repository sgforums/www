If its Javanese Magic as you mentioned, it will not be easy. I am sure those whom you seek help from turn you away or give you a price you cannot afford. Its been months, the magic has gone deeper, to remove it, its not easy. You should have seek Spiritual help from Reliable source when you first discovered it, chances of removing it is higher. At this present moment no point letting your mind run wild. My recommendation to you is simple, if you want to have a clearer picture of what is going on, book a session with me. If you do not like the idea of having a session with me, the best i can do for you at the moment is get an "Spell Breaker" Spellkit from me, just you got to cast the spell yourself with all the charged items you need &amp; instruction scroll provided.<br><br>ok... can yo u get in touch with me asap?

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">Merry Meet To All,<br><br>Well if praying would solved the issue, I am sure the Ustaz already did all he could together with others in the Mosque. Chanting verses from the Qur'an can only keep the issue stalled temporarily but it do help from preventing the issue to go worse. Even if you have people praying for him 24 hours daily, it will take quite some time to see abit of result but it will not be able to eradicate it. Things don't happen for no rhymes or reasons, some maybe due karmic debts from past many lives to be repaid in this live. Praying will help be it more or less irregardless from what Religions. No point speculating or debating on what is already there, the main concern should be how to go about solving it.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Blessed Be,<br>Oceanos </span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He is a muslim? K ask him to keep reading the Quran. 'Dzikir' all the time, on the bus, everywhere if he can possible do. Keep doing his prayers. Pray for help from god. Go and see a reliable ustadz. A good one can help to lead him back and do his religious obligations properly. Ask him to be really sincere and keep faith in his prayers. I believe this can help him..</div>
