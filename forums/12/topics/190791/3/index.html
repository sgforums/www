Yeah he is a bisexual. Used to anyway.<br>No, i am sure that my bf didn't mess with free-will before. but if it is something that he has done... I am nt too sure about that. But the ex of his is certainly a very jealous and vergful person. Esp when my bf's family treated him as a adopted son and he has free access to my bf's place.
