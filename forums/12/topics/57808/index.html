You may want to wait for more time to pass to see how things go. 1st you can see if you really like her that much, 2nd is to see if they really like each other that you stand no chance.

She's not married, you still stand a chance. By confessing, you can at least know, if she's interested. If she's not, then be a man, let her go. No harm done. Still can be friends. It may hurt the BF to know that you like her, but then again, if the girl is not of a certain standard, then the BF wldn't have a competitor rite? So, actually the BF shld be glad and honoured to haf a competitor. May the best man wins. Good luck. This is juz my opinion, you may not agree with me.</div>

However, one word of warning is that this deal comes with the package of NOT expectation anything at all. If you expect anything (and I mean ANYTHING) in return, apart from simply letting her know, forget about it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Will she drift away from you?  If she agree to be your gf, then will she break off with her current boyfren?  Then can both of you face her boyfren?  Will she be a two-timer?<br><br>I always feel that if you like somebody, let her know.  You can't decide for her..It's up to her to decide.  Be prepared for whatever consequences it might cause.  My advice to you is, do not try to be a third-party.<br><br>Best of luck!</span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

It will be miserable for if you are expecting something from her....in this case maybe u want her to be your gf...<br><br>If u treat her nice because u realli want 2 see her happi, then u can be happi 2 see her happi, whether she is with u or with her bf...<br><br>Love  is when u want the other person to be happi.. whether or not you guys are together...If you can see it day way, your problems will definitely go away...<br><br>if u can treat someone nice not just because u want something in return..then you have loved the person the rite way....</div>
