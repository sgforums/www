There probably really ain't much you're gonna accomplished if you're gonna tell her about how ya feel for now...? Unless you're mentally prepared for a GAP between you and her after what you're gonna tell her and perhaps more complications to come in, you just go ahead...?<br><br>And WHAT do you really WISH to happen after you tell her those things...? Possible scenerios like...<br><br>1. She avoid you and perhaps things about you and her which MIGHT affect your reputation OR her relationship with her bf OR perhaps further disrupt your friendship with her...?<br><br>2. She LEAVE her bf for you..? UNLESS her bf really SUCKS... I don't see much GOOD in this happening...? BESIDES... Be HONEST with yourself...? What are the CHANCES of things to go this way...? And the CRUCIAL thing is... It's NOT really up to you to judge whether her bf SUCKS or not...?<br><br>3. Others... Alas too LAZY to continue with the possibilities....

Like u say, it's not tat hard to find out if a gurl likes u or not, won't it be better if she ends up wif u cos she really feels for u &amp; not cos she's jud havin'  a rough time wif her guy. In a way, though am a gurl, I understand how u feel, I onli noe tat my fren likes me months later &amp; actually some of my frens (they are all good brudders) decide not to go after me and be my fren instead cos they felt tat frenship can last, if they let me know how they feel I may avoid em. See, u're also veri kind wat, u dun wish to hurt their relationship so let live and let go. It won't be easy but when she can trust u and rely on u as a fren, she may find u of importance in her heart in future, who noes? Or by tat time u may find someone who realli treasure u??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
