I'm 22, he's 21. By the way, I've always been hearing people saying things like "you're a kid/he's a kid/she's a kid". I never heard of a standard way of dealing with things in a r/s.</div>

No one can TELL you what is best for your relationship. No one can ultimately make you do something you don't want to do regardless of how much advice is given.<br><br>Listen to your heart ba. Do you truly believe this man loves you? If he doesn't, do you still want to stay with him regardless? Do you think you can actually change his mind and MAKE him love you, without changing yourself, compromising your values, and still continue to respect yourself?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i am a frank, logical and very straight forward guy,<br>So what i tell you now will be probably be much harsher than you expect.<br><br>1.  Pls do not be tied down to the past.  Whatever things he have done for u or times/ memories u shared before, during the courting process is gone.  Those might be very sweet and happy times for u, but tat is the past.. Sad to say, he have changed since then.  And he is not the same guy u loved anymore.  At the same time, he have done many things to hurt u.<br><br>From what i see now, its one sided love from ur side.  And i seriously dun see a future between both of u.  How long can you take this pyschological stress?  Can you stay a lifetime with this guy?<br><br>You are young, and time is at your side.  Since this relationship is not workable, it is best to quickly walk out of it and move on.  What is the point in continuing this when he is not even interested in trying?  Does he understand how u feel?  Is he interested in ur well being?  Is he even interested in  this relationship at all?<br><br>If no, dun waste too much time.  He have totally lost whatever love, interest in you by now.  Treat everything as a bad experience and move on in life.  Learn from it and dun make the same mistakes again.  Given time , ur wounds will heal and u can start again with someone u really love and who will love u in return. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But of cos.. the decision is urs.  its ur life.  We only advise here.  But when u make the decision to follow one of the solutions, u suffer any consquences tat might comes with it as well.<br><br>cheers~<br>bin~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sweetie,<br>live up and live strong. Remember what we talked about on the phone yesterday? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Its all good. What the both of you have is but a grave misunderstanding. He prefers not to talk about it, whereas you want to, and not that I blame you since his ex is being persistent about squeezing herself into your lives.<br><br>You have been majorly strong all the way, and I know your love for him. I believe the both of you can work out dear, and I only want the best for you. He's a good person, and so are you.<br><br>The people here mean well, some are harsh but they still have their point...however I would advise you at this vulnerable time NOT to take their harsh comments too personally...it will hurt and you may feel stupid letting it out here but believe me, I'm glad you did.<br><br>No reason to give up so much of your time thinking too deep. Don't ask too many questions either...guys don't like it sometimes <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Just think of a solution...hope you guys can help her see how to make it work...<br><br>xoxo: Kim <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
