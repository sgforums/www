But i do think you got the answer there. What you don't need is MORE problems - and ur bf seems to be giving you more problems. Don't stay with a person simply cos you invested a lot of time/effort/sacrifices in a relationship already - no point right? Maybe you need some time apart for you and him to both sort out your own issues, and see clearly if he (and you) are the person you(he) want to be in a relationship with.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm... Just as I've suspected...?<br><br>Mmm...<br><br>Have you wonder why he has changed so much...? Even of how you've been... How YOU THINK yuo have changed much for the better... Why is he still like that...? Why are you still longing...? Looking out for...? Blaming him for....?<br><br>Based on 'surface analysis'... I SUSPECT you've contributed much to result in the change in him... But I really can't be too sure... I know too little about him to comment if it's his nature or anything... But from the outlook of things, you're certainly quite a slice of the pie...<br><br>And BASED on the CURRENT situation... It's... BAD...? The picture is probably something like this... You bringing in a change in him (at least patrial factor?), resulting in him (changed)... And this current 'him' who shows you NO LOVE and a BIG DIFFERENCE from the past is a BIG 'NO NO' for you... Causing you to further 'LOST YOUR HEAD'.... Asking yourself "What went wrong?" Somehow you've figured that something cannot happen for nothing... And you really do very much wish to have the old him back... 2 things to note here...<br><br>1. You might be doing it the wrong way... Do you often complain ALOT to him, comments and b|tch around things...?<br><br>2. If you ain't doing the above things (which I doubt so), then you really be TOO SOFT and MELLOW in this relationship... And he's probably EATING INTO YOU in this relationship....<br><br>But DO <strong>READ CAREFULLY</strong> on the 2 different scenerios I've posted above as they're VERY DIFFERENT PICTURES.. THINK through it CAREFULLY and let me in the FACTS... REMEMBER. No EGO, STUBBORNNESS or ANYTHING like that... Afterall it's YOUR RELATIONSHIP you're trying to SAVE...<br><br>If you're not honest with me and yourself... I'm afraid I can't help you...?<br></div>

He just never answer and ask me why i ask him...damn stubborn one kind...<br>Dunno la...I really gone through alot of crap...for him also...alot alot...now im working two stupid jobs to support myself because i screw up my studies in aussie because of the pregnancy...never even ask him to accompany me for the abortion because i knew it would hurt him...maybe i shouldn't have a bf should sort out my life first...so i won't be a burden because i feel like a damn idiotic burden. but breaking up is not the pt...like he will blame me for everything...i don't want that...im equally tired putting up with his mcp attitude...</div></blockquote>Pardon me...you got pregnant in Melbourne?

He doesn't know how to handle her, and possibly he feel that if not for you (your existence, not your actions), she would not become this problemetic. It doesn't mean he still misses her, but guilt can be talking.<br><br>On the other hand, perhaps he is remaining with you for the same reason that he feels guilty towards you. However, his resentment is growing because though he initiated a rship cos of guilt, maybe he just isn't ready. I'm speculating of course.<br><br>I think your rship carry too much unresolved emotional baggage for two young people to keep on with it. And with things like emotional baggage, you can't just open it like a can of worms and expect a peaceable, acceptable solution to 2 (or more) people.<br><br>In a situation like this, there isn't much of a point confronting and 'forcing' a solution because the time isn't right. There's nothing to prove who's right, who's wrong, except that right now, the journey is stormy with each other. Perhaps what you need to do, is a bit of 'travelling' on your own and hope that when you put some space and time between you and him, the emotional baggage will be lost in transit, and you can start out anew IF you want to start out anew.</div>
