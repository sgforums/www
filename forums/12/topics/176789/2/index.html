            <div class='col-md body'>AshedAnna, I'm going to be sharp and sweet here. You really need to leave this guy of yours for good. I don't see you being loved in this relationship of yours and I can't imagine your future if you decided to hold on to him for the sake of the past.<br><br>Listen to your inner voice and dump him when you have the chance to do so. I hope a better guy will cross your path soon and you'll be so thankful for this decision that you've made.<br><br>Good luck and for the sake of your parents, you deserves better. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>
