Not doing something because it's cool, it's hip and its in.<br>Good for them, they've got a girlfriend/boyfriend. But for me, besides my own personal beliefs about relationships (not religious), there's no reason to jump into the bandwagon just because I feel 'left out'.<br><br>Remember, most relationships are like movie stars. They look all happy cappy and some even look glam on the outside, but you're not the one facing the fights, the problems, the unhappiness, of many of the things that plague keeping a girlfriend/boyfriend.<br><br></div></blockquote>That's a good one.<br><br>See, the problem with most people when getting into a relationship is they rush. Im speaking from a guy's point of view. See why there are so many relationship problems is because so many guys rush into it for the sake of companionship. They see, ooh, that girl is damn chio, I want her to be my girlfriend. But the more important question is whether she wants to be your girlfriend.<br><br>Not only that, you also have to see if she is the type of girl that is good for a long-term relationship. She has to be putting effort and commitment into the relationship and not expect the guy to keep pleasing her all the time. Of course, the guy has to put some effort into making the relationship a fun one.<br><br>To outsiders who are single in a relationship, they yearn to have a girlfriend. But alas, they do not know the sacrifices and maintainence that comes with a relationship. Not to mention the added stress and pressure at times. In fact, it's better to be single and free from worries than to have a relationship. That's hope for people who are longing to have a relationship.<br><br>Lastly, if you are not happy without a relationship, what makes you think you can cope with one?<br><br>doko</div>

I more of assume it occurs through every generation since the age of man.<br><br>Man has developed conscious and possess a free will, thus the ability to think freely and unrestricted... well... restricted by what man do not know.<br><br>Possibly because of the simplicity of the life in kampong or earlier, there is no need to wrack the brain to develop a higher level of establishment since life is easily contented and thus very few will think "too far" and felt isolated from the crowd.<br><br>On the contrary, in the modern day life most humans are too obsessed with the notion of "out-doing" one another that they try to device ways and patterns to prove themselves better or "different" from others. Therefore it is highly unlikely one can identify with another because of the competiveness and many other factors.<br><br>BUT as long as we are willing: willing to understand, willing to listen, willing to feel compassion towards one another... it is still possible to relate with another person at a certain level and because of that rare understanding, one might not feel as lonely as it can be.

I'll say if you never had a r/s before how can you ever weigh the pros and cons? If you ever feel lonely and you suka a girl... why not hang out more with her?

By taking proactive steps to expand our social encounter, we are taking accountability for our singlehood problem and not leaving it to fate. If your definition of fate does include the fact that you should take proactive steps to expand your social circle instead of finding excuses, then does not it means that in fate, you bascially have to take actions frequently. If your definition of fate means that you do not need to do anything because fate will decide your encounter with that girl, does not it then contradict the advice of taking proactive steps?<br><br>I also believe the first  few relationship are hard to survive because couples tend to quarrel and its hard to resolve couple problems sometimes..<br></div>

Envy, jealousy, horniness, sadness, frustration of being single, i have experienced them before. i have to worked on how to remove these negative emotions and thoughts. on the other hand, i also need to work on being more friendly and sociable so that i could get a girlfriend oneday. i am the quiet, boring type.<br><br>For sure i know that girlfriend is not everything in life. It is still a necessary thing, an important part of life. Especially when your peers are getting hooked and unhooked every now and then while i am in the forever single mode, its gets more frustrating and depressing.<br><br>Fate is just pure crap... i think Fate= luck ... that is the actual meaning. if u are lucky u will get a girlfriend that is similar and compatible to u by chance that you happen to be in the same place at the same time.<br><br>just as there are luck , there is therefore unlucky.. some people are still unattached before in mid 30s......... for people who keeps talking about fate, do they understand the actual feelings and experience  of people who are in the 30s and never had a girlfriend before.<br><br>I also believe thefirst  few relationship are hard to survive because couples tend to quarrel and its hard to resolve couple problems sometimes..<br></div></blockquote>You are what you believe! Fate = Luck then what? Everybody drop out of school and depend on Fate=Luck?<br><br>No lah, you must get up, use your brains and do something about it. Read self help books, read philosophy books, read religious nooks then work it all out for yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
