            <div class='col-md body'>hahahahaha you all dont know what you're missing out. not only for companionship somebody perfectly close to go out with, never feeling lonely in the day and nights, somebody 100% close, loving and nice, somebody that will do anything for you, somebody to look forward to being with, a sex partner you feel 100% comfortable with, somebody you wake up hugging then go to class together, somebody to share nice stuff with, somebody to give you a blowjob in a boring movie, somebody sexy and pretty hugging you warmly, somebody that sees you in a better light instead of your faults, even though life may be hard and sad, there is always comfort in retaining her unwavering love.<br><br>who said its even 5 % quarreling or restricting? at most its misunderstandings because you both are not against each other. i knew i was lonely before i had a gf. and i havent been single for more than few days since sec 3. (even when break up immd stead e another one.)</div>
