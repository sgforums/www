              <p>well my story kinda goes like this. some time ago i retained in sec 4, met this other girl in my class who also retained along with me. shes quite tomboy like but shes actually very pretty and got very smooth complexion and has an overall very nice body. i wanted to jio her out but i never dared to...in the end we became fren fren only. then after we graduated, somehow we ended up in the same poly course but diff class. i tried to show my love for her...spend all my free periods with her, help her out with her schoolwork, give her advice when shes buying tech stuff (tell her which one is best value for money).<br><br>but then, she started spending more time with this guy from her class. that guy is like super gay looking lor. dam girly looking, very slim, also very weak. somehow she end up falling in love with him...and i became dam emo and wanted to give up hope le. then a few months later, i found out that that gay guy wanted to change sex. he grow his hair super long like zha bor, and when hes not in school he will wear girly clothes like skirt and singlet and all.<br><br>i thought since hes a girl now i'd have one more chance with that girl. finally muster some courage...dun wan let her slip thru my fingers again...ask her if she wanted to go out with me. TURNS OUT SHE PREFERS GIRLS OVER GUYS. THEN SHE CONFESSED TO ME THAT ALL HER EXS THAT SHE TELL ME ABOUT BEFORE WERE ALL GIRLS.<br><br>haizzz....i feel dam stupid. waste so long trying to jio one girl and its all in vain. :(</p>

              <p>If this is the reason why you feel stupid and emo.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Then I can safely tell you, that there's more to come.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Finding yourself a mate is not as easy as going to the supermarket.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>More like, ebaying.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>You search for the one you want, make several comparisons with what others have to offer.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Then you bid against your competitors. The highest bidder wins provided he/she meets the reserves requirement.</p>
