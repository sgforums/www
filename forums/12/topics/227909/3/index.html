The girl I still think about is not interested in me. I think it is because I am not good looking and I'm not rich like her previous boyfriend.<br><br>For that matter I notice that girls don't look at me. I don't know what is wrong with me. Maybe it's my eye browes being too thick, or my face is too big. I just don't know why.<br><br>How can I get over this and not be sad about not having a girlfriend.</div></blockquote>There's nothing wrong with being without a girlfriend at age 36. You should not question your self-worth because of it.<br><br>I'm sure one day, you will meet a girl who finds you interesting, who adores you the way you are. I know this may sound cliche, but you know, it's true. Life's a long journey, don't write yourself off so early. And when you eventually find that girl, treasure her.<br><br>Being rich, often makes it easier. Many girls do get attracted to that.<br>You know, it's not our fault if we're not born rich. But hey, you can change that destiny! You can do something about it. Read Rich Dad Poor Dad for some inspirations if you need to.<br><br>I'm not saying that get rich, and that's the way to get girls notice you.<br>I'm saying that don't keep thinking about what you don't have, think of doing something about what you don't have.<br><br>You know i been through alot too and i know one thing for sure: Nobody is always a loser in Life. Everybody does get a chance to win. Your chance will come.<br><br>I wish you success in 2007. Happy New Year!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As for girlfriend, I can advise you, but not sure if you agree to my philosophy.<br><br>No big deal not having a gf, but a bid deal not having enough money especially in Singapore.<br><br>Since you are a grad, you can join SDU, or other paid dating agencies for their services. SDU have a lot of activities for their members, and if you join their activities regularly, I am sure you will find your soulmate soon.<br><br>If you want to get married before 30, how about getting a wife from Vietnam, Myanmar if by then you are not able to find a soulmate.<br><br>Sad to say this, appearances does play a part. If you are handsome, no lack of gfs, but if you are ugly, thats it, thats the nature of the world isnt it. Money also apply to this logic. If you are ugly, but rich and drives a ferrari, I guess girls will stick to you like bees attracted to honey.<br><br>Heck why do you have to think you have to get married before or at 30 and start a family. There are people who are married at 30, 30 plus or even 40.<br>If you have this concept of marriage before 30, you are putting yourself under alot of undue pressure and stress.<br><br>Would you want to rushed into a marriage, then find that the girl is not your type, or vice versa, personality clashes, no common interests and so forth.<br>A divorce is both time consuming and expensive for man. Also marriage does not mean married happily after. There are a lot of divorces in Singapore.<br><br>Thats life for you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Will someone in the forum who is single and female, go out on a date with the TS to see if there is a chance to develop from there. A night out on a movie date won't kill  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Those who are abt his age ie 30 plus can consider going out on a date with the TS, give a chance to yourself and himself. If cannot work it out, then can remain as friends isn't it.<br><br>TS, you can learn from the insurance line, by asking your friends, family and relatives for referrals  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  I find this approach easier for you to know more girls if they have someone in mind.<br><br>If not, go sign up on paid dating agencies. If you are a grad, sign up SDU as a member, if you are not, then join SDS.<br><br>If really still cannot find a gf despite of your efforts, try marriage agency for Vietnam or Myanmese gals  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
