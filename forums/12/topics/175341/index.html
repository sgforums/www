That's the whole story of them.)<br><br>Now, its like we just tell everybody we've been together for what, seven years? Meaning that it implies we didn't break up at all since sec. school.

            <div class='col-md body'>You have a right to feel insecure, especially when your bf doesn't treat you as gently as he does with his ex.<br><br>From your later post replying Dev, I would say his ex knows she still has a place in his heart, &amp; is playing on that to deliberately hurt you.  For some sick, warped reason, she wants you to know that, "I was here 1st" to stake her claim.  1 phrase comes to mind: Bo Liao.<br><br>Perhaps it may be time to tell your fiance plainly that all this is hurting you, &amp; although you trust him, her taunts don't exactly make you feel good.  If he was in your shoes, he may deal with it, but it's hard on you.  If he doesn't give you support, then how much support is he gonna give you when you guys are married?<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by AshedAnna:</div><div class="quote_body">No FeowFeow, only in the beginning of the relationship he was the nicest as always with most relationships.
