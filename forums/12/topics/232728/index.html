Who? xxx lor." etc.<br><br>she won't be telling you all these.<br><br>there could be 2 (that i can see) reasons she is telling you these....<br><br>1) Wants you to know that she has nothing to hide, that you have nothing to fear/be jealous.<br><br>2) Wants to see some reaction from you.... like MILD jealousy...<br><br>why don't the next time she tells you these things right, try telling her something like this... in a joking manner<br><br>"hmmm.... u very close with xxx hor..... hmph.... i jealous liao..... hahaha... but hor.... i trust u la..... tell me if he bully u hor.... i go humtum him!! hehehe"<br><br>let her know you do treasure her but also trust her...</div>

Surely, other guys would have done the same thing and forge the same bonds like the way you do - the only difference is that either you made more impact or you were 'faster' in your approach, in which love has developed.<br><br>Kinda obvious about this guy's intention to advance on her - jealousy only occurs when feelings are invested and if he is feeling it, he's probably investing chance, time, money and emotions? And likely, he could seize opportunity to give your relationship a low blow, especially when there are frictions brewing from conflicts?<br><br>This is the dilemma of leading relationship: should we sacrifice short term, in which our relationship will benefit a broader frame of time, or are we to sacrifice long term to appease short term gains?<br><br>You worried about communicating serious and unpleasant issues to your partner, in which a bulk of your worries comes from the fear of losing this relationship. You may decide to keep mum because you would choose to ignore your own concern by brushing it away, but certainly, you wouldn't be able to put it aside for long before you start trashing things. This is sacrificing long term to appease short term gains because once she get 'used' to you behaving in that manner over a long period of time, it would be difficult to make major adjustment in your relationship later or the cost of implementing those changes will be tremendously pricy.<br><br>You may like to let her know, over a causal dinner, that this guy is questionable, although you have no plans to restrict her in any sense and you still allow her the freedom.<br><br>In the long run, the key is to resolve her insensitivity - not the man around her.<br><br>P.S: In marketing, generating awareness does not always equate to sales.
