And if her pic is circulated and many ppl have made comments about her body and you, as a friend, rubbing it in, maybe she has reach her limit.<br><br>If a friendly person suddenly changes to a very cold person, perhaps you would like to think back what you really done wrong..I mean how long have you know her? if for a very long time, you've done something wrong. (meaning she is not this way before) If for a short time, perhaps it's her other side you've never seen before. All in all, you really have to think back what really went wrong.</div>

May I remind you that she's a GIRL....<br><br>Integrity, self-defence, insensitive or oversensitive... Whichever you wanna label it as, is somehow a rather subjective thing... But based on a more 'intrusive' ground (he made the 1st outwards move), I would say he should be more careful for a starter....? Of course, none of us are perfect beings, and we all made mistakes... But no reason for finger pointing since one has commited a mistake (however small you might wanna imagine it to be) in the 1st place...?</div>

In fact, it certainly buffers my intelligence to figure what sort of 'help' you might require...?<br><br>As of my previous posts... If one made a mistake and realise it, it might just be genuinely a human's nature to error from time to time...<br><br>But if one commit a mistake and can afford to make such a LUXURIOUS EXCUSE for HIMSELF... Even in an attempt to turn the table around to the other party (on a generalised level).... All I can say is GOOD LUCK to you....?<br><br>Actually you need not us to tell you of what you already know deep within yourself... If you really think you're 'right' on your grounds, would you even wanna come out during an outing as yourself and stand for your 'point'?<br><br>YOU DECIDE <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>
