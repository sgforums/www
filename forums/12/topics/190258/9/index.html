You like her. Why didn't you say so in the 1st place?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>How old are you..?<br><br>Going after a girl you're interested in... Frustrations often won't get you too far..<br><br>You still don't understand now, do you?<br><br>Whatever's happening to you is because of you've done.. You can't change your past but only shape your future...<br><br>Give her time to make her decision... You're still a far leap from your target... Like you've said, you're not even friends... If you still hold a chance or she's interested in you enough, you'll naturally be forgiven... Otherwise, not much point for you to cry over spilled milk also...</div>
