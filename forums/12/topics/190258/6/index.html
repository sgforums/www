            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: green;">I guess, it could probably be a huge misunderstanding. Guess the comment you made about her probably make her see you in a totally different way. It may seems like a harmless remark to you and probably to other girls but to her maybe it means something to her. </span><span style="color: red;">Have you tried asking her why she acting so cold to you? Ask her whether is it because of the remark you make? </span><span style="color: blue;">Some girls can be really petty(I know of some), but to to such an extent like yours, very weird.. Try asking her why or ask her close friends.. Like HENG@ said, try to find out why she acting like that..</span><br><span style="color: orange;">Hope my crapZ helps..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </span></div>
