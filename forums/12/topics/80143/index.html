Don't even know if its really his child just married recently only, stomach quite big already.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>My uncle is a very capacble man and fairly rich too but recently I think he went bankrupt and now everything in under that China Woman's name. Quite dangerous right?<br><br>What I am afraid of is, in future after he passed away he probably will leave some inheritance for my mother, his sister. What if that China woman comes knocking on the door and demand us to hand over the inheritance or what if he is really so stupid to didn't realised that China woman is only using him? I mean why would a 20+ China woman married a 40+ man when they barely know each other or a year or two and almost right after my uncle and his previous wife divorced.</div>
