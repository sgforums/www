I wonder have i made any mistakes. Almost all of them been invited except for the absentee who might be busy. What have i done wrong?<br><br>I known to be less popular and not much charm in my old school as i have label poor and old fashioned. That could be the fault that i can't click on them last time. I really dont know why they look down on me. I do treasure friendship seriously but no one recognise it.

            <div class='col-md body'>*nods nods*<br><br>I agree with Smudgey.  1 of the reasons you probably jumped to the conclusion that your friends shunned you because you aren't rich &amp; popular may be because of your own self-esteem issues?<br><br>Your friends might actually have been trying to spare your feelings, &amp; by jumping to your conclusion, you may Not have been fair to them.  Why don't you speak to 1 of them, &amp; tell her/him that you're quite hurt at having been left out?  Ask gently &amp; calmly for their reassurance that they haven't left you out due to malice.  Perhaps their explanation will help you feel better.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by smudgey:</div><div class="quote_body">Some times ppl/friends have a tendercy to drift apart.... a lot of effort is needed to maintain a friendship and truth to be told, if I can't click with him/her why spend so much time to maintain this "friendship"... Plus If the other part does not want to be bothered to maintain this friendship... Are they really your friends?<br><br>You mentioned that you are labeled poor, maybe just maybe, the place they were going for dinner is rather pricey and they didn't want you to feel obligated to go along and spend that money that you can't really spare on a dinner? or maybe it was an impromptu thingy?<br><br>Most often we let our imaginations run away with us... often the situation is not as bad as we envision it to be...<br><br>take action! go ahead and organise an outing and meet up chat.... it might be nothing at all...<br><br></div></blockquote></div>
