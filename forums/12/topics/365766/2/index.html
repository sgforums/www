              <p>This type of gf don't want better. Better to be single than to have this type of gf. But before break up with her must make her have sex with you first, don't care is force her, give her drugs to eat than fuck her, etc.</p>
              <p>Just make sure she loses her virginity before you break up with her. Make her miserable for the rest of her life.</p>

              seriously speaking, if you love her, you should also like her religion, thats what you are in now isnt it. but i think you like her appearance more than anything else.
              
              Since you know she is a devout christian, there isnt much you can do, since you know what you are getting at.
              
              I think she would be suited more to another fellow christian than non believers, as they have more common interests than non believers, like going to church, cell groups, abstaining from sex before marriages, go to a christian bookshop etc, listening to gospel songs and reading bible etc.
              
              unless you are a christian or going to convert to one, dun think you share her interest in these.

              <p>Christians have alot of commitment in their church, he got to understand your gf. Some people's life revolves around christianity, and no matter what they do, its also church, god and jesus. I am not saying this is bad, its just their devotion towards the religion.</p>
              <p>If your friend is staying by the girl just because she is pretty, then ya fren is a loser. Because he loves her just because she is pretty and wants to Fuck her. Well, i dont see this relationship lasting, because in the end the girl would still break up with your fren. Because christians tend to marry other christians. And your friend is not on the same frequency and wavelength with the girl. Ones like to go church and cell groups. The other like clubbing and sex.</p>
              <p>So instead of waiting for the girl to eventually dumb him, ask ya loser friend to give her up and look for other girls that he can really enjoy being with. Your friend isnt at all happy with the girl. He just wants her because she is pretty and wanna fuck her. Pathetic!</p>

              not idiots lar, but fundamentalist. they are devout to their own religion. christians should just target those who are keen to join them or readily accept their teachings. they should leave those non believers alone and respect their religions or beliefs.

              maybe this is the first time his gf is pretty and his previous gfs are not. it doesnt help if his fetish is having a pretty gf. some guys prefer gfs who are fat or plumb.

              <p>Most importantly, when he ask her for sex, she say that Christians are not allowed to have premartial sex.</p>
              <p>He does not want to break up with her because she is very pretty. He is a quiet person and he is not rich not handsome also so it will be difficult for him to find another gf.</p>
