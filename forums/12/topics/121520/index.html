But where's your integrity? How could you allow a woman to pay for your everything?<br><br>You may have face lotsa setbacks in your career. What you should do now is not to harbour on the past anymore or you used to be successful blah blah blah! Plan your route well. Life is not always smooth sailing. When you fell, you get up. You learn from mistakes and make sure it doesn't happen.<br><br>From what you said abt you staying in the r'ship, tolerating her temper cos you are grateful that shes paying for your everything. Do you truly love her or do you love yourself more??? I think you are a selfish man who is afraid of loneliness! Where's your self-esteem, your integrity, your principles???<br><br></div>

Well, before I try to help you...I must say that you really deserved your current fate right now.<br><br>Hmm...well, you see...why you are in such a state currently is mainly due to yourself. You dwell in self-pity and this affected all your decisions that eventually brought you to this state.<br><br>If there is something that has been bothering your mind and heart all along and it doesn't concerns your girlfriend, I would like you to drop/forget all of them right now. You need to do that before you can move on and pick up your life and get it on track again. Do you have a religion? If yes, pay more attention to your religion as it will bring peace to your mind.<br><br>Throw away all your current pride, you won't be needing them at this stage.

And...your girlfriend, she loves you a lot and has sacrificed a lot for you.

I have yet to read anything that tells me that you like/love her.<br><br>Go get yourself any job, give her a hug EVERYDAY and start to pay some real concern for her please.

Not even if she offers and she loves you heaps...never never live off a girl...that's a very poor and shallow attitude towards life.<br><br>I hope this helps you a bit...even if it is 1% or 0.0001%. You will definitely need to start your life again and it will won't be easy. Do that for the sake of your girlfriend please. Good luck.<br><br>Ohh...your girlfriend hasn't stopped loving you, just that she is terribly terribly terribly disappointed with you. And you still have 1% chance of salvaging this situation...it all depends on the decision that you will be making. Think of her before you decide on anything and remember...she still loves you deep inside her heart.<br><br>Good luck once again.</div>
