Either that, or in the course booklet u receive before u start classes there will be a section on refund policies. It wouldn't matter if you have attended any lesson yet when the course start, as long as it has started and u decide to withdraw from the course, u would receive less than the full amount u pay as refund. But i sympathise with u because they inform u of the timetable so late. This will answer ur 1st question as to why u are not getting FULL refund.<br><br>As for the 2nd question, I think it depends on individual schools. their refund policy may be 2 months, and hence they tell u it takes 2 months. As to whether u can complain to Case, I am not sure, although I suggest u wait until u receive ur refund liao then see how. If u do not get the amount they told u u will be receiving, then u should complain. In the meantime, I doubt they can do anything, since the school set the refund policy, and when u sign up for the course, they can say that u agree 2 abide by the school's policies, regardless of whether u know about their policies or not. They can claim that its all stated clearly in the course outline, and if it is true and u do not read it, then it is ur fault.<br><br>Btw, I KPO a bit, can tell which Private school course u sign up for?</div>
