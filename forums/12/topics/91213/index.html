            <div class='col-md body'>Just open up yourself and smile more. Be friendly, and naturally, people will talk to you. Just be yourself, and don't think so much when you want to make friends.<br><br>Regarding this girl... well, she is attached. More or less, I think why you are feeling this way towards her might be because she is one of the few girls that you can really talk and communicate to. So there is a high chance that it might be just mere infactuation.<br><br>Keep a clear mind, focus and tell yourself that she is just a friend. And she is the beginning of more friendships that has yet to come for you.<br><br>Just concentrate, and study hard. Be happy, be cheerful, and friends will come.
