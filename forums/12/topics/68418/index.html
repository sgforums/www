And now I will teach you how to create this possible miracle.<br><br>***<br><br>You are sad because he is locked behind bars and couldn't accompany, talk or even SMS you anymore. However, the positive side is that this is a couple's karmic lesson for you both to undergo and if you humble yourself, acknowledge this test and face the challenges, you won half the battle. Please note that this test will bring your relationship into new heights because after this phrase of his life - there will be changes and this changes will mould and evolve the both of you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Handle inner cycle first (Internal environment): When you could see him in jail and if it is possible to pass him letter or note, do write up something and give him. Of course, in the midst of all these emotional words that you will sure to write - your content throughout this year plus has to be one constant message - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">CHANGE FOR THE SAKE OF THIS RELATIONSHIP</span>. If his temper is bad, he has to change. People tries to pick a fight? Learn to smile and walk off. People stare? Look on the floor.<strong> He has to learn emotional control</strong>. Worst still - if his friends were a bunch of people always implicated into fights - avoid hanging out with them.<br><br>With constant psychological reinforcement of encouragement, new drive of goals and psychological/emotional rebirth - this relationship will grow and foster from this test. In jail, he has tons of time to spend on thinking and pondering - he will read and re-read your letters. Your strong, firm faith in overcoming odds and to change him will succeed if he truely loves you and his focus becomes long term (this relationship) and not short term (by his temper).<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> He has to change because you want your parents to know that you didn't make a wrong choice.<br><br>What about you? You shall learn the beauty of devotion and encouragement to your love. If this year shall be a year of many suitors, so where does your love lies? In this bleak hours of his life, where will your strength in him lies? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: <strong>If you shield the canyon from the wind, you will never see the beauty of their craving.</strong> Relationship test - do you have the strength to leap to the next level? Or do you cry and succumb?<br><br>Cheers</div>

Ure right.... i can't believe suicide even crossed my mind. I have always been one to overcome difficulty with a positive and determined outlook... but this situation was entirely different. I couldn't accept it and i felt the pain was too much. I guess that's what love does to you... throws you off the track and makes u wanna think and do weird things. But i feel much stronger now. like one of you said...whats a year? if i can't wait that long and be patient and supportive..i don't deserve to be in the relationship. Its not gonna be easy but i guess... this is the best way to test the strength our relationship and i'll try to see it as a challenge.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  </div></blockquote>well done!<br>glad u came 'round to your senses.<br>anytime it gets too hard to bear again, well, we're here...</div>

I've been so depressed since then. I cry everytime i look at pictures we took together. I've never missed anyone so much in my life. The worst part...he didn't know how to tell me that he wld be going in soon...but i found out soon after. and my parents, who have always been against him because of his bad past wld probably totally ban me from having anything to do with him if they found out. I feel so alone and i can't bear to let him go but i know my parents might not accept him in the future. sometimes i think that perhaps suicide is the only way to end this pain.</strong>[/b]</blockquote>oh oh oh!! cool down girl...don't ever do anything foolish,im sure your bf also would not want to see you like this,can imagine if any things happen to u and he is inside,the feeling is worse than hell but still cannot do anything,well...maybe now your parents cannot accept him now doesn't mean that itz forever,maybe one day the strong relationship the two of u having will melt them...stay cool and wait for him if u really love him alot,but the same time make sure that u can be able to stay wit him for life,orelse don't waste your youth and time...</div>
