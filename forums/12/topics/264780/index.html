But as you progress further into your relationship - to sustain a relationship requires more than just that lovey SMS.<br><br>Don't get me wrong - it's always good to be loving and send something thoughtful or affectionate, but that shouldn't be the source of your problem.<br><br>Often, it's how the person developed emotionally.<br><br>Not everyone is apt to be affectionate.<br><br>You will be surprised knowing how some people demonstrate their affection in love. It's not because they don't love their partners - but rather, their environment and personal development had grown in such a way that they are unable to respond to love spontaneously and heartily.<br><br>Next time when you witness a large group of friends laugh together, watch carefully: you will realise that although the term 'laughter' is experienced by all - everybody will react differently to this experience, in terms of how they display their mirth.<br><br>Some will burst out in madness; some will tear; some will only giggle; some will remain cold; some will roll on the floor; some will only smile; some will cover their mouth when they laugh; some will appear like seizure; some will be clutching their chest... so on and so forth.<br><br>It's not about 'turning to be like these' as your title has suggested - it's probably part her to behave in such a manner in her most natural state and form. During honeymoon stage and the chase, most of us would attempt to conceal our flaws and negative aspects of our personality. It's only when we have led our relationship and given enough time, our blemish becomes clear.<br><br>Relationship is not a journey of perfect bliss. You have probably board the wrong train if you are expecting one.<br><br>It's how you uncover about each other's true personality, deal with them and grow from there. That takes years of effort to compromise, shape and evolve one another and especially to craft your relationship. Now that you know more about her and your relationship, start structuring basis communication - relating individual needs and definition of love. Try to blend indifference into something workable and learn to fine tune regularly to keep it in shape.<br><br>If you even perturbing over such minor roadblocks, I can only say: please anticipate more of such challenges, with greater intensity, thrown into your path.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Well, she might be just too tired and wants to talk to her girlfriends maybe? She also needs her own time and space. Not everytime she needs to spend time with you, she's human too. Maybe you are too possessive over her, you need to develop the relationship to a higher stage whereby its up to mutual understanding. Mushy stuff such as "dear" or "honey" is called only/maybe after the honeymoon period unless you are able to maintain that kind of affection towards each other.<br><br>Ultimately, asking yourself whether she is the right woman for you in the future, give yourself some time to think about it. Not everyone can be so mushy ALL THE TIME just like in the movies, somehow there will be problems(obstacles) here and there. It is how you tackle these problems(obstacles) to make the relationship a stronger one.<br><br>Oh yes! Talking face to face &gt; Calling &gt; SMS/MSN.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Everyone's expectation on Love is different.<br><br>The first 2+ months you experienced was sweet, and that's not surprising because i believe generally everyone has a pre-conceived notion of honey moon period.<br><br>However, for the stage after that, its different for everyone. While 10 smses a day everyday for 5 months may seem alright to you. It may slowly be suffocating for her. Especially If you require her to answer the smses as well (i do remember how intrusive a sms conversation is when you're trying to enjoy a few hours of gaming).<br><br>I believe she wants her own private space, and i suggest that you give it to her, by cutting down on your smses, and instead, talk to her face to face once every few days(depending on how much time the two of you have), or just call once in every 2 days.<br><br>What i'm saying is to cut back a bit, and be slightly less demanding. Maybe she'll reciprocate in kind and instead give you the attention you want later in the relationship.<br><br>Tui yi bu, hao guo tian kong? Take a step backwards, and maybe you'll reach the stars.
