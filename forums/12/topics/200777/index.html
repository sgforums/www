You can't eat and sleep and work.<br><br>So the first thing to do is banish her from your thoughts so that life can go on. Only after you have successfully done that, only then can you cherish the time you had when you were together.</div>

If you loved her (just as she loved you), you should all the more wish her happiness for you loved and cared. There is no need to harbour hatred or any negative feelings towards her, that only showed you loved her based on emotions and NOT on love itself.<br><br>Time will heal your pain of losing her, in the mean time go out with friends or do something to pre-occupy yourself. Friends can share your problems even if not all can answer your questions in heart. If you still have any problems, you may want to post here or PM to a few people you can trust. We can offer some form of "help" to you.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
