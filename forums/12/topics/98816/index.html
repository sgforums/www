            <div class='col-md body'>There was once this guy who is very much in love with his girl. This romantic guy folded 1,000 pieces of paper cranes as a gift to his girl. Although, at that time he was just a small fry in his company, his future doesn't seem too bright, they were very happy together. Until one day, his girl told him she was going to Paris and will never come back. She also told him that she cannot visualize any future for the both of them, so they went their own ways there and then.<br><br>Heartbroken, the guy agreed. But when he regained his confidence, he worked hard day and night, slogging his body and mind just to make something out of himself. Finally with all the hard work and the help of friends, this guy had set up his own company.<br><br>One rainy day, while this guy was driving, he saw an elderly couple sharing an umbrella in the rain walking to some destination. Even with the umbrella, they were still drenched. It didn't take him long to realize they were his girl's parents. With a heart in getting back at them, he drove slowly beside the couple, wanting them to spot him in his luxury sedan.<br><br>He wanted them to know that he wasn't the same anymore, he had his own company, car, condo, etc. He made it! What he saw next confused him, the couple was walking towards a cemetery, and so he got out of his car and followed and he saw his girl, a photograph of her smiling sweetly as ever at him from her tombstone and he saw his paper cranes right beside her.<br><br>Her parents saw him. He asked them why had this happened. They explained. She did not leave for France at all. She was ill with cancer. She had believed that he will make it someday, but she did not want to be his obstacle. Therefore she had chosen to leave him. Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to, doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have. She had wanted her parents to put his paper cranes beside her, because, if the day comes when fate brings him to her again, he can take some of those back with him. Once you have loved, you will always love. For what's in your mind may escape but what's in your heart will remain forever.<br><br>The guy just wept. The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right besides her knowing you can't have her, see her or be with her ever again. Hope you understand.<br><br>* Find time to realize that there is one person who means so much to you, for you might wake up one morning losing that person who you thought meant nothing to you.<br></div>

At times, they even see the most important person as someone disposable to them. Thats how regrets come.<br><br>I hope this story can remind us to take a more careful look at people around u who cares for u and mean alot to u but yet u duno or take them as not such a person.<br><br>Pardon me for speaking in the view point of the person who is around but not appreciated. It was just how my heart felt towards happenings around me lately.</div>
