            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Jus found a new job recently in a private clinic.. Completed my dip in nursing.. Indeed is kinda hard to find a job for a green horn like mi.. With zero working experience at all..<br><br>Alot plp adviced mi to start off in the hosp 1st.. But after long period of consideration, i decided to tak up a clinic job coz of the office hours.. Have a proper lunch break.. (In the ward, there isn such thing as lunch! U're too buzy thruout 2 leave!)<br><br>Boy, i was wrong!!<br><br>Practically everydae we're workin over time! From 8.30 it can stretch up to 6.30.. Tot that everydae can have proper lunch break of 1h, but nah.. We work thru lunch practically everydae! We take turn to eat.. &amp; that is onli 10-15 mins each.. Depends on how fast u tak to gobble ur food down..<br><br>The doc is reali popular i guess.. Sees double the number of patients.. In a mornin.. From 8.30 - 1pm.. Sees abt 26 patients + / - ... Sat is worst.. Thouigh 1pm is our offical time to close, we end up closin at 3pm.. Every sat almost!<br><br>Everydae.. Sum times is a full clinic.. Sum times is onli half dae.. Or the dae of the wk is allocated for pt doin surgery..<br><br>We look 4ward to half dae clinic coz tat's the onli time we have to clear our paper work.. But then.. On and off.. The doc will say.. Okie.. I'm free 2dae, or there's no surgery.. Open clinic.. Urgh! There goes our time to clear paper work..<br><br>The onli gd thing is we get to claim time off.. On &amp; off when there is no clinic, we can take time off..<br><br>Reali dunno if i can tak it any further..<br><br>!stly.. the workin hours is too long.. Haha.. I tot tat office hrs is beta.. But i realised by the time u off work.. is already so late into the evenin.. Everywhere is crowded.. &amp; shoppin centers are closins soon..<br><br>Another is the workload.. Mayb i'm too new.. But i jus can't find enough time to finish my work.. I mx to cope okie when dealin with patients.. Doin several tests on and off..<br><br>But paperwork.. I've a big headache.. Always can't find the time to finish.. Work seems never ending..<br><br>I'm in charge of the drugs inventory.. Each time the stock is low.. Havet o call and mak order.. Find the time to key in into our system.. To juggle the lttle time we have when there isn clinic, claimin ur time off to have a rest.. Answer the phone.. No neat feat!<br><br>There are time we are alone.. The phone calls can mak mi go crazy!! Feel like a telephone operator at times.. The calls if to fix appointment is easy..<br><br>But then sometimes is call to request for this n that.. Takes up more time.. Handlin the calls alone.. Leave u even lesser time for paper work!!<br><br>U can be answerin tis call.. N while u still on the line.. Another phone will ring.. If not.. once u hang up the phone, the nx call will come in non stop..<br><br>Got so stressed up..Tat i  started to "hear" the phone ringin..When in actual fact, there isn at all.. Gotten funny tat.. How come the phone isn ringin 2dae?<br><br>Often.. I have alot of stuff to pack.. Cotton balls.. Surgical instruments.. Pack it into papers or bags etc.. Then send it for autoclavin.. A procedure to sterilise all the stuff used..<br><br>@ least for the clinic.. I dun mind.. But recently.. The doc family uses alot of supplies.. Have to keep wrappin n wrappin.. Alot of time taken up..Lucky she's on leave.. So i mx to do it.. if not how!<br><br>I have to cut the paper, wrap it lik a present.. urgh..<br><br>I'm so stress!<br><br>Sorry 4 e long post.. jus lettin off steam!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

It probably won't be as systematic as working in a hospital... But the main pro would be that you're likely to be working under only 1 or 2 bosses...<br><br>In a hospital is more systematic and it's more likely that you can follow up by the black and white alone..
