            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">Please pardon my english. hahaha.. </span><br><br>When closing a deal, 20% of the time is the customers who close it, and the other 20% is the salesperson who close it. so what about the remaining 60%? 60% of the time, the deal has never been closed because there wasn't any attempt to do so.<br><br>so why is this so?? there are 2 main factors. 1st is because of guilt. the salesperson himself/herself know that the product isnt as good as being promoted, and at the point of closing the deal, he/she decided not to do so. 2ndly, it's because of fear of rejection. the salesperson is afraid of being rejected, and therefore decided to reject himself/herself by not attempting to clinch the deal.<br><br>rejection, it's commonly seen in reality. it's not just about closing a business deal. lecturer cited an example how he was being rejected by a girl he liked when he was secondary 4. the reason why the rejection took place is not because of him, but the girl had a boyfriend already.<br><br>then he went on, explaining "tenacity". he had this friend, XX, who likes this girl, and wanted to ask her out. he asked her out for a simple meal for the 1st time, but was rejected.. and was continuosly rejected after many many attempts. so XX approached lecturer and asked him how. The latter simply told him, "try again lor". and his friend really heeded his advice, and tried again.. after many many many many attempts, the girl eventually agreed to go on a date with him. then the girl finally fell in love with him after a few dates, and so they went on steady... one day, the girl met a rich suave-looking in her university, and fell in love with him (the suave + rich guy). so she initiated a break-up. but XX didnt want to because he loved her deeply.. so he kept asking, persuading.. and did all kind of things, hoping that she will come back to him one day. but she didnt.<br><br>XX again approached lecturer for help. lecturer told him once more, "try again lor". and XX really did try again. after many attempts once more.. blah blah... they patched up.. and right now they are happily married, with 3 children.<br><br>and that's tenacity. 40% of the sales people gave up after their first attempt.. (so much statistics.. don't quite rem). so in general 96% of the sales people gave up after their 4th attempt. the remaining 4% succeeded on their 5th attempts despite being rejected for the first 4 times.<br><br>haha.. so understand what's tenacity now? =P<br></div>

Many successes in life has been created because of this, and i agree that this is a good characteristic to have.<br><br>But like what Icy Jie has stated... you keep on banging the same window, you end up killing yourself. Why not see if the other windows are open instead?<br><br>Generally it applies to relationships as well. Keep on trying to woo a girl, but girl rejects you. There are only 2 options: 1) Continue to pester her. 2) Give up and look for another.<br><br>Sometimes, infact, many times. I've heard of my friends being continuously pestered by people who don't give up. While this may be a good thing in business relationships, i believe it can get kind of irritating when you cannot seem to ditch a guy you have no interest with.<br><br>Hence everytime a relationship problem surfaces in AA, we have generally 2 responses, continue in the relationship, or give up and look for another.<br><br>Of course i think which stage of the relationship, future of it is important when considering which option to take... but then i just realised i'm rambling, and i don't know where i'm headed.
