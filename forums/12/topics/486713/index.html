              <p>You have got no choice, you can try negotiating with them. This kind of thing cannot say dont sue one, you can try to go to legal clinic see what the lawyer there tells you. This is breach of contract you know? The contract is made to fulfill both parties obligations, you are obliged to fulfill the working terms stated in the contract while the agency is obliged to pay you your wages. If any terms is not fulfilled, there is a breach in the contract and whoevers breach it will have to face the music. </p>
              <p>Before doing anything, please make sure that you have fulfilled ALL obligations in the contract. </p>

              Are you a foreign student studying in Singapore? If you are and you are 16 years old and above; and your current immigration status is on student pass or dependent pass, you are not suppose to work as a part timer or full-time basis. Its against the MOM laws. The employer need to apply for your work permit with MOM and go through the process of work permit protocol if they wish to hire you eventhough its a short term employment during school holidays.

              Are you above 16 years old? If you are, then report this case to MOM and bring along your contract agreement and payment proof from that agency to the officer in charge at MOM. Its free and no service fee.

              Me too...in the past I get annoyed and frustrated when I encountered agents and the bosses themselves whom I suspected were trying to cheat their workers..in my case usually the foreign workers and they tried to lied their way with MOM while processing their workers' work permit...sometimes I would question the agents/bosses themselves until they got scared. Sometimes I felt like grabbing them by their collars and shout in their faces...but of course I never did that...However, sometimes I wish I could reject their work permit applications but after on the spot verification..all their documents were all in order and valid...so sadly and reluctantly I had to approved their work permit processing..and send their workers for thumb prints for the work permit card. I really like to see more local companies especially the SMEs...hanged by MOM for trying to cheat their employees of their wages and work rights....there are plenty out there...really plenty of them...still cheating their employees and abusing the labour laws in Singapore.

              So Peikou...listen to me...if you are below 16 years of age...or a foreign student working as part-timer or full-timer secretly...don't worry...just report it to MOM...the most MOM will advise you and remind you to be careful next time and follow the MOM law. The the real culprit is/are the employer/employers...they should know better about MOM laws...they will be dealth by MOM sternly without any prejudice. Anyway...MOM is really looking forward of working closely with the public or whistle blowers on rogue employers...local or foreign entities.
