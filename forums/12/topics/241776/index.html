If he tells you, it is not simply a  'prediction', there is an element of 'commitment' as well.<br><br>I think you should try to find out and have a clear idea why he and his wife want to separate. Ask him what his wife complained about him... then observe if you can stand it, those things his wife complains about him<br><br>If he says that his wife complains that he does not communicate and he is always not around, then O_O; same complains as your present ones...<br><br>If it is because his wife dislike his habit of not 'committing' and 'communicating' and you are the type that would like your man to 'commit' and 'communicate' then how do you expect to be happy with him?<br><br>I can guess that in the beginning you gave him lots of space since he is still married. That was your excuse. That was his excuse. He enjoyed the 'freedom' you gave him and compared to his wife you were like heaven sent.<br><br>He did not realise that it was temporary and you are not what he thinks you are.  I can imagine that he thought that you will be much more easier then his wife since you are willing to have a relationship with a married man. He did not think that you will expect him to commit and communicate much more once you think that there were no good reasons for him not to. You too want him to commit and communicate just like his wife.<br><br>There are 3 possible outcomes<br>1. One, he changes... which I think is very unlikely because he is willing to divorce his wife rather than change.<br><br>2. You change. That is up to you and for you to decide if you can and are willing to be there when he needs you and he will not reciprocate by being there when you need him unless it is life and death. You can expect that he will not be there or will be around very little under normal circumstances.<br><br>3. You separate. Please don't think that you have any hold on him. Not sex, not money, not even promise of a relationship unless it is on his terms. There are women like that. Women that will "be a doormat" so to speak. If you are not, then you will have a hard time in this relationship.</div>

I understand that you wanna see him... and that this is probably the only way you think you can meet him.... but does he see this?<br><br>I use to do this too for my ex, and he will last min have to wk so we can't meet even if i cleared my day for him....<br><br>So i changed 'tactics'... Basically I was sick and tired of waiting and sacrificing my own personal life for an opportunity to meet him...<br><br>so I told him. if he can't confirm with me by thurs if sat he wanna/can meet, then I'll just make my own plans. and at a point, to drive my point home, I'll stay home all day but still refuse to meet him last min.<br><br>after that he learned that i'm just not going to settle for sitting by the phone every weekend waiting for him to grace me with his presence....<br><br>so what i'm trying to say is. you have to try not to be too available for him. or he'll never treasure you. Try asking him a direct qn. like "tell me now once and for all, are you meeting me this sat?" and if he try to change the topic, don't allow it.</div>
