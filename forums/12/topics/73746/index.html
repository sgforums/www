            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly speaking , i think most of the shops in singapore have bad customer service. If you looks like a poor chap , they don't even bother to serve you. Regarding of your MRT incident , well.. not all of the singaporeans are racists. have you ever listen to our national anthem ? It goes like we the citizens of singapore , regardless of races , language or reglion... : )</div>

Everyone (especially in another forum) jumps on board and starts saying they are 'diluting', 'polluting' the chinese race. HAHAH..<br><br>My response is.. yes.. they are racists. My friend from India, whom i met in Melbourne came down to Singas with me. We were sitting in my neighbourhood coffeeshop in the morning. The aunties that walked past with their groceries in their hands stared at us. Every one of them did that. My friend asked what on earth is wrong with them.

Regarding your 1st incident with the fast food restaurant, no.. It's not your fault. Though I agree with some that your topic is far too overgeneralised, it's more like a response of mine.. Like to defend my position as a Singaporean...<br><br>Despite the fact that I won't agree all Singaporeans are like that. I've come to realised that quite a majority of them can indeed be so. Calling the ang mos racist and uncivilised and yet we're not reflecting on ourselves... Yes. In a way, it's a shame.<br><br>Against Indians, there're generally 3 types of prejudice which I've come to noticed. The 1st is 'inborn'. Some people 'just don't like the smell and look' of Indians... In Singapore's hokkien culture, 'koah li ber siong...'. Nothing you've done, you've said. Some people just 'naturally' don't like certain things or certain people... I have no problem with their attitude, except that they should just try to restrain themselves 'a little'? Imagine a world where tomorrow President of US 'not happy' with Singaporeans then some missiles would come flying our way... You'll get the picture?<br><br>The 2nd would be 'hatre of behaviour &amp; power'. As of now, some Indians tend to take quite high positions in our society and SOME have them do tends to 'look after' their own skin type... Could be the way of 'management' which they use or the attitude which they display (which I personally believe in due to their background culture... Can't really blame them totally..?) Being suppressed long term by such a form of character would naturally make you develop a prejudice and hatre against this race...<br><br>The 3rd type is 'Status prejudice'... This type is not really prejudice against local Indians.. Nor establised overseas one... This type is a form of 'looking down'... Because of a form of mentality that Indians work as labourers and cleaners.... It's a form of look down. And it's not exclusive to Indians. But it has become more and more influential subconsciously as more Indians take up these jobs....<br><br>As for your woes. I've noticed indeed that especially of customer service areas... They tends to treat those who they believe are of the 'lower class' as less worthy and can really be rude to them... This I would not defend against. You'll only see a minority who really understand the meaning of customer service or having zero prejudice at all doing a good (fair?) job....<br><br>As for your encounter in the MRT. I personally believe that the comment is racist and uncalled for. But another point I would like to bring up here. I think that you could usually see quite alot of 'rude' Singaporeans displaying their behaviours at the MRT... Ok.. Not only Singaporeans... Even foreign Indians and China workers...? It's just the way you see it? I think among all, the Europeans are the ones displaying much better behaviours generally speaking... The rest? Well... I believe it's very much a matter of 'culture' and beliefs? Being in the kinda society we're in, we tends to be more 'practical'... So especially of those aunties and uncles.... They would tend to neglect things like that... Or people in some work force? Highly selfish and 'each for their own' kinda mentality?<br><br>Yup... This is the kinda society... Having said that, have I told you about the Indians? Yup... And the China man...
