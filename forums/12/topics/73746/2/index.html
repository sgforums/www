            <div class='col-md body'>I would say a good number of chinese dislike the indians because of the smell. You ask any chinese to go to little indian on Saturday and sit on the bus from serangoon, very few will say they want to.<br><br>Traditional chinese families do not want interracial marriages. Same goes for Indian families who want their sons/daughters to marry other Indian families and still arranged marriages even up to today's society! Same goes for Malay families as well.<br><br>The modern singaporean, most would'nt mind but its still frown upon, its not something a society is used to see, ie an ang mo girl with a chinese man... is hardly seen but there are some and they get the most stares! But, Singapore is being more open about it, having productions such as Ah-cha on TCS 5, shows a chinese girl married with an indian!<br><br>Even our govt is open to employing gays or lesbians. I would say Singapore is pretty open to interracial marriages and bi relationshpis, but it takes time for the citizens to adapt to these new values as we are still 3rd or 4th generation citizens. IE our grand parents or great or great great grand parents came from traditional china, india, indo, M'sia...<br><br></div>

MRT was crowded and she was standing in the middle of the door. she refuesed to move and i was unable to get down.. i had to go to next step and the come back...the lady passed the comment "why you indians come to our place, you people don't know how to behave in MRT". again i don't see any misbehave and i was polite and i don't see any problem to ask a woman to give me way as i want to get down and she is standing in the middle.....</div></blockquote>i strongly resent your comments. you might comment that these two singaporeans were downright rude. but i wouldn't think they're racist. if you were a chinese national, they'd just substitute indian for chinaman...<br><br>but i do have to agree with you that they were downright rude. you did no wrong and on behalf of singaporeans, i apologise.
