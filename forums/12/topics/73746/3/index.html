            <div class='col-md body'>haha that's pure singaporean-ism. Ppl just can't end off their tirades with "you queue jumper" or "you can't speak english well"<br>seems that putting a person in their social caste as an adjective is a must for them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> to some its outright racism..to me...its just downright stupid. no matter how badly the guy pronounces his words or if he jumps in for a couple of nano-seconds to grab a satchet of chilli sauce, it doesn't warrant an angry outburst.<br><br>anyway, i don't think singaporeans are racist. not on a whole anyway, most ppl would harbour a lil racist sentiments but i think that's normal as racism or discrimination of any form stems from ignorance. Not being able to understand the language, custom, tradition, it all plays a part in being racist. At least this misunderstanding has never amounted to anything serious (with the exceptions of the racial riots donkey years ago).<br><br>To come outright to say that singaporeans are racist, i disagree as its a sweeping statement that generalises the population. Yes, racism exists on our shores but not to the majority. Its something even you and lingos have agreed to. for eg the guy at the train station in Britain asking you to avoid (where??) and Lingos saying that Aussie is not a racist nation. In the end, its just a few bad apples who come out to spoil the whole batch.<br><br>I think however, plenty of singaporeans are just not friendly enough. They're rude and arrogant and really think too highly of themselves. Just look at singapore's drivers. Plenty of walking accidents i say. Tailgating you on lane 1 even though you're travelling at 100km/h already and even honkin you to get out of the way. Stupid drivers who bicker and argue over who got the lot first. Worst still, morons who come from behind and steal your lot, endangering your car and its occupants. Lets not even start on some of the bad service we get at shops, restaurants etc etc.<br><br>I believe this is where all of you have to agree with me. Can't we all be a lil more gracious? If singaporeans really wanted to put themselves on the map, they'd work on their attitudes and behaviour. No need to climb some stupid mountain or win the world cup. Just be more gracious and go greet the world with a GENUINE smile...haha cheers....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Farmer Brown:</div><div class="quote_body">I think however, plenty of singaporeans are just not friendly enough. They're rude and arrogant and really think too highly of themselves. Just look at singapore's drivers. Plenty of walking accidents i say. Tailgating you on lane 1 even though you're travelling at 100km/h already and even honkin you to get out of the way. Stupid drivers who bicker and argue over who got the lot first. Worst still, morons who come from behind and steal your lot, endangering your car and its occupants. Lets not even start on some of the bad service we get at shops, restaurants etc etc.<br></div></blockquote>since I am a frank person, I shall be frank wif my opinions with regards to what u have juz said.... u said "plenty" of singaporeans are unfriendly... How are u going to justify the word "plenty"? Are you a Singaporean by the way? Anyway, If u are, U will notice that people tailgate your car when u drive so slowly at 100km/h on lane1, because they are busy and need to rush! Tailgating is actually a nicer form of a hint that u should give way to that car behind for him to pass first. What do u think the car behind should have done? just follow behind the car patiently and just be late for work? Driving so slowly is such a waste of time.<br><br>In Singapore, efficiency matters! We are often forced by cirumstances and situations to rush, be it we like it or not. How can drivers drive at only 100km/h on lane 1?<br><br>Alrite, i agree with you that some idiots do occasionally snatch our carpark lots; but, how often does that happen? I would use the term "seldom" to describe the frequency.<br><br>Bad service at shops, restaurants, etc are inevitable. Wait till you become a shop assistant, a waiter, etc. There are bound to be circumstances or perhaps even personal problems that led to the bad service of that employee. Can't we spare a thought more for them?<br><br>It is not that PLENTY of Singaporeans lack grace and manners. The percentage of these people is not an alarming rate as yet. If you are a Singaporean, I do hope u will receive ur fellow country ppl wif an open heart and get used to the pace and speed of our country. On the other hand, if u are not a singaporean, please do not make such quick comments or impose your impressions so narrow-mindly on the majority of us.<br><br>Thank you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Towards the topic starter: I have not read if other fellow forum-ers in this thread have said this, but I feel you should not come to such a quick conclusion abt Singaporeans based on just these black sheep in our country. I agree that those people have treated you discriminately and feel so sorry for you. Nevertheless, there are still many other nice and kind souls around in Singapore that you have yet to encounter.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well on behalf of all the Singaporean whom I knew most are very racial harmonious people, was sorry for you to received the wrong reception . One thing I must bring to your attention that there are no. of permanent residents who looked like us but unfortunately not cultured like us. I have to admit there R some of us which still have some prejudice against other races but let me assure U the numbers are very small. Hv U been to singapore chatrooms? After answering yr asl , they will asked about yr race. If they learned that U R not their "kind" their mood will swing. Its really upset to know that there still prejudice among races. As far as I am concerned , regardless which ethnic groups we belong to singapore have only one race. 'SINGAPOREAN"<br>So cheer up  and welcome to singapore lifestyle.

            <div class='col-md body'>Its so dangerous labelling a whole nation as racist based on 2 bad incidences you have had.<br><br>I also think that its irresponsible to come onto a public website and say that singaporeans, australians, british people are all racist.<br><br>Its irresponsible and also dangerous because people will read your comments and form wrong impressions about a group of people they know nothing about.<br><br>I was born and raised in Sydney and i have also lived in london. I find australians to be one of the most friendliest group of people I have ever know. Australians love to laugh and joke and I think due to cultural miscommunications some jokes may seem racist but they were meant with no offence. Australians and british people also love to tease each other and comment on how fat, lazy and drunk each of them are.<br>I had no racism directed at me during my time in london and there was no general feeling of racism while living in london. It disappointing to read that people would label a whole nation as racist.<br><br>This is why i think it is so dangerous to publicy critize a country as being racist based on a few incidents. You would be surprised at the number of australian people who really hate pauline hanson and who think shes a real nutcase. Because of her, many people  think australia is a racist country and have pre-judged australians without having meet any.<br><br>You as singaporeans know that singapore is not a racist country. But an outsider who reads or hear these sorts of incidents will think that it is........<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm shocked. You are so silly! Welcome to the real world out here. Not just Singaporeans ---- about the whole wide world is racist to some extend. It just stems down to whether how racist you are. People who are alot less racist (those who knows how to show respect etc) are considered as 'non-racist' but they are still racist. Humans are racist as a general.<br><br>Ask yourself this ---- ARE YOU 101% SURE YOU DON'T DESPISE ANY RACE IN THIS WORLD? EVEN JUST BY ABIT?</div>
