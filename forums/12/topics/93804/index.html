The indirect way, but it works.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

Call her out and talk face to face.. In this situation is you that needs to know how she feels towards you and the guy.. So wat if you tell her? Is she goin to do anything about it?<br><br>ANyway you both are not into r/s. dun make the whole situation like so complicated.. if she really feels for you.. you already win half the battle liao.. then the next move.. jus have to make plans and move on in chasing her lor.. Not together yet.. got such things liao.. think so much..<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></div>
