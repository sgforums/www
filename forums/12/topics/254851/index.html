            <div class='col-md body'>So you are wondering:<br><br>- why she continues to like someone although she has no chance?<br>- why she's sometimes emo about something doesn't look like will happen?<br><br>Sounds familiar? I bet it does!<br><br>You should tell her you love her with all your heart and soul (and other corny teenage stuff) at a special occasion in front of a lot of people (like her birthday) then she can reject and hate you for embaressing her, thereby losing her best friend (assuming, of course, that you are correct in saying that you are her best friend) so she can feel even more downtrodden by this unfair and uncaring life.<br><br>Who knows, she might come here and post about it too.</div>

In familiar wavelength, it's the same with an employee mindset - earning a decent salary and already warming up a good seat in the corporate hierarchy.<br><br>Many often talk about starting their own business - who actually did?<br><br>Singaporeans often complained about the government, but ended up dropping votes for the very party they hate.<br><br>These are everyday analogies that effectively describe people who desire security much more than freedom.<br><br>And therefore asking that 'someone', who desire security, to move away from certainty and to pursue something risky is often justified with excuses like 'I think he can provide her better than I do/I got a family to feed and I can't start business/I hate the garmen, but I rather not take the risk by voting alternative party/etc.'<br><br>And the fact is that there is always a mountain taller than another. There's always someone else better than you do and someone even better than the next guy. The concept of 'providing' is but relative to our perception and mindset.<br><br>If I were to tell you that real love transforms people into strength and if you are unable feel the strength to experience metamorphosis and evolve into someone powerful, then perhaps, this love is pretty much surreal. You cannot say that this quiet affection for this lady is Love, other than plain admiration or young infatuation.<br><br>In Love, the battle is always against yourself - not people outside you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
