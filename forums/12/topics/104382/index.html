She'll think you don't care for her or something.<br><br>That's why i said 2-3 days, and not daily. Not everyone can talk so much, and talking daily can spoil the freshness of the relationship... Its like you like to eat apples, and you eat it everyday. You may get sick of it soon.<br><br>Eh, that's just what i had in mind when he said communication. So far his relationship looks normal, so i don't know what he wants to know~</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The key to communication is trust. She probably doesn't communicate well with you because of some reasons. Is it because she hasn't got over he ex-boyfriend yet? Or is it something about you that makes her unable to trust you? It's your job to find out!<br><br>Once you've discovered the reason, slowly help her to solve her problems, let her understand more about you so that she is able to open up her heart to you.<br><br>Btw, it's also important for you to assure her that there must not be secrets between the two of you. That applies to you as well! If you want her to speak her mind all the time, you must do the same as well!<br><br>Hope that helped!</div>
