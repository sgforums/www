            <div class='col-md body'>There's no point owning up. Telling her that the flowers were actually from you is not going to change anything. You have already made your stand clear to her. To her you're probably just a wuss. Pardon me for saying that, but this is what I felt.<br><br>Just forget about the whole issue whether she knows or doesn't know or whether you should let her know. She doesn't want to know anyway.<br><br>Step back and ask yourself what you really want out of this. Don't say that you're not expecting anything in return and you just want her to be happy. "Wanting her to be happy" is an expectation. And you probably thought keeping yourself by her side, helping her out, sending her presents is going to make her happy? Or are you just clinging on to some hope that one fine day she'll realise someone has been doing so much for her and start to appreciate him? Come on!<br><br>If you really like her, go and tell her. And accept whatever that outcome is because whatever it may be, it'll be the best for the both of you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
