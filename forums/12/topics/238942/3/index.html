You did yourself no favour there(you aren't getting remotely closer to winning her over; neither are you doing your wallet any favours), mind!<br><br>Seriously, as some have already suggested, just make up your mind on what you plan to do and stick to your guns. If you wish to move on, then just move on (stop doing things like sending her 99 roses - that can be left to some guy she fancies, not you). Otherwise, if you wish to give this another shot, at least do your darndest to make sure you don't shoot yourself in the foot (it's nonsensical to think any guy would go through the trouble of getting someone 99 roses, yet not have the courage to admit the roses were from him). Last but not least, enjoy whatever you wish to do - it will still be a priceless experience either way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
