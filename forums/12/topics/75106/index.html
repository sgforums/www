            <div class='col-md body'>My father keeps saying that if he dies one day, never let my uncle and his family move into our house. Not that my uncle needs a house to stay or something. My uncle is a really capacble man but I am afraid because recently he ran into a lot of problems, both cash flow problems and love problems. I am afraid I would not know what to do if such a day really comes. " Choy! " If I don't let him move in I would be letting my mother, grandmother and my uncle down since my uncle is my mother's brother and he treats me very well. When I was young, he really dotes on me. If I let him move in I would be letting my father down, although its really unreasonable for my father to request this because my mother is paying for this house and he doesn't have any good reasons for my uncle not to move in. In my opinion, I agree with my father too not to let my uncle and his family move in because it would hamper my usual life and the house is not really very big either. I hope such a day never comes, what do you think I should do if such a day really comes?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

All the elders are dead except for my mother's mother who of course will help his son. Well, if I know that elder brother of my father, he'll support my father. And if I know him, I don't want him in this problem. You see my father's side ain't exactly helpful advisors. They are all the same like my father get drunk and scold people except for a few exceptions. I doubt my uncle needs to move in anyway, I am just....you know.</div>
