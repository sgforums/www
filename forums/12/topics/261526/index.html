Obviously you are insecure; not just because he is a competitor, but also, his positioning is probably perceived as 'better brand' than yours.<br><br>Seriously, don't fret over things that are beyond your control, namely external factors. Gather your resources and focus on what you could manipulate - which is yourself.<br><br>If you kept segmenting yourself as the bottom tier system of our screwed education system - ITE as It's The End - you will probably live in that brand for the rest of your life. Then when you get jealous due to insecurity, you are likely to tighten your grip on your love and over the time, this will hurt your relationship.<br><br>You might think that you are not good enough, but actually it's because you do not understand yourself well enough to play your cards strategically.<br><br>The ball is in your court - only you can make her see if she has made a right choice by sticking with you. And as long as it becomes a reality... as long as you gradually improve your 'brand' and become more 'marketable' - your positioning will improve. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Not an issue.<br>You are going in the right direction by showing the willingness to upgrade yourself.<br><br>The thing about that pesky friend.<br>You are the man, not a wuss.<br>You need to protect your girl.<br>First, ask your girlfriend for permission to pick up the call for her, speak to the guy yourself. Tell the guy you are her boyfriend, politely tell him not to call anymore.<br>NOTE: Do not do this without her permission. Do not act hostile when you talk to the guy.
