Say instead of resting and relaxing, he had to work for his family, which is physically and mentally tiring.<br><br>Maybe, you want a third party (like the SAF cousellors) to help intervene, WITHOUT YOU.<br><br>Tell your boyfriend he must speak to his parents that BMT is sh!t. Working more with little pay returns is even more worse. Tell your boyfriend he cannot cope.<br><br>What's the point of earning little money when it makes you more tired for your BMT training and it drains you mentally?

Though moonlighting is not encouraged.<br><br>Think lidat he can choose to plan and schedule his time more freely. Instead of binding to his family business, which is not time well spent I can see.<br><br>Its like working as slave for army then go work for as servant for your family.</div>
