God has given us a set of rules on life. you break them, you're not under God's protection, cuz we walk out of His protection. commiting murder is one. abortion does kill the baby, thus when the mother walks out of God's protection, she is vulnerable to demons which attacks thru spirit(she may see things), soul(unstable emotions,sucidal thoughts) and body(falls ill more often, weak) the only reason why i prefer to share on a personal level cuz this is a sensitive subject.  of cuz what i am saying refers to christians aborting babies.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
