            <div class='col-md body'>No relationship is perfect.  No matter how much you love each other, there will always be disagreement since we are different individual and especially when females and males don't behave the same ways.<br><br>However, if you have doubt about it, especially with his anger problem, you should seriously reconsider about the whole relationship.  Anger is like a disease and it doesn't go away and only gets worse unless it's properly dealt with.<br><br>A good relationship involves lots of respects for each other.  So look after yourself and do not allow yourself get stuck in an abusive relationship.  You deserve someone better.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Depends on wat u define quarrel.. me n my gf (wife now) have been together for 4+ years, we have never quarreled in that we never once raised our voices or shouted at each other.<br><br>Sometimes we talk n get abit upset, but we never once really got mad at each other and usually everything returns to normal in a few hours or so. In that sense it is wrong to say that quarreling is an unavoidable part of a relationship; disagreement and a bit of friction is unavoidable, but how u choose to handle it is purely a matter of choice.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
