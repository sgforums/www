If so, calling for a 'family meeting' once in a while as suggested by Bear could be something which might help in the situation....<br><br>At this point, it's important to have a good financial distribution plan and STICK to it as suggested by AshGoh....<br><br>For yourself, try to make your life meaningful... It doesn't mean you'll have to go spend alot of money and enjoy yourself... Just do the things you enjoy doing and pamper yourself once in a while.... Since you're now an IMPORTANT figure in the family, it's equally important that you don't let yourself fall... And a life without meaning can easily makes a person drift apart under pressure...<br><br>If your family still doesn't see the 'tightness' and RISK they're taking by being too spendthrift and stuffs like that... You can alway exercise 'false alarms' by cutting their budget within a certain size and explain to them that it's due to unforeseen circumstances... In doing that, you can save a sum aside just in case a real emergency turns up and also to let them realise it's not such an 'all fine weather sky' out there.....<br><br>Regards....</div>
