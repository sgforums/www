            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, came across this forum by chance and find that it is really a very neat and nice one. Wondered if you all can help me with this problem of mine<br><br>I am in my mid twenties this year and actually I broke off with my boyfriend like 6 months back. All this while I still have feelings for him but he just keep avoiding me.<br><br>Now the problem is as follows, I came to know another guy just a few months back and we have like gone out for the past few weeks, he seems to be a very nice guy and we seems to click off quite well, the same frequency and such<br><br>BUT<br><br>he mentioned that he is someone who is does not want a relationship that holds back the feelings, when I asked him what does he mean by that he meant that he is more of a physical kind of person<br><br>I think I belong to the more conservative side of person so its like he thinks that I am moving too slow while I think that he is moving too fast, initially we said if that is the case, it would be better to remain as friends but then somehow now it becomes a case of 'go with the flow'<br><br>So now what should I do? Because it seems to be like its not really a relationship as yet but he wants to have feelings and behaviour like what a couple should do like hugs and kisses etc, I must admit it is not really what I would normally do unless I am deeper into the relationship, and yes, I do have a mutual attraction to him as well.. so any adviceon this matter?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>we are in 2006 now...<br><br>there are really very few of you left in singapore, where no kisses or hugs are allowed in a r/s...i must say, to a guy, without such, there is no feeling to be in a r/s..<br><br>some honey words/advices like, "if he really loves you, he should accept who you are"...but i must advice you, that is really a good fairy tale...<br>true, that you have to accept a person for who he/she is, but certain things, are hard to compromise...<br><br>in this case, not even a peck on the cheeks? Hmn..i think you and him have to sit down and talk about it, and probably, it is hard for a guy to accept it..<br>to get you as a gf, they will say yes to anything..after going out with you, they will start to persuade you...<br><br>conservatives gp like you are rare, and to find a guy who really appreciates and accept you, is endangered..good luck..have a good talk to him and tell him how both of you feel...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think his so call physical love is hinting you when both of u go in r/s. He wants to have sex with you! Are you still a virgin? If so remain that way! I admit physical contact(Kissing and hugging) can increase a couple bond but is not the critical ingredient for a true r/s to survive. If he really love u,he will not force you! Always remember that b y hard...</div>
