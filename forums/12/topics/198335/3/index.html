If he really likes you, he should be able to like you for who you are, be it conservative or not. Just make sure you let him be aware of your concerns.<br><br>If a relationship is to survive where one cannot be themselves anymore, then this relationship is definitely doomed to fail. Anyone can change for the better of another one, but the changes will only and always be TEMPORARILY...unless either one of you are great actor/actress. It's because you've been like this all your lives, and you can hope but cannot expect yourself to change permanently for one another. And this is the most common silly mistakes made by alot of couples around the world.<br><br>To effectively change, you need to compromise-&gt;tolerate-&gt;reason. Do you want to compromise? Can you tolerate? Is the reason great enough for you to instill the change? As far as I see, I don't see the need for you to give in to his demands in this relationship. My reason? It's because you are obviously uncomfortable with his request. So do not allow yourself to feel uncomfortable in any relationship else it's isn't a relationship anymore, it's a trap.<br><br>Have a talk with him and make your stand and hold it firmly. If he cannot accept it, then perhaps he should be going after the slut-next-door instead of you. Nothing to lose if that's the case, cos you're just too good for him if he's unable to accept your concerns and had to make you feel uncomfortable.<br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
