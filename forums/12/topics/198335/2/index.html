Wondered if you all can help me with this problem of mine<br><br>I am in my mid twenties this year and actually I broke off with my boyfriend like 6 months back. All this while I still have feelings for him but he just keep avoiding me.<br><br>Now the problem is as follows, I came to know another guy just a few months back and we have like gone out for the past few weeks, he seems to be a very nice guy and we seems to click off quite well, the same frequency and such<br><br>BUT<br><br>he mentioned that he is someone who is does not want a relationship that holds back the feelings, when I asked him what does he mean by that he meant that he is more of a physical kind of person<br><br>I think I belong to the more conservative side of person so its like he thinks that I am moving too slow while I think that he is moving too fast, initially we said if that is the case, it would be better to remain as friends but then somehow now it becomes a case of 'go with the flow'<br><br>So now what should I do? Because it seems to be like its not really a relationship as yet but he wants to have feelings and behaviour like what a couple should do like hugs and kisses etc, I must admit it is not really what I would normally do unless I am deeper into the relationship, and yes, I do have a mutual attraction to him as well.. so any adviceon this matter?</div></blockquote>He has to respect your wishes and my advice to you is to believe in what you do and not just succumb to his wants just because you like him.<br><br>Talk to him about how you feel. Obviously it's about two people have two different wishes. If you two cannot come to compromise, then I suggest you leave him, it will only lead to nowhere.</div>
