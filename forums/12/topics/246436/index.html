Life is more than just sleeping, eating, playing, working, etc.  Apart from just thinking about how you can make yourself happy, you can also think about how you can make a difference in people's lives.  Learn to always look for opportunity to reach out to others who are in need of help and be a blessing to others.  The smile you get in the end from these people whom you've helped and blessed is simply priceless.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
