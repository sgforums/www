            <div class='col-md body'>Hi people,<br>i have this problem. Theres this guy in my school, call him C. We knew each other for around 2 years. After a group date, he smsed me and we then started to sms alot. He likes a girl S, but he smses me stuff like darling, i love you, etc.<br><br>The smses then stopped, i didn't pursue it as i heard he was after a girl - G. I saw them on a group date once. I felt a little sad, but took it off my mind.<br><br>I forgot about it as time went by, even had a budding relationship with a guy - W. When i thought i was really interested in W, C contacted me again. At first i was snubbing him, but after more smses, i started to feel like i'm in love with him. I hardly talked to W anymore. C now progressed to having phone calls with me, he kept calling me sweet names and a lot of sweet talk. And yes, i'm falling for it, i can't control it. Sometimes i really hate myself for being so weak. At school, C doesnt talk to me at all. He doesn't even glance at me when i walk past, kind of hurt.<br><br>Approached him about it today, and he began to stutter things like "You know i'm always with my friends, so i won't talk to you, you know lah, they will say alot of things." But i mean, a hi is definately alright isn't it? Not as if i don't know his friends. They're mine too!<br><br>I think hes embarrassed about me probably, since i'm not that great looking and i'm in the normal stream and him, the top class. Why does he have to treat me so good in smses and calls when he doesnt even mutter a hi in reality? But i've really fallen for him. I can't live without his sweet words everyday. I tried to forget, but to no avail. Anyone please enlighten me, thanks in advance. Sigh..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

No, right! i dun consider this as love.. it maybe jus some affections..<br><br>be brave and have more faith in yourself.. you are good.. so wat you are in nirmal stream.. so wat you have ordinary looks.. you dun disgrace yourself like he do.. he lied.. he toyed.. what else??

Look, he even stutter when he talks. This shows very much about the real him - the sweet talks and sms are nothing but airy words. Nothing concrete nor substantial.<br><br>You are likely to be quite young and a little of such male's attention and words seemed sufficient to sweep you over? Do not fall blindly for such thingy if you wished to survive better in the game of love.<br><br>P.S: Usually only time and experience can make you see that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers </div></blockquote>I believe what you mentioned about the daily doze of virtual love, empowering his ego is definately very true. I feel it just adds up to his feeling that hes charming.<br><br>Yes, in reality, he doesnt give me a glance, for all i know. Hes probably using me in sms to hypnotise himself to believe i'm someone else.<br><br>Age wise, i must admit, i'm still rather young. 16 that is. Maybe all this is a test for my future r/ships. But i still think its really mean to do such a thing hes doing. Just can't understand it.<br><br>Ignorance is bliss sometimes, what i can do is just ignore it probably. Last but not least, thanks very much. Deeply appreciated. All these advices have made me reflect on everything. Thanks!</div>
