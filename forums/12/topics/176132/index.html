I can understand the need for companionship and so on... after all, we humans are supposed to be social creature. However, you shouldn't be attached for the sake of being attached. If you believe that being attached puts you in the 'in' crowd, then I'd say you're doing it for all the wrong reasons.<br><br>A boyfriend is not a Tamagotchi for your own amusement.<br><br>Anyway, you're already 21, and I'm sure you ought to be mature enough to realise all this. Be patient and get to know more people... I'm sure sooner or later you'll find the right man for yourself. I know it can be frustrating at times... I myself have sometimes wondered whether I'm fated to remain single all my life.<br><br>But I realise that somewhere out there, there's a special someone who doesn't mind being called Mrs Fudgester. I just haven't found her yet.<br><br>Likewise, there is a Mr Idunnohow out there as well. You'll find him someday.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It can be quite sian if you are pressurized into getting attached.<br><br>But, my advice is to start to know yourself more and learn from your friend and book what is a realtionship is about.<br><br>Then, you will be able to better manage your relationship when it is there.<br><br>Being attached requires a lot of time and management if you want it to last long.<br><br>So, it is not really that fairy tale thing about being attached.<br><br>There will be a lot issues that you may not foresee.<br><br>Therefore, prepare yourself first and the guys will come soon.<br></div>
