            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Idunnohow,<br><br>Seriously, you should stop worrying abt whether you are having a problem. I guess its social or peer pressure that you start to think that you have a problem.<br><br>Seriously, at the age of 21, without a bf isn't anything big deal. If you have a bf and he turns out to be a bad guy, he can do you more harm than good. So, let time and fate take over.<br><br>When I was your age, I din have a bf. I seriously dun think i had a problem then. And now, I still dun have a bf even both my elder and younger sisters are married. So, why should you be worried? Unless you are thinking of having a bf and that no one came along and swept you off your feet. So, not to worry and enjoy your singlehood now. Who knows? Maybe when that time comes, you want singlehood more than anything else!<br><br>Cheers!</div>

You're only 21. It's perfectly alright I think. I'm 24 and only had a gf that lasted 3 years. I have students that had 4~5 relationships and they are still under 16! I sometimes think that's I'm so useless too: I belong to the average, can talk, "fun to be with" and have a lot of friends type also. But only had 1, and she ditched me some more one loh... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>It's not the quantity that matters. It's the quality. And you should't give yourself too much stress or give in to peer pressure. No use trying to get a guy, put your heart and soul into it, and break up just 1~2 weeks right? And I think you're still a bit young for your parents to worry about. Or maybe you can get a guy friend to act like an irresponsible+irritating pig bf that you truely love infront of your parents. Maybe they would rather you be single for the time being.<br><br>That said, you shouldn't worry much. Leave everything to fate. You must have more confidence about yourself! Confident women look pretty by itself! And don't be so pessimistic, yeah? You're still too young to worry. Wait til you are 31 then you can start complaining bah...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Have a mind of ur own, u don't haf to follow suit what others r doing with their lives. If u think 1 looks better as "i'm taken" than "nobody wants".. u r wrong. If pple kpo keep asking Y still no bf? U can tell them u'r still young.. enjoy dating / courtship 1st coz selection too wide liao.
