              <p>Err....</p>
              <p>Wow......until late this year or next year ?</p>
              <p>That is way too long.....</p>
              <p>And youve been married for 6 months....that means......already 6 months till now.....</p>
              <p>It's too long.....</p>
              <p>This will create ever-increasing pressure and unhappiness for your wife.</p>
              <p>She is already unhappy and pressurized to such an extent that she tries to avoid having dinner together with the in-laws, and avoid going to living room to watch TV.</p>
              <p>If you are her....if you live in this condition, day by day, everyday, how would you feel ?</p>
              <p>If you are in this kind of mental state, dont you think you will have bad mood too ?</p>
              <p>And this will cause problems and arguments from time to time ?</p>
              <p>This may also be the reason she is reluctant to sweep the floor and do other household chores. It is because of lack of sense of ownership. She feels that it is your house or your parents' house.</p>
              <p>If something is hers or belong to her, with more sense of ownership she would be more compelled to take good care and maintain it.</p>
              <p>Other reason may be because she feels uncomfortable sweeping floor in front of your parents.</p>
              <p>etc etc.</p>
              <p>My suggestion........why not try to find a cheap place to rent outside....just a small place, quite cheap......financially will be no issue......this will create a major relief for her.....</p>
              <p>Please try to pay more attention to this one and not think that it is just a technical matter or something that is already settled.</p>
              <p>If she is living everyday in pressure and unhappiness, this is a major mood dampener and it will affect everything else.</p>
              <p>By the way, when someone says she wants to separate or divorce you because she is not good enough.......you know what this is.........this is a cry for help......she is also burdened and tired.......and "im not good enough for you" is just a sort of euphimism or indirect polite way to complain about YOU actually.......</p>
              <p>I hope you understand about this..........</p>

              <p>Iwannabehappy,</p>
              <p>I wouldn't be happy if I am your wife either. You may think you are a great husband, but you're not.. you are dense and have no clue why your wife is unhappy.</p>
              <p>First you expect her to help you clean your parents house ? Why? She married you to become your parents maid or your wife?</p>
              <p>You rather spend money on music lessons and socialising with your friends instead of renting a nest outside where both of you can enjoy bliss in privacy ? She probably can't even enjoy sex with you because your parents are sleeping in the next bedroom.</p>
              <p>You are comfortable with your parents because you've lived your life with them.. you are probably immune to your family's little quirks..and ethics which are alien to her...because She grew up in another family.. differences will be crystal clear in her eyes...</p>
              <p>She wants to get out of your parents house because she wants privacy.. you want to keep staying on in your parents house because you enjoy the comfort and conveniences...conflict.. something's gotta give...</p>
              <p>Stop trying to squeeze blood from a turnip. Stop thinking she can simply blend in with your family because she married you. She is not your family blood.. and she'll never be.</p>
              <p>She wants to spend time with you, yet you are more interested in doing something else without her ? She got into a LONELY marriage....why did she even bother marrying you in the first place ?? Love ? really ? 6 months and you are dying to go do stuff on your own? Honeymoon over so soon ???? You totally short changed her, yet you wonder y she's not happy.....</p>
              <p>Save the "all by myself" activities for later, after the marriage hit the 20 year mark... When your wife is so sick of seeing your face every morning when she wakes up.....she'll be sending you off faster than you can say "bye honey".</p>
              <p>You argue with her because she is not willing to live by your expectations.. ofcors she feels un-valued. Ofcors she thinks she is not good enough for you. Because she feels she cannot be herself and satisfy your expectations at the same time.</p>
              <p>If she wants a divorce, she won't need your permission to proceed. Crying divorce is an "Ultimatum".. she is at the end of her road. If you don't want to wake up and work it out.. she can't go on...</p>
              <p>Obviously, you've been a stubborn person, and she's been stone-walled too many times.</p>
              <p>Open the communication channels and LISTEN.</p>
              <p>Maybe YOU are not ready for marriage.</p>

              <p>She knows all this lei. We argue about it all the time. So she knows what Iâm gg thru. After each time she will feel guilty and promise to do more. Sheâs very low self esteem, always saying that shes not good enough for me. Actually shes the one that always bring up divorce, but I really donât want to resort to that. She also says it in the spur of the moment. <span style="color: #ff0000;">After the argument we will be loveydovey again</span>. I dont feel our problems are very big if shes at least willing to try. But after so many months of arguing about the same thing over and over, Iâm starting to feel very tired.</p>

              <p>This is what I was waiting to see you post. I have come across many females like this. Lose temper, angry, scold people, then afterwards everything normal.</p>
              <p>ThisÂ kind cannot be cured. You just live with it.</p>
              <p>Do not take her criticisms, scolding, anger to heart. Just ignore them. Be selective, take good times and enjoy and remember them.</p>
              <p>Always treat her nice, and try not to provoke her. Therefore know what she don't like. And when she is upset, talk to her condescendingly.</p>
              <p>You love her, she love you, and both of you made the decision to get married. So you got to live with it.</p>
              <p>But you must also have some spine lah. Its her nature to bully you, because she can. She would respect more if you be more assertive. But be diplomatic about it. She will throwÂ  tantrums, to win, but you also must win some times.Â </p>
              <p>Thats the way its gonna be, hot and cold and sometimes good.</p>
              <p>In the long run, you will look back with love.</p>

              <p>Kind of like too much male posting here could ultimately shift the whole blame on we, the female, please hor, if TS cannot control and discipline his wife, that aint nobody business, and if sg female is incurable due to the system that brought them up, Please hor, that include your mothers, sisters, nieices and grandmas.</p>
              <p>But having said all, sg gal are too pampered, unlike we, the Alisan gals of taiwan, serve our husband very well, work all chores in the house and bring up good childrens, because we believe that once our husband is satisfy, he will work in peace and harmony which in turn bring more money and better career. This is how we are taught from our grandmas, not everyday scold or beat the husband or make problem for him, end up he go works also no mood and become a poor performer, which then end up in my pubs drinking to pass time.</p>

              <p>I'd say communicate your feelings to her first. We are only hearing your side of the story, so it's not possible to tell if she is acting in such a manner because of issues on your part. Not accusing you of anything, but that is often the case.</p>

              <p>I'll post the honest experiences of an imperfect wife:</p>
              <p>I don't like to do housework and I'm not good at it. However, initially i didn't
              mind doing it. But my hubby had exacting ISO standards and I got tired of
              getting criticised over how clothes are not hung properly (armpits lined to
              pole), or forgetting to keep the washing machine 3rd round water for recycling,
              or drying the sink after washing dishes etc. It just got very tiresome being
              criticised after you put in the effort to do it. Eventually this became my
              excuse for notÂ  doing it, though I felt guilty lah deep down when I see
              him quietly do everything for me.</p>
              <p>Eventually we had a long talk. I asked him if he could be less critical and
              at least show appreciation for my efforts? He finally understood it wasn't that
              I don't WANT to do the housework but I don't know HOW to do it well. But I am
              willing to learn if he supports me. Instead of merely agreeing that I
              'improve', I decided perhaps we needed something concrete and measurable on HOW
              I can improve.</p>
              <p>We picked out 5 specific tasks that I should do weekly, and I focus on that
              instead of the assumption that I know exactly what needs to be done. Over time,
              because I had only the 5 tasks to focus on at first, I could improve on the
              quality and develop my own system of getting things done. It became much less
              effort for me and a pleasure to greet him from work with something well done.
              He also makes a point of noticing and encouraging me whenever I have done
              something well instead of taking it for granted.</p>
              <p>I really appreciate my hubby's patience through this time. He put up 
              with an
              imperfect wife, and instead of just judging me on the surface like most 
              other
              people "useless pampered princess!! Cannot do housework!", he
              understood that my intentions were good just that my abilities were not 
              there
              yet. He was willing to be supportive to help me learn, instead of just 
              being
              critical for what I cannot do well. Isn't that what relationships are 
              about?Afterall, how many of us get to marry a perfect person? But both 
              will be lucky if we marry someone who can help us to become a better 
              person.</p>
              <p>However, having said all these: I think your problems with your wife lies a
              lot deeper than just housework. It seems that she is very insecure and
              reluctant to communicate through problems. You might both wish to go for
              marital counselling to sort out the communication issues without which it is
              very difficult for the other problems to be resolved.</p>

              both will be lucky if we marry someone who can help us to become a
              better person.</p>
              <p>However, having said all these: I think your problems with your
              wife lies a lot deeper than just housework. It seems that she is
              very insecure and reluctant to communicate through problems. You
              might both wish to go for marital counselling to sort out the
              communication issues without which it is very difficult for the
              other problems to be resolved.</p>

              <p>SC the thing is that there are really women who refuse to do housework and it's not because of the lack of trying and totally different from your husband's high expectations.Â </p>
              <p>And there are women who are really extremely difficult as well. Seen a number of those myself and as a woman, I feel like slapping themselves myself sometimesÂ <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Anyway, TS has enough different views to come to a conclusion.Â </p>

              <p>You can see how people conduct themselves in different situations.</p>
              <p>Simple situation, how people talk to their immediate families, and how they talk to strangers.</p>
              <p>e.g. Your brother spill some gravy on to your dress, and an overseas friend spill some gravy on to your dress, how would your reactionÂ be?</p>
              <p>People just need to be reminded they need to consider the feelings of their immediate families, just as much as they are considerate to outsiders.</p>
              <p>Verbal abuses between spouses sometimes are just overboard. BTW both sexes can beÂ equally abusive.</p>
