Work as in perhaps stress. Main concern should be MENTALITY...<br><br>I don't think it's because he don't love you anymore? I think he still does, try to help by not stressing him too much... He may be man of quite alot of words at the right time but there're just some things he wish to just keep to himself and burden himself with. There might a 'side' to the story but just wild guesses, so not worth mentioning for now.... IMPORTANT thing now is to just give him all the LOVE and SUPPORT despite how he reacts but don't stress him... I've got my REASON for suggesting this... Don't care whether it's fair or not, ultimately it'll be for EVERYBODY's GOOD and it certainly is a well paid off idea...<br><br>His FOCUS should be MAINLY now on how to SUPPORT this family... To give BOTH you and the CHILDREN a comfortable life... TIME is BAD nowadays you know...? Given the fact that he's the SOLE BREAD provider certainly doesn't help much... Stress at work could easily cause him much pressure... That's why his so much concern on the children... Both you and him are ADULTS, they're just kids... If hardship is to hit, they'll be the 1st to suffer... Maybe he's partially hoping that you could 'understand' his position (with a bit of luck...?)... Yet not wanting you to think and worry too much...? He probably just wants you to concentrate on the CHILDREN... Which is probably his PROUD of this relationship he has with you....<br><br>Hope I've helped in a way? Try to contact up with SkinnyBeanie... Don't ASSUME that things are exactly the same for the 2 of you...
