From what you stated, she looks like she is not in love with you anymore. Which girlfriend who is in love with her boyfriend would totally ignore his boyfriend and spend her birthday with her friends?<br><br>I suggest that you take a step back, do not be anxious. Give the girl some space. She will appreciate it.<br><br>I know that you are suspicious about what's she doing behind your back but i recommend you not to tell her about it. It is because it'll make you look insecure and that it might start a quarrel again.<br><br>You should be more of a challenge and also try to be creative. Make sure she laughs and not quarrel with you the next time you meet her. Your ought to make her enjoy her time with you. If she try to steer you into serious topics or give you 'tests', you could just avoid them by giving a funny answer. For eg, she say, "Do you love me?". You could reply, "I love you, as a little sister" or "What? You want to hear me to say I love you is it?" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Anyway, just don't think too much. Relax a little.

Only young love avoids, escape and vanish without trace. (Has absolutely NOTHING to do with chronological age - it is the degree of enlightenment one has regarding love.) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> This is simply ridiculous - 2 months of zero contact is as good as the legendary tootpid 'silent' break. FYI, night SMS can't maintain a relationship at all (its simply a minor tool to keep a relationship sweet and contented). My take is that she wants to back out from the relationship, yet she doesn't know how to bring it up to you, therefore she avoids, until one fine day you bth, then break out the news to her, saying that you are leaving this relationship for good. One thing: she doesn't have to face the music of saying it to you and having to bear the name of 'bad person.'<br><br>Advice? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Date her out and speak to her directly face to face. Useless to sms, write letter, emails, etc. The real message and idea can only be gotten straight from 1st hand information - real life communication. Watch her body language, her tone, her feelings, her way of speaking &amp; her thinking. Everything has a story - you piece them together, you get the whole tale. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Its useless dragging this man. Have a final showdown and speak to her. Even if you were sentence to death, there must be a reason - seek that reason, at least you die clearly and fully aware of what's going on. There must not be mask - everything has to be honest truth. Any 'effort' on trying to hide something suggest that your relationship is descending to destruction and would probably die soon after. 8th law of love - lying destroy intimacy; which is exactly what it is doing to your relationship. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

As a bf, if you are unable to make your gf feel comfortable to speak about issues relating to your relationship (please note only relating to your relationship and affecting it, nothing to do with past and other irrelevant subjects) - its kinda sad and failure on your part. (in most cases, both parts) Yes, not everything must be told. (Past for example), but issues that is <strong>currently affecting the relationship </strong>must be discussed and solved or at least even if it were to end, it will be a conclusion laid down by TWO parties.<br><br>She won't tell you a thing? So you are going to leave it as it is? Attempt countless times and ASK TO MEET HER. Prepare a speech and seek to understand why your relationship is falling apart.<br><br>Of course if you are simply lazy, dump the relationship then. In this case, you save your effort, don't need to know the reason why and probably achieve what she wanna achieve. But if I was you, I will do exactly what I said above. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Is she a Cancer?<br><br>Cheers</div>
