              I think the TS may have a geniune case here... Just because you all never had a relative such as his uncle doesn't mean there isn't 1 such person around.
              
              My advice to the TS... At this stage, you need to adobt the Godly attitude already, forgive and forget. Forgive your enemies. As for your life, just because it's in bad shape now doesn't mean it's in bad shape forever. Why would you say you have no future when the Macdonalds founder was a poor salesman all the way until 50+ years old, and from there on he actually started building his empire... You haven't 50 years old you already give up, then you cannot expect others to have faith in you... To have others believe in yourself, first and foremost, you must believe in yourself. 
              
              From my experience, no point in zi bao zi chi (self defeating attitude), you must embrace the "no matter how tough life is, i am tougher than it, i will survive and become successful" type of attitude. and you need to let go of this burden about your enemy (aka ur uncle). hatred is a toxic emotion, do not let it become your master... forgive your enemies is the best thing you can do...

              <p>storywolf, when you come out to the REAL world, you will get to know and see a lot of people with mental illness.</p>
              <p>Then only do you judge. And no, none of them deserved to be bullied or ill-treated by people who think themselves are "normal".</p>
              <p>When you ever see one with mental illness, learn to show sympathy and support instead of dunking them in the toilet.</p>
              <p>OK ? Good.</p>
