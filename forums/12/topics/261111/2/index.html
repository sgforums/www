There are some, but rare number of cases where a r/s can last very long till they get married. It is very important to add lots of sparks continuously in r/s to sustain and keep it burning...<br><br>i wish you all the best for your next r/s. I understand how u feel, to break from a 8year old r/s but not completely though. My longest was only half of yours, and then, i was already quite upset.<br><br>cheer up dude! *pat pat*<br></div>

Give it up completely for the sake of his own feelings also. In that way the man can move on without emotionally being tie down. Clean break so he can open his heart to someone else who is more worthy of his feelings and attention.</div>
