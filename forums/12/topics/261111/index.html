The lady has spoken. Me thinks when a woman says that to her boyfriend, she's trying to let him down easy. Leave her alone for a while, if she comes back, she comes. If she doesn't, then so be it. Must've been difficult letting 8 years worth of emotional bonds go.<br><br>Females never/refuse to leave when they feel positively engaged in a relationship. Maybe something happened along the way? I had the misfortune of being sympathetic towards a friend when his relationship of 7 years ended. A year later when he was still moaning about it, he revealed she left because he cheated on her. Such is life.<br><br>However you choose to act, just remember that it's almost never worth it if all you want is for her to come back while you try recapturing the past. More than anything the present is already impossible, always already gone as soon as we begin to look for it. Take it easy. When necessary, just switch off the lights, shut the windows and let it out when no one's looking.<br><br>Take care.<br><br></div>
