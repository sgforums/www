            <div class='col-md body'>True!  i definitely agree with everybody, saying that MAN jus want to be the best b4 marriage.<br><br>No money no honey<br><br>Women always requested alot of things from man. Furniture, Housing, Shopping goods, gifts, surprises and etc. You named it, women always have a plan of wat to buy and where to stay after marriage. (maybe some of you dun agree with me)<br><br>These things comes with a price and of course $$. This creates an impression on the man, to work hard and earn more to satisfied women's need.<br><br>therefore a Heart to heart talk is very important. i always tell my gf. If want all those, i can achieve it for you. But the price is, i might not have time for her you and we agreed into marriage in 3 - 4 years time. Let her be mentally prepared for what coming ahead. She will anticipate it and be by your side to suport you<br><br>these are my 2 cents worth of advice<br><br></div>

If he tells you that its not possible in the next few years, you need to ask yourself if that is okay with you.<br>Maybe you could also ask him when if at all is marriage in his plans, so that you can decide for yourself if this is something you want to stay in.<br>all the best <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am sharing my own personal experience here.  I think I am willing to do that because anonymity is guaranteed here.<br><br>My wife and I hanged around for almost 10yrs before we finally married each other.  It was primarily my very decision.

Like the saying goes "enough for one's need, not for once greed".

My last relationship ended 3 years back. She is as you would also say, "stick around forever at all cost" type. However, she did hinted to me of setting down but deep down I feel she is not the one. Back then, we were around 26. I let her make the decision to break off and right now, she is happily married with a kid.<br><br>I understand that there is no right or wrong when it comes to relationships and also affairs of the heart are difficult to fathom. Maybe due to my busy schedule of work, studies and pursuing my interest, I do not have the space to accommodate another person into my life. But when I know that time or fate comes, I will get the right gal and settle down.<br><br>Other than that, I will not make that gal exclusively mine. Even in marriage, do you think that the guy/gal is exclusively yours? In terms of the physical being or the emotional aspect?<br><br>As a guy, its always good to have someone around (wife,gf/mistress) when ones need companionship. But do spare a thought the gal, esp when you know that it is not the ending that you wanted or would have hoped for.<br>I cannot fault you cos in the end you have married her.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, it's all nice and good the stuff u posted canny. But there's so many issues to dwell upon. I am not you, you are not me. There are certain things in my life that you won't be able to comprehend. Neither will i be able to comprehend yours. That doesn't make either of us bad, naive or silly<br><br>A marriage in my definition is different from yours. When couples are dating, we share stories and dreams. We talk about the marriage she always wanted the ambience of the church, the nice honeymoon getaway, etc. These are things that i want to give to her. (The reason are deep and they shall remain private)<br><br>Beyond that, we need to pursue our dreams. She's chasing hers, i am chasing mine. We're miles apart due to our differing goals, but the love is still strong. Every relationship has it's own idiosyncracies, so you can't expect me to adopt yours.<br><br>With that being said, it's good that you're happily married. And you have nothing but my sincere well-wishes  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well guys... it' truly great to hear the differing views from all of you... while i can comprehend with ben's point of view from a guy who wants absolutely only the best for his gal... perhaps if only my guy can understand from my point of view too... tat a marriage need not b one event tat 'stops a nation'... as in requires lotsa $$$ to put together... i tink wat a gal needs is juz a simple promise from her bf... the lifelong commitment to love her and care for her...<br><br>i tink im juz like a love-struck gal... waiting patiently for the day to come when her guy proposes to her -- the ultimate exchange of a love promise... if u ask me again... i wld say -- yah, i will stick ard cos i love him..  hopefully my guy is one who eventually marries me for love... not out of 'feelings of indebtedness' cos i was ther beside him for the past years... i do hope tat if he ever look me in the eyes.. the only thot is "i love tis gal, and i wanna be wif her forever'...<br><br>anyway, can't really thank you all enough for hearing me out... and providing precious insights to a guy's world... really helpful... had a chat wif my guy and yes, he understands... but guess the time will soon come... to make all wishes come true...</div>

But I start to ask myself,how long will I achieve these and is all these things my darling want?<br><br>Acutally starting a family is not as hard as u all think and don't require a lot of money and is not as complicated as u guy think.
