If you have already break off with your ex-gf, you should treasure your current gf. If you really can't forget her and feel that you can't accept your current gf, you should tell her fast if not it will hurt her more in the end. The problem is that you are not decisive enough, so please make up your mind. Good luck.<br><br>rgds<br>vksg</div>

(Btw: I have a good friend cum disciple nickname |ost too, which brew this affinity in me and the urge to reply you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> )<br><br>Break off with ex that lasted for 6 months and went with another girl you know barely 1 month? Seriously speaking, even though you don't wish to hear, I will say: I have never encounter a relation that lasted after a recent break and a sudden union with another girl/guy. Know why? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>2 Reasons:<br><br>I) Your mind and soul longs for the positive aspects of love. You feel the desire to be loved and love in return. To feeling of someone being there for you, the comfortability in dependancy, etc - and most importantly: the fear of walking alone, venturing life into the bleak future. (You said you feeling really great thinking wow! tis gal really loves me alot, etc)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>II) Subconsciously, you are sourcing your ex in *HER* (your present gf). You are looking for qualities that you find in her and sadly, certain elements ain't there (You said some actions, etc pissed you off) and you long for your ex emotionally. You know what is happening? There are some points about your present gf that your ex doesn't have in the past and you wished that she is 'like that'. You found it, but the other variables ain't kept constant.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Everyone is unique. I can tell you, there is absolutely no way you could go on with another girl you know less than 1 month after a prior relationship of half a year and CLAIM that you love her without having the past to haunt you. You are comparing these two ladies - which in fact belongs to two different era of your life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You made a criticial mistake - which is to enter into this relation <strong>hastily</strong>. In reality, there are alot of confusions, delusions, misunderstanding, etc yet to be solve - despite all these discrepancy, you chose to enter. I am not saying you can't be with this good woman, because the problem lies with <strong>yourself</strong>.<br><br>What is left to do?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Take a small break to be with yourself and reflect. You haven't been giving yourself ample rest, thus all these problems started to surface unneccessarily. Tell your present gf to give you some time to ponder and think. Then do lots of soul searching and your love priority, definition, standards and goals.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Finally after you come to a conclusion: swear and make heed never to compare these two ladies again. Think and sort through <strong>what you have to sort </strong>through during this short period and vow to move on with your life. You are like a boat stuck in the middle of the ocean, with no direction and moving aimlessly around - totally no sight of any visible land.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Time change, people change, money talk. Your ex by now, may not be the same 'ex' you knew months back. She would have grown, matured and moved on. You are the only one left behind; holding yourself back.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>erm I think maybe u don't love ur current gf enough... or maybe she is not the right one for u. if u have chosen her instead of ur the other ex gf.. u should have decided long ago not to compare the two of them and "find faults" with the current one. By getting easily irritated by some actions of the current gf,  she will sense it too and i guess this relationship will not last long..<br><br>Just be fair to ur new gf and hope u make up ur mind as to who u want... decide on who u think of most when u are bored, or perhaps who do u feel like talking to most when something happy/sad happens....  of coz, the gf whom u are most comfortable wif when u are out wif her is a determining factor too. Most importantly be happy and give the gf that u have chosen happiness too...<br><br>dun dilly dally and let the situation drag till a few years then u decide ur current gf is not suitable for u. good luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
