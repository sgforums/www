Well.. the problem comes in here... i still can't forget bout my ex~! it's already been like 5 mths since i went stead wif this gal but the memories of my ex keeps on coming back... i've told myself not to think bout her anymore... but i guess tt memories r 4eva... i know tt i really love my stead... but on the other hand i oso love my ex alot... i know by having tis sort of feelings i'm really letting my stead down... i've tried to bring myself into breaking up with her... but to see her sad is something i really dun wanna do. there's another thing... although i love my stead but there are some actions tt she does tt either pisses me off or tt i can't accept. When she does tis sort of things the memories of my ex will hit me even harder.. and make me even more eager to get back wif my ex( which is impossible ) ... I'm now trying my very best to spend time wif my stead so as to totally forget bout my ex... any advice from u guys? thanks in advance..</div></blockquote>I have a friend that was once in the same situation as u but someway diff. he loves this gal and waited for her for utmpteen years.. thru these yrs, he also met girls that loves him and he too~ likes the girl bt inferior of the one he is waiting for~.<br><br>In order to overcome his lonliness~ he had a couple of gfs but in the end when he found himself loving his gf more, which should be a gd thing yet turns out to be bad y? because he realised that he couldn't forget the one he is waiting~~and he is guilty of what he is doing to his current gf...~<br><br>so without a second tot, he just broke off with his gf and until now~ he has been dangling there for more than a decade~<br><br>so well brudder~ memories are unavoidable you have to ask urself, you say you love ur gf and couldn't forget ur ex~ the love you had for ur ex: does it exist in the memories that you keep recalling or you really love her like you used to...<br><br>or<br><br>you have accidentally mistook ur current gf as a substitute or a person to supress ur lonliness~<br><br>Take ur time to think cus regrets are painful~<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
