If you do, you will sure to be hit backfire by the problem later.<br>Trust me on this , i been there before.<br><br>Just try to accompany her and give her more freedom to do what she wanted . This action hopefully will help her recover faster and at the same time let you know more in-depth of her problem.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>For what i've read in your thread, I think you've got chance. Wait and see, if she's your's...you can feel it. But no matter what outcome it is, remember she's the one you wanna care for, even if she has someone else in her mind or whatever. Love someone no need return, when you see the opposite side happy, you will feel happy for them, and that's the return. I used to be selfish, stubborn, silly... Good luck and all the best.<br><br>Regards</div>

I dunno what happen to her previous r/s.. It might be something very hurtful and pain.. that's why she has such a reaction toward guys.. INSECURITY.. What you have to do now.. is to break that barrier of communication between you and her.. It seems like you don't really know her too well.. YOu are too good to her.. that she fear that she might fall in love again and history repeats..<br><br>Be yourself.. no need to do extra things for her.. treat her as a normal friends.. now.. she's feeling uncomfortable with you... cos the psychology barrier in her is not open up.. she fear.. she hold back.. Moreover.. she's unstable to go into any r/s now.. SInce you wanna help her.. Treat her as a friend first.. once she learn how to open up.. let her share her problems and tells you what happen if she wish to.. Like this.. she'll be more confident of herself..<br><br>She needs much communication!<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I think you overdid things by bringing meds to her, ...sweet but irritating. She doesn't want to feel obligated  because it could make her guilty . You would rather have someone to like and love you for what you are , rather than being your gf out of guilt and obligation<br>Don't ever ever push bf issue on her.

In the beginning she got very very angry over me bringing medicine to her especially when i just got out from wheelchair after an operation. Then at the end of the day when she cool down, she admitted to her friend that she was touched by what i had done which caused her to be guilty.<br>But that was 1 month ago, i think she had just forgotten what i had done for her. She was suppressing her feeling for me all the while. When the moment she thought of the things we used to do together, she will try her best to stop thinking of it by being busy with something.

She is not a lesbian. She dun trust guy becos she is a very insecured girl. So how do i convince her that i can be a secure bf she is looking for ? I was told care, love and concern through sincerity. But i did alot of things for her. I treated her very good. When she was sick i bought her medicine to her, but she only get angry becos she thinks not worth it cause she doesnt deserve it.<br>For now i very scared of msging her. She told me she was also very scared msging me. But if i few days nv msg her, she will ask me where i am but after that we just stop there.<br>So How should i chase her ? I need help or else i going mad !</div></blockquote>You are scared of this, you are scared of that.<br><br>Ask her out, play in the day first; then sit down somewhere near the evening and discuss matters.<br><br>This way works, but it is up to your guts this time.</div>
