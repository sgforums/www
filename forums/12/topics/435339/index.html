              <p>use ur anger as a motivation to succeed... nobody can put you down if you do not allow them... we cannot control other people's bad mouth so let them say, but deep down, we must be stronger than they are... if you notice, when people say something, it usually reflects them rather than you... if they say life is poor, money is hard to make, it usually reflects what happened to their lives... if you ask the richest men in the world, they will tell you money is easy to come by, sometimes just need to ask and you can get the money from VC etc... so whatever output is sometimes derived from the input on their lives which may not have anything to do with you... although there is no clear cut way to resolve ur problem, but if there is any consolation it's that some of the people did come from very tough and poor backgrounds, such as the Olivier Lum from Hyflux and also there are people with worse problems than you such as my dad who is suffering from cancer and will have little time left to live.</p>
              <p>All I want to say is, ur problems may be tough but if you can be stronger and be higher than all these problems. have some trust in your own ability.</p>

              <p>If you have low self esteem, you dad has the lowest of the low self esteem. Yes, dads also can have low self esteem, and nobody helps them, and they can't help themselves.</p>
              <p>Just build yourself up with positive actions. Resentment is negative and will keep you in low spirits.</p>
              <p>You need to break out of the poverty cycle. Your dads poor, so will you be poor as well? That will be the case if you harbour resentment. Break away from it, and think of the good that you have.</p>
              <p>People repeatedly and repeatedly think of the bad things in their lives, but the good things they just think about it for 20 seconds.</p>
              <p>You are able to resent your dad for the whole week, but how much time do you spend thinking of your good mum, and other aspect of your fortunate life. Little lousy thing upset you for a long time, little good things you hardly acknowledge.</p>
              <p> Try and reverse that trend, and improve your life. More good things come from happiness than from resentment.</p>

              <p>Your father is a deadbeat. Your mother could have left him long ago.. but because she cares about 
                      your future, she stayed with him and endured the humiliation and abuse 
                      for so many years.</p>
              <p>Study hard and take good care of your mother. Encourage your siblings so they too can be successful.</p>
              <p>If you don't feel like going home to see your scum ass dad, then go to the library or study room facilities in community centers to concentrate on your studies.</p>
              <p>Make sure you tell your mother where you are.. so she will not worry so much about you.</p>
              <p>I don't quite understand why your mother is unable to get a PR or citizenship ? You are a Singapore citizen are you not ? Do u have a pink IC ? You should check with ICA about your mom's PR application via her Singaporean children.</p>
              <p>I reckon your mom is poorly educated thus she does not know her rights. Your father must have used your mother's ignorance and fear of deportation to control and oppressed her all these years.</p>
              <p>Your father is mentally unsound, he has compulsive hoarding disorder. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsive_hoarding">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsive_hoarding</a></p>

              <p>Hi pal, </p>
              <p>As some has advised you, turn your anger into a motivation force, and do well in your study.</p>
              <p>Frankly, we can choose spouses, but not siblings and parents.  So, it is indeed unfortunate that you are in this situation. </p>
              <p>I will not want to talk much about your dad, perhaps he has his reasons or something along that direction.  No point, But I want to remind you as the last reply said, he is your dad, and you may follow his footstep. </p>
              <p>So, what is most important is, no point blaming him, but be sure that you do all you can not to become like him.  One way to do so is to do your best in your study.</p>
              <p>BTW, I am also a poly boy some 20 yrs back.  I do have my fair share of struggle with family, and I always stayed in library to study until dark.  So, it is possible to do all your study outside your own house. </p>
              <p>In ending, I wish you all the best.  Do well in your school work, and be a man that is useful to the society. </p>
              <p>Regards, </p>
              <p>Old man. </p>

              <p>I do agreed with what you said. </p>
              <p>But at this juncture, he is too young to think in that direction.  Thus, my advice is to focus on getting his study done, and move on. I too, took a long time to realise this simple truth. </p>
              <p>So, <span style="line-height: 17px; font-size: 15px; color: #333333;"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #5d5ebc;" href="http://sgforums.com/users/281948">Liptonman1993</a>, focus on making it in life, and not on how to get back your father.  Life is surly more than this.  Things are really beautiful outside.  Take time to appreciate it. :)</span></p>
              <p>By the way, I am now on the road trip from Toronto to Prince Edward Island with my family, why? because I focus on the positive part, determined not to follow by dad's footstep.  </p>
              <p>What my dad cannot give me, I will do my best to provide for my family.  That is what you should aim for.  If you want to 'beat' your dad, do it in a positive way. :)</p>
