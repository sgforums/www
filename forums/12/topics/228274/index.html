This model does not take into consideration that some friendships are not easily given up, despite having the same set of scenario. From here, it wouldn't be a surprise if your boyfriend feels threatened by your passive attitude in dealing with the situation as he had swiftly eased your insecurity with a quick decision, but somehow you hesitated when the same scenario applies to you.<br><br>Albeit your friendship with the guy might be 'pure', your lack of action suggested otherwise. In fact, it actually implied that you might have some unconscious liking for him, because of how this solution model was created in the first place and you didn't 'follow the standard procedure'.<br><br>You don't have to get him out of your life completely - just that you would do well to remove 'unnecessary contacts' with him? I reckon that since you guys are part of a bigger group, I don't think you could run away from seeing him altogether unless there is a spilt up somehow. Obviously, it would have an impact on your friendship with him, but from some angle, that would be the lesser evil?<br><br>Think about it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
