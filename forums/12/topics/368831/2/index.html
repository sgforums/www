              <p><br>Nope, I am not mad at her not enriching me.  If I am still not wrong.  Her idea of enriching involves $$$.  It is understood that she 'enriches' her family by giving them $$$.</p>
              <p>And that amount of $$$ usually is about only enough to cover a person's costs, but never a person's worth.  Nor was there any actions that compensated to pay off other's peoples help.  Not even a thank you ever pass out her mouth.</p>
              <p>You know....the 'ai chee, ai pee &amp; mien gong gum xia'</p>
              <p>I am mad at her enriching people's life with advises which are about as useful as telling you shitting your pants is good manners.  And when you do shit your pants, your sibling merely walk away from you and giggling?</p>
              <p>Does your sibling stayed to help clean you up or at least try to find you a pair of pants to change into? Or simply throw you $0.10 cents to get to the toliet and tell you to get out of her presence?</p>
              <p> ~~~</p>
              <p>Oh yah, I think I know why there is sibling rivalry.</p>
              <p>She after all gave what $20+k to mummy.  All her hard earned savings.</p>
              <p>I gave $35k to mummy recently.</p>
              <p>I do think it kinda unbalanced her a bit.  It used to be her always trying to tell me about how she gave $$$ to mummy.  But somehow, the last few months, she stop telling me about it.</p>
              <p>Heck......that must be it!  My sister is now jealous of me, because I am free and single, no need to pay this and that, no need to ask people for $$$ for this and that.  And that I do not listen to her advising me NOT to shave my head for charity.</p>
              <p>Its properly somethings that she cannot control.  Therefore, she is picking fights &amp; acting to her biatchy personality again.  Which incidently is what the our mummy does best and its definitely genetic.</p>
              <p> And for that matter.  Did it confuse you about asking?  Did I confuse you about asking my siblings to 'enrich' me?</p>
              <p>So if I did not request to be 'enriched'.  Did it justify people forcing their 'enrichment's on me?</p>

              <p>Anyway, on the same subject of siblings.</p>
              <p>I have a half sister, which I already promised some help should she really need to further her studies and the parents can't supply.</p>
              <p>Is it reasonable?  To standby some $$$ for her, for her further studies?</p>
              <p>And where or who should I go, to administer those $$$ when I die?</p>

              ourselves. Yet you see all our achievements as a challenge to you. </p>

              you out of our life is our only defense against your abusive behavior

              <p>Argh yes.....that I am competing to live your lifestyle?</p>
              <p>So thats your explanation about how you abuse your family to get your way?</p>
              <p>I dont know who has been more competitive with the: 'I am not estranged from the the family, she is' kinda statement.</p>
              <p>And I think more then someone obviously missed the point about 'siblings rivalry' then.</p>
              <p>I really would not mind my family cutting me out for my abusive &amp; emotional state especially since those abusive &amp; emotional state was so purely 'unprovoked'.</p>
              <p>Dirty laundry?  One only  call it dirty laundry, when one has so many dirty stuff to hide.  I've never felt anything about my family nor how my parents or siblings are ugly. </p>
              <p>It always have been their behaviour is dirty.  And I for one, does not think dirty laundry should not be washed, aired and clean up.</p>
              <p>Or are you refering to the fact that your own dirty laundry should not be bought up and discussed by others other then yourself?</p>

              <p>I so far never seen that you actually care to name the deeds.  But hey, since you refused to 'air up dirty laundry'.</p>
              <p>So the world will never know the deeds hor.</p>
              <p>Quite clever, and it obviously works well for you.  Unfortunately it does not for me.  Because I do not fancy anymore, to be accused and be used as scrapegoat for another person's bad behaviour inlcuding yours, irrespective about what 'depression' you were still suffering from.</p>

              <p>viciouskitty, I respectfully agree that everyone of us is not having a good time either. However, one of both sides has to compromise. By compromising, it is not subjecting yourself under the mercy of your sibling, but to talk with her and find out what makes her that way.</p>
              <p>My brother was an ass too. After a couple of physical fighting and yellings, we sat down and talked it through; apparently, he had issues which I never took notice of.</p>
              <p>Correct, her sometimes unfathomable behaviour is the last straw but blood is thicker than water. One act of kindness might not amount to anything for her but the constant care and understanding might just mellow the hard edge in her.</p>
              <p>Some people are not good with talking, while some resort to ways to get noticed. I do not think that she feels "really good" for trampling on the people who are close to her. And why the people who really matter to her, get hurted?</p>
              <p>viciouskitty, I know it is hard on you. I agree that respect has to be earned and with the things going, it is daunting. But going ballistic with each other over certain, unsolved issues would only deepen the misunderstanding.</p>
              <p>Take one step at a time. Be with her in spirit.</p>
              <p>Stay strong. I hope you and sister would reconcile the differences, because in a family, there is no animosity; just sprinkle on it with some good ol' fashioned "care", "love", "understanding" and "tolerance".</p>
              <p>Whatever happens, stay cool.</p>
              <p>I hope the sisterly relationship would mend for both of you.</p>
              <p>Friends cannot be there all the times, but family would always be there for you.</p>
              <p>Good luck and please take care.</p>

              <p>There isnt any misunderstanding.</p>
              <p>I understand her and our mothers well enough.  To the point of even predicting their actions before it happens.</p>
              <p>And since my sister is happily married to USA.  I can't see her building up her biatchiness.</p>
              <p>But her general lines looking for fights are always peppered with: "You, you, you, you &amp; you."</p>

              <p>I have never, cut off my family of siblings whenever they needed help.  Most often, they are the ones that put pride and grudges in their way when they could have gotten help so easily.</p>
              <p>And most times, even after I offered help, they accuse me of having ulterior motives or that I am acting damn ya ya, just because I 'think I am big papayah, because I know police or legal issues.'</p>
              <p>It has often gotten to the point, where I won't even answer to them, just so they can have their rants, and I at the end of the day, I become their faults.</p>

              <p>I am not good at interpreting thoughts but are there some minor things being overlooked?</p>
              <p>1st highlighted part - she does not want to talk about what goes on in her own life and the only way she can divert the attention on her is by calling your name (amongst the others) out?</p>
              <p>2nd highlighted part - erm, was there some competitiveness thing going on between you guys during teens?</p>
              <p>3rd highlighted part - maybe adopting a more <span style="text-decoration: underline;">forthcoming</span> approach would help? Being loyal is one thing but when there is a need to address an issue, taking the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">silent approach is likely to stifle honest dialogues</span>.</p>

              <p>What I was pissed off about is, that my sister accused my mother of sowing discord amond the children so she can reap benefits for herself.  A bit of the divide and conquer tactic.</p>

              <p>And yah, she acts the tyrant because she was the 'traumatised emotionally abused party' in the family.  And she accuses others that is older or in a better authority of being controlling and abusive.</p>
