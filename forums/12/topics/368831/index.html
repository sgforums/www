              <p>It seems that the problem now is that your sister is reverting back to her old self.</p>
              <p>It is not that you are unable to see her strength. It is just that her personality and behaviour overshadowed whatever good points that she might have.</p>
              <p>The only thing left for you to do is to snub her. You can't change her, and neither can you stand her, so your only choice is to stay away from her.</p>

              <p>Truthfully speaking, the amount of help which forummers can provide is limited.</p>
              <p>But sometimes having someone to console you, talk to you and discuss with you about your problems will already make you feel somewhat better.</p>
              <p>It is better than having to keep everything to yourself as there is no one for you to turn to.</p>

              <p>I wonder who was it, that despite being so near, does not even borther to pay visits to families.  Except to call them for transport and nannying services.</p>
              <p>And who was it, that suggest to her younger brother, to cut off credit cards, to prove independance, and basically make a prat of himself.</p>
              <p>Who was it, that believes that her mother is only other people's mother,  or for that matter, in text, expressed that her father is other people's father only.</p>
              <p>Yes.  I am estranged from the family, but at least I fighted with them.</p>
              <p>There is another form of estrangement, where people get rid of their relations, claiming distance &amp; being busy, or whatever hate they have for their relationships.  But have no qualms kicking people out as and when they pleases.</p>
              <p>Or should I mention, that using the excuses of children, to get what they want, by means of quarralling.</p>
              <p>Someone just send me a message.  It says: People who loves you, will stay back to quarral with you.</p>
              <p>People who don't, they just kick you aside when they have used you enough.  Or they leave you when they are done with you.</p>
              <p>At least I am estranged with fights involved.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>BTW, the family does know the truth.</p>
              <p>We fight, we always return to help those in need.  There is only two person among us.  That uses those help, then kick everyone away the moment help is no longer needed.  Or abuses other people emotionally &amp; verbally whenever there is a chance.</p>
              <p>And that person is mummy and you.</p>

              <p>My suggestion - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">let it go</span> lar and heart never lies - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">being wise is far more better than being rite</span> lar.</p>
              <p>As for your sister, if u feel that she is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">using</span> ... (u fill up lah) to get what she wants - it will come around sooner, i mean the come uppance When one lives accidentally, the essential will surface  and that is the predicament of many relationships, family and even at work place lar.</p>
              <p>Perhaps, the unlearning is happening lah(unconsciously) or has to happen cos its apparent that all that has been learnt and acquired is only causing strife, misery and unhappiness.</p>

              <p>Be it your siblings or your spouse.  Especially since you arent planning to be preparing to sustain them better for 12 months at least, in any future?</p>

              <p>My complaints is more towards, there are SUCH siblings that causes strife, misery and unhappiness.</p>
              <p>And venting it out here, and seeing the guilty party pretending discreetion, is more a manner of losing the respect for such a sibling causing strife, misery and unhappiness just because the siblings want to get a heck out of it, and forgetting that there will one day be karma on herself,  where eventually, there will be days where she can be kicked out.  Especially with what she is doing now will surely reap 'benefits' in time to come.</p>

              <p>Favoritism does happen in the family when some parent has too many kids and yet they cant provide enough for all.</p>
              <p>so they will pick the one that they think is the smartest one (bias one) to provide the resources they have in order to make that kid successful and do them proud at the expense of the other children they have.</p>
              <p>when the not so fortunate one is young then nothing they can do except at the mercy of the parent. but when they grow up. they are independent enough and are free to do what they want and this is the time they can build the life they wanted to be.</p>
              <p>After all, sibling will eventually have thier own family and will no longer be seeing each other as often as before. after all, parents will eventually grow old and pass away. u will be a long again.</p>
              <p>Letting it go is the key, sad family pass is a heavy burden to be carried along. why not concentrate on what u wanna do now and leave the pass burden behind and you will be much more happier.<span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
