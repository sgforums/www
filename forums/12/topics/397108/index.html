              <p>feeling of 'unwantedness'.</p>
              <p>Hi, it is me again. I have this 'problem' of me feeling sad/depressed/sucks/negative feeling whenever noone talks to me in a group outing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For example, been outing with a group of 'friends' with their respective gfs.</p>
              <p>Ok lah, I am a girl lah. There are about 3 ,4 females in the group who are gfs. I find that I hardly talk to them or is it they hardly talk to me also?</p>
              <p>I have tried to take initiative to talk, say... one of the gf, then after that, full stop. No more conversation. Then just last saturday, I know it was rude not to reply but I just feel abit 'angry' and didn't even say 'goodbye' to one of the couples when they say 'goodbye' to me. Because the gf didn't even talked to me during the outing and  even took photos with the other gfs except me. I felt left out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sigh..... I wonder, how can I get rid of this negative feelings of being left out? I am not talkative and creative to sustain interesting conversations.</p>

              <p>You feel awkward talking to people...then you think people dun awkward talking to you ah?</p>
              <p>How old are you?</p>
              <p>If you know that you have bad social skills then improve on them! What's the point in whining? You can complain all you want about the mean people who don't talk to you and things will still remain the same and not change!</p>
              <p>The only way to avoid being left out is to be involved. After all if things do not change, your negative feelings will be there to stay.</p>
              <p>I know I sound harsh...but seriously you need a wake up call...the world will not change to suit you....you should try and adapt to it instead.</p>

              <p>By the way...EQ can be improved...all you have to do is observe the people around you...look at the way they interact...find out what the common topics are...then practice! If it doesn't work the first few times...don't despair...persevere...and one day you'll find yourself succeeding.</p>
              <p>It's just like Monkey See Monkey Do <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
              <p>Good luck!</p>

              <p>If you know that you have bad social skills then improve on them! What's the point in whining? You can complain all you want about the mean people who don't talk to you and things will still remain the same and not change!</p>
              <p>The only way to avoid being left out is to be involved. After all if things do not change, your negative feelings will be there to stay.</p>
              <p>I know I sound harsh...but seriously you need a wake up call...the world will not change to suit you....you should try and adapt to it instead.</p>

              <p>feeling of 'unwantedness'.</p>
              <p>Hi, it is me again. I have this 'problem' of me feeling sad/depressed/sucks/negative feeling whenever noone talks to me in a group outing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For example, been outing with a group of 'friends' with their respective gfs.</p>
              <p>Ok lah, I am a girl lah. There are about 3 ,4 females in the group who are gfs. I find that I hardly talk to them or is it they hardly talk to me also?</p>
              <p>I have tried to take initiative to talk, say... one of the gf, then after that, full stop. No more conversation. Then just last saturday, I know it was rude not to reply but I just feel abit 'angry' and didn't even say 'goodbye' to one of the couples when they say 'goodbye' to me. Because the gf didn't even talked to me during the outing and  even took photos with the other gfs except me. I felt left out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sigh..... I wonder, how can I get rid of this negative feelings of being left out? I am not talkative and creative to sustain interesting conversations.</p>

              <p>Why don't you go out with group of friends who appreciates your presence?</p>
              <p>Friends should be equal with one another on the same level of scale when weighted together.</p>
              <p>If you have friends who expects you to place yourself lower than them in order for them to become your friends, then please leave such friendships for your own good sake. Don't waste your life insulting yourself and live in humiliation.</p>
              <p>If you have friends who expects you to be high above them so that they may find you useful enough to benefit and gain from your friendship, then please leave such friendships for their own good sake. Don't waste their lives by insulting them and allow them to live in humiliation if you truly appreciates them as your friends.</p>
              <p>And please don't write in such a manner as it pains me to see someone writing as if it is their fault and takes blame for everything that has happened.</p>
              <p>You may be at fault, but your friends and people around you also need to play their part and correct you or advise you gently because they know you and because you are their friends.</p>
              <p>Friends or people who don't really want to be personally involved to care for one another, and especially those who called themselves your friends or call you their friend, are just people who are out to take advantage of you for their own selfish gains.</p>
              <p>Before you blame yourself and accept all the condemnations from others that it is all your fault, ask yourself this question. Would you have behaved in the same way that other people have treated you? Would you have also ignored or make another person felt "left out" in an outing with you?</p>
              <p>There is a reason why you felt it was wrong about the way that your friends have treated you so, and you must stand firm in what you believed in.</p>
              <p>If you felt that you have been wronged, then believed that you have been wronged and do not go after people who have done you wrong and begged them to explain why they had done you wrong. People don't really need a reason to treat you as their enemy, all is needed is an excuse to do so and you will be under fire/attack irrationally.</p>
              <p>Don't waste your time talking about people who have already chosen to misunderstand you and become your enemies.</p>
              <p>Spend your time wisely instead with people who want to be your friend and spend time with you, in time you will find a few good friends who truly appreciates your presence. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
