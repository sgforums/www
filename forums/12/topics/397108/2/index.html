              <p>feeling of 'unwantedness'.</p>
              <p>Hi, it is me again. I have this 'problem' of me feeling
              sad/depressed/sucks/negative feeling whenever noone talks to me in
              a group outing.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For example, been outing with a group of 'friends' with their
              respective gfs.</p>
              <p>Ok lah, I am a girl lah. There are about 3 ,4 females in the
              group who are gfs. I find that I hardly talk to them or is it they
              hardly talk to me also?</p>
              <p>I have tried to take initiative to talk, say... one of the gf,
              then after that, full stop. No more conversation. Then just last
              saturday, I know it was rude not to reply but I just feel abit
              'angry' and didn't even say 'goodbye' to one of the couples
              when they say 'goodbye' to me. Because the gf didn't even
              talked to me during the outing and  even took photos with
              the other gfs except me. I felt left out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sigh..... I wonder, how can I get rid of this negative feelings
              of being left out? I am not talkative and creative to sustain
              interesting conversations.</p>

              <p>if next outing try to keep the group small is 3 to 4 pple so most of the time will be talking wif each other rather the being left out</p>
              <p>another point is go out wif like-minded friends.</p>

              <p>There are already a lot of constructive comments by mature contributors here. I would only be repeating what they say. But you, you sound like one of those losers. No one wants to talk to me? And yet you are talking to me. Grandma, please put on your false teeth before you talk. Better a troll than a grandma who tries to relive her own past nightmares. You remind me of Drew Barrymore in "Never Been Kissed Before". Only problem is nobody wants to watch your movie. The poor girl already have a bad experience, don't need you to tell her what she grow into (you - the absolute nerd). I just want her to have confidence in herself.</p>

              <p>It is not an imagination. You are conjuring your own past and reflecting them upon Zhang. You are the one who is not contributing because you are giving her nightmares by showing her what she got grow into an unwanted orge such as you.</p>
              <p>Haha, you must be so desperate that you would go to the extend of going for lesbian relationships. Sorry to disappoint you, I am already attached.</p>
              <p>Good to know that this is the last because euuuu I don't want to be flirted by a lesbian like you. I have nothing against lesbians just that you are here giving bad examples to young ladies and seducing them too.</p>

              <p>For example, been outing with a group of 'friends' with their respective gfs.</p>
              <p>Ok lah, I am a girl lah. There are about 3 ,4 females in the group who are gfs. I find that I hardly talk to them or is it they hardly talk to me also?</p>
              <p>I have tried to take initiative to talk, say... one of the gf, then after that, full stop. No more conversation. Then just last saturday, I know it was rude not to reply but I just feel abit 'angry' and didn't even say 'goodbye' to one of the couples when they say 'goodbye' to me. Because the gf didn't even talked to me during the outing and  even took photos with the other gfs except me. I felt left out.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sigh..... I wonder, how can I get rid of this negative feelings of being left out? I am not talkative and creative to sustain interesting conversations.</p>

              <p>If the group of GFs you have you find it hard to click then dun bother ...go find another friend.... need not be a group also duh.</p>
