Am I just being too timid... thinking too much? </div></blockquote>Hello Timble. Most of the time we all want to have a desirable relationship, in which the guy should be caring, gentle yet manly. And the girl should be supportive and loving. But there's always a big difference between ideal and reality.<br><br>Life is complicated. Lets face it. And why so ? Its not the world that presents itself that makes things complicated.. its how you want to think that makes complications even more... complicated.<br><br>Take for example, your bf's 'vulgarity'. To you, its probably a matter of etiquette, or rather ur bf's lack of it. To him, its probably a freedom of speech, a way to express his thoughts and release tension. This is a 2-way ideal.<br><br>Find time to sit down alone, and sort things out alone. Ask yourself what is the real problem that causes the 2 of u to have frequent arguements ? Are the 2 of u communicating effectively during the arguements ?<br><br>Or is there the ego problem ? Because neither would want to really sit down and listen, enforcing your own theories.<br><br>I feel the question ultimately is not 'Is love enough' ? It is 'Are we really listening' ?<br><br>Just my 2 cents.. hope this helps a little at least. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think both of you have come these far. So why don't you think what makes you registered for a flat with him in the first place?<br><br>I do confess that even couple with 5 years of relationship also agreed that they do not really know each other well. So let alone your 2 years plus.<br><br>Come on.., nobody can garantee a happy couple now will live happily ever after they got married. Neither can anyone garantee that an average couple will not find blissful family life after they got married.<br><br>So what is your heart that's telling you ??? If you think he is the type you are looking for then stay on. If he is not, better open your eyes before everything is too late. I will not try to be too lengthy, in marriage's life, there is even more tolerance, understanding, care, concern, trust..etc needed. If you think you cannot give and take then you better twice.!!<br><br>Divorce will only break both hearts, create unhappiness around both, what worse if there is kids around.<br><br>Be logic and resonable, love is blind. But spare thoughts for the roads both have walked till now.<br><br>Good luck<br><br></div>

Waking up beside him everyday, accepting all his virtues and faults? Can you? If you accept a man, accept everything that he may represents, including his family background, his habits, his future potential changes etc. etc. Can you?</div>
