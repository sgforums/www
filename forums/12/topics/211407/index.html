DXO? comabt/ technical/engineering vocation? medic/ store? what? need more details.<br><br>qualification requirements, salary, working hours, benefits etc for SAF positions are usually fixed for starters so if you have email or send them everything u have the first phase of the selection programmes is sealed. if u have been even selected for an interniew then what i believe is your performance then that matters.<br><br>how did you fare for the psychology test? during the interview remember to mention/ show your interest in the position/ vocation you have applied for with SAF. work on them and your chances should be higher. remember what you do is for the nation and country and remember to put in some patriotism. no matter what positnio or starting rank you may be expecting, have confidence and some level of firm answering/ decision making (even if it may not be the desired or best answer/s) since decisiveness is very important for a man in uniform.<br><br>if you really need the answer simply ask the interviewer or call them to check why you have not been chosen for the post.<br><br>as for your qualification or qualities suxing to the extend that even SAF dun wnat u i beilieve its BS...age is one big problem and SAF usually wants ppl below 25/24 and has height and weight liimits.</div>

Most probably the problem lies on the interview part.<br><br>When attending interview,<br><br>make sure you're not late.<br><br>make sure you're courteous at all times even to other passerbys<br><br>make sure u reach there early so you will not feel panick or sweating.<br><br>make sure u bring yr own pen along.<br><br>make sure you bring a copy of your original resume<br><br>make sure you present your true certs in a neat clear file (recommended)<br><br>make sure you wear smart attire.<br><br>make sure you don't wear any heavy make up.<br><br>make sure your mouth don't have any odour.<br><br>make sure you greet and offer firm handshake enthusiatically.<br><br>make sure u present yourself professionally.<br><br>make sure you think before answering any questions.<br><br>make sure you're comfortable with 4 interviewers together interviewing you at one long table, each taking turns to ask you questions one after another<br><br>make sure you answer relevant answers<br><br>make sure you're on eyes contact with the interviewer when answering questions<br><br>make sure your tongue is not tied<br><br>make sure you speak confidently<br><br>make sure you can name your own weak points and personality if they ask you (no one is perfect, some may think it's pathetic if you don't even know your own weak points, you can improve on your on weakness if you know it.)<br><br>in my own opinion&gt;&gt; actually other than your paper qualifications, expected salary or past experiences, your character plays a very important part as well. Shortlisting a particular candidate for interview is in fact is trying to find out more about the candidate's personality and character.<br><br></div>
