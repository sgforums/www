With each scare, we tell ouselves to stop or otherwise use rubber.....<br><br>but we don't like sensation of rubber.. not just me, her also... so we just use the withdrawal method ONLY.<br><br>and with each scare we stop for about 2 to 3 weeks before resuming from 3rd week onwards.... it is almost impossible to stop i think for ppl... esp when you love the other party. i think it is wired into our genes<br><br>and we finally got married.... so now no more scare already... we don't want kids yet , but if got kid we are fine with it also.<br><br>Just want to share... it is not easy to stop. and for those in which their r/s is "spoiled" because of this issue, it means that the r/s is not steady yet or it is already flawed... i think for two matured adults sincere about each other.. the above is not really a issue...<br><br>but then having a baby when not ready is really a very serious issue. so don't take it lightly.<br><br>on hindsight, i am very very glad we didn't hit the jackpot when we are unmarried.... but i am glad that we did it... sxx strengthed our r/s and whatever ppl say, sxx outside of marriage with someone you love is different from sxx within marriage.... so I am glad that I can share both experience with the one that I love.<br><br>If we had hit the jackpot, it probably meant that we have to get married suddenly and also a bit of accusing fingers by relatives and caring for the kid when young.... but i think overall we would still be married... so that wouldn't be much different just the order or things are a bit jumbled up.<br><br>So don't blame pre marital sxx as the issue when r/s turns sour or if things didn't work out. it is prob issues outside of sxx that cause r/s to crack/break.<br><br>btw, i read somewhere that although pre- c um contains semen, they are inactive (basically died), so the withdrawal method is actually effective IF the guy managed to control and pull out EACH time.<br><br>But of course to control is not easy.. esp for younger men. do some reseach on the web....<br><br>This isn't highly publised. i guess it is not responsible to publicize and a lot of this kind of "studies" are generated by those condom manufacturiers and those who are anti HIV.<br><br></div>

There is a booklet inside that teach you how to correctly wear it. All brands of rubbers in the markets have gone thru batch testing in PSB before they are allow to be sold in singapore. Therefore, those who got preg even if they got used rubber is that they mishandle it. Like when the guy is putting on, then used his nails to pull it over, causing the nails to tear the rubber.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
