In the end the smartest thing to do is to remember what our elders have been telling us about the birds and the bees - save sex for marriage.<br><br>I know of this 17 year old girl who had missed her period for several days. She had told me that she had sex with her ex a few weeks before and was now frantic. Her home pregnancy test kit gave negative results, but she was still under extreme stress until her period finally came. That was a few days of sheer terror for her.<br><br>The bottom line is pretty simple - it's tempting to have sex before marriage, but the ultimately, it's a lot wiser to save that 'first time' for your wedding night.</div>
