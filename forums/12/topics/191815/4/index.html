I think you're not that ready for this relationship yet...?<br><br>Don't compare yourself to her ex... Don't question and ask her... When you can't let go, how do you expect her to let go...?<br><br>If you wants to be with her, you should learn to slowly walk her out of her past... Not to push her back into her dilema...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: violet;">Been following up on your story <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Something which caught my attention today is:<br><br>1. She feels sian so she went to <strong>play games </strong>while you continue doing the project<br><br>2. She says she'll consider giving the relationship another chance if <strong>you pass the next maths test</strong><br><br>You mentioned you were a top scorer before the recent test which you failed. It seems to me that she would have an advantage in her academics if she is with you. I'm not going to use the term "making use of you" because it is too strong, but perhaps I would say its a milder version of it.<br><br>To me, it appears that she is one confused girl. She does have feelings for you, but only to this <strong>limited extent</strong>. She clearly have not gotten over her past relationship at all, and is definitely not ready to begin a new one fairly. <strong>Bad timing </strong>bah.<br><br>Another point is that she can go and meet her ex whenever she wants, but you mentioned she smsed you b4 going malaysia "no drink no call girl". I mean, she can go meet guys she have feelings for but you cannot even call girls? From this, either she is <strong>selfish</strong> or <strong>insecure</strong>. Not criticising her though, I would say most of us are selfish when it comes to this right? But not even calling, has this gone too far?<br><br>I think she knows very well your love for her. <strong>She is not blind</strong>. She can clearly see what you are doing for her. Knowing the fact that you can't bear to leave her, in the words, <strong>not afraid to lose you</strong>, she doesn't cherish or treat you like she should.<br><br>My advice would be to <strong>leave her for a while</strong>. Certain times you just have to be harsh. If you continue to let her "bully" you, this will drag on and will get no where de. But I know it is hard to let go. I've been trying to do the same for the past few months too, but still can't bear to. I believe, one day, when you have reached a limit and can take it no longer, suddenly wakeup and see the whole picture rationally, you will do what you ought to do. Good Luck! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></span></div>
