              Hearing you say this only shows something parn..
              
              Either you are too nice (easily get stepped over the head)
              
              Or you dont understand what i am talking about.
              
              
              I can treat the person neutral.. But i won't go out of the way just to wait for that person..
              
              Talk about waiting for friend? Can the person even be considered a friend? 
              
              Yes, I will WAIT FOR FRIENDS, I won't wait for stuck up colleagues though. 
              
              Period.
              
              And talking about PRCS, they are ok.. a few of them is like that DOES NOT give you the right to stereotype them. 
              
              I am a selfish person whereas you are a stereotyping racist bugger.
              
              Go reflect upon it yourself.
              
              The discussion shall end here.

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>A few things have happened at work, but somehow I'm happier now
              that it has happened..<br> <br> The 'biggest' thing that happened is that we fell out with
              another colleague. 'We' are me and another Chinese girl. The
              colleague is a filipino girl.<br> <br> What happened in the lab was all her fault. I mean even though yea,
              we mistakenly left her behind (more about that later), we
              apologised to her after that. And you know what? Her sms
              read "it's okay =))". But apparently it wasn't okay, because
              the next day she started ignoring us, from the very first time we
              saw her that morning, she just ignored us both. I already sensed
              she was gonna do something like this (it's not the first time she's
              showing that kind of stupid fucked-up attitude), so I didn't
              say or do anything, didn't even say 'hi' to her. Although I
              wouldn't have ignored her if she didn't ignore us first. And the
              other Chinese girl, she said 'hi' to the filipino. She got a dirty
              look in return. And, at lunch that day, the Chinese girl offered
              the filipino some of her lunch. And the latter gave her a dirty
              look.<br> <br> I mean, "WTH?!" F-ed up <em>larh</em>.<br> <br> My take on things is like that: whatever attitude someone gives me,
              I give back. If possible, double or even triple. So, I ignored
              her.<br> <br> She's taking things another step further. Making it worse. In lab,
              whilst we are doing our work, she keeps making unnecessary noise,
              like singing damn loudly, talking damn loudly and 'happily' (?!),
              and talking to others (whom she's making use of) damn sweetly, the
              very annoyingly 'teh' (act-cute) way.<br> <br> And she even kept kicking her table to make noise. The back of our
              table is a metal sheet, so kicking it is making annoying noises.
              Hell.<br> <br> What was our 'fault'? Okay me and my Chinese friend were
              rushing to the MRT after getting off the bus after work. The
              filipino was following us. She was slow, and me and the Chinese
              girl rushed into the MRT train when we saw it, and turned back
              looking for her. Couldn't find her, cos there were so many people.
              It was only after the door closed that we saw her, and she saw
              us too. I caught that 'microexpression' of annoyance flitting
              across her face. Then she rearranged her features into
              a very fake smile and waved us goodbye. Afterwhich, my
              friend messaged her "sorry we left you behind, we didn't know you
              were so far away from us. Sorry, we see you tomorrow" or something
              to that effect. It was an apology!! And the next day my friend also
              apologised to her.<br> <br> Gawd, what a childish person (the filipino). This isn't the first
              time she did something like this.<br> <br> The first was, she ignored the filipino guy (used to be the 4 of us
              hanged out together, like talking during our free times, lunching
              together). And the reason being? "He didn't talk to me so I'm not
              talking to him." Argh, that day when she decided to start ignoring
              him, he was very very very busy. This 'cold' war lasted a month.
              They made up in the end. It was the guy who took the initiative.
              Not the girl. And, the girl was shouting so loudly "I miss him!! I
              want to go out with him, I want to sit with him." So
              fake.<br> <br> The second? It was me who <em>kena-ed</em> the 'cold' war. Not
              my fault okay. The 4 of us arranged to go Sentosa on a Sunday.
              Then, on that day itself, when I reached HarbourFront, I was
              waiting for them. Then I got a message from my Chinese friend,
              saying she and the guy couldn't contact the filipino girl. So the
              trip off. And what, the filipino girl messaged me 30
              MINUTES AFTER THE ARRANGED MEETUP TIME saying
              "outing cancelled. you know?" I replied, "no. what happened." Her
              message "I duno, they cancelled." She's blaming them! Without a
              word of sorry. I knew she just woke up. Because the day before
              (Saturday), she was supposed to entertain her visiting fellow
              countrymen and take them to Sentosa. No responsibility to message
              us the night before to at least say, "I'm tired, maybe tml not
              going with you guys."<br> <br> Well the next day (Monday) she ignored me. I was pissed off and
              ignored her as well, cos I can't be bothered to go and
              <em>por</em>(mollycoddle) someone who's in the wrong. I heard
              from my Chinese friend that she took 2 days to persuade the
              filipino to talk to me. And how did the filipino 'apologise'? "Hey!
              Why you never talk to me for so long ah?" T_T she said it in a
              'joking' manner to 'hint' that she's "not in the wrong".
              WAHHH<br> <br> And I'm the type of person, when I know of something good, I'll
              tell my friends about it if I knew they were looking out for that.
              For eg, I told her about the IT fair cos she was asking around
              about it. And I told her, "if you know any sales, tell me! I want
              to buy stuff!" she said 'okay', but she didn't keep that promise. I
              know. I found out. I hate people like that. I already openly told
              her what I'm looking for, she had the info, couldn't be
              bothered to share.<br> <br> Alot of times also, she 'made appointments' with me to go out,
              never keep them. And she never take responsibility to tell me, like
              even on that day itself. I knew she would break the appointment.
              But I just kept quiet for the whole day to see if she would tell
              me. She didn't. A whole day working in the SAME PLACE and she
              can't be bothered to tell me. So at the end of the day I said,
              'we going out right?' she said 'no, sorry I going out with my BF'.
              I asked, 'when did you confirm you going out with him?'. She
              said 'yesterday'. Never apologised. T_T<br> <br> Alot, alot of times. I gave her chanceS. (Note
              the plural) Normally my first impression of a person is
              right. I got the impression (When I first got to know her) that she
              wasn't good. There's no reason, just an instinct. But I chose
              to give her chances. Which she didn't treasure.<br> <br> So okay, I give up. I'm happier now. I don't have to pretend I like
              her. It was tiring.<br> <br> She's the type of person who'll bitch about others when she's in
              the wrong. I bet (and I have the feeling) she bitched about us to
              the Manager, saying it's our fault that caused the rift. (the
              manager noticed the 4 of us have now become 2-2) I know it, because
              that's how I'm like. Her behaviour and mine are the same, when
              we are annoyed. (I don't act as fake and as 'friendly' as
              she is though.) I know I'm annoying when I act like that.
              I just didn't know <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how
              bad</span>. Now that I'v seen, I feel I really gotta change and be
              more aware of my behaviour.<br> <br> I sound like such a bitch. But who wouldn't? If they <span style="text-decoration: underline;">had</span> a 'friend' like that?</p>
              <p>And then, the guy joined in. So now we have double trouble. The
              two of them gang up to do stuffs to annoy the both of us chinese.
              For me, I really heck care, because I was the one who brought up
              the matter to manager and complained about them, dun think they
              also dare to cause too much trouble. In the first 8 mths before
              this happend, I was with them and amongst us all the two of them
              always tease me cos I 'let them bully' me. Den now they irritate me
              i go bite them back.</p>
              <p>An MCP and a witch. I'm resigning. The MCP dares to make trouble
              but dare not face it. He dare not face me when I'm angry. The witch
              only dares to make trouble when the MCP is around. What weaklings.
              Want to make trouble, they shouldn't have to wait for 'backing'
              what... My gawds...</p>

              <p>TS, from my perspective, seems like ur oversensitive... u assume far too many things and ur emotion affect ur perception too much...</p>
              <p>Eg: how do u know she will 'bitch' abt u in front of the Manager ?</p>
              <p>just because u will do it, doesn't mean she will do it... u may say both of u are similar, actually if u r really that 'similar' to her, u would understand why she behaves the way she is and be more understanding...</p>
              <p>and what makes you think that she does things purposely to annoy you ? ur making it like its her life purpose to annoy you...</p>
              <p>Most people have LIFE, they are not out there planning on how to irritate people just because 'i cant get along with u'</p>
              <p>See things in perspective... find out the facts and avoid jumping to conclusion....</p>
              <p>Also, it would be bad to mix work and personal feelings all in one... thus ur manager's concern.</p>
              <p>Even if at the end of the day u can't be friend with her... so what... u can't be friends with everybody anyway... however for the sake of work... do get along... it's part of maturity to be able to get along with ppl different than u...</p>

              <p>chinese are called "chinks" by some racist whites, and it's from "chinese" ---&gt; "chinks".</p>
              <p>pinoys???!!! from "Phillippines" to "pinoy" is a bit far off leh......shouldn't it be "Philey"??</p>
              <p>and btw, some filippinas (especially those pale skin ones), are indeed very arrogant and proud. it's a well-known fact that a lot of fillipinas see themselves as white americans, due to their cultural similarities. i really wanna slap these ****es, though.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>What kind of lab/company do you work in?  Believe it or not, chances are, certain types of companies have vacancies because someone like you resigned in a similar situation.  In other words, its the bullies that stay on.  The other thing you can do, is do some background research on the companies that would like to hire you, instead of joining the first one that comes along.  But it might be rather difficult given the current economic situation.  Best advice - stay on, learn to smile and joke like her, and don't take thing seriously.  If she starts making noise like singing, banging things, report immediately to your superior.  It would be very odd if the manager allows his employee to sing, bang tables in the work place since it disrupts the work.</div>

              <p>Glad you let it out of your system. I suppose you feel better
                                              now.</p>
              <p>Time to face up to reality now.</p>
              <p>1. Office politics is common and is an everyday occurence. I
                                              know it's difficult, but somehow, we must work within our
                                              differences and find a common ground to stand on. Working life is
                                              no longer the carefree days of school life. You are now earning a
                                              living and building up your career.</p>
              <p>Anywhere you go will ALWAYS be like this, sad to say. But the
                                              solution, once again, is to find a common ground to stand on, live
                                              and let live, even if friendships cannot be struck up at the
                                              workplace. Be the professional that you are suppose to be, in your
                                              profession.</p>
              <p>That's why we have after office hours and weekends, to relax and
                                              find true friends of our own.</p>
              <p>2. Never resign. Not in this financial climate. Unless you have
                                              a better job on hand and ready to make that switch, or you will
                                              truly yourself in between a falling rock and a hard place of
                                              unemployment. Trust me, anywhere you go is the same. It aint school
                                              life anymore.</p>
              <p>3. Chill out, enjoy some light music, and hope you may consider
                                              my suggestions.</p>
              <p>Good luck and cheers.</p>

              <p>Ya true…But this thing I <em>tahan</em> for nearly half a year liao.. actually 4mths to be exact.. and know what, even when we were ‘friends’ the fili guy used to embarrass me because of my problem. My hearing is bad. And I did mention to them because the guy asked me damn loudly why I “always cannot hear”. I didn’t want to tell him. But he kept bugging me so yea I told him and my Chinese gal pal. And each time the guy would be “hey I called you so many times y u never hear??” and bug me AROUND THE LAB even when I said ‘enough anot?!’ he always says those stuff damn loudly. He always called damn loudly, shouting in the lab "where are you where are you" even though he knows i cannot hear him as the lab is usually noisy. He doesn't bother to come and look for me but keeps shouting. Now that kind of guy decided not to be ‘friend’ liao, guess what’s happening in the lab? Not that I cannot understand that there is office politics, but there’s a limit when it starts on personal attacks on something I already feel so low about.</p>
              <p>My first rant was actually something that happened at the beginning of the year before the guy joined in. At that point it was, as you said, <em>tahan</em>-able. But now that the guy joined in, they are doing more serious stuff that warrant my resignation.</p>

              <p>Re-reading my post, I realize i may not had been more clear in
                  defining the difference between school days and work life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is largely individual effort during school days, and it would
                  not matter 'dont friend, dont friend loh' kind of attitude. No one
                  else can help you gain an A in your Science except your own hard
                  work in the exams.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But at work, it is largely a team effort. You are only part of
                  the system whereby a company survives or profit. The chain is only
                  as strong as its weakest link.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Therefore if there are any problem at work, it is the role of
                  the manager to ensure the system of team effort function
                  efficiently by building rapport among qualified members of the
                  team.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Failure to do so will only ensure the company collapse. Thus
                  your manager will have to take responsibility for his failure
                  should you resign, that is, if you are indeed the problem and not
                  the other girl. If not, it would be the company's loss.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rather than to lay blame on the manager, you could at your level
                  see if you can draw a line and maintain a professional distance, to
                  help your career and the company you work for.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You will be admired and go far for it if your manager is
                  competent or his 'rational' door is open to discuss and find
                  solutions.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>See the difference?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br> Yea I see the diff. I spoke to both qc manager and lab manager and hr manager about this, but they’r like ‘small matter la, just tahan’. But hey, I kept stressing to them that they are DISRUPTING OUR WORK by snatching machines and stuff, but the managers wouldn’t listen. Ok lor, since my friend and I already tahan and didn’t do anything back to them, we’re not at fault. 
                  
                  I already have a backup plan, because I wouldn’t ever resign from anything w/o another job/study plan. Im already onto the backup plan I have, just waiting for a chance to see GM about this. Im not letting this go.</p>

              <p>Eh but, seriously boss (TS =P), like Mr. xtreyier mentioned,
              "<strong>Anywhere you go will ALWAYS be like this</strong>". In
              school also got (can say cos I just got out with diploma).<br> If you be ninja (zabo ninja hot woo~~ =X) or some form of
              solo-ranger then nothing to say. So, don't bother resigning. Wait
              next workplace 2 fili girl + 2 fili guy or more ah, how sia like
              that? =\<br> <br> My strategy in school was: as much as possible, just
              <strong>siam</strong> the people you don't like, like say lunchtime
              or what. Employment contract also never say must eat with them ba.
              But then again, I never wore a skirt to school, so could run and
              jump around as I wished. XP</p>
              <p>Find ways to deal with them lo (for now at least), especially by
              discussing with your Chinese girl khaki (chio ma? =D). Methods
              don't need be direct ones, if you know what I mean. =)</p>
              <p> About the "go Sentosa" thing ah, if tio pang seh then can
              try call other good friend go gaigai with you lo. After all,
              goodness knows how much time you spent on makeup...</p>
              <p>And I strongly suggest against listening to emo music (at least
              till "they" gone), only makes you more emo &amp; angry &amp; ready
              to explode. Confirm more effective than naked gunpowder. (Then
              again, gunpowder got wear clothes de meh? Underwear also bo.
              =\)</p>
              <p>Best of luck. =)<br> And best of colleagues (in future)</p>

              <p>Understand why you so angry.. It's common to meet such people at

              <p>What i mean is: Normal working days lunch together ok lar.. But
                  non-working days keep as it is.</p>
              <p>Don't be too close to them.</p>
              <p>You'll never know when they will stab you.</p>

              <p>I don't trust my colleagues too much either.. Yes, we chat and
                  fool around during work and lunch time.. but non-work days means my

              <p>yup.. admittedly I didn't really keep a distance from them,

                  heart.. when we were friends. Kinda prepared for this kind of stuff. So I
                  didn’t feel any sense of loss when this happened, just anger that I was treated
                  as less than what I am. Im not a nationalist or anything, I do have good pinoy
                  friends..(but they were the older ones like 50+)</p>

              Anyways, I tolerated more, cos on the 4<sup>th</sup> last day my backup plan
