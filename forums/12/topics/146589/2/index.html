You are putting emotions too foward when dealing with these cases. And when emotions are involved, it will affect judgement, neutrality and objectivity. At the very least, avoid becoming personal regarding counselling. You are doing something noble and the least you could reward yourself is avoid sinking into the enviromental moods of your cases and affect your day?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frostice i seriously suggest u do not use friendster 2 get to know the person because u most probably would be branded as desperate and grostque . Why i say this is because i have a lot of female friends who got a lot of this kinda  "wanna be friends?" "hello? " kind of messages in their friendster inbox then when i ask them why they never reply they tell me "u crazy ar , look oso can tell they sibei desperate to look for girls online lo"  and i would say they are quite rite cause some of them are quite gd looking so i guess they will feel ppl jus want to know them because they look good lo , so advice pal is get to know her thru ya mutual friend and say hi to her face and at least she will feel safe seeing ya real person and not some virtual stuff .</div>
