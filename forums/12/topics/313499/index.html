              <p>GCE 'O' Levels 2008 is only about 6+ months away and I havent really start studying since sec3. Last year I lucky never retain and was advanced to sec4, but now I still have not been studying but instead wasted my 3 months, january february and march, on my computer games. Now I am starting to worry about my 'O' levels as I had not been studying much and when I want to study or do my homework, I just feel like wanting to play computer and I would go and on my computer and forget about my studies and homework. I am currently addicted to my computer and just 6+ months later is 'O' levels and I feel like it is too late. </p>
              <p>Is it too late to study now? Can anyone give some advices how to get rid of my computer addiction and go back to study?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hmm, maybe i should tell u all my subject standards?</p>

              <p>Biology--know only 25% of what's being taught in sec3 and sec4</p>

              <p>you want some motivation? fuck yea you do.</p>
              <p>i was in your situation last year. i literally only started studying at about this time during sec 4. i almost retained my sec 3 , so i was doing rly rly bad. to give you a clearer idea of how bad i was, i failed every single chem and maths test i had till about mid-year exams.</p>
              <p>i managed some ok results though, r4 10, r5 13 during o levels.</p>
              <p>your school will finish the syllabus soon? ill try to give you some advice, unless things have changed drastically over the last year.</p>
              <p>For maths and science,</p>
              <p>-do ten year series. (unless you are having new syllabus, im not sure if your year is.) just to give you an idea of where you stand, if you cant answer at the very very least 90% of the questions, you suck and should start studying right the fuck now.  circle all the questions that you cannot answer. <strong>don't</strong> just
              check the answer after you've answered and think you understand the
              concept behind it, you need to ask the teacher why this
              question's answer is like that. The students in the good schools have
              done their TYS a few times over (thats right they literally have done
              every single question in their maths/science TYS a few times over the
              course of their upper sec life, im not fuckin kidding you) . spend a couple of hours a day doing your TYS (you know which subjects you suck at, so be smart about how you spend time on diff subjects)</p>
              <p>-get tuition if you can afford it.</p>
              <p>-spend your fuckin weekends studying. you wake up in the morning, sit the fuck down at your table, take our your textbooks/notes and shit, bring out your TYS and start doing it till evening or so. (you don't need no fucking computer breaks you piece of shit.) if you think you suck at time management, bring out a clock and time yourself as if you are having an actual exam. your teachers dont say it but you are actually expected to complete the entire TYS at least once.</p>
              <p>the main idea is, at the end of the day, to be able to sit down, and you say to yourself 'holy shit maths/science is fucking easy what a joke subject i am taking' .</p>
              <p>-your teachers know what they are talking about. ask your teachers exactly how to get full marks for the open ended questions. (the ones where you have to write a shitload of text on foolscap).</p>
              <p>remember this mainly applies to maths/science though, they are easy as fuck to do on TYS when you have done the same question 4-5 times before. you should expect to have filled many many pads of foolscap paper just by answering questions.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>definitely not too late. if you decide to put in effort now, you can still do well.</p>

              <p>and my r5 was 18, r4 was 13.</p>
              <p>if you can 'wake up' and start now, you can definitely do much better than i did</p>

              <p>starting now may be a bit late but it is definitely better than only waking up 6 months later only to realise, fuck, tmr is the paper. doing tys is definitely one of the best ways to guarantee an A. i can share with u my story. i also slacked like crap in sec 3. i score l1r5 38. failed more than half the subjects i have taken. basically i never hit below l1r5 20 before. so the chances of me getting into jc was super low. even in prelim my l1r5 was still 26. but when u really wake up and work hard, it will work. practise all sorts of compositions. do all the questions in tys repeatedly. most importantly, practise every single subject everyday. if u plan like to study only 3-4 subjects ono ne day and the rest on a another, u will lose contact easily and find it tiring to recall stuff 2 days ago. then u will start to dread mugging and give up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>all the best dude! after the o's u will realise it is such a minor thing to even think it is hard. trust me.</p>

              <p>you say until when reach prelim chiong also can,different ppl have different speed of absorbation...true that when u guys started to chiong after prelim your result improve but this may not work for other people......its like some people understand a concept after the teacher teach one time but some people may need more than one time than to understand the concept</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So this is my suggestion,is to have constant revision for your tys and if your have any doubts on any subject,make sure to clarify with your peers or your teachers....and if u study like 5 hours,you can reward yourself by playing computer for 1 hours,well unless if you have a good self control and really play for 1 hours</p>

              <p>start now before its too late, its good that u realise u don't have much time left to o'levels. from now on treat every homework seriously, pay full attention in class.</p>
              <p>if u start revision only 1 or 2 months before o'levels, don't ever think of this because it will be too late.</p>
