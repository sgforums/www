              <p><br>Many guys also talk sex with me, from PMs to SMS to MSNs to whatever communication methods they can use, I did not even accept anyone of them, if I did, i will be no different from pros, worst, at least pros collect money, i got nothing.</p>
              <p>Gal to gal talk, my take is keep your sex or whatever intercourses till the day you marry to one that really love you and you really love him. Listen to me, you will never regret what i said, as a streetgal all this while, you can never outsmart me with boys.</p>

              <p>hi, i wanted to post my issue in a forum. tried hwz but my post
              got removed cos the moderator said its not the right place. so im
              here to share it. me and my bf has been together for 6 mths now. so
              far everythin is going well for us. recently we thought abt having
              intimate moments when he came to my hse. but time aft time nothing
              happened. so we chat on the phone and he was quite into having sex
              with me. idk what to reply but since i love him i said ok but only
              protected sex. he doesnt want. he asked me if i trust him and he
              promise not to impregnant me. i know the risk and that but hmm
              having unprotected sex is quite scarry for me... for a week he been
              asking abt my decision. i kept telling him i dont know... i heard
              abt withdrawal method but what if he cant control? i dont want to
              screw my life and at the same time i dont want to disappoing him as
              he is my bf and i love him alot. im not asking alot, just ask him
              to have protected sex. im quite confused now. am i on a mistake? i
              havent done intercourse before so im not too sure with alot of
              things. we had petting before and alot of times it went to almost
              sex but then nth happened cos i kept turning him down. any advises
              people?</p>

              <p>Pregnant is not so bad lah..a product of love.</p>

              <p>He dare ask unprotected sex from you... he also dare ask other girls have unprotected sex lah.</p>
              <p>You know you are clean.. but you sure he is clean or not.</p>
              <p>Pull out method .. failure rate is 80%. Pre-cum got sperm hor.</p>
              <p>You pregnant.. he ask you go abort. very damaging to your womb ok. You think he give a damn ? He is a selfish bastard, this kind of guy you also want ah...</p>

              <p>Try not to believe his words. Just 6 months only and he is looking into sex. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I feel as if he dun really love you. But more of after sex, it seems to me. For most of my friends they only did it after like 1 to 2 years into relationship with protected sex.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why i say he dun love you. If he does he will wanna set up a family with you in future but not now. Also he will respect you, respect your choice. I feel as if like he is more like a jerk. Dun give in to him alright. There are plenty of good guys out there.  </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the method below is only applicable if you really love him and "so called" cannot live without him. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another way to test the guy if he got HIV/STD is to bring him go for check up first before you even allow him to have any unprotected sex. Since there is such thing called contraceptive pills for you to use(reminder: there are side effects after using it).</p>
