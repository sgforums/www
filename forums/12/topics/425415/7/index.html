However much you feel like you're in love, the probability of this relationship lasting is incredibly low. Have sex with him now, some other boyfriend next year, maybe two the next year . . . before you know it, you have a substantial sexual history.

Getting pregnant at 21, which is possible even if you use birth control. How would you raise a baby, finish school, get a job, anything? Even if you plan on abortion or adoption, those are very difficult paths to travel. Plus there are STD's. If your boyfriend has had sex, he could have AIDS, gonorrhea, herpes, genital warts - who knows what? If you have sex with him, even with a condom, you have some chance of catching one of those disgusting, embarrassing, life-altering diseases. You could become infertile. You could solve this by making your boyfriend get tested. But most tpeople aren't willing to do that. He'll probably just tell you the girl wasn't promiscuous so it's safe. <br><br>Even if we just think about your emotional well-being, if you have any reluctance about having sex, that's a good sign that you'll regret it. Your body wants sex. Your boyfriend wants sex. The only things that can possibly be pressuring you in the opposite direction are your own morality, common sense, and hesitation about committing that much to this relationship at this time. Whichever of those it is, your doubts are worth listening to. Far more than your lustful hormones and self-interested boyfriend. Next time he asks, tell him the answer is "no" and is going to stay "no" for the foreseeable future, and if he has a problem with that then he can find a slut to date.<br><br>Good luck and stand strong.</span></p></div>

              he is totally right TS. if that guy is true to you. He still can ask u for sex but he'll definitely respect ur wishes in that aspect and u wont be having this protected sex vs unprotected sex issue ma. That kinda akin to not respecting the r/s itself.

              <p>Must say, good and safe choice you made regarding that relationship, despite having to contain your own raging hormones......   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15"></p>
              <p>And if you're gonna have sex next time, apart from having blood tests and that bit of rubber, you can also consider having 'the Pill' to go along with... if you can get those. So long as it doesn't give you side effects it's pretty much recommended as yet another layer of protection... and I heard it's pretty affordable. And of course, you can always try get the guy to foot this bill... if he loves you enough.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15"></p>
