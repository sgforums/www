              <p>Our oriental culture are abit more conservative, we prefer a totally new package, like if i am to get marry, I will sure try to get a guy who is a virgin. But then when i ask 40 guys, who is a virgin, even the oldest one put up his hand..both hands</p>

              <p>Yup, nowadays it is easier to find a boy who is willing to marry a girl who has sex around a bit.</p>
              <p>One word of caution though. Sex brings the relationship to a different level.</p>
              <p>Its the you belong to me, I belong to you mentality that sexual intimacy induce.</p>

              <p>The law is funny, but it is there.</p>
              <p>In rape cases the issue is always on consent. The guy will claim that consent was there.</p>
              <p>The court will determine if there is really consent.</p>
              <p>You say yes with condom, that means no without condom. He will argue that you agreed without condom. So go to Courts, and trash it out.</p>
              <p>Also when you agree, and while he is humping, you say "Stop" he must stop immediately and pull it out, otherwise from that point onwards its rape. No kidding.</p>

              <p>Hi mardiana,</p>
              <p>I believe angel7030 is trying to be helpful, but sometimes it may not be the right answer.</p>
              <p>If he really loves you, he can wait.</p>
              <p>Having sex before marriage to test whether you guys are sexually compatible, is the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard.</p>
              <p>If both of you really love each other, you guys would have the most wonderful sex ever, whether he has a small penis or if hes inexperience and so on. Sex is not only a physical connection, its so much more than that.</p>
              <p>You love him so much, and sex for you would be so good because you are 
              doing it with someone you love, but if he does not love you the equally,
               you are going to have lots of problems.</p>
              <p>And i recommend you, to do it only after marriage, because, if he breaks up with you, you are going to have lots and lots of emotional instability and many other unquantifiable problems. He is probably sexually curious, i do not blame him for that, and it is only natural. But if he really loves you like you love him, you guys can wait it out.</p>
              <p>Oh yes i'll like to end on this note.</p>
              <p>You can only lose your virginity once.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>and mardiana, "the reason ppl tell girls to be virgin until married
                                      is bcos they dont want us to get pregnant so young. so if u can
                                      avoid the pregnant part, then it should be fine to go ahead." who gave you this idea???</p>
              <p>Think about this, after your marriage vows , your wedding dinner, your husband and you both virgins. And giving yourself to each other, thats the greatest gift you can offer.<br>Not money,time or anything can compare to the gift of yourself.</p>
              <p>imagine how wonderful that would be.</p>
              <p>I can only imagine, because i m nt a virgin anymore. i would take it back in a flash but i cant.</p>
              <p>But in your case, you still are. And you can keep it till marriage.</p>

              <p><br>It is not your job to persuade him to have unprotected sex. Just make it clear that if he doesn't agree, then there will be none. His insistence on having unprotected sex is clear indication of the kind of guy he is. It just shows that he has no respect for you. Maybe you should move on and away from him.</p>
