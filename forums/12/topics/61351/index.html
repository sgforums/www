            <div class='col-md body'>yupz.. it's just a dream.. and maybe it's because you worry too much about your gf leaving you and thus you dream about it... but if you're really interested in <a href="http://www.armenian.com/dreams.html" rel="nofollow">interpretation of dreams</a> or <a href="http://www.sleeps.com/dictionary/dictionary.html" rel="nofollow">this site</a>... you just take the key things in your dream, it's just for fun, no one at this stage has significantly proven scientifically that dreams carry a message, though some claim to have experience.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't really think you can interprete dreams to relate to your daily life. I'm not a believer of that. But to dream of your gf, and to cry for her and hug her when she's well, goes to show that you really love her.<br><br>Just carry on loving her and everything will be fine!</div>

It bears a simple message of treasuring things in your life that you might take for granted everyday. The other message speaks of fear of losing precious thing in your life. You might be facing a situation that is unstable or beyond your control. It is an anxiety you face that was reflected in the dream. Something that you think you might lose it.<br><br>Hope this helps.</div>
