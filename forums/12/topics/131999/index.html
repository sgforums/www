In fact, results are not everything when you come out to work. In fact a good company and a good employer will not only look at your results. I've known plenty of people who got a job (and it's a good one) much faster than those who did better. (I am comparing 2nd upper class/2nd lower class vs 3rd class/no honors here!!! No kidding!!) Hence you can't be sure you'll definitely do better than him just because your results are better.<br><br>The problem with our education system and people in Singapore is that a lot of people enter courses that they don't even like or worse, they hate it. They end up hating to study for it. Is that why he's behaving so?<br><br>On the other hand, he may be having some problems at home since you already said finanacially he's poorer than your family.<br><br>If he can survive uni and manage to stay on and finish his studies, he'll be able to prove to prospective employers that he can be one who oevrcomes adversities. Shouldn't that be someone you want to be with more?<br><br>If one is from a good family background, had the right upbrining, resulting in him being high achieving and ambitious, he is lucky I guess. But not everyone has such chances.<br><br>Love can change someone. Though you are still young, and there are 2 different schools of thought, where one encourages you to meet more people while you're still young, and the other encourages you to sweat it out with him, the decision lies in you.<br><br>Do you love him? Are you willing to ride the storm with him?<br><br>Or do you prefer a relationship that is likely to be smooth sailing with no real tests at all?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you think there's nothing wrong with your mindset and have no intention of changing it, please break up with your current BF. There'll be no lack of even more well-off guys you will encounter. If a guy you don't know very well can make you go on 2 dates with him and reconsider your current relationship, you might as well not waste your BF's and your time. Spare your BF further heartbreak and let him go for better girls out there.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Its sad to hear such a thing happen on u. I  know how u feel. But as foxwall has mentioned, result is not very important in working life. A good degree is only a good for a jump start, but don't promise a good career. Based on result is not everything. If u loved ur bf very much, i suggest u maintain as friend with the promising guy and see how. Give yourself some time to think about it. If u think ur future is more important, I suggest u break up with him fast, cos its not doing any good to drag on. Although ppl may think its selfish, but eventually, its u who will be with ur bf not them.<br><br>Finally I think its very diffcult to have 2 people who knows and love each other  to be together, so hope u make your decision wisely.
