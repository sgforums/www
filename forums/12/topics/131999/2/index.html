If u loved ur bf very much, i suggest u maintain as friend with the promising guy and see how. Give yourself some time to think about it. If u think ur future is more important, I suggest u break up with him fast, cos its not doing any good to drag on.

            <div class='col-md body'>Simply put, your thinking has changed or matured, but your boyfriend's hasn't. That creates a disparity between your mentalities during communication and you are starting to find him less suitable as a lifelong mate as compared to the other guy. Have you tried talking to your boyfriend about the change of your values, and that you've become rather concerned over his apparent lack of concern about your plans for the future?<br><br>You said you are confused, but you do sound a little like your mind has been made up. A part of you wants to give your current boyfriend a chance, give him time to change; but another part of you fears that if you missed this chance, a better prospect like that other guy may not come by again so easily.<br><br>Since you should know your heart better than we do, we could only advise you to go with it then. If you've really had a change of heart, you'd actually be doing him a favour by breaking off with him now than by committing yourselves further.<br><br>Worst comes to worst, you could always recommend him to drop in here.</div>

Reason being very simple: you will likely to leave him for another man if things continues: this is a straight fact. You two share very different attitude and preception towards your own relationship and eventually it will cause a breakdown somewhere.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Love is about looking in the same direction, not just at one another</strong></span> - you can't survive a relationship simply through your sweet little things.

            <div class='col-md body'>~ Hi Steph84 ~<br><br>I'm Cecil's gf. I went through similar experience as you.<br><br>My very 1st bf, B, &amp; I found that we couldn't get along with each other any more. After 10mths of dating, I felt very unhappy with him, yet I couldn't let myself go. And I saw no future with him. There came a guy, S, who helped save me from this draggy r/s.<br><br>S, was definately a much more better guy. Very ambitious, tall, rich, highly-educated, &amp; a nice character. We clicked immediately. We felt very comfortable with each other &amp; shared a lot of common interests &amp; values. We spotted a very bright future ahead. We were very happy together then.<br><br>Out of a sudden, he said that he wants to concentrate on his work entirely, leaving me no choice but to go. I was so devastated..It was only after 6 mths then I healed myself from all the pains &amp; sorrows. As for now, we are just plain good friends. By the way, we were only together for 6wks.<br><br>So girl, I think you have set your mind to break up with him. Why don't you give him the very last ultimatum? Tell him that if he were not to listen to you this very last time, you will break off with him immediately.<br><br>I know this is cruel, unless you don't love him anymore.<br><br>But girl, please, don't rush into another relationship as soon as the past one has just ended. Take your time to know the guy. Be wary of his work scope, don't be like me.<br><br>I have learnt my lesson. Though it's a very painful experience, I feel glad to know that finally, I have found someone I love so much. Now I'm blissfully attached with my bao bao, cecil.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Steph,<br><br>Wait a minute...  You have a stable bf, but you've been out on dates with another guy?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">   Do you really treat him as a stable bf, or are you open to options &amp; playing the field?!<br><br>I'm Not here to judge you, just asking you if you've thought over what you're doing, &amp; what you want.<br><br>I can tell you this:  I've been out with guys who are financially better off, they can pretty much afford most things &amp; offer me a stable life.  I probably don't need to work.  Has that brought me happiness?  *smiles*  NO.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Currently, my guy isn't as well-off as others.  I don't get the rich kinda toys that I used to get (i.e. jewellery, etc).  But I wouldn't trade him in for a richer guy at all.  What for?  I'm proud that I work &amp; I can buy my own things, when people tell me my stuff is nice, I'm proud to say I bought them.  I don't need a guy to buy them for me, &amp; expect me to tolerate their shit.<br><br>My current guy isn't perfect, but he's the 1 who's brought me the most happiness.  He's caring, he's sweet, he's supportive &amp; understanding, we have plenty of laughs together.  His gifts aren't expensive, but they bring the brightest smiles to my face.  I get shoulder massages, foot massages, I have dinner cooked for me sometimes, he picks out the clothes I wear on dates, he goes shopping with me &amp; takes a genuine interest in what I buy.<br><br>We make each other happy &amp; we're faithful, &amp; frankly, that's all I ever need.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Steph84:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi there...<br><br>Let me descibe the situation...<br><br>You have a stable bf of 1.5 yrs.. the 2 of u all are comfortable with each other, know each other inside out, had ur share of major quarrels n all... ur bf consider the relationship a stable one... a dependable one....<br><br>But you, on the other hand, think that u can do with more security in the relationship. Ur bf's family background is not exactly desirable... he's is less well-off than you. In fact, you have to pay more on dates and also at times take care of his financial needs.<br><br>The most inportant factor troubling you is the attitude he holds towards his studies. He is faring poorer than u. A partner fares poorer than u doesn't appeal to u.<br><br>Nonetheless, time has told u he is loving and caring most of the time... during this period that the two of you are together.<br><br>Recently, you met this new guy.<br><br>You do not yet know that much about his family background, but he seems to be better off than ur bf. He also seems to be more goal-oriented and steadfast in working out his life. Education-wise, he fares better than ur bf. In fact, he's just graduated and will be working soon.<br><br>So far, he is nice, gentlemanly and all... and the two of u get along great... despite knowing each other not for long, the 2 of you are really comfortable with each other. The few dates that you've been on with him, you throughly enjoyed yourself. He has also expressed his interest in pursuing a relationship with you clearly.<br><br>What'd you do in such a situation? Risk it with the new guy u met? Or think that love conquers all and rough it out with ur bf and see wad is the ending?</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Steph84,<br><br>I'm a bit late.  Haven't been reading Aunt Agony for some time now.<br><br>You say that your current bf is becoming a bit undesirable because of:<br>(1) His family background.<br>(2) His lack of interest in studies.<br><br>You also said these about the new guy you met:<br>(1) You don't know about his family background.<br>(2) His ability to get through his studies.<br>(3) You don't know him well yet.<br><br>Well, I think the answer is obvious and you're right - its a risk at this point of time.  Why hurry and make a decision now?  You need time to get to know the new guy before making any decisions, so take your time.  There are always things you like about somebody (no matter how unattractive he is) and there are always things you hate about somebody (no matter how attractive he is).  So just relax and let time "educate" you better.<br><br>Our seniors always told us that lying was bad, didn't they?  But when we grew up, we found that they were no angels and lied too.....and its part and parcel of life.  To cover up their flaws, they called it "white lies".<br><br>Is the same with relationships.  We've all been taught that two-timing and cheating is bad, isn't it?  Well, in my opinion, not so!!  I'm gonna suggest a justified two-timing in this case.  Stick with both for the time being, take your time to learn about both....and make a decision only when you're sure.  Its gonna take some cover-up skills and guilt-squashing (if you're not used to it).  But it you pull it off, you'll be better off in the end.<br><br>PS:  I can't understand why the lack of interest in studies would affect a relationship (future financial security?), but OK....each has his/her own opinions about what attracts them.<br><br></div>
