            <div class='col-md body'>My personal opinion is to do business since you already have the intention to do business. Doing business you can generate more wealth than being a employee. If you have big dreams, then being an entrepreneur will be the right direction.<br><br>However, to become a successful businessman is not easy. One needs to have determination and clear goal. It will be better if there is a business mentor who can guide you along and help you to overcome obstacles. You also need to have good products/services for you to market and a good marketing strategies to go into the market.<br><br>My suggestion is to explore more and be open to opportunities. Opportunities are everywhere but it depends on where we can see it or not.<br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
