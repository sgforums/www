I like her or not, and if you do, date her and then if you get along really well... ( <strong>NOT</strong> quarrel now and then,  <strong>NOT</strong>break and patch, break and patch, type) marry her, and then chances are you will get along well in marriage as well....<br><br>what is courtship for if not to find the right person... meaning, break up with the wrong person as well....</div>

So, go with your heart. Go where it leads you and try to place character before looks.
