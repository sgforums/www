Talk and communicate more...?<br><br>If you're not too comfortable to chat in a big group, go for a smaller group... If you're not comfortable with smaller group then chat 1-1 style.. The FACT is that you would still need to learn to communicate with others when you step out into the society next time...?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Really blur about the rank thing. But sometimes different interests, will really have NOTHING to tok about lor. Moreover it seems those guys are your subordinates? So maybe they find it hard to tok to u too bah, coz people will think they saka u or wat. But because you are their sup, think of it as an advantage. Even if they dun like u , they will not show it to u. So in the meantime u can be more friendly to them, try to find common topics / interests / know them more ?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Or just join their activities (if they invite u) and see how it develops from there / organise an activity so that u get included?</div>
