If she likes leading a life centred around church and interacting with other believers, then she should do so without forcing along somebody who is blatantly not interested. I hate church, and I like spending time with my other friends doing things which actually generate fun. In fact I rather do homework than to go to church. The fact that she is asking me to bring more friends along is puzzling Â– why would I want to subject my friends to such torture and consequently jeopardise our friendship? I already explained to her that I cannot (and in actuality do not want to) commit to church. I mean, what a way to destroy an otherwise promising weekend. So I get my Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays all occupied with something incredibly worthless such as worshipping? When does the fun start, or does it ever? The fact that church is a heavy commitment does not help one bit. I have a life, I need to unwind and I have ambitions which require much time and self-commitment.

Why canÂ’t churches just be quiet and simple like every other house of worship, without all the extravagant commercialisation, preaching and coercive methods of increasing membership? Stop trying to be heroes and tell people where they should put their faith in. We can think. I am sick of people trying to convert me. They ramble ceaselessly about very ambiguous things regarding God, life, brotherhood and an inherent obligation to atone for our sins which Jesus died for, but when I start to challenge them to a debate on religion, they cannot even answer me. Go away, get lost, donÂ’t preach and get a new cause. Believe in whatever you want but keep your mouth shut about it; I am sure anyone harassed by you annoying neo-mafia members would say the same. I know that once I become Â“one of themÂ” (i.e. get baptised) I am never going to be able to escape future meetings. If I quit, I would be condemned as a traitor and be damned to hell.<br><br>I am really at my witÂ’s end when it comes to abstaining from church while not straining my friendship with her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote>biggest ever abuse of religion, they will truly burn in hell</div>
