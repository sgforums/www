            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Since the beginning of this year, I have gotten to know a couple of friends whom I mingle well with Â– well enough to spend recess with and participate in group outings. All was fine until one of them invited me to her church service some time ago, which I eventually agreed to despite my initial hesitation.<br><br>To start off, I am not a religious person, nor am I interested in activities of faith or anything related to worshipping. My friend assured me that it would be fun to Â“get to know more peopleÂ” and besides, they were going to watch a movie after that. I thought that I would give it a shot; I was not one to be a spoilsport anyway.<br><br>Obviously that was the biggest mistake of my life.<br><br>Service was disgusting, coma-inducing and highly absurd to say the least. I was drowning in the ocean of unwashed humanity who kept on singing, chanting and mumbling some gobbledegook which meant absolutely nothing. There was also a session called Â“healingÂ” which I find inexplicably stupid. Some woman got on stage, testified that her back pains had miraculously disappeared during the Â“healingÂ” and thanked the lord for curing her. What an idiot. Try curing cancer and make a cripple walk again; then I would be impressed.<br><br>What really pissed me off was when they started begging for money: Â“Even if itÂ’s one dollar more than youÂ’ve contributed last week, the lord is watching from above and he knows that youÂ’re helping at your best.Â”<br><br>Hello? If I want to make a financial contribution towards a charitable cause, I would put my money in established reputable organisations to pursue my philanthropic deeds, not in some deceptive profit-driven association disguised under the clever label of a church.<br><br>Anyway, back to the point. Despite my subsequent refusal to attend service or cell group meetings, my friend kept on pestering me to show up, and it actually worked. I have already attended several cell group meetings against my will just to keep the friendship going.<br><br>Their pressure for me to participate regularly in their church activities is overwhelming. I kept on rejecting her, citing other plans, but she just pressed on and stuck to compelling me to join them. Now she is asking me to bring more friends along the next time I show up. She even wants to know the actual number of people I already have (zero), and she messages me on a daily basis just to persuade me to commit to church.<br><br>She is being horribly selfish. If she likes leading a life centred around church and interacting with other believers, then she should do so without forcing along somebody who is blatantly not interested. I hate church, and I like spending time with my other friends doing things which actually generate fun. In fact I rather do homework than to go to church. The fact that she is asking me to bring more friends along is puzzling Â– why would I want to subject my friends to such torture and consequently jeopardise our friendship? I already explained to her that I cannot (and in actuality do not want to) commit to church. I mean, what a way to destroy an otherwise promising weekend. So I get my Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays all occupied with something incredibly worthless such as worshipping? When does the fun start, or does it ever? The fact that church is a heavy commitment does not help one bit. I have a life, I need to unwind and I have ambitions which require much time and self-commitment. Why would I even waste my time on things which obviously do not add value to me as an individual, a student, a son or a citizen? Why canÂ’t she be more understanding in this respect?<br><br>My last point is why are people from churches so mafia-like? Why canÂ’t churches just be quiet and simple like every other house of worship, without all the extravagant commercialisation, preaching and coercive methods of increasing membership? Stop trying to be heroes and tell people where they should put their faith in. We can think. I am sick of people trying to convert me. They ramble ceaselessly about very ambiguous things regarding God, life, brotherhood and an inherent obligation to atone for our sins which Jesus died for, but when I start to challenge them to a debate on religion, they cannot even answer me. Go away, get lost, donÂ’t preach and get a new cause. Believe in whatever you want but keep your mouth shut about it; I am sure anyone harassed by you annoying neo-mafia members would say the same. I know that once I become Â“one of themÂ” (i.e. get baptised) I am never going to be able to escape future meetings. If I quit, I would be condemned as a traitor and be damned to hell.<br><br>I am really at my witÂ’s end when it comes to abstaining from church while not straining my friendship with her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi =D<br><br>Although I agree with what you said, there are some things that I couldn't help thinking whilst reading through your post.<br><br>Yes some christians can be very persistant with trying to spread their religion around and especially with trying to convince other non-members of the church to join. I know that because I've been to church before... I was baptised when I was much younger. I no longer attend now though. Partly because I'm not that much of a believer in god and I have no faith in the religion itself.

But it was not because of that behaviour that put me off christianity, it was the lack of faith to begin with.<br><br>Now <strong>take in mind</strong> that I used "SOME" christians and "SOME" churches. I don't think one should generalize and expect the same behaviour from all christians. Your friend is wrong for pressuring you to attend church and expects that you do..in order to maintain the friendship. If YOUR friend expects you to do so, then clearly, she is not a real friend to begin with. I can't imagine any of my friends threatening me to attend church or else they'll stop talking to me. That is just childish behaviour in my opinion.<br><br>There is <strong>REALLY NO NEED</strong> to religion bash or anything like that. Keep in mind that different people have different values and beliefs. Just because you don't like christian teachings, doesn't give you the right to criticise what they do or dont do. If you can't stand what they teach, simple..dont go to church anymore. Respect what other people believe in, and what your friend believes in.

            <div class='col-md body'>Not all churches are like that .<br><br>I notice the ones with cell groups do not belong to conventional churches. In Australia , I did write a letter of complaint outlining religious freedom to the property manager of my apartment complex where they started harassing a friend and I by knocking on our doors, placing fliers under the door etc . The church operates out of one of their function rooms and has a large following around the complex. I got it settled fast because I was threatening to go to the authorities. At least I like my church better - it owns a building and I can choose to go there whenever I want to, the religious order doesn't pester me to go   because God gave us all free will to decide what we want to do.<br><br>As for your friend , you want to keep her as a friend- you might need to keep going to her church - they are like brainwashed minions and they act like it.  Or you can cut it off from her- make it clear if she harasses you - you are entitled to seek a legal recourse . You can actually complain to the authorities in Singapore because of the sedition act that comes with religious tolerance.<br></div>
