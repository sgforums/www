I am in a rship now, after all those lonely years, but somehow i feel that she's not really the one... maybe it's normal.... or maybe it was becos i rushed things.... so just take it easy lah.... dont have to think too much also.... have means have.... have liao not the correct one also nvm... life goes one... at the end of it, u'll definitely find the one for you...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Me too. i was single all the way till i turned 23. When i was in the army, all my army mates, rather many of them had gfs. And of course when i did not, i felt oh why din i have one too???? Can understand. but then again, not to worry, expand your social circle, meet more people, meet more gals and then you should be able to find someone. And of course, don set your expectations too high..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why is everyone in Singapore so worried over having girlfriends? What if you don't have one even after you have turned 25?<br><br>Does that mean you are bad looking?<br>Does it mean you are a poor chap (no money no honey)?<br>Does it mean that you have bad habits?<br>Does it mean that you are less capable of wooing ladies then the rest of the guys?<br><br>NO.<br><br>It just means that you have lesser exposure among your social circles then the rest! You just need to:<br><br>Be more outgoing.<br>Try to be an extrovert to a CERTAIN EXTENT (If you are an introvert)<br>Try to increase your social circle by making more friends. It doesn't matter whether you make guy or gal friends.<br>You can do so by joining new and interesting stuff which you enjoy doing and not just for the sake of increasing social circle.<br>Attend group outings and go out with new friends without hesitating.<br><br>Just for your knowledge, in India majority get into relationships only around 20s. They are not pressurised into it or anything.<br><br>Its just the society here. Don't Care about it. You can't put a deadline regarding when you wanna get attached.<br><br>So ya.. My 2 cents worth =)</div>
