            <div class='col-md body'>haha, i haven been into a relationship b4 but there're quite a number of chicks who dig me tho. i know i hv no problem gettin gals, but its veri damn hard to find the right 1<br><br>but here r some advice i can giv u<br><br>1. make more frens, doesnt matter guy or gal. maybe ur buddie's fren could be ur one. just know more n more ppl the more the better<br><br>2. when talkin to gals, dun be shy...try to b funny but dun try too hard. tease them in moderation. ALWAYZ look into their eyes. try to smile alot oso...be fun, hav fun<br><br>3. dress well, ask ur frens for opinions. good personal hygiene oso<br><br>4. Now heres the part dat seperates the boys from the men. it is called touching. DONT EVER tell a gal that you 'like' her before you have even touched her....unless she already liks u alot, ur going to fail miserably. After youve talked to her and shes comfortable w u, try to make brief contact wif her hand in a casual way.... when u guys r closer, u can try put ur hand on her shoulder. see how she reacts...if she avoid it or somethin then give up and move on.<br><br>if shes comfortable w it, u can den hold her hands. at this point, u can tell her u 'like' her.  :-)<br><br>5. u dun hav to buy her ex stuff...unless shes already ur stead. but if ur too filthy rich...then well, still dun buy it for her. u should buy for me since i help u learn the tactics of chee hong<br><br>so basically, you make frens w ur fren's frens everywhere. see a gal you like, talk to her n make her laugh. touch her, hold her. then go stead...simple. or if u got balls u can juz pick up gals on the streets....but im too tired to go into dat. gd luck</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>actually very simple.<br><br>1st u need to change ur social circle of friends. Stop hanging ard with all males clan oni. Dont do u ani good<br><br>2nd U will oni noe girls thru - Ur sch after army if u studying, friends recommendation (can get those guys gt gf one, ask them to ask gals out for grp outing), or ur workplace<br><br>3rd - U already say u got so many flaws. Then why will girls like u sia. Do something abt urself. Get a new haircut at a gd salon, if u r pimpely, see skin doctor. If u r thin or fat, time to hit the gym<br><br>4th self confidenc and witty is very impt.
