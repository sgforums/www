              <p>Through experience, I confirm the guy is insincere and either seeing another gal or in the midst of getting his target.   Treating the gal as "deposit".  Don't wait, wait what, wait, wait.   So many guys out there.   Don't put all eggs in one basket. </p>

More commitments means more money. Everyone wants to have a balance between love and career. But honestly we are living in Singapore, education and career is up most important provided if ur some gay motherfukers who have a damn rich dad and mum than money is not an issue. In Singapore career is impt as it creates a source of income. Everything needs money.. Marriage, honeymoon house and car and so many more.. Without a decent amount of salary per month <span> </span>forget abt forever love without a proper job. Having a good career means a stronger self confidence.. Gals will feel more financially secured and stable. So wait for guys to find their right path whether its in terms of education of career. <span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></span></span></p></div>
