            <div class='col-md body'>forgive my verbal diarrhoea but i have this tingling feeling that's been with me for quite a while. basically, i feel really trapped in this vicious cycle:<br><br>after reading some books or watching some movies or getting know some successful pple that are v motivational and inspiring -&gt; make a personal pact with yourself to do something well, excel and achieve the certain goals you have in mind -&gt; fail because of some reason or another ... and so on.<br><br>i don't know why but i alw feel im under-achieving or not doing as well as i expect i should. a lvls wise, did average but certainly below my expectations. after a lvls, went into ns and i think i did pretty well for sit test and peer appraisal but just cant jump (broad-jump) and couldnt land myself in comand sch. even now as a man, i feel i should not be bounded by my circumstances so i actively volunteer to make my life more fufilling. tried to organise projects to hone my leadership skills but the progress is abysmal and i think i just have to shelf it afterall.<br><br>of course, there are instances where i shone, or at least made some tangible progress in my ambitious endeavours like taking up key leadership roles in my jc cca and winning the first prize of an essay competition. but i really feel insatiated. they seem too minute to suffice my hunger.<br><br>i'm like forever being so in a dilemma. on some days, i feel it's okay to be simple and take things one by one as they come along and that it's alright to be the average joe. on other days, i feel really inspired and committed to fufil the many new objectives that sprout out on my mental wishlist like trying again to get a scholarship in uni first year (which i failed previously), working out to becoming fitter and leaner, being an inspiring leader and an entrepreneur in the future etc.<br><br>it's as if i'm like a pendulum swinging between two extremes, unrelenting to achieve a standstill. ultimately, i feel it's important to take a definite take on life i.e. whether you are willing to be an achiever or just get by in life simply. maybe, it's possible to attain the delicate balance between the two but it's just aint happening to me in my life! i'm feeling so perplexed and exasperated at myself.<br><br>anyone ever felt or feels this way? sigh.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey, i think u expect too much from urself, and u want to take a big step in a shortest time possible. relax, dude. sometimes things are not within our strength and that we need opportunity n luck too. though hardwork plays a very important part but do not forget we need the right time and place to make that miracle happen. i understand how u feel as im always thinking of doing big and successful too but seems like fate n luck are not on my side. relax urself n ur mind, dun force or pressure urself. its just life. some ple can make it big in a short time, but some just need their entire life to fulfil it. accept n appreciate wad u r doing now, for some ple are less better than us.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I've been through this before so cheer up, ur not alone...... and proud to say. I've survived this ordeal.<br><br>U could be giving yrself too much stress by comparing yrself wif others. Add to this the fact that u may have been experiencing a fair dose of self-doubt......<br>which eats into u. Mentally u r fatigued....... jaded..........<br><br>U r right. This condition is a vicious cycle - one thing leads to another and the problem snowballs.......<br><br>I suggest u tackle this wif rest. Stop stressing yrself out by comparing wif others. Don't even compare wif wad u expect of yrself - just accept everything abt yrself, If u score 60/100, juz accept it and b happy with whatever u've achieved......... for a while lah. This period of 'inertia' is to allow u to build up yr mental strength. In time, yr fighting spirit will come charging back and when u experience that zing in u, u know u'll have recharged yrself. U';; feel and think differently!<br><br>It worked 4 me....... hope it works for u too. Good luck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm going to go against the grain here and propose a wacky idea:<br><br>STOP TRYING SO HARD.<br><br>I discovered this one by accident a few years back.  After focussing on getting 100% on everything in my first four years of university and being disappointed with a low-80's average, I found myself in a very odd situation at postgrad level.  At third year, I had to bust my chops to get into Honours.  At Honours, I had to bust my chops to get into postgrad.  Once I got into postgrad, there were no more hurdles to clear and since it was no longer in the university's interests to stop me, failing to get to the finish line was a virtual impossibility.<br><br>At this point, I figured that since the pressure was off, I could sit back and enjoy the subjects I was doing.  Taking my foot off the pedal, I ended up getting 90+ percent averages.  Go figure.<br><br>As it turns out, I discovered a new game; rather than worrying about what was coming next, I lived in the moment and discovered passion for what I was doing.  yes, I'm well aware that it's extremely corny, but that's just the way it turned out.<br><br>To some extent, I'd already known this in an informal sense.  During NS, instead of focussing on the pressure of the overall situation, I just kept my mind on what was going on at that moment, and things would sort themselves out.  However, I didn't think it through until my postgrad experience.<br><br>I figure this is the way it works: if you're worrying about the big picture, you're drawing resources away from where they could be better used, namely on the task at hand.<br><br>These days, when the heat's on, I just chill out.  I go with the flow, take it all as a game and have as much fun as I can doing whatever I'm doing.  It still works for me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I can see that majority of the population are affected by peer pressure and that stereo-typing of 'success' be it career, relationship or other things in life. People life to flaunt their properties and what they have owned or achieved. Just how do we define 'success'?<br><br>To me success does not mean having a car or able to drive. Success do not mean getting a pretty girlfriend or wife. Sucess do not mean getting into an executive position and wear office clothing to work everyday. And success do not mean earning quick money in the shortest time. Most people may want to weigh the above and hope to overshadow others who are not on par with them in these areas of 'achievements'. What if my definition of success is making a beautiful sketch of a scenery with a pencil and a paper? If you can't do this i would not say that i am more successful and accomplished than you. I would do worse than that by saying that 'you are handicapped'!<br><br>This also brought me thoughts over to a job interview a couple of days back. The first interview went okay and i was informed to got for the second interview the following week. During the first interview i requested for a plant visitation because i wanted to look at my work areas and the working conditions..believe me this tells a lot. However during the second interview another manager from another department insisted that he will interview me just because he was formally from the department which i will be working in but in my mind i thought to myself WTF kindda working system is this? My god that company was ranked the top local companies in Singapore! Okay i went along and completed the second interview and they asked me to wait for the third and it seems like the HR is forever busy not bothered about my presence when they themselves requested for the rendezvous! F uck it man i just felt like telling them 'hey fu ckers, i need to go go down to Orchard Road later to get myself a handphone so what's keeping your as ses up'? The company HR was located way off my home and immagine 2-3 trips to-and-fro like a clown. Worse when i reached home they called again over my mobile for a third round hoping they can orgasm again!<br><br>The company was rated local top in the charts .... but in my eyes and forever etched in my mind i began questioning the public 'is this call a success'?<br><br>So the next time someone challenges you to a game of achievements and success, tell them all to sit at the coffee shop and discuss...be it the odd-job labourers or a manger or executive. Tell them that the Lee family is the most successful in Singapore and the money they earn is the most <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>pipipopo, you're right. Success is not measured by comparing to others. Success is a journey by itself.
