Needs to find a replacement . Cannot cancel my own.<br>She's getting so cold-hearted. Never ever care about others feeling just that she wanna play and enjoy.<br>I've sms her yesterday,she said i'm pushing her...What the FK? Why not say she push into the other end now? Now she had nothing to worry,but me?<br>I guess that $2200 also can't get back liao,just like her parents. Thats what she complain to me...Mum never care about others,any quarrel at home straight call police...Dad always borrow money from ppl never return...now still owe "ah long". not yet settle.<br>Dunno whether i still have feeling for her or not? But i still thinking of her.<br>She told me she very busy this moment...i reply "really? have time go hang around not related to your dream( music), no time to settle this off? "<br>No reply.<br>I'm saying these cos ppl saw her else where.<br>I've know some of the music school friends she introduced to me, they say they long time didn't see her liao. Is she leaving me cos of been a singer or cos of other guy? She's a liar.</div>

I love,she used to love me(dunno whether is acting or not but i guess is true.) Why love can fade so easily? I'm now waiting for her to settle the guarantor things. No shared acc. I'm not stress at work cos of her,different matters,but one said," Successful man always have a woman behind supporting him." But i don't,she left me...though i still have little feeling for her,i won't waste my time for her and won't allow her to be part of my life again,might divorce maybe. Yah maybe someone better in my future.<br>Thanks alot BLIM for ur advice. But sometimes i do recall those happy times we've been thru, quite uneasy,sad. End up like that.

            <div class='col-md body'>she is an immature person, but not a stupid one. it also seems like she took her dream very lightly, as if its something nice to have, but not important to die for. alot of people do this too, they claim its their dream and all, but true colours are revealed when problems happen or as time goes by. then you can see, they actually used that dream to hide something else.<br><br>same goes for guys, so if thats the case, it is not easy for people to really trust her once they know the real her. its like having many relationships, but each of them somehow broke off.<br><br>perhaps the problems she faced at home since childhood may be the cause of development but its just a random guess. i doubt anyone would like to be in hers situation either.<br><br>unless she change for the better, the ending is quite obvious for her, at least by what i can read here. but for you, its different, as long you don't give up hope, there is always someone you cna look forward to in the future, and it may not be her.<br><br>in either case, its good to chat lo, keeping things to yourself is no good, doesn't have to be right or wrong. avoid to tok about her will make you a miserable man. my 2 cents la..</div>

What you mean by the ending is quite obvious for her? Sorry ,my english not good. Is it good or bad ? She changes heart easily. No point staying back for her,as you said, there is always someone you cna look forward to in the future.<br>But right now, still hard for me to forget. Really hard...but i'll try. Not all girls like her.</div>

Starting a relationship always sweet and nice,it's just the beginning, after that turning good or bad nobody knows,both have to work out together. I've tried. But bad outcome. You're right, her future bf or ex bf will do something to her also don't know. At least i didn't beat her nor any girls. I've temper,not violent. She just doesn't care for other ppl at all,all she wants is just to be happy by herself alone.</div>
