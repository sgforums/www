            <div class='col-md body'>After 3 yrs 3 mths of relationship with her,it ended a month ago. I'm 24,while she's 20 this yr. She has good voice,got champion or second in lots of competitions. So she wanna be a singer. I used to not accepting her as a singer,as i have my reasons. Cause, She can't take stresses, her family problems loaded...Both mother's and father's side grandparents divorced,even her parents too. But i don't mind,just wish to protect her,and take care of her. I don't want to see her stress. Yup,not easy been a singer,maybe not succeed. But there's still chance if you try. 2nd is that if she succeed, we won't have been so close,it happened few times that she went for singing performance, no calls and even sms from her for 2 weeks. Not only for my own sake, she keeps complaining about her part time job,and also some problems dealing in that music school, and also family. As a guy,i wanna help but dunno how,that stress me up,but she dunt understand.Of cos i also have my own problems to handle...What should i do? Now? No more...<br>More to tell....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>She kept complaining to her friends that i'm hot temper. But does she know what she had done? I attach Taiwan 2 yrs ago during my NS, she had accept a guy for 1 day(She told me that), and also allow another guy to send her home but she rejected him,which hurt them alot. She told me she miss me until cannot sleep,even late for school which end up debarred. Cannot sleep? Guess what? Her poly guy friend introduced her to group of guys at a coffeeshop nearby her house and she went there after her mum had slept which she joined them from 12am to 6am. She told me just few times..but heard from her god-sis,more than what she told me herself,even drink beer...Not to listen to other than my loved one much,so i ask her myself,she admitted. She wanna go disco as she had never been before, I allow,but must let me know who she's going with and also not alcohol,but seems like not happy. She wants to go malaysia with her god-sis and god-sis's parents,i don't allow,cos that period got lots of news about robbery and rape there. I explain to her but she kept persuading me, and i got fed up. One guy how to protect 3 ladies? Few months ago i wanna try accepting her to sing...she said she had gave up because of me. And she's actually going to join SG Idol but got sore throat that day. She said,"Heaven not allow her to sing,it's fate." On the break up day, She told me she wanna go back to the music school after hearing her friends whom she introduced them into the music school,got contract signed,her heart itchy,i know. I allowed...But she add in ,"If anything happen in future, don't blame each other." I got really upset to hear that!!! She can try giving up for both of us,why can't i try??</div>

When you love her and pursue her during the courtship, do you even mind her anything? Say, her attitude? her personal problems and her way of handling things?<br><br>No doubt you had put in your effort in the relationship and yet tasted only failure and sourness. Your post had told us of how a girl you love has grown up and transform into someone who only care for herself and do not listen to your words. But is that how she is? For what we know is your side of story and i dont doubt your view of the situation. But did you try to know her thinking and why she was doing that?<br><br>Its not easy to gone thru a relationship when serving ns.. both of you 2 sure have to give in perhaps not 100%.. but 99% of the time as love is very fragile.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yah,it may be my own side story,but i've never flirt around with girls,i've never beat her,she has family problems,i gave her money to eat. During the break up, she told me I'm the one and only she love most . I ask if she's coming back to me in future,she said yes. I was really lost that time, she keep doing mistakes which make me angry ,i scold her means i care for her. I'm not Big-man-minded,I somehow allow her to go out with her friends,have her freedoms, but not disco with ppl i dunno. To her, she only cannot tahan my scoldings. I've do so much,i forgave her pass...she can't forgive my temper. Ppl say she can't change the out-going,playful, naive character. Once, she went ktv pub with her friends,after she sang,there's a guy came forward to her asking for her contact telling her that he also like to sing maybe next time jio her to sing. That guy is one of my friend's younger bro,all gangsters. Of cos i worried...i ask her why she so naive? she said he just want to jio her go ktv only...what if that guy drugged her..then..????<br>Who knows? Not i wanna be hot-temper,it's her that keep increasing my stress.. I can see that she really loves me before,but this time totally change to another person? I'm really puzzled. Just because of the 5 yrs contact? Scare i cannot wait? But her way of breaking up is too tragedy. I don't accept her to be singer cos i don't wanna see her stress,ppl always say,"been a singer/actor,You smile on stage but cry behind." When i wanna accept,she told me she gave up singing. Now say she wanna go back,cos her friends had sign the contracts,her heart itchy. I wanna try accept,she added in "if anything happen in future,don't blame each other." She had plan to leave me already...how can she do that??<br></div>

As a bf, you have to protect her, but she is like a wilful bird - she hasn't seen much of the world and wished to leave that sheltered life of 3 years in this good relationship with you, to sacrifice them for another form of lifestyle.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Thanks,I know I'm too possessive. But i'll be happy to see her with a very nice good decent guy. I'm not saying i'm good,at least i wanna protect her,care for her,love her.I already her to do what she wants. Just telling my sorrow here, and worried for her still. </span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Time change, people change.<br><br>There are external influences that she is absorbing and that gradually mould her mindset. Wanna be a star? Just a little information, I am currently working within the music line and yes, I do see such people around. Her dream is a dream many people adore, but as to sacrifice everthing - she is prepare to leave that safety shore you set up to pursue another life. (Actually, sekali I know her)<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Sorry that you don't have to know her,cos i dunt wanna let anyone know who is she. Some ppl might think it's ok for her to choose her way. But still some will think she's selfish,cold-hearted. I don't wanna have anyone have any attitude against her,hope you understand. </span><br><br>Only experience and reality can be her tutor. You wanna impart; she is not listening. Let her go. Let the cruel side of reality burn and fry her life - by then, do not be soft hearted. [b]Afterall, she chose the road she wanna walk</strong>. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br><span style="color: blue;">What you mean don't be soft-hearted? I don't wanna see her suffering. When i love someone,i'll forgive whatever she did,cos i may have mistakes too. I did say harsh words during the break,cos i'm lost,cannot control. But i guess it's better,she'll then be more concentrate on her things .</span><br>Cheers      [/b]</blockquote><span style="color: #444444;"></span><br><br><span style="color: #444444;"></span><span style="color: #444444;"></span></div>
