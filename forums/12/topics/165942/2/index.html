One down all down. At least with 6 companies, one down and you still have 5 other companies. Please think before you comment on this.<br><br>But I do agree that he should at least find out what is her interest and from there try to woo her or impress her with his thoughtfullness. But then again, a rich woman like her, can he afford her kind of lifestyle if she happens to be interested in a higher level kind of lifestyle?<br><br>From what I read on what he said, more likely that her "xi xin" is just purely an elder sister towards a younger bro. Nothing more than that. And more ever, at this young age with such success, I won't be surprise that she's more interested in expanding her business career than to spend time on boyfriend. Hoenstly, who can really tolorate having a partner who's ever busy with work and no time to spend with them?<br><br>Then again, unless he's a talanted guy who can help her alot in building her business, then maybe there's a higher chance that they might end up together but it sounds more like a business relationship to me than a love relationship.<br><br>Short to say, if I'm him, I'll probably just use a needle and burst the bubble myself before I land myself in deep grieve. I'll rather spend more time building up my own career and stable my own life before I'll ever consider having a relationship with a high social status woman.<br><br>Ok, I'm gloating. I have a gf now who loves me but I'm penniless. But at least now I know what is it that I have to do. Nothing is more important than building up my career now so that I can give my gf a more comfortable life. I don't think I want my gf to suffer with me.</div>

No pubs, no nightlife and there isn't even a cinema and the nearest cinema is 3hrs drive away. It took me less than 3 days to fell in love with the place there. At least during my three weeks there, I don't have to think of where to go or what to do during the night where most of the shops are closed and only a few coffeeshops are open. I'm not in the least bored and in fact I felt relieved. I can indulge myself to do my writtings and readings during the night.<br><br>If you think you are boring, then I think I'm at the edge.</div>

It's an entirely different scenario.</div></blockquote>I know running 10 companies at the same time can be done, you can even drive with your feet if you want to.

SPH also diversified into properties, why didn't the owners or the government just setup another company? one of the reason is that they have to transfer the money to another account and fall under another tax bracket, and also pay more taxes during the transfer and taxes on cashing out the profits. 10 companies, simply does not make sense.

Who's talking about setting up a company for a sound blaster and another company for a speaker and another company for whatever it is?<br><br>I'm talking about a boss who owns different operating Business and companies. One hotel, One printing, One seafood resturant, Two pubs, and few others different companies which I can't remember what business. You see the different between what you are saying and what I'm saying now? Do you see any link in those business? I'm talking about business...NOT PRODUCTS OR SERVICES!!!
