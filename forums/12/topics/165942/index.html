BUT ...  in most cases.. it doesnt last long. Talents n Determination.. mmm.. true. But i would think more of.. Understanding and then able to make her see the possibilities of him. Women at that age would want a very understanding partner and someone that can be there to listen to her stress. He is still serving NS n it will take years to be able to make her see his value.

But you've to face the reality.<br><br>Just ask yourself these few questions:<br><br>1] When will you complete your NS?<br>2] When will you step into the working society?<br>3] How long does it takes for you to have a stable career? 3years? 4years?<br>4] What can you give her if she's your gf?<br>5] What confidence level can you give and provide her?<br>6] Anything can happened within this 4yrs, i.e. relationship turning sour.<br>7] So, if let's say something real bad will to happen within these 3~4yrs, you'll be ~25yrs old but she'll be ~30yrs old. You're still young by then, but she's not. You can look for another girl easily, but can she do the same as you?<br><br>Have you thought of those questions above? If not, it'll be meant to perceive that you're a selfish person, as you think all for yourself, sparing no thoughts for her future and feelings.<br><br>All these simply leads to INSECURITY which you can't provide her with.<br><br>So, i would suggest you giving up the idea of being togather/relationship with her.
