He may think how will his place in ur heart be affected?<br><br>At the same time, why do u insist him to tell u? I mean like what others say, u dun mind so how come u ask and wans him to tell u?

            <div class='col-md body'>somehow girls tend to link watching porn with infidelity. They will extrapolate this (hu si luan siang) and think that if guys watch porn, they are fantasising about other woman and thus, have the intention to cheat on you. Maybe, as you said, this is cos of insecurity..<br><br>I rem when my gf found porn on my computer, she totally freaked out!! I had to spend days to pacify her.. and still, it din work. Eventually, it was her fren who saved me. cos she asked her guy fren about his opinion and he somehow convinced her that most guys watch porn.. For a guy, it's 2 different part of the brain, where watching porn does not mean that you will love some one less..<br><br>It's a different way that guys and girls are wired, i suppose. As long as the guy doesn't become too obsessed with it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If your issue is about the porn and his refusal to admit it, you can try to confront him in an indirect and non-aggressive manner. Maybe in the throes of passion, ask him to show and demonstrate some moves he learnt from porn? Or, in the middle of a conversation, try to bring up the topic and ask him what fantasies he would like to try out with you in the sack. Don't ask him directly, e.g. "Have you watched porn before?". By asking questions that strongly hint that you already know his porn habits, I suppose the pressure placed on him will be less, and consequently he will be less fearful of revealing his innermost thoughts and desires to you like what a couple should be like.<br><br>However, if the real problem is something else in the relationship like negligence towards you (I hope not), I think you're just using his viewing of porn as a catalyst for your worries and frustration. If that's the case, you should be tackling the real issue at hand.<br><br>Don't give up on him so easily!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Not to mention that you're not really being fair to him to jump to such conclusions as to the possible actions he might take....?<br><br>You're probably a 'goody goody' sort of girl, and he thinks that you'll never be able to accept his sort of actions no matter what... Hence he insisted on lying to you...? Then again, people do often tell lies from time to time when there's a need to... It's not like he's really harbouring any real evil intentions while doing so...? In a relationship, it's often about 'give and take'... This bf of yours.. Or another one... Probably the same... Try to take things easy girl... Might be a long way to go...?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am extremely secure in myself, my partner and our relationship although I know he views pornographic material. It is never an issue of whether he loves me or whether it reflects negatively on his commitment or character. It is his male hormones on overdrive, acting out his sexual fantasy. On occassions, we<br>view these material together, express our sexual fantasies and role play it.<br>It is such a healthy avenue to be able to be open about sexuality, fantasty and share it with someone who loves me.</div>
