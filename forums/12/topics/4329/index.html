Just to share something...<br><br>when i was younger and full of nonsense.  I chased a younger girl who have been attached for 6 years, then we were like going together for a while but behind my back she was still seeing her ex.  Later, we broke off but the thing that stuck to my mind till today was what she said...<br><br>Me:  I don't see what i lose out to him other than my height.<br><br>She: Oh there's something u lose him.  "Tah bi jiao ting hua" translated means he's more obedient.<br><br>The morale of the story is "Don't be a third party, otherwise its gonna make a mess out of everybody's lives."  Hmmm... i think i still can be friends with her now but haven't seen her like for 7 years oredi.<br><br></div>

I would also think that it's a good idea... at least get to know each other better first before any thing serious happens.. and have to be sure that somethings are settled and nothing is in ur way then it will be good for any 2 pple to start a r/s.

            <div class='col-md body'>i think wat u ppl say make sense. But seriously, if u r in a r/s, do u really take yr own sweet time getting to know tat person until u really very sure tat u r ready? if u really like tat person u really let time tell? i duno. many of my fren don't cos he/she may jus be another person's gf/bf. Anyway despite him ahving gf, he still sms me every nite when he not wif gf. he did tell me not to sms him fr fri to sat nite cos he wif gf. Anyway like wat u ppl and wat i say earlier, treat him as my bro first.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ok to keep u guys update, we talk on fone yesterday. well..the conclusion is, we will not be able to sms each other everyday nor on the fone. It is jus not rite. Well he do not wan his gf to misunderstood and if his gf came to noe abt us, he will find it difficult to explain. Thus, we'll tok on fone once a while and meanwhile communicate via email. he says tat if we were to continue smsing, something is bound to happen, thus prevention is better than cure. Anyway i think he make sense. although i very much wan to be wif him, i do not wan him to treat me as sparetyre or to be a third party. Anyway i jus have to give him up and seriously, i do adore him for being so faithful to his gf...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I believe u can still maintain a platonic friendship. However, this measure has to be taken with great caution. I myself wouldn't like to lose a friend just because of such misunderstandings. You will need to draw the line between friendship and love distinctly. Think about it and maybe you will see the light.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
