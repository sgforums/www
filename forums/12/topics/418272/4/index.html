              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>okay, i have a gf for 1 1/2 years now. and from the start until
              now, she have never treated me nice or right.But in the past i
              usually tolerated it, for i love her alot and i believe deep down
              she loves me too, but now, im emotionally drained.</p>
              <p>In the beginning, while she was with me, she kept thinking of
              her ex-bf and need him to stay by her side like SMS her meet her
              often etc. to the extend of sending him i miss you so much kinda
              msges. At those times i wanted to leave, but she kept holding me
              back, saying she need me as well. We quarreled and fought over this
              but in the end, she gave him up, in that romantic kind of way. but
              theyare neutral friends now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After that issue, i thought everything was going to be fine but
              it was just the beginning. As we grew closer, her true colours came
              out. She would attitude me or not respond to me talking to her for
              absolutely no reason or for minor reasons like for eg. me giving
              her the wrong color of the towels or if i cant hear what she is
              saying cause sometimes she talks really dam soft. We have
              occasional quarrels over this and the cycle always goes like this.
              She starts throwing tantrum &gt; me Confronting her &gt; She throws
              even bigger longer tantrums &gt; until i have to apologize and wait
              for 3-7days til she cools down.</p>
              <p>Then, she got a part time job at the same company as me, but
              different working locations. Every morning, she would throw tantrum
              and give attitude because i am not ready preparing, or prepare
              slower than her every morning (She lives with me). and the reason
              she gives is I didnt pack her bag for her, or she is tired sleepy.
              Until i had enough, i started feeling numb and not giving a dam.
              but she noticed my change, i really wanted a clean break but she
              kept threatening me with suicide and stuff like that and kept
              forcing me to take off to accompany her but i really cant.until i
              quitted my job as i cannot take the pressure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After that incident, feeling guilty of the way i treated her
              during the phase in the above paragraph, i treated her even better
              than i used to, and no confrontation nothing if she starts her
              nonsense. i just 'bao rong' embrace her. And she had never done
              anything for me before, even if i ask her to pass me a tissue
              something like that. this continued until recently.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today. For the past week she've been throwing tantrums in the
              morning, like that period of time she went to work (now shes
              studying) and throwing tantrums after school for being tired. i
              really cant take this anymore. until a few days ago, i couldnt take
              off on her off day(from private school), she started contacting her
              another ex-bf whom they had a physical r/s with. meaning just
              sexual. I couldnt take it. As i do not have any evidence, (she
              would say, we are just friends what now.) i cant say anything, but
              because of me not being able to accompany her for one day. she have
              to do this to me. Dear forummers, what should i do????</p>

              </p><p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> I will brutely honest: as much as you have painted yourself an exiguous picture of a victim suppressed by his gf - there are also significant returns you are getting out of this - a 'familiar' relationship of 20 months living together and probably regular sex. Seemed like you are experiencing poignant frustration and your so called 'sacrifices' are somewhat 'a bad trade off', which you probably find that this deal might be 'overvalued' and you paying more than the initial forecast. </p>
              <p>Therefore, even subjected to overwhelming trivial nonsenses hurled by her, or greater issues with her ex, you quietly accept the outcome (although not without protest or reluctancy).</p>
              <p>Blatantly, you are not happy in this relationship. But you accepted anyway.</p>
              <p>Her series of tests are not random; these are exhibited because the men before you largely conditioned her to believe that it is her prerogative to behave as such; in simple, she is 'rewarded' in some ways for displaying bad attitude and reinforced by unconscious habit and personality - changing that might be akin to moving mountains. You can start by taking away small stones, but chances are, you might have died of heatstroke before you can witness transformation.</p>
              <p>You have to decide if this is an issue with compatibility or you are simply staying put because of habitual reasoning. Only then, you will know what you want to do about it and figure out your plans on how to go about executing it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>It could be either:</p>
              <p>(i) She is an indecisive person when it comes to heart's matter.</p>
              <p>(ii)She needs pampering and attention from you, when you can't do so, she thought you've somebody else in your heart and hence reacting in such a way. She could have low self esteem and fixated with insecurities. </p>
              <p>Tell her honestly and straight forward that you feel uncomfortable that she kept contacting her ex-bfs. Tell her how you've felt. Perhaps she doesn't know and not aware that you're feeling unhappy about it. It's best not to bottle the unhappiness inside your heart. After relating to her all these, hopefully she would know how to rectify the problem if she genuinely cares about you.</p>

              <p>I really believe that you love this girl very much and I respect that.</p>
              <p>Sadly your gf does not treat you as her true love.</p>
              <p>I had a friend just like you and your gf, he lasted 12 long and painfull years.</p>
              <p>In the end he caught his gf making out in the bushes with his best friend.</p>
              <p>When he yell at his gf and asked her why she did it. She just say "whatever" and she just countinue on having fun.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To TS if you can stand your gf having sex with another guy in front of you and feel nothing about it and can pretend that is normal for a gf to act like this, then I can only say good luck and will ask others here not to waste their time on you.</p>

              <p><strong>Btw my friend jump and died cos he could not take it and the gf just laugh at him for being such a fool and went on with her life. </strong></p>
              <p>I do not wish to see another bro suffer like my friend did.</p>
