              <p>Ts,</p>
              <p>I dont know how old you are and it is palpable that love is non-existent excepting the mutual benefit scheme that both of u accrued from going into these so-called relationship. The scheme is not working and it is bound to flounder.</p>
              <p>Getting out is easy but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">unlearning</span> is essential. She is not wrong, you are not wrong. Two heads (minds) can only compromise and <em>try </em>to relate. In other words, use and be used like things and put aside. Relationship is a thing - dead. It is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only alive</span> when two persons relate.</p>
              <p>Sadly, heads collide (egos!) and hearts relate. Love abides and always does absenting reasons and fears. Otherwise, it is not love but something else interpreted as love or the needs/expectations masquerading as love.</p>
              <p>Being <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">self-honest</span></em> and it may avail you of ''answers''.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>okay, i have a gf for 1 1/2 years now. and from the start until now, she have never treated me nice or right.But in the past i usually tolerated it, for i love her alot and i believe deep down she loves me too, but now, im emotionally drained.</p>
              <p>In the beginning, while she was with me, she kept thinking of her ex-bf and need him to stay by her side like SMS her meet her often etc. to the extend of sending him i miss you so much kinda msges. At those times i wanted to leave, but she kept holding me back, saying she need me as well. We quarreled and fought over this but in the end, she gave him up, in that romantic kind of way. but theyare neutral friends now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After that issue, i thought everything was going to be fine but it was just the beginning. As we grew closer, her true colours came out. She would attitude me or not respond to me talking to her for absolutely no reason or for minor reasons like for eg. me giving her the wrong color of the towels or if i cant hear what she is saying cause sometimes she talks really dam soft. We have occasional quarrels over this and the cycle always goes like this. She starts throwing tantrum &gt; me Confronting her &gt; She throws even bigger longer tantrums &gt; until i have to apologize and wait for 3-7days til she cools down.</p>
              <p>Then, she got a part time job at the same company as me, but different working locations. Every morning, she would throw tantrum and give attitude because i am not ready preparing, or prepare slower than her every morning (She lives with me). and the reason she gives is I didnt pack her bag for her, or she is tired sleepy. Until i had enough, i started feeling numb and not giving a dam. but she noticed my change, i really wanted a clean break but she kept threatening me with suicide and stuff like that and kept forcing me to take off to accompany her but i really cant.until i quitted my job as i cannot take the pressure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After that incident, feeling guilty of the way i treated her during the phase in the above paragraph, i treated her even better than i used to, and no confrontation nothing if she starts her nonsense. i just 'bao rong' embrace her. And she had never done anything for me before, even if i ask her to pass me a tissue something like that. this continued until recently.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today. For the past week she've been throwing tantrums in the morning, like that period of time she went to work (now shes studying) and throwing tantrums after school for being tired. i really cant take this anymore. until a few days ago, i couldnt take off on her off day(from private school), she started contacting her another ex-bf whom they had a physical r/s with. meaning just sexual. I couldnt take it. As i do not have any evidence, (she would say, we are just friends what now.) i cant say anything, but because of me not being able to accompany her for one day. she have to do this to me. Dear forummers, what should i do????</p>

              <p>5. Very likely she will sleep with her ex-BFs even after married to u!</p>
              <p>6.  I dun think she loves u at all....she obviously need her ex-BFs more than u.</p>
              <p>In short, ditch her fast before she hurts u further.</p>

              <p>okay, i have a gf for 1 1/2 years now. and from the start until
              now, she have never treated me nice or right.But in the past i
              usually tolerated it, for i love her alot and i believe deep down
              she loves me too, but now, im emotionally drained.</p>
              <p>In the beginning, while she was with me, she kept thinking of
              her ex-bf and need him to stay by her side like SMS her meet her
              often etc. to the extend of sending him i miss you so much kinda
              msges. At those times i wanted to leave, but she kept holding me
              back, saying she need me as well. We quarreled and fought over this
              but in the end, she gave him up, in that romantic kind of way. but
              theyare neutral friends now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After that issue, i thought everything was going to be fine but
              it was just the beginning. As we grew closer, her true colours came
              out. She would attitude me or not respond to me talking to her for
              absolutely no reason or for minor reasons like for eg. me giving
              her the wrong color of the towels or if i cant hear what she is
              saying cause sometimes she talks really dam soft. We have
              occasional quarrels over this and the cycle always goes like this.
              She starts throwing tantrum &gt; me Confronting her &gt; She throws
              even bigger longer tantrums &gt; until i have to apologize and wait
              for 3-7days til she cools down.</p>
              <p>Then, she got a part time job at the same company as me, but
              different working locations. Every morning, she would throw tantrum
              and give attitude because i am not ready preparing, or prepare
              slower than her every morning (She lives with me). and the reason
              she gives is I didnt pack her bag for her, or she is tired sleepy.
              Until i had enough, i started feeling numb and not giving a dam.
              but she noticed my change, i really wanted a clean break but she
              kept threatening me with suicide and stuff like that and kept
              forcing me to take off to accompany her but i really cant.until i
              quitted my job as i cannot take the pressure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After that incident, feeling guilty of the way i treated her
              during the phase in the above paragraph, i treated her even better
              than i used to, and no confrontation nothing if she starts her
              nonsense. i just 'bao rong' embrace her. And she had never done
              anything for me before, even if i ask her to pass me a tissue
              something like that. this continued until recently.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today. For the past week she've been throwing tantrums in the
              morning, like that period of time she went to work (now shes
              studying) and throwing tantrums after school for being tired. i
              really cant take this anymore. until a few days ago, i couldnt take
              off on her off day(from private school), she started contacting her
              another ex-bf whom they had a physical r/s with. meaning just
              sexual. I couldnt take it. As i do not have any evidence, (she
              would say, we are just friends what now.) i cant say anything, but
              because of me not being able to accompany her for one day. she have
              to do this to me. Dear forummers, what should i do????</p>
