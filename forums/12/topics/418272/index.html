              <p>okay, i have a gf for 1 1/2 years now. and from the start until now, she have never treated me nice or right.But in the past i usually tolerated it, for i love her alot and i believe deep down she loves me too, but now, im emotionally drained.</p>
              <p>In the beginning, while she was with me, she kept thinking of her ex-bf and need him to stay by her side like SMS her meet her often etc. to the extend of sending him i miss you so much kinda msges. At those times i wanted to leave, but she kept holding me back, saying she need me as well. We quarreled and fought over this but in the end, she gave him up, in that romantic kind of way. but theyare neutral friends now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After that issue, i thought everything was going to be fine but it was just the beginning. As we grew closer, her true colours came out. She would attitude me or not respond to me talking to her for absolutely no reason or for minor reasons like for eg. me giving her the wrong color of the towels or if i cant hear what she is saying cause sometimes she talks really dam soft. We have occasional quarrels over this and the cycle always goes like this. She starts throwing tantrum &gt; me Confronting her &gt; She throws even bigger longer tantrums &gt; until i have to apologize and wait for 3-7days til she cools down.</p>
              <p>Then, she got a part time job at the same company as me, but different working locations. Every morning, she would throw tantrum and give attitude because i am not ready preparing, or prepare slower than her every morning (She lives with me). and the reason she gives is I didnt pack her bag for her, or she is tired sleepy. Until i had enough, i started feeling numb and not giving a dam. but she noticed my change, i really wanted a clean break but she kept threatening me with suicide and stuff like that and kept forcing me to take off to accompany her but i really cant.until i quitted my job as i cannot take the pressure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After that incident, feeling guilty of the way i treated her during the phase in the above paragraph, i treated her even better than i used to, and no confrontation nothing if she starts her nonsense. i just 'bao rong' embrace her. And she had never done anything for me before, even if i ask her to pass me a tissue something like that. this continued until recently.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today. For the past week she've been throwing tantrums in the morning, like that period of time she went to work (now shes studying) and throwing tantrums after school for being tired. i really cant take this anymore. until a few days ago, i couldnt take off on her off day(from private school), she started contacting her another ex-bf whom they had a physical r/s with. meaning just sexual. I couldnt take it. As i do not have any evidence, (she would say, we are just friends what now.) i cant say anything, but because of me not being able to accompany her for one day. she have to do this to me. Dear forummers, what should i do????</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>Very high chance no end result in this r/s. Secondly, I hate girls who throw tantrums. This is usually a case of lack of self confidence.

              <p>Okay thanks. I will consider the break up but i need to know the answer.</p>

              <p>because in my opinion if she deep down somewhere truly loves me, i wont let her go. its hard to find 2 person who loves each other</p>
              <p>anyway i really treat her 100% best, sacrifices, love everything i gave her. so why wont she put me as the best in her heart</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and seriously ive seen all her ex and everything, I have to admit im hotter than all of them. so not bragging, but ive actually trounce every single man in her life, but why she still treats me like this?</p>

              <p>Well sit down and talk to her if she is interested to work on the issues in the relationship as much as you wish to. Make it clear you still love her but she needs to grow up.</p>
              <p>However, if she refuses or does not want to work out the issues, then there isn't any point trying alone on your side. How long can you be the nanny of a spoilt thoughtless brat?</p>

              <p>A relationship is supposed to be blissful and full of happiness. Not agonizing and torturing. I believe it is time to let her go. She wants to go f*%k around with her ex-boyfriends, by all means let her go do that. Don't be fooled by her words and your own feelings. Think with your brain, not with your heart! </p>
              <p>In a nutshell, she will not be happy with you or any other guy in the long run simply because her attitude sucks! You know it yourself. If not, why would your thread title be "My gf has a horrible attitude"???</p>

              <p>okay, i have a gf for 1 1/2 years now. and from the start until
              now, she have never treated me nice or right.But in the past i
              usually tolerated it, for i love her alot and i believe deep down
              she loves me too, but now, im emotionally drained.</p>
              <p>In the beginning, while she was with me, she kept thinking of
              her ex-bf and need him to stay by her side like SMS her meet her
              often etc. to the extend of sending him i miss you so much kinda
              msges. At those times i wanted to leave, but she kept holding me
              back, saying she need me as well. We quarreled and fought over this
              but in the end, she gave him up, in that romantic kind of way. but
              theyare neutral friends now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After that issue, i thought everything was going to be fine but
              it was just the beginning. As we grew closer, her true colours came
              out. She would attitude me or not respond to me talking to her for
              absolutely no reason or for minor reasons like for eg. me giving
              her the wrong color of the towels or if i cant hear what she is
              saying cause sometimes she talks really dam soft. We have
              occasional quarrels over this and the cycle always goes like this.
              She starts throwing tantrum &gt; me Confronting her &gt; She throws
              even bigger longer tantrums &gt; until i have to apologize and wait
              for 3-7days til she cools down.</p>
              <p>Then, she got a part time job at the same company as me, but
              different working locations. Every morning, she would throw tantrum
              and give attitude because i am not ready preparing, or prepare
              slower than her every morning (She lives with me). and the reason
              she gives is I didnt pack her bag for her, or she is tired sleepy.
              Until i had enough, i started feeling numb and not giving a dam.
              but she noticed my change, i really wanted a clean break but she
              kept threatening me with suicide and stuff like that and kept
              forcing me to take off to accompany her but i really cant.until i
              quitted my job as i cannot take the pressure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After that incident, feeling guilty of the way i treated her
              during the phase in the above paragraph, i treated her even better
              than i used to, and no confrontation nothing if she starts her
              nonsense. i just 'bao rong' embrace her. And she had never done
              anything for me before, even if i ask her to pass me a tissue
              something like that. this continued until recently.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today. For the past week she've been throwing tantrums in the
              morning, like that period of time she went to work (now shes
              studying) and throwing tantrums after school for being tired. i
              really cant take this anymore. until a few days ago, i couldnt take
              off on her off day(from private school), she started contacting her
              another ex-bf whom they had a physical r/s with. meaning just
              sexual. I couldnt take it. As i do not have any evidence, (she
              would say, we are just friends what now.) i cant say anything, but
              because of me not being able to accompany her for one day. she have
              to do this to me. Dear forummers, what should i do????</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>SERIOUS ANSWERS ONLY PLS...</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Have you ever considered why she has so many ex-boyfriends? The answer should be pretty clear now.</p>
              <p>You should end the relationship and not be threatened by her threats. She has probably threatened to kill herself to a number of her ex-bf while she is in a relationship with them, and you can see that she is still alive and well. On the contrary, you are alive but not well.</p>
              <p> Some men are horrible. They dump girls like garbage. But clearly your case is much different from that, and if you allow yourself to be a anger-venting mechanism any longer, I have confidence that the relationship will end in a very horrible way than it will now.</p>
              <p>And just as shrodingercat mentioned, you are a boyfriend, not a father. Even a father does not deserve to be treated like this by his daughter.</p>

              <p>IMHO, if a person who is not mature enough place keeping an at least cordial relationship over his/her own feelings is more trouble than they are worth. Cos snowball effect makes things worse.</p>
              <p>It just seems that you are like a float. For her to hang on to until a rescue ship comes by.</p>
              <p>If you cant reconcilate with such behaviour and basket of values/beliefs. Its more prudent to end it.</p>
