              <p>Girls will  cry father cry mother and play victim when it happens to them. And yet this is something they themselves do. Its more prudent to look after your own interests first. Ad treat courtship as an audition. A test of goodness of fit.</p>

              <p><em>"But there was something strange that happened last night, she treated me fairly better than average when i asked her 'what are you so mad about? she shouted at me nothing! and a few hours later, 360degree change."</em></p>
              <p>Whoa man.</p>
              <p>You are looking at some personality disorder (bi-polar, OCD ??) here. One who has little control over her feelings. She has an extremely sensitive fuse and a very short one at that. A simple remark would set her off. Some thing like "Ai ya! Why don't you take bus No. 14?" and she will snap at you and scold you in public. And if you try to tell her it is an innocent remark, the quarrel will escalate with historical incidents. Then later she will talk to you as if nothing happened. You will never know what can be said to her and what not to say. And if she gives you something to eat, you better eat it, or she will take it that you hate her and there'll be another temper tantrum.</p>
              <p>Don't be fooled by the turn around, she is sick. And can maul you one day if her thoughts snowball over insignificant matters.</p>
              <p>You been warned.</p>

              <p>okay, i have a gf for 1 1/2 years now. and from the start until now, she have never treated me nice or right.But in the past i usually tolerated it, for i love her alot and i believe deep down she loves me too, but now, im emotionally drained.</p>
              <p>In the beginning, while she was with me, she kept thinking of her ex-bf and need him to stay by her side like SMS her meet her often etc. to the extend of sending him i miss you so much kinda msges. At those times i wanted to leave, but she kept holding me back, saying she need me as well. We quarreled and fought over this but in the end, she gave him up, in that romantic kind of way. but theyare neutral friends now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After that issue, i thought everything was going to be fine but it was just the beginning. As we grew closer, her true colours came out. She would attitude me or not respond to me talking to her for absolutely no reason or for minor reasons like for eg. me giving her the wrong color of the towels or if i cant hear what she is saying cause sometimes she talks really dam soft. We have occasional quarrels over this and the cycle always goes like this. She starts throwing tantrum &gt; me Confronting her &gt; She throws even bigger longer tantrums &gt; until i have to apologize and wait for 3-7days til she cools down.</p>
              <p>Then, she got a part time job at the same company as me, but different working locations. Every morning, she would throw tantrum and give attitude because i am not ready preparing, or prepare slower than her every morning (She lives with me). and the reason she gives is I didnt pack her bag for her, or she is tired sleepy. Until i had enough, i started feeling numb and not giving a dam. but she noticed my change, i really wanted a clean break but she kept threatening me with suicide and stuff like that and kept forcing me to take off to accompany her but i really cant.until i quitted my job as i cannot take the pressure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After that incident, feeling guilty of the way i treated her during the phase in the above paragraph, i treated her even better than i used to, and no confrontation nothing if she starts her nonsense. i just 'bao rong' embrace her. And she had never done anything for me before, even if i ask her to pass me a tissue something like that. this continued until recently.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Today. For the past week she've been throwing tantrums in the morning, like that period of time she went to work (now shes studying) and throwing tantrums after school for being tired. i really cant take this anymore. until a few days ago, i couldnt take off on her off day(from private school), she started contacting her another ex-bf whom they had a physical r/s with. meaning just sexual. I couldnt take it. As i do not have any evidence, (she would say, we are just friends what now.) i cant say anything, but because of me not being able to accompany her for one day. she have to do this to me. Dear forummers, what should i do????</p>

              <p>I had a friend just like you and your gf, he lasted 12 long and painfull years.</p>

              <p>To TS if you can stand your gf having sex with another guy in front of you and feel nothing about it and can pretend that is normal for a gf to act like this, then I can only say good luck and will ask others here not to waste their time on you.</p>

              <p>Okay thanks. I will consider the break up but i need to know the answer.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>because in my opinion if she deep down somewhere truly loves me, i wont let her go. its hard to find 2 person who loves each other</p>
              <p>anyway i really treat her 100% best, sacrifices, love everything i gave her. so why wont she put me as the best in her heart</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and seriously ive seen all her ex and everything, I have to admit im hotter than all of them. so not bragging, but ive actually trounce every single man in her life, but why she still treats me like this?</p>

              <p>Anywayz I think your gf has some issues that you don't know about.</p>
              <p>Until you get to the root of the prob you won't know how to deal with her.</p>
              <p>It'll be difficult, but if you really want to be with her and think it's worth it, then this would be one solution to consider.</p>

              <p><em>"But there was something strange that happened last night, she treated me fairly better than average when i asked her 'what are you so mad about? she shouted at me nothing! and a few hours later, 360degree change."</em></p>
              <p>Whoa man.</p>
              <p>You are looking at some personality disorder (bi-polar, OCD ??) here. One who has little control over her feelings. She has an extremely sensitive fuse and a very short one at that. A simple remark would set her off. Some thing like "Ai ya! Why don't you take bus No. 14?" and she will snap at you and scold you in public. And if you try to tell her it is an innocent remark, the quarrel will escalate with historical incidents. Then later she will talk to you as if nothing happened. You will never know what can be said to her and what not to say. And if she gives you something to eat, you better eat it, or she will take it that you hate her and there'll be another temper tantrum.</p>
              <p>Don't be fooled by the turn around, she is sick. And can maul you one day if her thoughts snowball over insignificant matters.</p>
              <p>You been warned.</p>
