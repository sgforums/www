              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Girl knew Guy from a online dating site. After a week of
                  chatting and viewing of pictures, Guy asked girl out for a short
                  meet-up</p>
              <p>They met shortly and girl felt that guy was a nice guy. It was a
                  normal cafe meeting with a normal short conversation, but girl felt
                  that guy wanted to leave like 30 minutes into the conversation</p>
              <p>Guy  wrote in his online dating profile that he
                  dislike shallow people and girl  thought that he was sincere
                  in knowing more people, and definitely not the shallow type.</p>
              <p>After the meet up (which ended rather shortly), girl did not
                  hear from guy . Guy did not bother to msn or sms her after the
                  date. </p>
              <p>Girl however still have a good impression of guy and decided to
                  contact him. Guy  replied politely but kept telling girl 
                  that he is currently super busy with his work and wouldnt be able
                  to even chat with her even on msn.</p>
              <p>Girl told guy that she wants to know him better. BUt guy 
                  turned her down flatly by sayin that he finds that there is no
                  chemistry between them and they cant click. Girl  told him
                  that it is impossible to tell whether you have chemistry with a
                  person from one date, but guy said he could tell very accurately.
                  Guy then went on to say he just wanna remain as friends with girl
                  and that he would never consider her as a lifepartner. He even went
                  far to say that he does not want to know her better, and would only
                  wanna be friends with her now and forever. Which means. girl as
                  totally no chance..</p>
              <p>Girl doesnt know why the guy is giving her such an absolute NO.
                  its like guy would never ever like her or consider her but just see
                  her pemanently as a friend. Girl ask is it due to her looks. Guy
                  claimed no, and that he only goes for feelings. Guy said girl looks
                  ok, and doesnt know why girl think he is rejecting her on the basis
                  of looks</p>
              <p>Under this situation, what could be the real reasons why Guy is
                  totally rejecting girl just after a meeting?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>pretty obvious that the guy just judge her by the cover.well, its also common that this guy just couldnt accept her for the way she it or the way she looks, so yeah.just forget him.its pointless because he is just way too shallow, predicting that his accuracy is 'accurate'. dont be with such guy luh, they bring you no good.since moore and more guys are becoming so judgemental, tell him to zip his virgina.</p>

              <p>So have you given a thought about how you've behaved or are you still trying to comfort yourself with the excuse that he's "probably having super high expectations"? Cause from what I've read in your replies, you seem to be ignoring all other aspects when they've been offered for suggestions and only harping on about the physical looks issue.</p>

              <p>one thing you also don't know is that a lot of girls also reject guys very harshly. Rejection is part and parcel of life. You simply cannot avoid it. What you are doing is fighting for your ego only. When the guy does the rejection, people say he's insecure/superficial/whatever. And then, suddenly it becomes guy's fault for being a guy. Guess what? The same applies to girls too. Girls DO look at the guys if he's handsome enough for her. That's reality.</p>
              <p>Remember, it takes 2 to tango. So, drop that ego. He has to make a decision fast and has done so. Don't take it personally. Respect his decision and move on.  </p>
