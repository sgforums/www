              <p>Girl knew Guy from a online dating site. After a week of chatting and viewing of pictures, Guy asked girl out for a short meet-up</p>
              <p>They met shortly and girl felt that guy was a nice guy. It was a normal cafe meeting with a normal short conversation, but girl felt that guy wanted to leave like 30 minutes into the conversation</p>
              <p>Guy  wrote in his online dating profile that he dislike shallow people and girl  thought that he was sincere in knowing more people, and definitely not the shallow type.</p>
              <p>After the meet up (which ended rather shortly), girl did not hear from guy . Guy did not bother to msn or sms her after the date. </p>
              <p>Girl however still have a good impression of guy and decided to contact him. Guy  replied politely but kept telling girl  that he is currently super busy with his work and wouldnt be able to even chat with her even on msn.</p>
              <p>Girl told guy that she wants to know him better. BUt guy  turned her down flatly by sayin that he finds that there is no chemistry between them and they cant click. Girl  told him that it is impossible to tell whether you have chemistry with a person from one date, but guy said he could tell very accurately. Guy then went on to say he just wanna remain as friends with girl and that he would never consider her as a lifepartner. He even went far to say that he does not want to know her better, and would only wanna be friends with her now and forever. Which means. girl as totally no chance..</p>
              <p>Girl doesnt know why the guy is giving her such an absolute NO. its like guy would never ever like her or consider her but just see her pemanently as a friend. Girl ask is it due to her looks. Guy claimed no, and that he only goes for feelings. Guy said girl looks ok, and doesnt know why girl think he is rejecting her on the basis of looks</p>
              <p>Under this situation, what could be the real reasons why Guy is totally rejecting girl just after a meeting?</p>

              <p>i kind of think point 2 is possible.<br><br>it may be her laughter... or her desires for the future. can scare a guy one. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>probably looks. girl picture online usually is the best chosen one.</p>
              <p>and pictures dont show the whole thing. maybe the picture was only of the face. could be she too short or fat.</p>
              <p>if the girl is 30 cm shorter than the guy, its looks totally mismatched.</p>
              <p>cant be personality or character since they chatted like a week and this is enough to get a rough impression of the other. just my 2 cents</p>
