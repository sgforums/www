              <p>Because Bigthumbfoot, the girls a 3, the guys a 6. You cant go 2 points over what you are. Its just against nature. Lol, dont take me seriously, i totally quoted that from the movie "She's Out of my League". </p>
              <p>Hey guys i developed a new rating scale, its 8-9. You rate girls from 8.0-9.0. So the girl above would be a 8.3. genius.</p>

              <p>Listen bigthumbfoot, places like SDU is at least something better than online. U can get to see the person face to face and know their true color. Take my word for it, dont trust anyone from online. They can be 42 year old diguise as a 18 year old. U should go out with friends and mingle with them or join any social activities. More bonding and better understanding of each other.</p>

              <p>I'm really sorry if im being too direct or mean but i dont quite see the excitement of online dating. Its like to me its a desparate attempt to get into fast relationship. I have no problem if widening my social circle thru online but dating or finding bf thru online isnt my cup of hot chocolate in the morning.</p>
              <p>Listen bigthumbfoot, places like SDU is at least something better than online. U can get to see the person face to face and know their true color. Take my word for it, dont trust anyone from online. They can be 42 year old diguise as a 18 year old. U should go out with friends and mingle with them or join any social activities. More bonding and better understanding of each other.</p>

              <p>Girl knew Guy from a online dating site. After a week of chatting and viewing of pictures, Guy asked girl out for a short meet-up</p>
              <p>They met shortly and girl felt that guy was a nice guy. It was a normal cafe meeting with a normal short conversation, but girl felt that guy wanted to leave like 30 minutes into the conversation</p>
              <p>Guy  wrote in his online dating profile that he dislike shallow people and girl  thought that he was sincere in knowing more people, and definitely not the shallow type.</p>
              <p>After the meet up (which ended rather shortly), girl did not hear from guy . Guy did not bother to msn or sms her after the date. </p>
              <p>Girl however still have a good impression of guy and decided to contact him. Guy  replied politely but kept telling girl  that he is currently super busy with his work and wouldnt be able to even chat with her even on msn.</p>
              <p>Girl told guy that she wants to know him better. BUt guy  turned her down flatly by sayin that he finds that there is no chemistry between them and they cant click. Girl  told him that it is impossible to tell whether you have chemistry with a person from one date, but guy said he could tell very accurately. Guy then went on to say he just wanna remain as friends with girl and that he would never consider her as a lifepartner. He even went far to say that he does not want to know her better, and would only wanna be friends with her now and forever. Which means. girl as totally no chance..</p>
              <p>Girl doesnt know why the guy is giving her such an absolute NO. its like guy would never ever like her or consider her but just see her pemanently as a friend. Girl ask is it due to her looks. Guy claimed no, and that he only goes for feelings. Guy said girl looks ok, and doesnt know why girl think he is rejecting her on the basis of looks</p>
              <p>Under this situation, what could be the real reasons why Guy is totally rejecting girl just after a meeting?</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>The guy just wanted to test our his psychological mind tricks on the girl. By balantly rejecting the girl without providing any reason and behaving extremely dodgy about it, will no doubt make the girl more curious about the guy and sometimes the chase will become the chaser.</p>
              <p>Guys like this can only use such tricks on innocent-looking or stupid-looking girls that they think they have a good chance of success rate.</p>
              <p>Girls who encounter guys like this, should completely if not totally ignore that guy's smses, emails, phone calls and remain uncontactable for as long as it takes for the guy to come crawling back to her. Yes, they does that....guys are actually quite insecure creatures. They will panic and run around their rooms in circles when they realised that their plans have backfired and isn't working on the girls that they have targetted. And they have such fears of losing not just a girl, but any girl and all girls.</p>
              <p>So I will encourage all girls to hold onto your curiousity, go hang out with other guys/girls friends that appreciate you, so that you won't even waste a second of your time remembering your curiousity.</p>
              <p>Then patiently wait for that guy to crawl back to you, toyed with him cos he will give you everything just to make himself feel secure in his pursuit with you. But don't forget to dump him when you're sick of him, because guys like this are simply not the guys that you are looking for in your future.</p>
              <p>The guy will not even have asked for a meet-up if he isn't attracted to the girl in any ways. But it's different reasons for girls when they chose to meet up with the guy. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>I think it is extremely silly to jump to conclusions and offer unwarranted conjectures, such as saying that the guy was lying when he said it was not about her looks. What proof could you possibly have besides being the kind of shallow people who would do the same thing? Besides, they've already exchanged pictures online, so unless her pictures had her face in a paper bag or were grossly misrepresented/photoshopped to make her look normal when she looks like a monster in real life, chances are he won't be running away because of her looks.</p>
              <p>Anyway, Boy has already said there's no chemistry. Don't like means don't like 
              lah. Be a lady and respect his wishes. If you are not horribly disfigured or make people turn away with one look, chances are, it's not because of your looks. When it comes to physical attraction, it's true that better looking people are more in demand; however, the complete reverse is not true- i.e. plain/normal/boring people do not generally make people 'turn away' from them or make people will reject them. The only ones who would do that are extremely shallow and judgemental people.</p>
              <p>If birds of a feather flock together, then the chances of him not being a shallow person increases because you did mention that he likes people who aren't shallow. Usually people who like non-shallow people are people who (i) aren't shallow themselves or (ii) NEED someone who is not shallow because they are not very good looking /do not have much confidence in themselves.</p>
              <p>Being big sized is probably already an issue- it does not just affect girls, but guys as well. So he probably might not have much confidence in himself. People who don't have much confidence in themselves usually aim low because there's no point aiming high.</p>
              <p>Anyway, attraction between humans is a complex thing with varied schools of thoughts. Unless he is someone looking for a purely physical relationship (e.g. sex) and not something deeper, he would be judging you by how you look, and that doesn't just mean how pretty,  but how sexy you are. You are the best judge of what he is looking for in his online dating profile. Is there anything to suggest that he's looking for something purely physical and superficial? Or does he yearn for something more? If it's the latter, then rest assured that it's nothing to do with your looks, but how you make him feel. Maybe you're not funny, or mature, or easy going enough for him.</p>
              <p>Even so, you have to respect his decision. What he finds lacking doesn't mean you are inferior. It's just that he has different expectations and you don't happen to have them. Nothing personal, just business, ya noe? Find someone else who can appreciate you for who and what you are. It's not your loss anyway, since he's definitely not the kind of person you're can be happy with.</p>

              <p>My, my. What a response. Perhaps you'd like to take some time to cool down before trying to engage someone else in a discussion? you did mention that you were not in a good mood. Firstly, your questions don't make sense. What on earth are you talking about and where on earth did you presume such an implication? Maybe you need to chill first. Please do engage me in a more logical, understandable manner when you're more cool- and try to actually acknowledge points I've made in my post. Thanks. :)</p>
