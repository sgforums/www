Even though your heart tells you so? Would you mind being the smaller wife ? When I first read the first paragraph, I thought ok, maybe the boyfriend is really planning for the future.<br><br>Then in the 2nd paragraph, you said horrors of horrors... he's married! What are you doing with a married guy in the first place? Although I know logic cannot talk you out of your emotional attachment to him, you have to be clear he's a married man. In other words, does he love you or his wife? What if you are the wife and there's this invisible woman in the background who is seeing your husband? Would you like it? Stay clear of married people, man or woman. It's an unhealthy relationship.<br><br>Now this man deserves to get bashed. After what you did for him, he can simply say : "hey, it's over between us." and kick you aside like a soccer ball. Do you really think divorce is as simple as he says ? It involves a lot of cost especially in terms of money. If I were him, I might not even want to divorce, considering now if Im found out to be dating this woman, I can be accused of adultery, which will be even worse. All will be against me. Do you think I will want to get divorced after so much trouble I went through during marriage?<br><br>Actually I shouldn't have said so much. I could have just given you one advice. Date other guys who are single, eligible and available. You are already 26. Try to be sensible and mature. I believe there are still guys that will sweep off your feet, your Prince Charming.<br><br>Your situation has made me realise one fact of life: most girls will share a guy who is in demand than to be with a faithful loser.<br><br>doko</div>

I believe if a guy truly loves u, he will be responsible n do things with u having to ask.<br><br>Months ago, I think or guess his wife knew abt me n him. she say they needed to talk. I tot okie, why not let them talk and maybe they will finally wan to settle their divorce.. So i went away from his place.. went back my own place... to allow them to talk.<br><br>I came back to him the next day, he say wife will let him have house n will settle divorce anytime he's ready.<br><br>Thats not the worst, I knew tat she slept over. I was helping out with folding clothes when i discovered a pyjamas which do not belong to me,a wet toothbrush n an extra used towel... I fold it n left it on his bed. He saw it n jus kept it in the closet, WITHOUT saying a word. He knew wat i wanted to ask obviously.<br><br>He kept quiet, i kept quiet too.<br>Somehow i know something must have happened.. maybe they did their COUPLE things, myabe NOT. I feel tat he betrayed my trust n I'm so upset till now.. I smile at him, pretend i was happy..<br><br>Deep inside, i know i am not. I'm so damned hurt by his inability to explain things.

He is probably taking you for a fool for sticking to him for so long, and never even confront him about all these issues, instead just keeping them to yourself.<br><br>Wake up from this nightmare girl. He ain't worth your time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi there, leaving a relationship behind may not always be the solution to problems.<br><br>If you want to marry this guy eventually, co habitation leaves him zero incentive to take this relationship a notch higher (marriage).<br><br>Actually sometimes there are signs along the way whether a serious commitment is in store. Is he initiating plans for his future with you in mind?<br><br>***<br><br>What kind of job offer did you give up on? Do you think his demands were fair?<br><br>For example, itÂ’s understandable for him to demand that you forgo a premium pole dancer position at the local bar. Unreasonable if he is asking you to give up a 5K per month salary with Qatar.<br><br>***<br><br>Pushing him for a dateline on top of all his existing problems is not going to help. If he is fresh out of a broken marriage and dawdling in his career, giving him time alone to sort out the priorities in his life may be the right thing to do. Sometimes people need to do these things by themselves, for themselves. When he has a clear direction in his own life, it is likely heÂ’ll be in a better position to pursue a serious commitment with you.<br><br>For most people, agreeing to another lifetime commitment straight after divorce is the last thing thing they want.<br><br>***<br><br>Living together and doing mundane things for each other may be a duty born out of context of care and love. But if you find yourself smouldering in resentment day in and out and not enjoying it at all, why do you do it still? If you cannot bear the idea of being home bound at this point, can you bear the dread 10 years from now?<br><br>This guy, and other better guys out there are not going to magically solve lifeÂ’s problems because every man and woman has enough of their own to handle. Apart from helping around the daily chores at home, what else can you offer in the relationship? Are you strong enough for him to count on, and vice versa?<br><br>***<br><br>IMHO, sometimes you need to take the leap and change things for yourself, by yourself, before you can safely say you have what it takes to make a relationship like this work.<br><br>PS: The sleepover between his ex wife and him is really subjective. They had sex. Are you willing to overlook it? If you can't, sweeping it under the rug is not going to benefit things in the long run.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>errrr... actually, I am quite surprised... no1 advice TS to have conversation with her bf's wife??? Well... I think her bf's wife is most likely mature type and if approached correctly, both of them can talk and help each other... Whatever, the wife say, it is at least 50% true...<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Advantages : </strong></span><br><br>1) Whatever the wife noes, TS dont noe. Whatever TS noes, the wife dont noe. if there is any lies, it will be straight away uncover... Probably, TS may even feel disgusted with her bf after the talk... who noes after all the wife accompany her husband more than TS do???<br><br>2) Currently, I can feel that TS still loves her bf. It is these love that bind her with her bf and torture TS. By approaching her bf's wife, it is like a sharp knife that chop the bond between her and her bf. Which is better ??? Breaking the bond with one chop or breaking the bond for a period of time???<br><br>3) Anyway,if her bf is true to her, communicating with her bf's wife is a good way to understand her bf...  It will greatly enhance the relationship if it is not stained due to her bf's wife.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Disadvantages : </strong></span><br>1) Yr bf will sure be angry 1... And his anger may even break the relationship with u<br>2) Probably, if u do communicate with her wife and he lied, he may lose u as well as his wife &gt;&lt;<br>3) Yr meeting with her wife may turn ugly...<br><br>well, if u really go and meet yr bf's wife, haha... yr bf will be shocked... I cant even imagine his face if he does lie to his wife and u ... &gt;&lt;<br><br></div>
