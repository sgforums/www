If talking to him = to picking a fight with him, it simply means that you employed that wrong way to speak to him. Quick to throw words and especially use words like 'You this', You that', which puts him into defensive mode? Tone of voice? Visible anger ready to tear him apart? Be firm, yet calm when speaking. Don't mention all the problems (or past) onto the table - do things one at the time. Always explain your intention in your words, don't tell him 'this is shit,' SHOW him 'this is shit' - let him feel in your shoes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>As for the part that he don't like you to know his friends, rationally, this is something weird - what so shameful about letting your gf knows about your friend? But everything exist for a reason - ask indirectly. Don't go to him and ask why you can't... ask if there is anything/something wrong with you that he has to do that - start from there. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Working in office and currently busy... give him the benefit of the doubt - trust him until he does something that loses this trust. Because since he didn't, you have to give him the benefit of the doubt - you can't let suspicion based on feelings to get over you. But, however if this goes on for *TOO* long... for most woman, its not a very good thing - percentage of them leaving for another men is very high. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>So... to prevent such things from happening, communicate and sort things out. If you avoid communication, you are letting this relation deteriorate gradually. Don't think communication as a dreadful or something that will harm your relation through arguments... learn to speak the right way to get your message across to avoid this. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers.</div>

Your life does not totally revolve around him. Live for yourself not him.<br><br>You should trust him until hes proven untrustworthy. Working late? Did you call his office number or mobile? Give him a *surprise* at the office. Bring supper for him.<br><br>Cheers. You can also PM me if you need more help.</div>

U tok like u see everything so easy, when u have a serious gf and she's outside with "friends" u don know, and not telling u what she doing, and keep saying busy for whole night, how would u feel?<br><br>She might be screwing other guys, flirting with other guys, u might not know. And u will feel insecured. Thats how she feels understand anot? When u r in a relationship, then u will get to know all these feelings man.<br><br>Ling^er, i understand about ur insecurities towards this relationship. But maybe u shd just meet up with your guy, and have a good talk with him. Tell him how u feel, and maybe join him with his group of friends or what.
