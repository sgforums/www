              <p>you should know if he got a dad or mom. they should be the ones worring about grandma's health. he should concentrate on his (tsk tsk) road march. and i think the 2 of you are still too young to undersatnd what is love and relationship. these problems are common in life and should not hurt any couples.</p>

              instead of wanting him to do something about the relationship, you should worry about hos grandma's health.
              With NS and his grandma's health, he might not feel confident of starting a relationship officially.
              Or he is just not that into you.
              Don't worry gal. Only time will tell..maybe you can show him more understanding and conconcern for now.

              <p>Now let's try some scenario planning...</p>
              <p>Try doing this in a same time frame...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1) Having need to study for exam during exam period... U are under alot of pressure from parents/friends/teachers to get good grades</p>
              <p>2) Need to plan 3 full birthday events (catering, location, invitation)</p>
              <p>3) Need to attend piano classes</p>
              <p>4) Need to do part time work</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>U will simply find that u are very much drained as times goes by... Very tired...</p>
              <p>All this activity are what we call commitment. All commitment takes some of ur physical and mental energy... When u have too much commitment than you can handle, most ppl get stressed out...</p>
              <p>In times like this, you can be more understanding... being together doesn't mean that he have to call u every 2 days, IE:</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>we havent been in contact for 2 days already ever since I asked if he still likes me</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Before u asked that insensitive (pardon me but maybe to him, u didn't spare a thought for his feelings) question, did he report to you everyday beforehand?</p>
              <p>What you can do is instead of adding further stress, as a couple, u shld be taking on part of his worry for him, let him know that u are there for him when he needs someone, so that he wont feel like he's in this alone... u shld let him know ur worries but maybe at a later better timing... Try to stuff everything into 1 single moment when he's too stressed out will end up balloon bursting...</p>

              <p>2 days never call and you get all upset?</p>
              <p>First you must understand what is BMT.. BMT do not have much time for themselves.. they maybe outfield...etc...</p>
              <p>Last time, I was in NS serving BMT.. we only have pay phone.. and is common that we do not call for week or even weeks.... as majority of the pay phone will be out of order wahahaha</p>

              <p>BMT is a very stressful experience. The recruits are being stuck on an island put through physical torment 5days in a row.. relationships outside will feel meaningless to them. I suggest you tell him you wait for him because after BMT, he will get to book out/nights out in his unit more often</p>

              <p>If the guy is truly interested, he will always try to make time for TS.</p>
