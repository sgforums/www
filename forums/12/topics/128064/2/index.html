It's obvious that it's not your time to earn the bucks yet since you're still studying. She should know this. If she can't wait 2-3 years, she's not worth it!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi zichuan<br><br>From your message I feel that you still love her and aty the same time you are angry with her.  We all had hear only one side of your story which is why I wont want to judge her base on this.  However, if you are thinking of changing her, I will like to suggest that you think about it again.  Nobody can change anybody unless he/she want to be change in the first place.  So dont waste your time waiting to change her.  Let say you live til 80, you only have four 20 years to go.  1/4 of your live have already past so dont waste anymore time on thing you cant control and change.<br><br>Regards<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by zichuan:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi,<br><br>Im very sad now, but i hope to express my feelings in here.<br><br>my girlfriend and i we been together for 4yrs+ recently she suddendly overnight changed and said that we broke off awhile, it was weird, i didnt do anything wrong to her or either we quarrell. few days later i saw her holding hands with another guy. i confronted her, but she kept crying. i asked her what happen to us both. she dont wish to answer. she keep crying. i asked for collegues of hers. she said that she wants to settle down with a finacial stable guy. this is hard for me though im studying now, i told my gf that i will finish my studies and move into the working soceity, we been enduring for so many years yet.. it true that alwayys i no money but then does she really love me or that guy she known 3days because he is stable. this is lame. this world is it no more love? is it love = so relistic in money...</div></blockquote></div>
