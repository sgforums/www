            <div class='col-md body'>Makes no sense that she just keeps crying when you ask her. Does she have some difficulties that she is not telling you? Is her family facing some form of financial difficulties?<br><br>I mean if she just wanted to settle down with someone financially stable, she could have just walked out of the relationship. No need for her to cry when you demand for an explaination although it is the 'cooling off' period.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>What a damn b****.......! I know what it must feel like to be treated like s***....I think u should jus forget about her. Reading ur post brings me back to my own experience where I felt so short-changed - I was in the mood for resolving issues at all times but she wasn't, she chose the easy way out instead - exactly what u're experiencing now......<br><br>U should not accept this kinda behaviour from her, its not tolerable and u should not take her back. FOrget her - if she's capable of doing something like that once, she'll do it again......this kinda woman got innate mental problem, avoid at all costs!!</div>
