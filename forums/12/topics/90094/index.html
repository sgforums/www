Either way its going to be too complicated just to have a causal meetup with her. Shes currently working in Singapore but she does express her hope to become a air stewardess in Malaysia airline. If thats the case its going to get a lot more messy to even remain in contact with her. But I do hope that she does succeed in her air stewardess dream.</div>

Hint to her or ask her close friends. Cos if u let her know ur feelings &amp; she doesn't reciprocate, u may end up losing a gd friend.</div>
