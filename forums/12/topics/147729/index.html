            <div class='col-md body'>Hi.....im posting here in the hope that i would be able to get some useful advice.<br>I have a close friend whom i have known for nearly 3 yrs. He confessed to me 2 yrs ago that he did like me alot and hope that things btw us can progress beyond merely friendship. I was surprised at that time and i reacted by pretending that nothing ever happened and tried to avoid him for a few months....hoping that his feelings would change thru time.<br>However....a few months back, i sort of had this nagging feeling that he stil had some feelings for me as he kept asking me out and wanted to spend his bday alone with me. And he started giving me gifts with very obvious meanings....but the thing is ....i dun feel anything for him at all even after all these yrs. I have tried dropping obvious hints such as asking him to go get a gf, refusing to spend valentines with him etc but he juz doesnt seem to get it....hence recently.....i have become very mean to him on purpose, doin things that i dun even do to ppl that i dun like.....now i feel so guilty cos he seemed to be rather hurt by wat i said and what i did.....<br>i really hope that he doesnt waste any more time on me........how do i bring across my point and not risk hurting him or losing him as my fren? pls advise... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>U r indeed a very caring and responsible gal. Some guys are very persistent, and thats because he really wans u to know how serious he is. Have a nice and serious chat with him, rather than ignoring him totally.<br><br>Like what a female friend of mine once told me abt a guy who chase after her but she didn't accept him becos there isnt any chemistry between them. She told him that she is still willing to go out for a nice dinner with him as long as he treats her as an ordinary friend, paying for their own meal. In short, there must be a distinct line drawn in between.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>avoiding someone is never a good idea. I think u have to stop hinting and tell him how you feel. if he truely loves you then he wont mind it and will still want to be your friend(so that he could at least be close to you and spend time with you). if u dont give it to him straight then...he'll just keep hoping and dreaming. and later it will be hard for him to let u go your own way( like when you get a bf)</div>
