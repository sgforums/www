He confessed to me 2 yrs ago that he did like me alot and hope that things btw us can progress beyond merely friendship. I was surprised at that time and i reacted by pretending that nothing ever happened and tried to avoid him for a few months....hoping that his feelings would change thru time.<br>However....a few months back, i sort of had this nagging feeling that he stil had some feelings for me as he kept asking me out and wanted to spend his bday alone with me. And he started giving me gifts with very obvious meanings....but the thing is ....i dun feel anything for him at all even after all these yrs. I have tried dropping obvious hints such as asking him to go get a gf, refusing to spend valentines with him etc but he juz doesnt seem to get it....hence recently.....i have become very mean to him on purpose, doin things that i dun even do to ppl that i dun like.....now i feel so guilty cos he seemed to be rather hurt by wat i said and what i did.....<br>i really hope that he doesnt waste any more time on me........how do i bring across my point and not risk hurting him or losing him as my fren? pls advise... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote>Dear milktea, I was in such a position once, only difference is that the guy was my ex. he wanted to get back together, I didn't. He took it real hard... What I did was cut off all contact. till he got ever me and now we still hang out at times.<br><br><blockquote> <strong>not being childish here (sorree master MC!) but perhaps u could get a bf and he'll let up.<br><br>serious. some pple just won't give up until u're with someone else.<br><br>but of course u won't go into a reln just to drive the point home.<br><br>if u're ALREADY in a reln and he's still like this well... u can't have ur cake and eat it too. u'll have to lose him, friendship and everything.<br><br>u did mention to get him to stop, but still maintaining the friendship. not easy. u've been trying for how long again?</strong></blockquote>I ever thought of using this tactic too. but I decided that since I've never lied to him in the past I will not start doing so now. in fact, I turned down a guy I quite liked because I didn't want my ex to think our breakup was due to a third party (which is true, I only gotten to know that guy after I broke up with my ex).<br><br>Bygones.<br><br>Milktea, What I suggest, is like the others. do not hint. TELL him straight. put your cards out on the table. make sure there's no way for him to mis-interprete. or if you can't bring yourself to tell him face to face, write him a letter. explaining how you feel,<br><br>tell him that if he continue to persue you, you'll have to break all contact. but your friendship is important to you. so when he have given up and is still willing to continue your friendship, you'll be more than happy to be friends again....<br><br>few things to note after sending him the letter:<br><br>1. no matter what response he gives (or no response) you'll have to keep your distance first. it doesn't matter if he decides to give up or not, it takes time to give up, and constantly seeing you doesn't help.<br><br>2. how long have you known each other, there's bound to be mutual friends. enlist a few of them to help you "look after him" as in go out with him talk to him so that he does not feel too alone without you in his life.<br><br>3. as mentioned by others before, be prepared to give this friendship up. as for some guys, they may find it embarrasing to face a gal who once rejected him. it's a pride thing.<br><br>4. last point, with regards to #1; keeping your distance means break off ALL contact. use your mutual friends as a informant to see if he's ready for you to reappear in group outings.<br><br>milktea, it's not easy to remain friends after such events, but with the help of mutual friends, it can be done... my friends helped me a lot. after about 7-8months, one friend even told me to stop worrying and join in their outings with him, that he's got another target now!!!<br><br>Time will heal. that's the truth!!!</div>
