            <div class='col-md body'>Requirements may change but that's a risk you have to take. However, I don't think they will reject you. International students are very attractive to them, because of $$$. The question will be whether you can pass the course. So, study hard. My first degree from QUT also. What are you doing? I did software engineering. That was tough!<br><br>Anyhoo, expect to spend about $1.5k in living expenses per month, so $18k a year. I'm not sure about international fees, I think close to $9k a semester? So another $18k a year. So try to prepare about $36k a year. If you want to get a car and drive around (highly recommended), that's extra.<br><br>Good luck!</div>

The more the merrier (except those selective and very good Uni such as UQ or Uni of Mel or something). Because they earn from there. Few yrs back there was an article written in Aussie saying that the govt don't fund much to these universities hence they rely on International students for funding. More international students = more money for them.<br><br>However, requirements do change time after time. Esp for Engineering students. But being a finance student, I think ur worries shld be lesser. QUT is known to accept most students.<br><br>My suggestion is, why not try to get a conditional entry (not sure if it's possible) Meaning request for a place now, but join them later? Won't that be better?<br><br>As for expenses, it depends on the school. The fees aren't getting cheaper in Aussie plus the increased exchange rates. School fees per semester (4 papers for biz students) is abt AUD6k (do check with their website for their sch fees). Maybe 2 yrs from now, it might increase. So per yr (not including summer semester) is abt AUD12k minimum.<br><br>As for expenses, 4 yrs back I spent abt $3k per semester just on food and accomodation (stingy way of living) but my husband who studied in QUT spent abt S$5k but was living a life of luxury. Every week can go restaurant, can go gambling, etc. Accomodation ain't too expensive at QUT side, you jus have to look around lah. So I guess maybe when u are going there, your expenses might be more because of the exchange rates difference.<br><br>Well, hope that helps</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Have no worries, the requirements will not get any stiffer, but the tution fees will get higher.<br><br>Its easy to get in, they love international students, especially the $$$ that come with them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Spenditure?  Gotta see your lifestyle.  If you going QUT and live in brisbane city, its walking distance and serviced by a free bus loop.  The brunt of expenses will be on rent.  If you live further in the suburbs, you have to start considering transport costs.<br><br>I will exclude tuition fees in the following sums, because it is module and course dependent, the higher the credit points, the higher the fees.  All amounts I state are in Oz $.<br><br>I live in the city in a rented apartment, monthly rent I pay is 600 bucks, I spend nil on transport, because QUT is just a walk away and theres the bus loop.  Next in line is food.  Food isn't cheap here.  Lastly are bills.  I don't lead a lavish life here, I can make do with 5000 bucks each sem just for living.  So assuming tution fees cost 9k a sem with the above living expenses, adds up to about under 30K annual.<br><br>You might consider extra expenses stabilising yourself down in the first sem when you come here.</div>
