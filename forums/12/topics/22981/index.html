            <div class='col-md body'>Hi to all of u who r reading this post....i jus want to see anyone can help me. Well...how should i start... im a boy in depression, 17 yrs old. I hav lost all my friends n failed my 'o' levels, n i hav nowhere to go, i do not know what to do next, n i hav seldom step out of my house since i feburary. I hav not been to the movies, shopping, and all the things teens will normally do for three years..n i am the  speckie type of boy...with 1000 for both eyesight.<br><br>Wjen i was in sec 1, everything was smoothy, i hav 3 best friends and life was good. But goin to sec 2,  i hav a quarrel with 1 of my best friends n b4 i know it they drift away from me slowly n soon i was alone..But goin to a new class in sec 2, i began to make new friends n soon i got to know 4 of the guys in the class. We all got on very fast n soon within 2-3 months, the bond btw the five of us grew very stronge. We were very popular in that year. And of course everything soared 4 me as i topped the class for both semester, getting 5 A1s for each of the semester. That can be said to be the peak year of my life till now. But things started to collapse on me towards sec 3. The five of us went to sec 3 together in the same class. And at the start it was like normal..but as time goes, we got to know another friend in the class n he is quite friendly n funky. Soon i was declining to go out with them to the movies and all that, as i think im not good enough to be part of them. Slowly i drifted away from them...<br><br>And from sec3 till now i haven been to the movies n all that. And with no confidence at all, my  results dropped. i was 30/40 ranking in the class. Goin to sec 4, things took a worst turn, my friends started talkin n gossiping bout me..n soon the whole class  was doin it. I was a loner . And everytime during the recess or break, i will always be alone...sometimes i will hide in the toilet untill the bell goes...n the feeling is terrible. When the school ends, i will always be the first to leave the school. And no surprised, i failed both semester n was last in the class rankings. Failing my 'o' levels, i try again  as a private candidate n failed again. Now, im  left with nothing, i hav no confidence, im jus an empty person. But i will not be a foolish person as to commit suicide. So what can i do...im facing the computer everyday for at least 7 hours a day to kill time, n my eyesight is getting bad...but what can i do..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Take your depression normal. This will not hurt you if you take it normal.<br><br>you just need some appreciation and sincere help. I suggest to go to any psychiatrist. if you dont want to do so, just share it conitnuously to any peson who loves you. Who can console you. Dont share it with any one. This will make your feelings of depression more stronger.<br><br>You can also help yourself by making some other small and easy goals for you. Achieve them. This will give you confidence.<br><br>Also read the biographies of great men. How the got theirselves succeeded.<br><br>Have trust that there is no failure. This is just a feed back of your input. You did not worked as was required, so  you did not get the result you desired. Give the required in put and get the desired result.<br><br>Never be afraid of failure.<br><br>You can also help yourself by making some other small and easy goals for you. Achieve them. This will give you confidence.<br><br>Now take a start positively!<br><br>[/quote]</div>

What you need to do now is to clear your "o" levels...if not, then you can go to some private schools and start with their certificate courses and then go on to take your diploma and such. You are still young, life is not a bed of roses.  It will have its ups and downs.  If you think you are feeling bad in life, there are people who are in more worse situations then you.

Sometimes things are very simple but we tends to complicate it, sometimes things which are obvious are not obvious afterall.  Step into the shoes of your friends and what do you think they thought of you?  Don't bluff yourself, if you are no good, you are no good.  Learn from experience and get new friends is more important <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Don't choose who can be your friends and who cannot be...... they can choose not to be your friends too.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, get a life... meaning what?<br>U lack the confidence, what's that?<br>U should know, go look at urself in the mirror, u feel sorry for urself?<br>1st thing, being confident in life is important(note: its being confident and not arrogant, its often a thin line between that). It will be hard but what comes easy??<br><br>Understand this, make ur frens treasure u and vice versa. Stun them, shock them whatever. Its hard to teach u like this. I hope we have a certain degree of understanding.<br><br>advice:<br>Learn to be independent, easier said then done.<br>Take stride in whatever u do.<br>Look at urself in the mirror, esp in the public.<br>smile it off if u ever engage in eye contact with a stranger be it gal/guy.<br>take a look at the surroundings, learn from those(be it nature or ppl).<br>And dun worry too much, whatever life u had been leading, its fated.<br>Know that all these are all but experiences that u will bring to ur grave.<br>Most importantly, believe in whatever u do is correct... of course that will depends on ur definition of everything. To a point of arrogance is unsought of.<br><br>Take care. And believe in causality.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>argh i said too much crap, just....take....care...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
