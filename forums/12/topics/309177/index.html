              <p>Hi guys I am 15 this year and will be taking my O'levels. I am currently studying at Whitley Secondary School and my VP is picking on me. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>
              <p>The latest case is regarding a youtube video about my form teacher scolding 2 pupils which included me and the head prefect in class.</p>
              <p>I edited the video but did not upload it. I had stored it in my phone and it apparently started to spread when someone borrowed my phone. This whole incident started when the 'gay' in class reported this video and now many of us have been questioned. The 'gay' dislikes me especially because we had quarrelled once.</p>
              <p>I am extremely frustrated now as my phone has been confiscated and who the fuck added two videos of my form teacher into my phone. The video in youtube was not taken by me, it was taken by Gladson. So why was his phone not even inspected? There are alot of sensitive documents in my phone and I do need it back. So when I questioned the authorities they say they have a 'search warrant'? How can a teacher have a search warrant?</p>
              <p>So the VP told me that if I could trace down the person who uploaded the video and get him to delete it, he 'may' let me off. WTF did I do wrong in the first place? I am being framed by someone and I suspect it is the 'gay' whom the whole class hates. When i was detained, many people turned up to support me however whenever the 'gay' gets into trouble people are happy.</p>
              <p>I doubt I would ever be able to trace down the person who uploaded the video and my phone seems to be gone with the wind.</p>

              <p>REPORT REPORT!!!</p>
              <p>Sensitive materials... porn? If not then you're quite safe to inform your parent about it. If you don't, still you're going to be quite screwed if this goes up to the next level. You'd still need to have a talk to your parents and stuff. And they might want to check your phone with regards to the video.</p>
              <p><br>Technically its not your fault since the video wasn't shot by you, it was Gladson. But technically, it is kinda your fault for not keeping the sensitive edited video (Gladson's I presume) locked away somewhere where nobody else can have access to. You, have sealed your own fate. But worry not, the school has no power to keep your phone for long; gota swallow your balls and talk to your parents to get your phone back, they have no authority to keep your phone for long. And it is my understanding that your VP is obviously unfazzed by the matter, and pushed all the shitload of crap to you to resolve. My question is:</p>
              <p><br>Did the video show any incriminating evidence of anything (abuse/whatsoever)?</p>
              <p>If not then its just a case of mischief on your part. Even if it was loaded on YouTube, they have no proof of your involvement. You can check on your phone, the date and time the Video was transferred into your phone memory. You can also ask for a proper investigation (with your parent's backing of course) to be done if before you take proper action on them.</p>
              <p><br>But technically, this is all just heresay, from the mouth of a 15yr old. What you need is hard evidence if not it'll all just go down the drain.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>I know what you guys mean. Anyway Gladson is to blame for the video not me. They want to know who uploaded it which was not me as I would be able to get my phone back unless I find a way to delete the video. That was what the VP said. Anyway inside my phone there are two videos of the same teacher althought it is nothing. Is it illegal to take a video of someone without their consent but not publish it on the internet? I mean look at Stomp.</p>
              <p>What I meant by sensitive documents is pictures of my personal life with parents and family members. I don't like the idea of that VP who might be a paedophile to be going through my stuff. There is no porn inside.</p>

              <p>Then its obvious that you've been screwed brother. Screw the VP, call down your parents and get ready for a muddy brawl! Such a lame excuse to blow up such a small matter.</p>
              <p>1) You didn't shoot the vid; get your friend to testify if not just play the vid and tell the stupid VP "How did I shoot the vid if I'm in it?"</p>
              <p>2) There is no direct evidence that shows that you were the one who uploaded it.</p>
              <p>3) Nothing incriminating about the vid; big deal, so why blow it up?</p>
              <p>4) Obvious blackmail; asking you to do the shitjob of putting down the vid when it wasn't you that put it up in the 1st place.</p>
              <p>5) Obvious over-reaction by the VP which led to your hp being taken away.</p>
              <p>6) Warrant? What warrant?! Show warrant than talk, if not screw them. Tell them to call your parents down. Blatant abuse of power!</p>
              <p>There is a far better tactile way to do things w/o abusing your powers. The VP needs to be screwed and put in his proper place...</p>

              complain to your parents and MOE lor. Even if you did take the video, as long as it's illegal it's still nothign wrong.

              <p>Vehicle_builder,</p>
              <p>Your VP is not picking on you, he gave you a chance to redeem yourself, yet you blew it for cowardly reason.</p>
              <p>If I am not wrong, you are not suppose to use your mobile phone while the class is in session.</p>
              <p>Since you borrowed it to your friend, you know which friend you borrowed it to. You should have been more honest and let your VP know who this person is. This way you would have been off the hook by now. Unless it's just a lie for you to get out of this sticky situation.</p>
              <p>Also if Gladson is the guy who filmed it, why didn't you report this piece of information to your VP ?</p>
              <p>To be honest with you, who post the video online.. if your VP really wants to trace, it can be done easily. He is merely giving you a chance to own up voluntarily.</p>
              <p>In school, you don't just learn textbook knowledge, it is also a place to develop your character and learn some virtues.</p>
              <p>Next time, back up your "documents" if it is so important to you.</p>
              <p>As for your phone, take it as "lost" and get a new one.</p>
              <p>Come clean, and stop making excuses for yourself. Most adults can see through it like a piece of transparent paper. In this case, yes, honesty is the best policy.</p>
              <p>A lesson learned becomes part of you forever.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              <p>I just spoke to 'someone quite high up there' and he reckons that such a case is a grey part in the law. According to him, it is not illegal to video anyone without consent especially if it is for evidence. What he means is that not taking for sick purposes. Since there is no school rules thats stipulates that it is illegal to to film an individual, I only broke one rule. Using hand phone in class. At most my phone would be confiscated for one month.</p>
              <p>For example, Stomp has people being filmed without their consent and being published in the newspaper. Thats tantamount to circulating pictures of other people. My friend who was in JC 1 when the infamous RI video was circulated told me that the student was just given a warning.</p>
