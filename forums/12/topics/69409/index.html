CloUdiSm remix III states that the next phrase after honeymoon period is called Growth. Usually, I term it as True Reflection because this is the part where the relationship will still continue to blossom from ample efforts of both side, but the actual love-attitude-cum-self-personality screen will surface. People with little experience in relationship or could be cardinal in love behavior experiences a lack of energy compared to the early beginning.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Like fire, the bigger than flame in the beginning, the faster it will be subdued.<br><br>When we were friends, we knew each other superficially. Even if we were close friends and knew about each other's personal problem, it's never the same compared to both together in a relationship. A good example would be: How on earth would you know, through friendship, that he said he would call, but wouldn't do it in relationship? Such behavioral reaction cannot be detected.<br><br>He doesn't want to talk because he felt that he has...<br><br>I) Either done nothing wrong and he sensed that you may be making a mountain out of a mole-hole. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>II) Felt restricted from his usual freedom from the 'captive' net you are assigning him to.<br><br>Please realise this by now: Cold War beyond one day damaged  and leaves invisible wounds into your relationship. His refusal to communicate, followed by your refusal to talk will going destroy this relationship with both of your bare hands. In fact, this will become a habit and in love cosmic cycle - the dynamic of this relationship will adopt this habit and get used. Without communication, this relationship is likely to be 'killed' without you knowing.<br><br>I said this to someone else in this forum before: <strong>Lead your relationship right or give them up</strong>. Date him out and have a soul talk. Induce him to speak first before you do since he hasn't been doing much talking. Unless he truely keep mum about his feelings and thought, start the ball rolling and say your piece. Don't trash - just reveal the happenings, your preception, your feelings and thoughts about this 3 months. Valentine Day is not just about being happy as a couple - in fact, you could use this day to reduce the barrier and tension between the both of you. Clear misunderstanding and learn empathy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: When you are in a relationship, lifestyle will change. Young relationship have to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">adapt to this new changes without expecting to lead the exact same life they have</span>. Their love has to be top of the agenda.<br><br>Cheers</div>

In this case, i might be cosh u're always there, u're always SMS'g/calling him, &amp; he feels smothered.<br><br>There're some guys who simply take their partners for granted too...  They're Not willing to make an effort, &amp; when confronted wif their partners' unhappiness, they get defensive.  They're too selfish to think for 2, &amp; they only think of themselves.<br><br>Tok to him again, &amp; if he's still nasty, make tt decision to live ur own life.  Why shd u put ur life on hold for someone who wun even think of ur feelings?  Does he care tt he's called u @ an inappropriate time &amp; tt u're gonna sleep?  Not likely, from wat u'd described.<br><br>Ultimately, we deserve to be loved &amp; cherished.  And we deserve the basic respect as women &amp; as partners.

But here, it's necessary to take steps in order to protect urself.  Pls understand tt I'm Not advising u to give up hope, juz to ensure tt u dun keep crying, okie?<br><br>There're some guys who "run outta steam" after awhile.  They enjoy the chase, &amp; after tt, they simply lose interest.  In this case, i might be cosh u're always there, u're always SMS'g/calling him, &amp; he feels smothered.<br><br>There're some guys who simply take their partners for granted too...  They're Not willing to make an effort, &amp; when confronted wif their partners' unhappiness, they get defensive.  They're too selfish to think for 2, &amp; they only think of themselves.<br><br>Tok to him again, &amp; if he's still nasty, make tt decision to live ur own life.  Why shd u put ur life on hold for someone who wun even think of ur feelings?  Does he care tt he's called u @ an inappropriate time &amp; tt u're gonna sleep?  Not likely, from wat u'd described.<br><br>Ultimately, we deserve to be loved &amp; cherished.  And we deserve the basic respect as women &amp; as partners.  If he can't respect u, &amp; treats u like dirt, mebbi u shd think over whether u wanna spend the rest of ur life in this state.<br><br>RP<br><br></div></blockquote>thanx sweet... really thanx.. *hugZ* thanx for the advise..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"></div>
