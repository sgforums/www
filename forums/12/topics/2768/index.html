            <div class='col-md body'>But then first impression do counts. And when a guy chooses a gf, no doubt, the first thing they look for is appearance. After that, maybe then they'll have eyes for the inner beauty. Reality hurts...not many guys will fall in love with a gal who has the size of a sumo wrestler even if she is the most gentle gal or most understanding gal. Guys normally will not give them a second look, worst still, some may even laugh behind their backs. I've seen too many such people around. One can't choose how they look. Though some may say fat people can lose weight through exercise and diet...but there are some who have bigger bone structure and they dun lose weight so easily...or some is under medication (like Chen Liping)?

These guys not easy to find.<br>On the whole, I feel that guys likes to boost in front of their friends and if they have a pretty gf, they can brag about it and bring her out to show off to his friends but once she becomes fat or ugly, he'll start to complain about her size and looks...and feels that he will lose face if his friends sees that he has such an ugly gf. I'm not saying that all guys are like that...but I believe that a majority of guys still look at the surface of things and not inner..especially so for guys who are young...the younger they are, the prettier their gf must be...<br>My friend's bf used to bring her out when he hangs out with his friends. That time, she was still pretty and cute...now, she is slightly fatter and has a little more pimples, her bf never brings her out anymore. He gives alot of excuses and never bring her on his outings with his friends anymore. She feels very hurt, and tries hard to change her looks and cure her pimples...I think her bf is being very cruel to her...she loves him with all her heart and that is how he treats her. To think they were together for more than 5 years. Not even married and the guy is already 'complaining' that she is not pretty anymore. He likes to control what she wears...when she say she like to buy a certain shoe or something, her bf alot of comment...say it looks ugly on her and stuff like that. Not encouraging at all. And I always see my friend eating nothing but fruits for lunch cos she say other food is oily...makes her fat and gives her pimples only...then later in the afternoon, she'll feel very hungry becos she only had some fruits or had salad for lunch. Sigh.<br>Gals on their part, need to look out for their figure too. Not only for beauty sake, but also for health sake.

            <div class='col-md body'>I know. We tried to talk to her...but I guess she's too 'blinded' by love. Her bf treats her quite shabbily lor. He even two-timed her when he is still serving NS. And the other party was her poly friend (by the way, her bf also know from the same poly). She forgave him in the end...her bf in the beginning treated her better...maybe trying to make it up to her...but before long, he start to treat her like a maid again...always running errands for him. Imagine, you have a bf who will scold you 'bitch' in public and say things like 'if you not a gal, I would have bashed you up'...sound like some gangster...but her bf is no gang member lah...just a spoilt brat whose parents spoilt him to the core that is why he is like that. He even told my friend that if she even get pregnant, he'll just give her the money, she go abort it herself! What a jerk! But then she still sticks to him lah...I think maybe she feels that she is already 'his woman'...no more market value. She doesn't listen to us...she always envys me when she sees how nice my bf treats me...I feel sad for her too...but she sort of resign to fate liao. Sigh. Sometimes, I really wonder...what is so wonderful about a guy who loves only your outer beauty, who dun appreciate what you do for him and one who takes you for granted.<br>I think gals out there need to really open eyes big big...guys complaining about your looks is still a small matter...if they still love you, treat you well...only occasionally comment that you need to lose some weight, it is still fine...if you dun like him doing it as it is hurting you, then talk to him, let him know that you feel hurt by such comments...maybe he doesn't know he is hurting your feelings...guys can be quite insensitive at times. But gals...if your bfs start treating you like trash, nice to you only when he wants you to do something for him or want something from you, then you better give a serious thought about the relationship.<br>I think that some gals' thinking that you're 'his woman' then you have no market value is way old fashion thinking. Dun bear with such guys just becos you think you lost your viginity to him and no one else will want you anymore...come on...if he can treat you like trash now, two-time you now and then, sooner or later, he'll dump you...why not we be the strong one and put an end to our own misery and get on with life! You'll find better guys out there!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by giraffe:</div><div class="quote_body"> hey Twiggie, I think ur gal-friend needs to be wake up    <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>[This message has been edited by Twiggie (edited 27 November 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>She stubborn mah. Our school got a guy like her alot, very good to her...but she just can't accept him. Dunno why she still think her bf better. Me and my friends also pity that poor guy cos she reject him liao, he still like so 'hopelessly in love' with her lor. But my friend just can't seems to give up that jerk bf of hers and accept this new guy. Probably that's what we say as we cannot force one to love. It's her life...all we can do is advice her, but it's up to her to accept it or ignore it. She tried breaking up with her bf a couple of times but dunno how come still end up back with him. We already done all we can. As friends, we already done our best. We can only wish her bf will learn to appreciate her...but I think that will be hard lor. They together 5 yrs liao, 'honeymoon period' less than a yr...thereafter have been quarrelling all the time. Only she can put up with such a jerk yet the guy doesn't appreciate what he has.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ^`Angel`^BaBy:</div><div class="quote_body">Hey Twiggie...very sad lehz...after reading abt ur gal pal...hate jerks who treat gals lk tat!...is there realli no way 2 tok her around???

            <div class='col-md body'>My friend's case is even sadder. Her bf treats her like trash, orders her around and even makes her pay for everything including his rent and food. He drives her car around but when they drove all the way to melbourne from here ( Sydney), he made her drive. I really cant imagine such a guy existed!! or should i say heartless beast. The whole world knows that he is with her for her money, but only she doesnt get it. A guy friend of mind told me that when the guys and her jerk bf were out one night, one even joked about asking her to go for plastic surgery! My poor friend of mine is really cleaned out, her heart, soul, virginity, money all taken by the guy..... I really quit trying to talk her out of her relationship as she doesnt listen at all. She has herself to blame too, nv open eyes big big and nv listen to others!!!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wah lau eh...is that call relationship or being call as free maid services? Even a maid also get more respect. Love doesn't go blind till that extend ney...not say force u twiggie &amp; Ice-lemon tea, your gal friends really need a tight slap or a hard shake to really wake them up ley... could it be dat the guy use black magic? If can't release those gals now, their future will be ruined. Nagging to gals may help...continue wif the communication. If the guy can wash-brain, gals can wash-brain too, only that gals-to-gals need extra effort...<br><br>Apologize if there is any violent meaning to be given to you people. I believe many ppl who know abt this will really wish both of your friends to wake up.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
