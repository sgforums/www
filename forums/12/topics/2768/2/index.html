When I knew him, he was like 60plus...now he is near to 80kg liao. I still love him just as much...but he always say his rapid gain of weight is becos of me. Cos I keep feeding him with food and tibits. I always store alot of tibits in my room and when he comes my house to watch tv, he'll start eating them and I always cook lots of things for him to eat. Haha...he says it's all 'part of my plan' to make him fat...so that other gals won't like him becos he is so fat. But then, I do like his little tummy...like a soft pillow...if it was last time, it was hard cos got muscule mh...hard hard one...I like soft soft one. Anywy, looks are not so important cos sooner or later, he'll grow fat when he's old. No difference to me as long as I love him.<br><br></div></blockquote>Hi.. hmm.m..honestly issnt it your plan har?? i used to be thinner when i knew my gf too...and that she is also like you..kept on feeding me food and tibits...and since then..i have grown...i seriously think that its her plan to make sure that i will not leave her...haha<br></div>
