Alternatively, you can just choose to ignore him as their gifts and already of your possessions...</div>

There is a possibility that he might see it as a chance to meet you up during the collection, and possibly even to try and patch back with you.. So if you're an uninterested party, you'll have to be caution of that...<br><br>'Giving gifts' hold different meanings to different people... Some want it back because they can't stand the idea that 'they still have some things with you...'... While others of various different reasons... Personally, I think it's really no point guessing their intention especially when you've already want nothing to do with them....</div>
