            <div class='col-md body'>Hey. I've a pretty serious problem. Seems like no matter what I do, gals are not a bit interested in me. So I'm a classic failure when it comes to dating and relationships.<br><br>You see, previously I was pretty much a recluse and introverted guy. I didn't talk much nor try to be prominent or outstanding hence no gal took note of me.<br><br>Then 3 years ago, I had a crush on a gal and things didn't work out. I analyzed what went wrong and why I liked her (she was the friendly and out-going sort but not exactly pretty either) and thought maybe my cold  and reclusive personality is what turning people off. Hence I decided I need to change my public relation skills.<br><br>Therefore, I tried to be as friendly as possible to all my friends (male and female). I tried keeping in touch with them on regular basis when possible, sending them New Year and Christmas cards and popping them a hello instant message if they go online in ICQ or MSN, and trying to start casual conversations if they're not busy.<br><br>Still, everyone sounds very cold and uninterested even though I've already taken my first step to be more friendly and outgoing.<br><br>OK. Though not very handsome, but I'm not that horrible-looking either that I scare people off. I would put myself as an average or alightly-above average looking guy. And in terms of financial status, not rich but not in heavy debt either, so somewhere in the middle.<br><br>Now I don't know what I can do. What's wrong with me?</div>
