            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Dear All,<br><br>I have such a disturbing experience today at NLB (Bugis) carpark that I HAVE TO WRITE THIS EMAIL to warn you people. Forgive my long explanation.<br><br>I was with my friend at NLB carpark today (2nd June) getting out of the basement carpark when we were hijacked  by this aunty who seemed to be of about 30-40 years old. She was wearing a pink bandena(scarf) and wearing pink top and 3/4 bermudas.<br><br>She wanted to hike a ride out of the basement carpark to the main road. So being the kind people as we are, we agreed because we thought it was just a short ride out. She got into the car and asked where our next destination was and we replied 'Vivocity'. She replied that she was merely looking for something to eat at Tiong Bahru or Redhill and asked us to drop her there.<br><br>We were shocked as she has changed her statement, but nonetheless, my friend agreed. Along the way, she was blabbering about where the good food are in Singapore and that my friend should read the street directory to know all the road in Singapore (Because my friend said he wasn't too sure of the road from Bugis to Tiong Bahru and asked for her directions). She continued to tell us that she once hitch-hike a uncle to bring her to some city area and that poor old man (about 60 years old) didn't know the road to her destination and she scolded him for being ignorant. She then said she had hitch hiked from many different people in Singapore and she didn't dare to give directions to the drivers if they didn't know the route for fear she won't get to her destination and that she has so far learned most of the routes in Singapore because the drivers drove her there.She asked where my friend and me (she thought I was his girlfriend, but we both told her politely that we are merely friends) usually hang around in Singapore, but we didn't give her an answer.<br><br>She just couldn't stop talking. I was getting impatient and irritated, but continued to do my knitting. Then I shot her a question. 'Do you often Hitch Hike from others?' She replied, 'yes once in a while.' Then I told her that she could always take a bus but she said 'No, because I am a very impatient person'. Then I said she could grabbed a cab. She replied it was too expensive and that she would be very poor if she was to take cabs everyday. I replied,' You could always take the MRT.' She then said she doesn't take MRT.<br><br>Knowing that we are nearing a very heated argument, I paused and checked myself. There was a short period of silence. Then she continued to blabber on to my friend, treating me invisible.<br><br>When we were approaching Tiong Bahru, she told my friend that she just realized that the coffee shop was on half day and didn't open today and told my friend to drive her to Red hill MRT. My friend obliged and when we eventually and FINALLY dropped her off at the Red Hill bus stop, she passed a VERY SARCASTIC remark to my friend. She said in mandarin, 'Boy, you can have only one wife, but you can always change your girlfriend.' Immediately, I reminded her that I wasn't his girlfriend but she closed the door and left.<br><br>Who were we to know that by sharing our compassion for others who practically hijacked my friend's car, we would have such sarcastic and crude remarks being brought upon us? Was it our wrong to have let her hike the ride? Perhaps. If we were to know that she was such a person who would take people and things for granted and slapped them with such demeaning and crude comments when she doesn't even know us, we wouldn't.<br><br>So I guess sometimes it doesn't pay to be kind.  So people, be careful when you see a middle-age aunty trying to hitch a ride from you. You might end up like us. Getting your day spoiled and emotionally disturbed.<br><br>So pass it on to the unaware. I feel everyone deserves a chance to know this.<br><br>Regards,<br><br></div>
