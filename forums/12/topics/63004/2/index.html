Like I've mentioned earlier... There're ALMOST USUALLY a 'story behind' it... "<br><br><span style="color: red;">5th assumption: a assumption with reference to the 1st assumption</span></strong><br><br>Another FACT you've gotta to LEARN... There're NOTHING WRONG with ASSUMPTIONS.... In fact, your life is FULL of them... eg. When you wanna go catch an appointment with a friend. You think take MRT can reach less than 20 mins... And appointment's time is 30 mins later... You KNOW you can reach there within less than 20 mins... But IN FACT you're ONLY ASSUMING it....? You might be caught late if the MRT breaks down... Or maybe some other events might happen....<br><br>The PROBLEM you're trying to DIG from my post should be GROUNDLESS ASSUMPTIONS.... It's these which people find hard to swallow... And like I'd discussed with Ric... MOST cases USUALLY falls between groundless assumptions and concrete evidence (which actually hardly exist...)..... Rendering them SUBJECTIVE.<br><br>And given the ASSUMPTION I was making, I personally don't find it hard to swallow at all? In a normal Newtonian world, CAUSE &amp; EFFECTs are at play... It would seems VERY UNLIKELY that a bf would just yell at a gf in public FOR NOTHING. Hence, my ASSUMPTION in other words would be it's ALMOST USUALLY.... Not 100% but of HIGH LIKELIHOOD.....<br><br>UNLESS of course the bf is an EXTREME bad-nature guy who would go to the extreme of yelling at his gf for NOTHING... Which would also render him VERY CLOSE to the 2nd possibility.... A COMPLETE LUNATIC... &lt;- Someone who doesn't need a reason to do anything...<br><br>Then again, you tell me yourself what are the CHANCES that it would be the case?<br><br><strong><br>Well i said GENERAL..and if that's not enough i said INITIAL.Find me a sample that will prove that wrong.</strong><br><br>I didn't say you're wrong...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  In FACT I said it's NORMAL for an INITIAL GENERAL response....

I also mentioned it doesn't have to be the only response... Though I agreed with you that it's probably gonna be a NORM.<br><br></blockquote></div>

Tell me, how should the onlookers feel?</strong><br><br>This is a 'forced situation' created by you to DECEIVE yourself?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  So as to make people 'agree' with you? In my eyes it's kinda PATHETIC... And let me tell you why....<br><br>If you want me NOT to make any assumption that there might be a story behind it, then you would 1st have to ASSUME that there isn't a story behind it... Isn't that an ASSUMPTION on your part? Then how can there be 'no assumptions'?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  If you want me NOT to make an assumption that there's a story behind, then similarly I would have the rights to ask you NOT to assume that there's NO story behind it? Well.. That would AT LEAST put us on EQUAL grounds now... Won't it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  That would simply means that there's also a CHANCE that onlookers MIGHT think otherwise...? UNLESS of course you PRESUME that they also all run on the same softwares and similar version of it...? THAT might give you an ULTIMATE SIMILAR response you so much wants me to agree with?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Oh yeah... That is also ASSUMING that the systems running the programs don't develop any fault or bugs... And ALSO ASSUMING that the systems won't burn out or anything which would cause the hardware to degrade giving you further responses that would varies from one another...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Hmm.... Maybe that won't be so hard to swallow for you? Make PERFECT SENSE to you yeah?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong><br>There are things which we should ponder beyond the surface, but<br>there are also situations where it just isn't possible. You said.."THE LOGIC HERE IS TO KEEP YOUR EMOTIONS IN CHECK." Well this is because you already have the assumption that THERE IS A STORY BEHIND THE WHOLE THING (point out any part of your post which you suggest there might not be any), and so without knowing the story, we shouldn't make any conclusions. All these, based on your assumptions (if the 6 areas which i highlighted is sufficient) that there IS a story behind.</strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong><br>You keep suggesting you are constantly thinking, you have seen<br>a lot and you think more than the others..then don't tell me it has never occured to you that more often than not, forumites post things in a casual joking manner? "Go SLAP him lah..KICK him lah.." are just replies to a post. You think one will really do that?</strong><br><br>Yup... In fact I've also considered that.... Sheesh... 2 points I wanna make here....<br><br>1. This is 'AA'... People asking for opinions, advices and help... When you 'joke', you should know your limits....<br><br>2. AND.... I hate to say this... But PLS... X 10 Do NOT bored me with your immaturity ESPECIALLY in the way you try to DIG FAULTS where they don't exist.... Ok... FINE... Even if I ASSUME (to your benefit) that they could be JUST JOKING.... (If you have no problem swallowing it...) Then I bet you should have NO PROBLEM with me telling you that whatever I've told you were all JUST JOKES....? And certainly I can't bet you IF you finally decided to tell me that you were 'JUST JOKING' all along.... Which would brings me to another TWO points....<br><br>1. Since we're all 'just joking'. Like I've suggested earlier, let's stop wasting everybody's time....<br><br>2. If you're someone who only likes to 'jokes around'. I don't find a need to even start a discussion with you...? Since whatever you said probably won't count...? Hmm... Kinda reminds me of those type of people who would just 'turn the table' when they lose a game? Hope you're not those type of people...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong><br>Or simply, you just aren't who you seem to suggest?</strong><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  Dunno what you talking about?

Like I've mentioned earlier.... I really don't have much time for these kinda stuffs or rather LAZY for them too... If there're more people like you around does that mean that I would have to start writing 'nice stories' for them too...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  I don't earn a living on that you know?<br><br><strong><br>Lastly, let me bring you back to the point where you asked me not to jump into conclusions..that because i do not know the story behind doesn't mean there isn't, which i'm sure i didn't. On the other hand, how many fatal assumptions have you made to suggest that there is a story behind?</strong><br><br>Ok... You didn't jump to conclusion... You just ASSUME that people's initial response has to be 'anger'? No? Or are you SURE that it HAS TO BE the CONCLUSION?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>AND... Talking about the 'assumptions'.... They're actually all quite the same thing yup...? Dunno why you must quote them so many times?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">  Maybe you like them ALOT?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  Or maybe it's simply because you've not much to 'DIG' anymore...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  By the way, I don't see them as being so 'fatal'...?

In my eyes it's kinda PATHETIC... And let me tell you why....<br><br>If you want me NOT to make any assumption that there might be a story behind it, then you would 1st have to ASSUME that there isn't a story behind it... Isn't that an ASSUMPTION on your part? Then how can there be 'no assumptions'?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  If you want me NOT to make an assumption that there's a story behind, then similarly I would have the rights to ask you NOT to assume that there's NO story behind it? Well.. That would AT LEAST put us on EQUAL grounds now... Won't it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  That would simply means that there's also a CHANCE that onlookers MIGHT think otherwise...? UNLESS of course you PRESUME that they also all run on the same softwares and similar version of it...? THAT might give you an ULTIMATE SIMILAR response you so much wants me to agree with?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Oh yeah... That is also ASSUMING that the systems running the programs don't develop any fault or bugs... And ALSO ASSUMING that the systems won't burn out or anything which would cause the hardware to degrade giving you further responses that would varies from one another...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Hmm.... Maybe that won't be so hard to swallow for you? Make PERFECT SENSE to you yeah?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div></blockquote>I have said it time and again and i will make it simple here (lest you don't understand again).<br>By asking you not to make any assumptions that there is a story, i DO NOT have to assume that there isn't. In fact, would you kindly point out any part of my replies where i assume there isn't a story? Or was it just another assumption on your part that you think i'm making such a assumption? Neutral stand for me. Story or not, i don't know. On witnessing such a scene, its anger for me.</div>
