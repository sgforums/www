              <p>I recently had the first one-night stand of my life with a friend whom I know for a few months ago and we started out being colleagues at work.</p>
              <p>She's 9 years older than me and a divorcee with two young kids.</p>
              <p>I'm a single man with a steady girlfriend.</p>
              <p>It started out that night as a gathering between both of us and after a few hours of hanging out, we checked into a budget hotel room. Boh of us were present at the lobby counter during the checkin and she even provided her IC for the staff for verification.</p>
              <p>Both of us are 100% sober as we only had coffee and we had a chat for more than an hour in the room about possibly having sex, and if she's ok to the concept of us having a relationship even though I have a steady girlfriend.</p>
              <p>To all that she was ok for us having sex and she even requested for me to use condom for protection which I did.</p>
              <p>Before penetration, when we were making out, I stopped and even asked her if she's still ok to continue and I made known to her that I can't promise her any committments or have a relationship with her. To that, she's still ok and we finally proceeded with the deed.</p>
              <p>After the deed I felt guilty and she's unhappy because due to my guilt I have now made the experience bad for her.<br><br>I'm worried because there have been numerous cases in Singapore of women regretting one-night stands and then crying rape, and the guy having to be imprisoned, caned, and losing their careers, reputation and their life.</p>
              <p>I'm not well-versed in Singapore law despite being a citizen all my life. Can somebody help provide constructive advice for me? How can I handle the aftermath of this one-night stand? How can I protect myself from her crying rape?</p>

              <p>lol it's rape if she reported you and you're convicted.</p>
              <p>if not you're just having an affair behind your girlfriend's back. which isn't a good thing either.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I recently had the first one-night stand of my life with a
              friend whom I know for a few months ago and we started
              out being colleagues at work.</p>
              <p>She's 9 years older than me and a divorcee with two
              young kids.</p>
              <p>I'm a single man with a steady girlfriend.</p>
              <p>It started out that night as a gathering between both of us
              and after a few hours of hanging out, we checked into a budget
              hotel room. Boh of us were present at the lobby counter during the
              checkin and she even provided her IC for the staff for
              verification.</p>
              <p>Both of us are 100% sober as we only had coffee and we had
              a chat for more than an hour in the room about possibly having
              sex, and if she's ok to the concept of us having a relationship
              even though I have a steady girlfriend.</p>
              <p>To all that she was ok for us having sex and she even requested
              for me to use condom for protection which I did.</p>
              <p>Before penetration, when we were making out, I stopped and even
              asked her if she's still ok to continue and I made known to
              her that I can't promise her any committments or have a
              relationship with her. To that, she's still ok and we finally
              proceeded with the deed.</p>
              <p>After the deed I felt guilty and she's unhappy because due
              to my guilt I have now made the experience bad for her.<br> <br> I'm worried because there have been numerous cases in
              Singapore of women regretting one-night stands and then crying
              rape, and the guy having to be imprisoned, caned, and losing their
              careers, reputation and their life.</p>
              <p>I'm not well-versed in Singapore law despite being a citizen all
              my life. Can somebody help provide constructive advice for me? How
              can I handle the aftermath of this one-night stand? How can I
              protect myself from her crying rape?</p>

              <p>You want to protect yourself against her crying rape ?</p>
              <p>CAN ! </p>
              <p>Cry rape first ! </p>
              <p>Logically, U can't possibly rape her if she's the one raping you .</p>
