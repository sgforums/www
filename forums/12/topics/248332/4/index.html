I'm getting older by the day and I am still single. I am so tired of waiting already. I want very much to get married. I do not want to be 50 and visiting the red light district. Yet no matter what I do, I simply cannot get attached. I have tried to "woo" many girls yet everyone of them seems to be waiting for someone better or show lack of interest. What is wrong with you girls? Most either continue further their studies or simply working or always waiting and concentraing on your careers. What is it with the society that everyone is so preoccupied with "success"? Am I not good enough? I am so fed up about life that everyday when I am alone I get so angry with people. Now I am becoming more selfish and cannot be bothered about other pple becos of this. I do not wish to be such a person but it seems like everyone is so selfish. Whatever happen to the good ol' days of love and simplicity? I really hate you girls. Hope you all rot in hell when you are single and old and unwanted. What am I to do? Is it so difficult to get attached?<br><br></div></blockquote>Hi TS,<br><br>While reading your post I can't help but feel sorry for you.<br>You remind me of my past many years ago. I put in my heart and soul into my previous 6 relationsips but all ended up in tragedy. Half of them are broken by 3rd party. I really yearned for a relationship until <span style="color: red;">I just gave up and <strong>let nature took its course</strong>.</span><br><br>Then I met this ex classmate which I wanted to woo during during sec sch days but had no guts to do it. We had not kept in contact for 7 years. Anyway she's my wife now.<br><br>Let nature take its course and don't force things. It doesn't matter if you're in your late 20s yet no gf. But by being forceful you become irritating and the girls will run away. Be gentle, caring, helpful but not obsessively. Let the chemistry come. After you're together, don't be pocessive. Like fishing. Sometimes you reel in sometimes you reel out. But every girl is different. Don't anyhow jump into a relationship whereby the girl has a wild nature. Then you'll be asking for trouble. Don't be chin chye in relationships. A marriage is a career you cannot easily say you want to quit.<br><br>Meanwhile, I would suggest that you concentrate on a career, preferably get a car too, find something which pays you well. Get a life in your career. Socialise with friends more, Know more people. It will aid you have a good relatiuonship.<br><br>All the best!<br><br></div>

All these are not exclusive to YOU.<br><br>But not everyone take every failure and become bitter and angry with the rest of the world about it. Life doesn't work out the way we want most of the time, and a man who shows he can handle his disappointments well despite all of it and still retain a sense of humour - IS attractive.<br><br>A person who ends up being whiney and self absorbed and think the whole world is against him - well think again, the whole world does not think you are important enough to attack you this way.
