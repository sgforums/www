"Assumptions are the mother of all $%&amp;*-ups" so dun assume that the girls are the one at fault here. chances are - u're so conceited by urself u didnt realise u're the one causing it.<br><br>hope this changes ur mindset and hope that it helps somehow.</div></blockquote>awww, im so touched that everyone agrees with me <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

I'm getting older by the day and I am still single. I am so tired of waiting already. I want very much to get married. I do not want to be 50 and visiting the red light district. Yet no matter what I do, I simply cannot get attached. I have tried to "woo" many girls yet everyone of them seems to be waiting for someone better or show lack of interest. What is wrong with you girls? Most either continue further their studies or simply working or always waiting and concentraing on your careers. What is it with the society that everyone is so preoccupied with "success"? Am I not good enough? I am so fed up about life that everyday when I am alone I get so angry with people. Now I am becoming more selfish and cannot be bothered about other pple becos of this. I do not wish to be such a person but it seems like everyone is so selfish. Whatever happen to the good ol' days of love and simplicity? I really hate you girls. Hope you all rot in hell when you are single and old and unwanted. What am I to do? Is it so difficult to get attached?<br><br></div></blockquote>What's wrong with being 50 and visiting the red light district?</div>
