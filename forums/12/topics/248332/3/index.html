I already very give in. Last time i not so thick skin one lor. i wun even put in so much effort. </div></blockquote>Thats where your problem lies. Try to be more tolerant . Its not easy i must say , but at least try. U sms her she must 100% reply eu is it? Call must answer is it? Eh uncle, you are not their boss okay? Dont expect them to follow you every ways and expectations. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Got limit? U mean got limit in patience ? If so, pls wake up ! For me, if the girl refuses to reply my sms i just ignore it and thinks that i just wasted my 1 cent worth of sms. U must have a screw loose in order to get angry. Really !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> If she is ur GF ofcuz angry lah. But friend friend nia leh, she cant possibly reply every sms u sent to her mahs. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>IMO, you seems like getting despo with the girls first, and you get frustrated with their actions. You seems like a demanding person to me. Try this, do not sms them too much. They may find you a pest. Thats why they ignore you. Imagine a girl sms you almost every 10mins. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>**Hmm what you wrote above seems too demanding for the girls. DO NOT expect them to reply whatever you sms-ed them . You aren't their BF and they wouldn't give a damn whether or not to reply ur sms or not. You aren't that special person in their eyes. Thats why .</div>

I'm getting older by the day and I am still single. I am so tired of waiting already. I want very much to get married. I do not want to be 50 and visiting the red light district. Yet no matter what I do, I simply cannot get attached. I have tried to "woo" many girls yet everyone of them seems to be waiting for someone better or show lack of interest. What is wrong with you girls? Most either continue further their studies or simply working or always waiting and concentraing on your careers. What is it with the society that everyone is so preoccupied with "success"? Am I not good enough? I am so fed up about life that everyday when I am alone I get so angry with people. Now I am becoming more selfish and cannot be bothered about other pple becos of this. I do not wish to be such a person but it seems like everyone is so selfish. Whatever happen to the good ol' days of love and simplicity? I really hate you girls. Hope you all rot in hell when you are single and old and unwanted. What am I to do? Is it so difficult to get attached?<br><br></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Glancing at your previous topic and connecting it to this, I can't help but to perceive you as a ranter.<br><br>You probably tried to work hard, but met with some dismaying results. From there, you got disgruntled and got rancorously resentful. I don't know how it actually seemed to you, but I don't think your mindset is improving your situation any bits.<br><br>You are like a man who gazed into the mirror and had no problem with what you see in the reflection. However, unknown to you, the enigma derive from your blind spots; areas where you can't see it yourself but definitely it's there. Yes, you may twist and turn in all direction hoping to spot the blemishes, but there's only a limit on how much vision a one piece mirror could offer you.<br><br>A woman walked by and easily spotted the maculation you failed to see. In your mind eye, you reckoned that you had no noticeable flaws that would fail your attempt in the chase, but obviously, that isn't the case. Rejections follow and gradually you grew bitter. The poison increased in intensity and soon, to protect both the fragile ego and our brittle mind, you had to rationalize it to be the fault of woman.<br><br>If you hate woman so much that you wished them 'single and old and unwanted', then why would you 'need' them so much?<br><br>Perhaps the fear of loneliness is inflicting you with insanity - you are largely driven by desperation, not maturity, and a terribly lack of wisdom.<br><br>Perhaps if you embrace humility and work yourself from within, you might be able to achieve better result. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

From there, you got disgruntled and got rancorously resentful. I don't know how it actually seemed to you, but I don't think your mindset is improving your situation any bits.<br><br>You are like a man who gazed into the mirror and had no problem with what you see in the reflection. However, unknown to you, the enigma derive from your blind spots; areas where you can't see it yourself but definitely it's there. Yes, you may twist and turn in all direction hoping to spot the blemishes, but there's only a limit on how much vision a one piece mirror could offer you.<br><br>A woman walked by and easily spotted the maculation you failed to see. In your mind eye, you reckoned that you had no noticeable flaws that would fail your attempt in the chase, but obviously, that isn't the case. Rejections follow and gradually you grew bitter. The poison increased in intensity and soon, to protect both the fragile ego and our brittle mind, you had to rationalize it to be the fault of woman.<br><br>If you hate woman so much that you wished them 'single and old and unwanted', then why would you 'need' them so much?<br><br>Perhaps the fear of loneliness is inflicting you with insanity - you are largely driven by desperation, not maturity, and a terribly lack of wisdom.<br><br>Perhaps if you embrace humility and work yourself from within, you might be able to achieve better result. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers </div></blockquote>wa kao, wise old man. how i wish my english as good as yrs. thanks. I understand but it's easy to listen but hard to do la. everyday i tell myself dun give up. take things easy. but very hard u know. especially when weekend comes. There so many new places coming up in Singapore yet I can't go with someone special. YEt thses places are crowded with loving couples and families. Even want to go overseas holiday also no one to go with. Got a stupid quote say, you are only young once, make full use of it. Seems like my youth will be wasted perhaps whole life also wasted. i dunno what i do to deserve all these.<br><br>yr last part "Perhaps if you embrace humility and work yourself from within, you might be able to achieve better result."<br>I seriously doubt so. Later I will be MR Nice guy. We all know what happens to MR Nice Guys. They get left behind.</div>

That is why women avoid the nice guys.<br><br>A jerk in the relationship context, is someone who have grown fed up with women. Frustration builds over the years and he has past the point of caring about women.<br><br>Loneliness however is still too hard for him bear.<br><br>He resorts to being constantly aggressive and flaunts his sexuality.<br><br>Why do I bother telling you all these?<br><br><strong>You are fed up with being a nice guy.<br><br>You need a healthy transition.<br><br>You are at a crossroad where there are two paths open to you right now.</strong><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nice guy -------&gt; Jerk</span></strong><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Loneliness however is still too hard for him bear.</span><br><br>Instead of finding out what causes the void and sense of emptiness in you, allow that frustration to build into anger and you will find yourself heading towards jerk land.<br><br>In the short run, you will enjoy a certain degree of success with women but you can never keep them.<br><br>The reason is simple.<br><br><strong>That sense of emptiness will not go away.</strong><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nice guy -------&gt; Good guy</span></strong><br><br>The good guy realizes one important truth.<br><br><strong>He can never be happy with a women unless he is happy being single.</strong><br><br>The truth prompts him to seek other ways to fill up the emptiness he feels.<br><br>You will obviously feel the need of intimacy along the way but you have to realize that you are way ahead of the nice guys and jerks.<br><br>Men who cannot get past the nice guy phase continue to buy their way into relationships to fill up that void they feel. They spend the rest of their days behaving like a doormat.<br><br>Men who cannot get past the jerk phase can never come close to living a life with passion as they base their success on a series of calculated maneuvers.<br><br><strong>Nice guys survive.<br><br>Jerks exist.<br><br>You on the other hand can choose to truly live.</strong><br><br>Take care.<br></div>
