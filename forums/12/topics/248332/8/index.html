And if she interested, she won't be cold liao. AND HOR, if beginning a bit not interested but friends pushing, then waa, for SURE won't develop liao cos of all the pressure. Love is between 2 parties, not the whole world.<br><br>2) Love at first sight? *snort* no la.. not desperate. Immature only. You can have LIKE at first sight - but love? Do u know what is love or not? And like at first sight - needs time to know and see and understanding. Plus.. u like at first sight doesnt mean she must respond.<br><br>3) See? people tell u honest views, you want to think of other things. Well, then you are right. A guy who thinks he is not good enough for a girl (so he gives up), then i agree sure is loh. Cos he never takes the effort to understand WHY.<br><br>4) If you want to believe it is everyone's problem then just have to look around you and see how many normal looking people, with normal character, earnin average pay, having average careers - are attached, married, and settled down.<br><br></div>

Girls please enlighten me. WHy is it when I tell a girl I like her thru a friend, she will like avoid me?Is it becos of my looks or shy or what?</div></blockquote>1) It sounds rather cowardly.<br><br>2) It suggest that u do not have a mind of your own (maybe mummy's boy? Anything also may need mama's advice and help? Sounds wussy)<br><br>3) What biz has it got to do with that "friend"? Why do u need to go thru that "friend"?<br><br>4) Lack sincerity. Sounds like 13 years old tactic instead of behaviour expected fr an adult.<br><br>5) Lastly, what do u expect the gal to do? Come up to you and proudly declare, "I Love You" too?<br><br>Aww... c'mon!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
