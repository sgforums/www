(unless its like in a group of friends where u can slowly nurture things.)<br><br>cos if the girl sense bad vibes from u, chances are u will get left alone.<br>i'm what u would call a kid but i definately know that first impression is really important. like if u have a stable status or have some car. the girl will tend to be more interested, NOT that they're materialistic, but its cos they are somehow assured that this guy has a stable income and life and if i were to be with him for life, i should do ok.(unless u're eating air to just support the car).<br><br>and maybe most of u won't agree with me(cos i'm still a student, therefore no income). u buy them gifts, u treat them - i think they'll just feel u're trying to "BUY" them.<br><br>oh ya, one more thing. how is ur communication with them like? doesn't mean u keep sms or call them means ur communication is good. good communication is very important. a girl may even fancy u if she feels that u 2 can communicate well.<br><br>and when u say u're a guy when people ask u to doll up. i think u're too old fashioned. and whats wrong with guys putting on make-up?(not that i do, unless u count moisturisers). taking care of ur skin and ur body shape is really important. imagine u know someone who doesn't look good(no offence to anyone), u may give her ur no.(like she gives u hers) but doesn't mean u will contact the person after that meeting anymore. prehaps a change of ur outlook would be good.<br><br>character wise, i'm not very good too (but thank god i've an understanding girl). but really it pays off to have a proper character. cos chances are everyone has limits(even u), the girl will just be fed-up with u and bye-bye goes ur chance.<br><br>IMHO,by the way. i learnt this from a movie. "Assumptions are the mother of all $%&amp;*-ups" so dun assume that the girls are the one at fault here. chances are - u're so conceited by urself u didnt realise u're the one causing it.<br><br>hope this changes ur mindset and hope that it helps somehow.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>u got some attitude error.<br><br>being alone is not sad or scary thing.<br><br>it maybe bad that u are single but you have got to accept reality.<br><br>i can see that complaining and ranting is ur way of relieving the stress you have.<br><br>but you have to learn to manage your stress also. cannot means that you have stress means that you can start blaming and blaming.<br><br>why not try to work on yourself so that when you realize that you are alone and single, you do not experience the stress or fear.<br><br>i can see also that you are pretty much consume by your ego.<br>manage your own ego, and dun let it be the devil in you and allow it to quarrel within you , to tell you to scold pple and all that.<br><br>look at it this way, you should know that the world is not exactly fair. it is possible that you may be the only one in the world single, just like it is possible that princess diana become princess and was chased by a particular car , and chased along a particular way, and she met with the car accident in a particular fashion and ended her life.<br><br>open your eyes to the real world. Reality does caused suffering and unfairness to people by pure chance and casuality. it can happen to everyone in whatever ways.<br><br>there is no GOD to ensure happiness and fairness. and the evidence are many. i am atheist btw and just spread my stance also here.<br><br>hope you will mature and be more understanding towards nature of reality.<br><br></div>
