            <div class='col-md body'>Sounds like you need to step out of your comfort zone.  Pick up new hobbies.. take up classes.  Get out more.  Take interest in your existing friends' hobbies.  If you hole yourself indoors, u'll never get anywhere with ur social life.  You'll never have anything to talk about, either.

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm also a loner. Maybe because I was born an only child and do not see the need to interact at a large scale with people. But I'm quite wary of befriending people, especially those who only interact with you for their own motivations and not because they really like or want to know you as a friend. I have a small circle of friends whom I do interact with once in a while but really, people like me who are relatively more quiet and less talkative are generally easily forgotten at certain moments.<br><br>I like to treat people with sincerity and in the past, I wanted to be an ultimate and loyal friend but past experiences thought me that very often, the loyal, steady and quiet friend is bypassed for a more interesting fellow. When there are troubles, they would be touched when I'm there but when the crisis is over, everything is back to normal and i'm again overlooked.<br><br>People out there do not really understand me; they think I'm pretty much open. It is surprising when even my closer friends do not believe that I'm shy and reserved internally. Maybe because I would greet people who I'm acquianted with, rather than acting that I didn't see them when i did (which is a habit of most people these days).<br><br>Now, I'm maybe more realistic and unless there is a real friend who is destined to be met, I have no high hopes in the people around me. These days, I don't want to pressure myself to create topics of interest, just to entertain the other party; maybe, I'm too lazy and I rather someone accept me as who I am than who I try to pretend to be. And I'm accepting the fact that most friends come and go, ultimately you will move on in your life.. different paths everyone will take and eventually, you face your end alone.<br></div>
