              <p><br> Keep your jokes light and don't get yourself involved inside your
                  own jokes, especially when  you're with  your family
                  members.</p>
              <p>Friends and other blah blahs outside don't need to take you
                  seriously and they aren't really obliged to care and provide
                  real concern for you.</p>
              <p>Family are different, they may be the nastiest aliens you were
                  forced to live with since you were born, but they are always there
                  for you....despite using their own unique ways to show care and
                  concern and love for you.</p>
              <p>As a living breathing family member inside your family, YOU MUST
                  ALSO SHOW CARE AND CONCERN FOR THEM. Doesn't means people must
                  always show concern to you one-sidedly. Unless you tell me you're
                  not capable of showing real genuine concern for your family
                  members, then I will ask you to start learning to do that while you
                  still can and while they are still around you.</p>
              <p>What if one day they are not around? Is that what you want? I
                  will give you the benefit of the doubt if you can tell me you can
                  take care of your home by yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>I know the difficulties faced when a single girl need to live
                  alone.</p>

              <p>I think the brother over-reacted.</p>
              <p>True that family should help each other when in need.</p>
              <p>However, You shouldn't condone family members abusing each other in the name of "family".</p>
              <p>His/her brother needs anger management.</p>
              <p>Domestic violence/abuse dont just happen between husband and wife.</p>
              <p>Sibling abuse is a huge problem in our society too. The abuser becomes someone else's abusive spouse or abusive parent, and the vicious cycle continues.</p>
