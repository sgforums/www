Perhaps she may mean everything to you, but you are not necessarily at the center of her universe.<br><br>I won't pull any punches - you are being both too sensitive and selfish. If you're going to act this way when you're trying to woo her, I can imagine you becoming even more possessive and sensitive if you get attached to her.<br><br>She has a life outside of a friendship with you, and it'll do you a whole lot of good to remember that.</div>

Try asking her out.<br><br>one more thing: most gals reply positively. That does not mean they are into you. U shd not expect anything in return unless she did not reply to you at all...then you have the right to be angry. But then again, they cud really have forgotten to reply to you. But that is a warning sign to you that she is not really into you after all. Take in mind you dun own her. You can't really force her to like you. Either she likes you or she doesn't.<br><br>Ask her out and you will know the answer.</div>
