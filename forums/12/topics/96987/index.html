She msg you daily.. becos she might treat you as a very good friend.. She also mentioned that she hates to be alone.. that makes her point stronger about the sms daily thing..<br><br>She shocked about people telling her.. cos.. she always feel that you both are good friends.. and why suddenly they will put you 2 as an item.. What you think is all based on your own feelings.. Certain things.. you need to think the other side of it..
