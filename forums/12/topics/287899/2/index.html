In fact, she didn't leave you; she just decided not to remain in contact. You see, you can't go 'out' if you are technically not even 'in' right in the beginning, so how can you claim that she has left you?<br><br>Also, who are you to her, may I ask?<br><br>Nobody actually - an online friend at best.<br><br>Why used the word 'betrayed'? You do not even have the status to condemn that charge to her, other than being fooled into thinking that she is into you. Looking at different perspective, your kindness is pretty much a facade too - expecting something just because you are 'nice'?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br><blockquote><strong>i AM NOT USED TO IT. i HAVE GROWN SO ATTACHED to her by now</strong></blockquote><br><br>What's this? Just because you are not used to it and just because you have invested time and money into her, she has to like what? Marry you? Or have sex?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I am not trying to hurl stones at someone who has just fallen; I am letting you visualise the backstage process in your blind pursuit. In fact, this love is narcissistic; you are almost like in love with yourself because everything materialised as a mirage - surreal and nothing substantial.<br><br>You were thinking along this plot: met a girl on the internet, she was in bad shape and you, the prince, came over and saved the damsel in distress. Got closer and a great love fostered.<br><br>Everything in which you reckoned, ended up flipping into the real chapter of the story you never knew it existed.<br><br>Her plot were much simpler - met a gullible guy, suck what I need from him, dump him before it becomes too much trouble and NEXT!<br><br>And you claimed to be heartbroken over such a woman?<br><br>Should you slap yourself awake?
