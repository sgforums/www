She would cry when you go away for a long time, she would shed her tears of joy when you return. And when making love, she would takes more initiative to satisfy her love one, she would be looking for sign of love bite in your body by other gal too.<br><br>If you can find a gal as above, you would had found true love, treasure and cherish it dearly. Other than that she only act to gain or to repay your help, she can treat it as hugging money, holding a stick, kissing a toad and embracing a tree trunk. Tears are for joy, with no love, of course no tears lah.<br><br>Like it or not, learn to forget her, there are many other angels like me around who are much better and caring for their love ones.<br><br>Along came a spider, and you are stuck with it.<br><br></div>

I would advise you to change ur grooming and try to apply reverse psycology by trying not to be so attentive to her whennever theres chance for you all to meet or communicate.</div>

Some may look for soul mates. Others want a mentor. And it's common for others to pursue providers who can furnish them financial security. IMHO, everyone has their own history and reasons for doing what they do.<br><br>Back to your questions, women only leave men when they lose interest in what's on offer. When women leave you, they rarely turn back. I think your biggest weakness is buying her affection (meals and money) in the beginning, then putting yourself in the position of being the chosen instead of the chooser (by asking whether will she go for you again).<br><br>Women want men with a strong attitude and a good life. Women don't want squishy romantic heroes who can't live without them. Just move on and do your own thing. If she wants she can come back to you.<br><br></div>

You're most probably in love with the image you have built of her and not the actual she herself. So much so that you actually overlook her feelings. If you have gotten so besotted with that unrealistic image of her and not the actual her, I am telling you from my point of view that I would be turned off myself too.<br><br>So on the other hand if you truly love her and she wants to go,<br>letting her go is also a form of love.<br><br>[quote]Originally posted by soleachip:<br><br><strong>Women want men with a strong attitude and a good life.
