I practically drag myself to work everyday..  just got scolded by my sale guy last friday for not able to complete one of his tasks..he shouted at me infront of my team..i nearly cried. was trying hard to hold back my tears.<br><br>there are alot of datelines i have to meet.. plus remembering some customers' arrangment for delievery.<br><br>the segregation in the office is rather bad. Sales people hardly socialised with the admin/operations people . Yah they are considered the kings and queens in the office coz they bring in the money . but dun simply disregard the support team.<br><br>maybe u guys may think i am a coward.. loser.. for not able to withstand this.  i really dunnno.. i even have to be afriad of wat my bf is gonna say if he finds out i just leave the job like that.  he knows how i feel these few weeks, and he thinks i can go thru it for at least 3 mths.  that adds on to the pressure and stress in me.<br><br>i am on urgent leave this friday, hence will not be going office ..i do not have many personal stuff on my desk..just one cup and bottle.<br><br>so can i actually send them my letter? pls help.<br>[/b]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think u can ask the HR for earlier termination. Tell them about how u feel. It's normal to terminate early. The contract is not so strict and binding, as long as both parties agree, there's no problem........Find someone who can make the decision while ur manager is away. (to terminate early).<br><br>If u cant find someone who can decide, then contact ur manager or wait for him. Ask for early termination.....<br><br>Remember to emphasize ur 'burned-out/ stressed out/ unhappy/ can't continue any more' situation while talking to HR or ur manager. They're unlikely to ask u to continue.......Probably u can stop working on that same day or the next day.....<br><br>But if u r really required to serve the 2 weeks, then just do it.....Don't stress urself in the 2 weeks time, take it easy....In the meantime, don't worry about making mistakes or missing deadlines, like u used to worry. Just work as usual and everything will be ok. Basically u know the ropes already. Be more confident. Cruise for 2 weeks.<br><br>And let everybody know u r leaving. They will start to put less pressure on u, expect less from u, and maybe assign some of ur tasks to other people. All this will help to reduce ur stress.<br><br>And don't worry abt ur BF......explain u r stressed out. He won't think less of u or be disappointed with u. Get a better job and impress him.<br><br>And more importantly.....u know u should really consider a job carefully from now on.</div>

Submit your resignation and request for an earlier termination with no compensation. EXPLAIN the situation to the HR and hope they should understand... If all's well then good for you.. Else...<br><br>Submit for resignation with 2 weeks' notice. Doing this period, don't overstress yourself anymore. If you feel that you can't take it, just 'break down' (meaning you just stop, not asking you to wait till you really break down and go crazy) at work and stop there. Can't do? Go see a doctor. Tell the doctor your problem and request for a long medication leave...<br><br>I wish you well.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>snowy.. can i ask u .. u jus step into this working society not long izzit?<br><br>From what you said abt your works.. i dont find it any problem with that. I work as sales co-ordinator before and beside all the sales paperworks, i still have more things to do... example, prepare report for my directors to send to japan and that got deadline too. I m also a secretary to my sales manager.  I m like you.. when i first accepting this job, my assistant sales manager scold me too but if you are right.. tell him back.. if you are the one in wrong.. jus accept it. That is life.  But after sometimes.. i did earn respect from them. NOne of the salesman dare to shout at me anymore. They know i m not that kind they can bully. LIke what u mention one of the salesman scold u cos u couldnt finish his task. Tell him.. you only got one hand and if you are the only one doing that.. tell him next time give the task earlier.<br><br>But i guess you already make up your mind to resign.. so all the best to you for your future jobs. Remember working life is never smooth.</div>

Then, you can leave the company the next day! On top of that, they won't give you that 2 week's of pay!</div>
