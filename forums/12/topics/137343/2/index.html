Tell them about how u feel. It's normal to terminate early. The contract is not so strict and binding, as long as both parties agree, there's no problem........Find someone who can make the decision while ur manager is away. (to terminate early).<br><br>If u cant find someone who can decide, then contact ur manager or wait for him. Ask for early termination.....<br><br>Remember to emphasize ur 'burned-out/ stressed out/ unhappy/ can't continue any more' situation while talking to HR or ur manager. They're unlikely to ask u to continue.......Probably u can stop working on that same day or the next day.....<br><br>But if u r really required to serve the 2 weeks, then just do it.....Don't stress urself in the 2 weeks time, take it easy....In the meantime, don't worry about making mistakes or missing deadlines, like u used to worry. Just work as usual and everything will be ok. Basically u know the ropes already. Be more confident. Cruise for 2 weeks.<br><br>And let everybody know u r leaving. They will start to put less pressure on u, expect less from u, and maybe assign some of ur tasks to other people. All this will help to reduce ur stress.<br><br>And don't worry abt ur BF......explain u r stressed out. He won't think less of u or be disappointed with u. Get a better job and impress him.<br><br>And more importantly.....u know u should really consider a job carefully from now on. </div></blockquote>==&gt; I like your points very much, it is so pertinent and encouraging... one thing I would like to emphasize, if you could find a job first, then submit the resign letter, would be ideal, but based on your case, maybe you have to resign first liao.. don't put a shadow on yourself, not everyjob, every colleague, every company like that, you will find a better one, jia you.. =====<br><br></div>
