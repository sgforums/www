Being passive serve much reason for your plight as well; other forumites calls it the lack of courage, but I reckon it to be passiveness. Lack of courage means you DESIRE to do something strongly, but LACK the strength to implement (E.g. chasing a girl). Passiveness refers to the non-chalent, easier-on-emotions-route to undertake, which ultimately goes nowhere and probably end up in Limbo. You may even have opportunity placed right in front of you to leave, but opportunity is still often left untouched, while a lack of courage with correct opportunity would be grasp immediately. It is easier route because it buys you some time and wouldn't create much changes to your exisiting situations (People often resist changes and if you want to implement something, big changes are bound to happen). It is so much easier, say, if you were to remain in your marriage (appease your parents), suck all your dis-satisfaction into your mind (appease husband, fear of psychological affecting child-upbringing), etc.<br><br>You may not realise, you may have subconsciously chose to maintain in the relationship, despite finding no Love in it... just for the sake of it - whatever it means to you. To some, it could be the length of time together... your baby... society's bondage... parental influence... and all other external factors.<br><br>There are many people out there remaining in unfulfilling relationship for reasons other than Love. They often lament about how CMI their relationship is, but you still see them clinging onto their relationship, which makes many wonder why.<br><br>No... the fact is that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>it is they who chose to retain their relationship.</strong></span> Nobody else did... nobody else HAD the power, regardless of how you thought others might have the power to do so (This is the Second Law of Love).<br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I believe you have already decide what you want to do and I am not doing to change what you had already plan for yourself. I just want to offer my thesis to complement your self-reflection.<br><br>Actual Love or not... you decide. Once bitten twice shy? Will you exercise more wisdom in your decision? Or would your continue your foolishness even further?
