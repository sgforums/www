              <p>Here`s the problem . I`m a 20 year old loafer. I`ve been slacking and partying all my freaking life . Then recently i saw this old friend of mine who i haven`t seen since secondary school days . Which is about 4 years ago.</p>
              <p>She used to be a ta jie ta in my school , always smoking in the toilet and bossing people around . At that time she seemed like the typical ah lian whose life will go no where but down hill. But a few days back when i saw her she was so mature and kind of gave a lecture in life .</p>
              <p>She told me she went to poly cause she retook her o lvls. And i told her that i was still in poly and slacking as usual . Then she asked me if i was still hanging out with this group of slackers which i call friends. Then of course i said no as not to lose face. But then in actual fact i`m still hanging around with my so called friends. Then she said all this stuff about how great her life is now with a part-time job at this big company which she worked for in attachment ( she also got AD for attachment ). And she also told me she did some self studying in her free time . Like studying how to use ADOBI and such computer stuff. I have never in my life study something which will not be tested in my exam . SAD.</p>
              <p>Guess how much was her freaking gpa 3.9. WTF 3.9 is confrim impossible for me to reach . my GPA is only like 1.5 . SAD i know . All i get for my exams are just pass and i have to retake half a year in poly.</p>
              <p>So it suddenly came to me that i should change my life and stop slacking partyin going out when i`m bored . I should really sit down and study . And should be like her who was a past ah lian ( now a super mature and smart girl ) .</p>
              <p>But the truth is . It`s harder said then done . I`ve though of it . If i were to be like her and study study . My grades would be better i think . And then maybe i could get into a uni. But if i did that wont i become a geek ? And everytime i think of sitting down and studying , i would end up playing . Even playing with anything thats on my table .</p>
              <p>And i just realise i dont even know wat i would want to work as in a few years time . I dont think a diploma can bring u very far in this day and age . I totally have no plan for my future. I decided to post here and get help from you guys because i`ve tried talking to my slacking friends and i always get the same reply. AYA DONT THINK SO MUCH.</p>
              <p>But i think it`s time i think . If i dont think now when am i going to start. And if u guys could tell me if i could get into any uni if let`s say my GPA is like 2.5. Cause my gpa sucks now even if i worked hard and get good grades i think it can only bring it up to 2.5. I dont wanna retake my poly . It`s wasting 3 years of my life . And about SAT`s exam is it like anyone could take it ? Or do u have to have a good gpa to take the SAT exams. I really wanna make a U turn in my life .</p>
              <p>Pls help me Thanks.</p>

              <p>to the ts, here's my own story..</p>
              <p>i was from maris stella high and was expelled due to fights and then got accepted into zhonghua sec express. i was a very playful teen during the younger days and didn't make it thru to sec 4 and repeated my sec 3.</p>
              <p>i scored pretty well for my o lvls and went on to poly. decided that it would be the turning point in life for me to excel. i was doing pretty well during my 1st semester and got really satisfied with my grades, however, i lost my father to cancer back then and had my semesters all jumbled up, also without the motivation to study without my usual friends i had during orientation.</p>
              <p>every modules that i took, people didnt really care much nor did they include me in project discussions. scoring good grades was difficult and finally, i dropped out from poly during my year 3.</p>
              <p>now, i am still serving NS and have grown mature a little and decided to take on my studies again at SIM, taking my bachelors now in computer science. so far, scoring an average B for my subjects.</p>
              <p>just wanna say, u can do it, its just ur mindset and don be afraid that people look at u as a geek. the one who laughs last, laugh the most <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/wink.png" alt="wink.png"></p>

              <p>if you really desire to change, you can and will.</p>
              <p>change takes determination and discipline. nothing is impossible in this world, save by your own willpower.</p>

              <p>in another 20 years, you will be 40! and the next, will be 60! every year passed, is one step closer to the coffin.</p>
