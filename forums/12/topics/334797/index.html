              <p>Here`s the problem . I`m a 20 year old loafer. I`ve been slacking and partying all my freaking life . Then recently i saw this old friend of mine who i haven`t seen since secondary school days . Which is about 4 years ago.</p>
              <p>She used to be a ta jie ta in my school , always smoking in the toilet and bossing people around . At that time she seemed like the typical ah lian whose life will go no where but down hill. But a few days back when i saw her she was so mature and kind of gave a lecture in life .</p>
              <p>She told me she went to poly cause she retook her o lvls. And i told her that i was still in poly and slacking as usual . Then she asked me if i was still hanging out with this group of slackers which i call friends. Then of course i said no as not to lose face. But then in actual fact i`m still hanging around with my so called friends. Then she said all this stuff about how great her life is now with a part-time job at this big company which she worked for in attachment ( she also got AD for attachment ). And she also told me she did some self studying in her free time . Like studying how to use ADOBI and such computer stuff. I have never in my life study something which will not be tested in my exam . SAD.</p>
              <p>Guess how much was her freaking gpa 3.9. WTF 3.9 is confrim impossible for me to reach . my GPA is only like 1.5 . SAD i know . All i get for my exams are just pass and i have to retake half a year in poly.</p>
              <p>So it suddenly came to me that i should change my life and stop slacking partyin going out when i`m bored . I should really sit down and study . And should be like her who was a past ah lian ( now a super mature and smart girl ) .</p>
              <p>But the truth is . It`s harder said then done . I`ve though of it . If i were to be like her and study study . My grades would be better i think . And then maybe i could get into a uni. But if i did that wont i become a geek ? And everytime i think of sitting down and studying , i would end up playing . Even playing with anything thats on my table .</p>
              <p>And i just realise i dont even know wat i would want to work as in a few years time . I dont think a diploma can bring u very far in this day and age . I totally have no plan for my future. I decided to post here and get help from you guys because i`ve tried talking to my slacking friends and i always get the same reply. AYA DONT THINK SO MUCH.</p>
              <p>But i think it`s time i think . If i dont think now when am i going to start. And if u guys could tell me if i could get into any uni if let`s say my GPA is like 2.5. Cause my gpa sucks now even if i worked hard and get good grades i think it can only bring it up to 2.5. I dont wanna retake my poly . It`s wasting 3 years of my life . And about SAT`s exam is it like anyone could take it ? Or do u have to have a good gpa to take the SAT exams. I really wanna make a U turn in my life .</p>
              <p>Pls help me Thanks.</p>

              <p>Change is can change... doesnt mean u cant go party anymore right ? U must know ur priorities liaw la. at 20 i still partying la.. graduate liaw still party until today. So i think its still o.k.  lol</p>
              <p>You gotta motivate urself. U gotta have a plan. U gotta have focus and discipline. If u can discipline urself at the gym , just apply it to ur studies. Manage ur time, give urself routines and then some flexible time for other things. Think positive. Look at the light at the end of the tunnel. Small sacrifice now for bigger gain.</p>
              <p>I dunno about ur SAT exams.. or shit GPA. All i know is u can do it. Dont underestimate the powers of ur own capabilities. Diploma can still go far. After u get ur diploma u can go get ur degree. Work at diploma also good. But my advice is get a degree if u can, cause now is good time to study. Economy going to shits anyway. Get some knowledge. U still got few years.</p>
              <p>Looking at ur friend should motivate u. Ur friends can still be ur friends as long as they are not actively or physically preventing u from achieving ur goals or studies ma right ? Maybe u can motivate ur slack friends also ma. But importantly is what u wanna do , and sometimes what u want is not easy to get, but not impossible.</p>
              <p>U can still U-turn. At least u realise now. I only started to realise what i really really want ... like last year ? hahaha</p>
              <p>U can do it! Hell yeah!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>SAT exams i think u nid it if u are going overseas to persue ur uni education. And is not a very easy exam from what i noe cos sometimes students from the JCs at Bukit Timah also complain some of the subject quite difficult.</p>
              <p>CHANGE, U NID! to improve your grades and  your overall academic performance you to to change your lifestyle. how? heres a few suggestions</p>
              <p>1. find a few frens (studious ones )to study together, say in library?</p>
              <p>2. if u feel bored n dun feel lyk studying, hit the gym or do do some physical activites, a good way to channel that extra energy out, afterall its better thn constant clubbing rite? quite heavy on the wallet to come to think of it.</p>
              <p>3. most importantly, move away from frens that influence u negatively.</p>
              <p>4. be practical. dun think of getting a high GPA after all the hardwork, but expect a gradual increase in your workload and result, so that u will not be burnt out and discouraged so easily.</p>
              <p>5. to put it bluntly, given your current GPA of 1.5 its hard for u to get into any uni. but nevertheless, you shld at least put in full effort to secure a diploma, when u come out n work, u still can contninue to go for nite clases to upgrade yourself.</p>

              <p>4-5 years of hardship now is nothing compared with 40 over years of hardship in the future after u graduate...so think wisely.</p>
              <p>there is no stupid ppl in this world, they let themselves become stupid because they are lazy..i assume you are just lazy to put in effort to study ( ya stop slacking ).</p>
              <p>your mentality also must change..dun keep say u cant achieve this and that..is actually self fulfilling prophecy happenin rite now to you.</p>
              <p>take things one step at a time..just dun use shortcut everytime u encounter problems in your study, slowly tackle it and know whats the core of the problem.</p>

              <p><br>I dont think i have studying friends . Cause most if not all of my friends are slackers. I also rather hit the gym then studying . I`ve been going to the gym 4 times in a week . I think i have to study as much as i gym. Maybe like u said i should slowly increase my workload then i wont get bored that easily . THANKS</p>
