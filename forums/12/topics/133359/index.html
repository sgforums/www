Its simply something to do with two individuals....one wanting something, the other not so sure.<br><br>Love and attraction are very difficult things to explain and analyse, aren't they?

Blown-off limbs, like those poor children in Sierra Leone, can't grow back with time.  Worse, some have infected wounds, resulting in gangrene/infection, &amp; then they die.

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, sadly, he didn't get her in the end. His life still needs to go on, he still needs to work, he still needs to make a living, cos mother earth never stops spinning.<br><br>Although the depression has sub-sided, he still can't forget her, he tried to numb his feelings by marrying himself to his job. He'll learn to be a better person. Some things are meant to be, some things are not. Itz better to know the cruel truth earlier than to drag it and wastes everyone's time, like I said, time will never stop for anyone.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by GaLtwenty:</div><div class="quote_body">Personally know of this guy, my colleague who is going after a gal for a very long time and madly obsessed about her.
