            <div class='col-md body'>bladez87...I have read your posts in this topic and I felt that she is only interested in being just friends with you and nothing more than that.<br><br>She probably has a bf already or already has somebody she likes. Next time just ask her directly as a friend who wants to know more about her. Ermm...make her laugh first before you enquire about her avaliability status, it makes her less defensive/suspicious with your question.<br><br>Good luck.<br></div>
