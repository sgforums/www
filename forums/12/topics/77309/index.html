Did not understand what she want to get stuck with the jerk. Thats wat she says:<br><br>when she first got to know him, everythink was lovey dovey. because she was hurt by love many times (never knew why she never seems to wake up from it) she decide to put a test to a him. She said she kissed a guy but actually she didnt, just pop over a guy hse she knew for two days but she know this fellow for a few years bcos he happens to b her ex-classmate ex-bf. Her bf came to plead but she refuse to soften ( bet she mus b feeling terrible, she those devoted  type ) and problems start arising. before this cease, another start, she used to out smart a guy, becos the guy cld nt get wat he wanted, he spread tales about her, of cos ppl believe him becos she is wild but not loose. than everytink she started to do seems wrong to her bf... waking up early in morning to hlp him type his resume, bought a hp for him which he complain no wap, don wan, pop over to his hse almost everyday and return (one stay west,one stayed north and she has to study and work), he keeps shouting at her for the slightest tinks and when my friend got mad and shouted back, he blames her. so there is point of time she got so mad and went out with guy friends (happen to ask her out) than i dunno how a fight broke up between them (her guy friends and her) than becos of previous incident i mention, she went to test her bf again, saying she did sth physical with them (tt point of time they were broke up) but actually she didnt do anytink physical with them. the tinks got so intense between those friends and her tt she worries the guy might spout nonsense so she wanted to test out how he wld react if they really sabotage her. great.. now straight after this incident, everythink become worse. in fact, i tink he treats her like a toy, he always wanted to get physical, when my friend refuse, he gets mad. now he says what he treats her is becos wat she had done.. omg.. my fren did nth unfaithful. he scolds her when the tinks she wanted to eat is in a crowded area.. list = endless...<br><br>pls..forumers.. tell me your opinion, whose right whose wrong? what can i do as her friend to help... I cant bear seeing her come crying to me almost everyday. I tried telling her to let go but she cant seems to... I m clueless of what to do.</div></blockquote>There is no right or wrong. I hate to sae dis, but dis is 1 side of da story, maybe da opposition got another version? In my pt of view, da main concern is not to noe whos right or wrong, BUT how to help yr fren overcome dis tide.<br><br>I have quite a few frens who recently have r/s prob oso lah. Every1 whom I "lectured", I used diff approach. for yr fren case, I cant tell U wats da best wae coz honestly I dunno. All I noe is: yr fren need some1 to rely on in times of despair &amp; disappointment. Be there for her coz if U r not, who will take dat place? So might as well take initiative to concern yr fren more, listen to wat she has to sae. lend her yr ear, time, attention &amp; care. She will be grateful for dat when she settles down.</div>

Romance and 'perfect' loving... Yes... These don't happen only in dramas... They happens in life too... They happens at the <span style="font-style: italic;">moment</span> when you see them happening... That also comes to the point... The moments she shared with her bf... Good times... Bad times.... I don't usually believe (though not impossible) that it'll be just complete sh|t between a couple.. From a beginning... Till the end... Otherwise they probably won't have got together in the 1st place? And your friend probably indulge too much into the 'pieces of perfect love'....<br><br>Imagine yourself reading a love novel... Starting... Then you starts to cry... Then happy for how a couple managed to 'overcome' their mishaps.... Then cry again when it ends a tragic tale... Your friend here has turned the pages back to the moments of 'happiness'... Virtually staring at them... Not wanting to turn the pages, she refuse to let go....<br><br>It would also be surprising if there're none happy moments at all in her relationship..? If that's the case then we probably won't even have to urge her to let it go? She'll probably just as easily choose to end it herself? Yup....<br><br>So let's put some things aside for now? Forget the part where she actually 'tested' him... And the part where he's actually a jerk...<br><br>Finally it all still boils down to what they want in this relationship? Is it going in the correct direction? For both of them...?<br><br>My <strong>AFTERWORDS</strong>...<br><br>Your gf is pathetic... Do mention some of the appropriate things that I've mentioned here to her? If you deliever it well, it should make her think a bit and figure things out by herself...<br><br>I don't know what happened to the bf. But from the way you've described him, he certainly don't sound too good? (for whatever reasons which might have caused him to be like that...)<br><br>Your gf is very much depressed. Not only because of the direct impact from the relationship.. But more like from the 'indirect' one... She's kinda trapped within it, so it'll probably make it kinda hard to see... Besides.. She ain't really the kinda material which would think very clear mindedly...<br><br>There're mainly 2 things about the failure of her to handle the current situation (we won't be mentioning about the bf's faults here. Not that he's not at fault, but he's kinda 'far-reached' for now.. So I'll just put him as an 'external factor')...<br><br>1. Her nature. She usually don't think very clear mindedly. She's witty and creative in thinking but her thinking patterns are usually unstable. (Hence, she'll need much guidance. In this case probably would be you. Be a bit more firm and harsh at times if you have to.)<br><br>2. Her altered nature. Due to her relationship, she's very much under a 'suppressed nature'. How long have this relationship been going on? For as long as it has been in this form, she've probably suffered equally long.. And because of her own nature, it'll probably make it VERY OBVIOUS (she complaining and behaving like a crazy woman from time to time) or not obvious at all (If her nature is quite pre-dominance and she have been behaving like this all the time...)...<br><br>For the 2nd point (this is important), I would advise her to give herself a bit of a chance to 'open up' and break free...<br><br>Take either a short break from her bf (go for all the things she wanna do, meet the people she wanna meet and make more friends...) or take a CLEAN CLEAR break off with him...<br><br>I'm not suggesting that her bf is so bad that she'll just have to break up with him and there won't be a future for this relationship... (in fact I won't really know for now as limited is mentioned about her bf...)<br><br>But she'll just have to take the 'track' to feel the difference for herself... Not saying that life would be better without her bf... But her current lifestyle with her bf totally don't fit her... If she does as suggested, she should be able to comprehense what I'm trying to say....<br><br>And for that important step, I hope it'll greatly aid her in making a clearer and better decision for herself as to whether she wants this relationship or not.. And how she should be going about tackling it if she still wants the relationship...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Regards.<br></div>
