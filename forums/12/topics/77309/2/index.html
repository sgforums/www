Defending your friend is one thing/matter. And i'll respect your decision.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Let's say she's going into another relationship.

She probably had nightmare and wld jus add on to her insecurities and her self confidence. She probably need a rare species lover to change her... one who understands y she become like tt and tolerate her and use the appropriate med on her but such ppl... is almost impossible.. not that is none.. but maybe not in her life... at least not for now.<br><br>The one advice i will give her : tink before u act, don repeat the same mistake again... u cant turn back time... do wat is right and not regret and try to salvage the situation later. If she insists... i wld tell her straight.. she has to bear the conseqences... but more importantly I will ask is she ready for the relationship&gt;&gt;&gt; don hope into one if u cant let go the past nightmare... everytink jus gonna be the same...<br><br>if that is going to satisfy ur queries</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your friend must be out of her mind to test guys on this issue....all guys would be angry if their gf tell them what she did to another guys.Am i rite Guys??She causes all these problems and she cant blame anyone except her.I doubt no guys will accept her if she does this kind of things which she claims is a lie.<br><br>For my point of view,i think the guy is very good to still carry on this relationship wif her given the things she does even though all these she claims is a lie. If she is hurt by relationship many times, I doubt she cant be of any good gal(no offence) given the way she test guy and given the fact she can pop over to guy's house so willingly.<br><br>She must be very young rite?High chance not virgin....hehehe</div>
