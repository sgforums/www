            <div class='col-md body'>Do you enjoy thinking and behaving like a girl as well when you are not in drag? If you do, you may need to seek professional help. A therapist should be able to help you decide what you really want for yourself.<br><br>If not, it could probably just be a harmless outward expression of an inner fixation with women clothing. As long as it does not affect your social life, especially your relationships with your partner and family, you should not be too bothered by general public opinion on cross-dressing. You'll probably outgrow it when the thrill wears off.<br><br>However, be aware that the public would not be as tolerant as your loved ones may be, so in order not to cause offense unintentionally, it is not recommended that you wear the lingerie to school or work.</div>
