Noble and ambitious as you may be with regard to what you feel guys should do, it's easy to forget girls have a role to play to sustain this relationship too.<br><br>The fact you can state something along the lines of "i feel more like the bf now" just sums up what's so wrong about your relationship and your maturity - I'm sure that guy deserves a less calculative girlfriend who will only give based on how much she takes.</div>

Not showing it doesn't means he doesn't care, most people find it difficult to express what they feel to another cos it's something that everyone have to learn. Listening to another is another clear sign that they care for you and what you think actually matters to them.<br><br>Alot of people in a relationship often ponder too much into the past and the future, which most of them times makes them neither in the past and future and very lost in the present. I used to be like that...and in fact sometimes I'm like this too. However, I'm learning to ditch the past and glance at the future but focus on the present. Cos I realised that without the present, there can never be a future. So I would implore you to ditch the past, ditch the past and ditch the past. The fact that we are referring it as the past means that it's never going to come back and we should spend our precious tick-tok time on our present. The future will still be safe and good if it is remained unknown. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Another thing I wanted to ask is....when is the last time both of you enjoyed a long hug? Hugging between couples in a relationship is very important as it eliminates distance and overrule misunderstanding. And hugging is a body action of reconcilation, closeness, compromise and unity. Why not give him a hug instead?<br><br>I would advise you to give him a hug everyday, and extending the hugging time a bit by a bit with each passing day. It may take a while for him to feel comfortable with the relationship and open up to you again. But hugging really works, I've actually tested and tried it myself. :p<br><br>So.....go give it a try for at least 2 weeks and tell me if it isn't working for you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>By the way, ignore those negative replies...it's always easier to give negative advises anyway.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

He might still be suffering from whatever you've done that leads to your break up last time but as he still loves you, he choose to patch back with you.<br><br>Give him sometime maybe things will be back to normal once he is able to get over whatever happen between the both of you last time.<br><br>But I must tell you, its not going to be easy.
