            <div class='col-md body'>The best sales person I encounter are those who know their product well, know how to explain their uses. And listen to my needs (and I don't talk in I need this function but I would say some I am emotionally attached to this other brand) and the sales person immediately know the feature I was looking for mand recommend the product I want.<br><br>Its not about talking like those hard sell kind. Its the gentle and yet relationship building kind of selling - you get to know a little of your customer to serve them better.<br><br>To know how to be a good sales person, you also need to try going out and try out all sorts of sales promoters and learn the good tricks from them and also learn their mistakes and how not to make that mistake.</div>

But if the product is terrible and your main aim is to earn $$ and cheat the customer then i suggest you work up your left brain and think of ways to be spontaeneous.<br><br>Its all about inter-personal skills and you can only develop these by just talking to any stranger. I used to be an introvert until i was forced to talk to strangers and it became an ease. Most singaporeans are faced with this problem because we are soooo shy, and our western counterparts make it so easy because they are brought up to be extroverts.</div>

Practice makes perfect.<br><br>a line i found to be 'effective' would be: "Would you like XXXXX with that?"<br><br>u probably noticed this line in McDonalds when the cashier asked: "Would you like fries with that?".
