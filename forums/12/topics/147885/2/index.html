            <div class='col-md body'>Perhaps you've all along been a good son to your parents. If I'm not wrong, you've never argued or challenge their authority over you, am I rite?<br><br>If so, then I've come to believe that you've "spoiled" your parents. Itz very natural. All living things tend to act ya ya when they are unchallenged, and will not change for the better.<br><br>I too, have been in this route. Told my parents tat I'm interested in this so-and-so gal in class when I was 13, got told-off and "brainwashed" by them. Anyway, I was not easily "brainwashed" and, call me petty but, I still remember tat "talking session" until now.<br><br>After tat got rebellous, you know, young over-zealous blood, did things behind my parents back, never tell them anything, went to arcades(was told by parents tat this is where bad pple hangout) and bowling after school, picked up smoking, learnt to stare and fight, talk loudly. But went home, behaving like a little tame kitten.<br><br>I only confess to them wat I did when I go to poly, they were surprised, shocked. Anyway, they also L.L. loh. But they were glad I didn't go overboard.<br><br>Today I'm 26, and my parents are anxious for me and wan some gal to get me laid. And itz my turn now to "brainwash" them into believing tat I dun need a gal to tie me down, and kept reminding them of wat they said when I was 13.... hee hee.....   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  Sooo fun to see their guilty faces and keep saying,"Noo... I didn't say tat wat..."  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>So dude, go ahead and get a gf, I'll doubt your parents are going to cut your Uni fundings. And if they really do cut it, go work and fund your Uni funding yourself, have some backbone, cos you are already 21 years old, so dun expect to depend on your parents all the time. You wan your freedom, you need to work for it, and not sit in your sofa eat potatoe chips and wait for it to come to you.<br><br>But all in all, dun hate your parents, they do all these things for ur own good, just tat they do it the wrong way, if possible, try to correct them.</div>
