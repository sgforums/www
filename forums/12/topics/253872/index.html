            <div class='col-md body'>Ok, it goes like this..<br><br>When I first came to this company, every morning, there will be a guy opening doors and letting me out of the lift first like a gentleman. I thought nothing of it as I thought he was just being courteous.<br><br>Recently, I felt lonely &amp; I suddenly thought if this guy. So I searched my company's database &amp; got hold of his company's number (he worked just next door to me, we r in a industrial bldg) &amp; I called the company not knowing who wld answer my call &amp; trying my luck.<br><br>Alas, he was the one that answered! I pretended to ask him how much it is for fixing the comp &amp; he told me that he wld get back to me, so i gave him his number &amp; i asked for his name, let's call him John. So I also gave him my name (he does nt know who am i yet, he didn't see my face yet) so i waited but no calls back, so i called again. This time is his friend who picked up &amp; i pretended to hurry them up wif the cost charges &amp; he told me the same, he wld get back to me.<br><br>No answer back to me, also.<br><br>But I didn't give up, so the next day I called them again and asked for John. Then he finally told me he dun do home based fixing, so i was thinking, ' oh, why didn't u told me so? why must drag &amp; drag?' Anyways, I hanged up but I really wanted to know him so when lunch hr came, I called the no. again &amp; was stammering all the way....<br><br>But he was good, he was coaxing me (so sweetly) to talk slowly..so i finally said something like, ' you wanna go lunch wif me?' Actually, I was hoping for the worst but surprisingly, he said 'yes' so readily &amp; say ok we meet now &amp; I was soooo elated!<br><br>ok, so fast forward to the lunch eating session..I was determined to drill him so I asked him from 'do you have a gf' to 'if any outings, pls call me!' Sad to say, he told he's attached but he seems to be lying..cause when he told me abt his things, he soo conveniently left out what he does wif his gf..weird. Anyways, he bought me a drink and I offered to pay but he said 'nah it's ok'Anyways, the only thing that he seemed to be not lying is that he's busy wif his work &amp; school exams that's all.<br><br>So i got his hp no. &amp; he got mine. After lunch ended &amp; we go our separate ways, I smsed him saying if he thinks the canteen food is boring, i can help him taupau from the kopi tiam instead. He smsed back saying thanks, it's troublesome, no need, thanks anyways...<br><br>After I got his message, I did my work &amp; a few hrs later, I smsed him saying if he needs somebody at his side, he can always call me up, ok dun stress you le..indirectly offering myself la in this case...then no reply was made frm his side.<br><br>After all these, whenever I see him, I avoided eye contact wif him &amp; from my corner of my eye, he seems to be like staring at me..question is..<br><br>Shld I continue the chase or give up?<br></div>

Appearing desperate is definitely not one of the factors.<br><br>I think in your situation, your body language and actions are like expressing your desperation and neediness over and over again.<br><br>Keep your cool, amigo. Take a step back and assess the situation. Why are you behaving like this? Are you really interested in him? Or are you just lonely working in your environment? Only after you are confident of your intention then you can decide if you should "continue the chase" or just give up.<br><br>Keep your cool, I can't stress enough.  I'm certain you want to appear as attractive before him instead of needy.  : <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think the damage has already been done and he is definitely <strong>not</strong> interested in you <strong>after </strong>he realized it was you. It must have come as a shock to him when he realized it was you, the lady whom he was just being gentlemanly to and you had just misinterpret his intention. What was worse was the continuous smses you sent him. You definitely has scared him off and I wouldn't be surprise if he thought he was glad he had lie to you of being having a girlfriend. I suppose you might ask then why he had taken your offer to meet for lunch. My guess was he didn't know it was you. If you have said you were the woman he met in the lift every morning in the first place, I guarantee he wouldn't have accepted your invitation.<br><br>Do you go around tracking someone down when the guy was just being a gentleman? Looks to me like you were reading too much into someone's innocent gestures. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
