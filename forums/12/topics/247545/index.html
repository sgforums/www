            <div class='col-md body'>VK, pls kindly show concern for the other users of AA. I've not closed the thread you've created to voice out your dismay. And having you to open threads flooding the forum is a normal allowed practice. It has always been the case even before you came to AA. Hope you'll understand?</div>
