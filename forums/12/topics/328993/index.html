              <p>I met my first love 5 years ago. Up till now, I have not forgotten about him even though we did not officially meet up for the past 4 years. But we did bump into each other on the streets before.</p>
              <p>It happened when I joined my first company after I graduated form poly. A colleague introduced him to me. He was working in the same company as well. At that time, he had broken up with his gf for about a year but had not gotten over her. Things started off pretty normal between us. We went out, chatted a few times on the phone and exchanged smses. I treated him like a frd that time and was very concerned about him because he seemed to be torned after the breakup. Love was the last thing on my mind because I thought that I can never fall in love with a much older man like him (he was 9 yrs my senior).</p>
              <p>During the times when we were out together, he did say that his colleagues brought him to nightclubs/ktvs and I actually found out that he had been misleading girls and telling them that he likes them and want to be their bfs. The colleague who introduced us also told me that he heard that he had been frequenting those places. At first, I only felt sorry and sad for him because I know he must have been too hurt and crushed from his previous relationship. I asked him about his previous relationship and he said that his ex left him for an insurance agent she knew after meeting up twice. She did not break up with him but passed the message through his sister. She also told him that even if her relationship with the new guy did not turn out well, she will not return to him, citing the reason that he had been insensitive/inattentive towards.</p>
              <p>As you would have anticipated, I gradually and unknowingly fell in love with him. I think he felt it and kept his distance. I asked him about it and he said he was afraid that he is treating me as a substitute. I appreciated his honesty and respect his decision. So I avoided him as well. But we continued to sms each other.</p>
              <p>However, as times go by, I felt I had fallen deeper in love. Once, I tried to call him to talk about us but he avoided my call. From there, I tried to save myself by withdrawing. After some time, he smsed me again. I ignored him but he persisted. Then we came back into contact. This happened a few times. We seemed unable to break away from each other or maybe I was jus weak and he was just lonely. There was once for about a year or two, I managed to ignore him completely. He continued to sms despite not having any response from me. He went  to the extent of pretending to be his frd and msged me using another number. Initially, I did not suspect anything. The "frd" asked about my feelings towards his frd and I naively revealed that I did like him a lot but he will never get to find out. The smses between me and him continued and one day I decided to stop contacting him as well because I felt that I like talking to him. I felt that it was very wrong of me to keep in touch with the frd of someone I like, behind his back. At the same time, I began to feel suspicious and check on the mobile number. To my horror, the number belonged to him. I was crushed. I told him that I can never trust him again.</p>
              <p>The smses still came. Sometimes I would ignore them and sometimes I would just tell him to take care and forget about me. This year, my family shifted house. And we happened to shift to the block beside him. On the day of his birthday, I wished him thru sms. He asked me if I can still trust him. I told him that trust takes time. We resumed contact in the two weeks. One day, he asked me if I was interested to go on a short trip with him. I was happy but felt it was awkward at the same time but I did not asked him anything. After 2 weeks, I realised that he still did not take any action in wanting to meet up and catch up with him. I sent him an email telling him that he was still confused and probably he just felt bored and myabe that is why he chose to restrict our contact within smses. I also told him about how I felt about the trip.</p>
              <p>He did not reply to the email. I asked to talk to him but he avoided my call again. From there, I changed my number and sent him an email to tell me that I have already changed my number and if we were meant to be, we would get to see each other again.</p>
              <p>Weeks went by and we really did see each other on the streets. He emailed me to tell me that he saw me But I never replied him.</p>
              <p>Can anyone make sense of his behavior?</p>

              <p>It seems like he's playing around with your feelings. But it could also be due to his own insecurities, or other commitments that is making him keep a distance away from you.</p>
              <p>Regardless, time wait for no man, or woman. My guess is you're around 25 years old, and you should really be moving on with your life/career. 5 years is a long time at the prime of your youth.</p>
              <p>Consider giving yourself and other guys a chance to prove their worth, and you may find guy who is genuinely interested in sharing their life with you. If you are currently in another relationship, be fair to the guy and don't let your feelings stray.</p>

              <p>I doubt he'd tell you even if he's in a relationship. Nonetheless, I respect your attitude and persistence...but is he really worth it? I just broke up recently with a girlfriend I had for 3 years..and I know how hard it is to let go. However, treasure your youth, and  you'll find your true love soon.</p>

              <p>For the past 4 years, we did not meet at all just smses because
              we were pretty much like disappearing and appearing in each others'
