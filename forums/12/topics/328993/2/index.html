              <p>Hi cherrycola,</p>
              <p>I feel that you hadn't be really very decisive in what you want to do with him. It seems like you've been waiting for him to prove that he wants you before you're willing to do anymore on your end. You waver between letting go and moving forward.</p>
              <p>Imho, as a female you've done enough. You've written him letters, initiated contact and responded positively to his emotions. Explained yourself, been honest with your feelings. You've pretty much covered the bases in the books.</p>
              <p>I believe his interest is either not strong enough, attraction has prolly mellowed out over the years or he's taking you as a spare. I say cut your losses and move on.</p>
              <p>After 4 or 5 years, he's obviously here to stay whether you like it or not. You'll bump into him and he will send the occasional sms. Best to adjust your mindset and take him as a good friend.</p>
              <p>I hope this helps. Good luck. :)</p>

              <p> <br>i agree. why? because i'm doing what he's doing.</p>
              <p>in the past year since my ex (my first, and so far, only love) left me .. and which she rightfully did (let's just say i wasn't the best bf) .. i have dated/slept with more girls than i care to remember. some i wined and dined, others i knew no more than hours. quickly, i developed a sense of self-awareness: i was, and still am, chasing the shadow of my ex.</p>
              <p>the difference between me and him lies in that once i find better, or realise that the girl i'm currently with has XXX flaw (in comparison to my ex), i move forward and don't look back. he, on the other hand, seems to feel the need to be in a constant state of attachment - and that's where you come in. you're his backup. the one girl he knows he can manipulate with ease. i too keep in my black book a list of girls who i know i can have my way with anytime, although, i have yet to feel a need to call any of them. the best .. rather, the only way to save yourself further heartache, is to cut all contact by keeping out of his sight, any trace of you.</p>
              <p>here's what i do - take some notes: i keep 2 numbers: 1 for my circle of trust, 1 to sian charboh. the former is permanent and the latter is by all accounts temporary - with each girl, goes the number associated with her. pre-paid lines are cheap and easy to obtain. on the rare occassion they wilfully disregard my unilateral breakup, and show up at my door, i get my family/maid to turn them away - after sufficient time, they'll just stop coming/waiting.</p>
              <p>they say the amount of time needed to properly mourn the loss of a r'ship is half the period for which the r'ship continued. i've still got another year to continue my ways - or at least, that's the excuse i give. but what's sickening, is that i don't see an end in sight and have come to accept it as part and parcel of my life. sucks to be you if he is like me. good luck, and do right to yourself.</p>
              <p>p.s.: think back and reflect upon the kind of person he was. you'll see there's very little beyond the sweet words and the money spent (that is, on dating you). both of which can be dispensed with relative ease (i'm assuming he has capacity). chances are, you'll also find that he's a great actor, and someone who can play to the crowd .. wh3th3r the g1rlg1rl likezz this patternz de, or the witty gentleman a lady seeks, he can be both, simultaneously.</p>
              <p>edit: forgot to add, girl that initiates contact - che-ching! 50% end in ONS. girl that continously initiates contact after i distance myself - goes into my blackbook's "anytime-anywhere" list.</p>

              <p>I feel that the most important thing after the break up is to give each
              other some space and distance, to be able to clear our minds and to get
              over each other, especially if one of the party is still emotionally
              attached. To become friends straight away especially if deep/strong
              feelings had been put in, is rather hard I find, because being friends,
              the emotionally attached party, will take it as a hint, or maybe even a
              chance to get back together.</p>

              Hi Cheerycola,
              
              I don usually post anymore,
              but what i`ll say is you all lack communication.
              
              matters of the heart are nv so easy to solve
              and advice from other ppl to ask to hold on or leave shall always only remain as advice only..
              
              In Love, always follow your heart.
              be it u wait, or you move on.
              just realise that one day, the price and reward that you`re gonna pay and get is the result of your actions today.
              U wait, he can get back to you or u wait in vain.
              U move, u might lose ur love of a lifetime or u`ll be better off w the real one.
              
              i say, let u all come out, have a good talk, be honest and plan for ur life, by all means, both of u all are mature ppl now, marriage is just a stone`s throw away if things works out. 
              
              perhaps, the one sentence will help make ur decision easier.
              
              
              DO YOU WANT TO LIVE W THIS GUY FOR THE REST OF UR LIFE?
              
              think about it and good luck for ur love life.
              
              Bless you,
              BaByBoY

              <p>reading this thread, i had to create an account and give my 2cents.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> <br>i agree. why? because i'm doing what he's doing.</p>
              <p>in the past year since my ex (my first, and so far, only love) left me .. and which she rightfully did (let's just say i wasn't the best bf) .. i have dated/slept with more girls than i care to remember. some i wined and dined, others i knew no more than hours. quickly, i developed a sense of self-awareness: i was, and still am, chasing the shadow of my ex.</p>
              <p>the difference between me and him lies in that once i find better, or realise that the girl i'm currently with has XXX flaw (in comparison to my ex), i move forward and don't look back. he, on the other hand, seems to feel the need to be in a constant state of attachment - and that's where you come in. you're his backup. the one girl he knows he can manipulate with ease. i too keep in my black book a list of girls who i know i can have my way with anytime, although, i have yet to feel a need to call any of them. the best .. rather, the only way to save yourself further heartache, is to cut all contact by keeping out of his sight, any trace of you.</p>
              <p>here's what i do - take some notes: i keep 2 numbers: 1 for my circle of trust, 1 to sian charboh. the former is permanent and the latter is by all accounts temporary - with each girl, goes the number associated with her. pre-paid lines are cheap and easy to obtain. on the rare occassion they wilfully disregard my unilateral breakup, and show up at my door, i get my family/maid to turn them away - after sufficient time, they'll just stop coming/waiting.</p>
              <p>they say the amount of time needed to properly mourn the loss of a r'ship is half the period for which the r'ship continued. i've still got another year to continue my ways - or at least, that's the excuse i give. but what's sickening, is that i don't see an end in sight and have come to accept it as part and parcel of my life. sucks to be you if he is like me. good luck, and do right to yourself.</p>
              <p>p.s.: think back and reflect upon the kind of person he was. you'll see there's very little beyond the sweet words and the money spent (that is, on dating you). both of which can be dispensed with relative ease (i'm assuming he has capacity). chances are, you'll also find that he's a great actor, and someone who can play to the crowd .. wh3th3r the g1rlg1rl likezz this patternz de, or the witty gentleman a lady seeks, he can be both, simultaneously.</p>
              <p>edit: forgot to add, girl that initiates contact - che-ching! 50% end in ONS. girl that continously initiates contact after i distance myself - goes into my blackbook's "anytime-anywhere" list.</p>

              <p>Hi Cheerycola,</p>
              <p>I don usually post anymore,<br>but what i`ll say is you all lack communication.</p>
              <p>matters of the heart are nv so easy to solve<br>and advice from other ppl to ask to hold on or leave shall always only remain as advice only..</p>
              <p>In Love, always follow your heart.<br>be it u wait, or you move on.<br>just realise that one day, the price and reward that you`re gonna pay and get is the result of your actions today.<br>U wait, he can get back to you or u wait in vain.<br>U move, u might lose ur love of a lifetime or u`ll be better off w the real one.</p>
              <p>i say, let u all come out, have a good talk, be honest and plan for ur life, by all means, both of u all are mature ppl now, marriage is just a stone`s throw away if things works out.</p>
              <p>perhaps, the one sentence will help make ur decision easier.</p>
              <p><span>DO YOU WANT TO LIVE W THIS GUY FOR THE REST OF UR LIFE</span>?</p>

              <p>Thank you, 4sg. I am definitely not judging him on one single event. Prior to the trip, we already had so much communication problems. That event brought the problems between us into a deeper pit. And that was when I decided to let it go. Hopefully, he will be able to find out what he really wants when I am not around.</p>
