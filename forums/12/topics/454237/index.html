              <p>dear ppl,</p>
              <p>every nite around 10+ or 11, my neighbour turn on the tv so loud until i cannot sleep, so i call the police to talk to them, then they turn down, so i thought its the "end" of irritation and frustration for me to go to sleep........but they turn on back again after the blue boys left. i call the police to come back again.....and they off it. this type of "cat and mouse" drama happens at least 4-5 days in a week.</p>
              <p>i tried talk to the neighbour after 5 mths of moving in, and they shouted at me that they got no problem before we moved in (which is 2 years now), bc before the owner rented out the whole flat to indians, and they pays the HDB rent every mth, so who are we to tell them wat to do. i explained nicely to them and asked them to help by lowering the volume, and they said its perfectly alrite with them. see.....how to talk to them???? then i suggested that they come to my flat and hear for themselves (husband and wife), but the wife stopped the husband,scared i XXX him.</p>
              <p>but for us, we find it very irritating and disturbing to bear, and we have to wait to call the police or not, if necessary. we cannot go to sleep early, otherwise we will be awaken by the noise at midnite and find difficulty to sleep again. so we have to wait until 11+ before we can confirm to sleep. we have to wake up at 6am to prepare for work, and its quite terrible to fight the tiredness.</p>
              <p>i have spoken to HDB and they said its the police business bc its after 5pm. i spoke to town council, they said its the HDB business, bc flats belongs to them. the police got adviced me to talk to the hdb, and i told them the merry-go-round story. so lan lan i called the police everytime or rather almost everynite.</p>
              <p>can anyone help me with any ideas, really appreciate it.</p>

              <p>Easy lah. Then in the early morning you take the radio pluck to big big speaker and play it right back to your neighbor. If you are out to work, nobody at home - set your radio on timer basis to rock from this time to that time.</p>
              <p>They watch TV till late at night, you play radio in early morning and then hot afternoon (normally this is when indians have their afternoon nap).</p>
              <p>Wah, you sleep so early? 10pm? What are you? like still adolescents?</p>
              <p>Or you can pick up a hobby. Buy a set of drums and play in the morning.</p>

              <p>Eh where you live? How come got trucks unloading. Either you must be living near ground floor or some shop house.</p>
              <p>Like I said if you cannot stand staying in flat life, suggest you go johor buy a house.</p>
              <p>In the mean time, stay away from coffee, tea, coke, pepsi, chinese tea and capucinno. They contain caffein that heighten your alertness.</p>

              <p>You peoples living in HDB or condo got not much to choice, for good or bad neighbourers, it is only matter of luck, if no luck, go buy a house at lucky height, if you can afford.</p>
              <p>Very unlucky you get a bad neighbour with noise problem, the only way I think can solve the problem is evil against evil,</p>
              <p>They loud, you more loud, Sim Lim Tower is having the GSS on HiFi system and speakers, go buy a big one, as big as those Kpop concert speakers, then go buy heavy music like disco hiphop songs CD or thumb, get a good amplifier, once yr neighbour on the TV loud only, you blast those music with the speaker facing them all the way, I bet they will jump out of their seat, call police and complain, then police go, you blast again.</p>
              <p>For these type of people, no choice, you must let them hv a taste of their own medicine. When people are evil to you, being good to them can only let them do more evil to you, to win them, you need to be more evil than them.</p>

              <p>dear ppl,</p>
              <p>every nite around 10+ or 11, my neighbour turn on the tv so loud
              until i cannot sleep, so i call the police to talk to them, then
              they turn down, so i thought its the "end" of irritation and
              frustration for me to go to sleep........but they turn on back
              again after the blue boys left. i call the police to come back
              again.....and they off it. this type of "cat and mouse" drama
              happens at least 4-5 days in a week.</p>
              <p>i tried talk to the neighbour after 5 mths of moving in, and
              they shouted at me that they got no problem before we moved in
              (which is 2 years now), bc before the owner rented out the whole
              flat to indians, and they pays the HDB rent every mth, so who are
              we to tell them wat to do. i explained nicely to them and asked
              them to help by lowering the volume, and they said its perfectly
              alrite with them. see.....how to talk to them???? then i suggested
              that they come to my flat and hear for themselves (husband and
              wife), but the wife stopped the husband,scared i XXX him.</p>
              <p>but for us, we find it very irritating and disturbing to bear,
              and we have to wait to call the police or not, if necessary. we
              cannot go to sleep early, otherwise we will be awaken by the noise
              at midnite and find difficulty to sleep again. so we have to wait
              until 11+ before we can confirm to sleep. we have to wake up at 6am
              to prepare for work, and its quite terrible to fight the
              tiredness.</p>
              <p>i have spoken to HDB and they said its the police business bc
              its after 5pm. i spoke to town council, they said its the HDB
              business, bc flats belongs to them. the police got adviced me to
              talk to the hdb, and i told them the merry-go-round story. so lan
              lan i called the police everytime or rather almost everynite.</p>
              <p>can anyone help me with any ideas, really appreciate it.</p>
