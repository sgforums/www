              <p>Sounds like you value your sleep very much and can be quite sensitive to noise. Me too.</p>
              <p>You can try some nice gestures instead. Knock on their door with Indian food in hand and everytime you do that, tell them you fully understand they have been living like this for so many years. I think it'd be ideal if you can win them over before you even demand anything of them.</p>
              <p>If you were in their shoes, I'm pretty sure you also wouldn't want to be told how loud your TV should be at night.</p>

              <p><br>All noise travel thru bricks. If your upstairs neighbor play basketball or drop guli, of course can hear. If your side neigbor, bang the door hard, of course can hear. If your downstair neighbor drill the war, of course can hear.</p>
              <p>Since you are light sleeper, best you take steps to mitigate your problem. Don't think you can fully solve your sleeping problem.</p>
              <p>1) Drink less coffee, tea, coke, pepsi or anything that contain caffeine. Some people are sensitive to caffeine. Maybe this is why you wake up at the slightest noise and unable to sleep because the caffeine is making you alert while your body is screaming for sleep.</p>
              <p>2) Fight fire with fire. If your neighbor play TV loud, then you also play your radio loud back at them. Buy some guitar speakers and plug them to your radio, guarantee very loud. I know a neat trick. Buy some long telephone wires, 20 feet. Some phone sockets that can accomodate 3 phones. Then go to electrical stores, buy the loudest phone you can find in the market, get the salesperson to test the tone before you buy. Then pluck 3 phones in your room and open the window big. When you are out, use your handphone to call and make sure you do it in the early morning and afternoon when indians like to take a nap. This would postpone their sleep and they won't dare to watch TV till late at night.</p>
              <p>3) Don't waste your time with the authorities. The police or whoever are not going to be bothered. Imagine that you are burdened with work as a police or HDB staff and this fella complaining about noise from his neighbor, are you going to take action? You can't do anything about that because you can't watch the neighbor 27-7.</p>
              <p>4) Work hard, earn money so in future you can afford to buy a big house with land surrounding and no problem of noise from neighbors.</p>
              <p>5) Exercise more often, helps you sleep better.</p>
              <p>6) Eat more vitamin supplements. Boost your health and encourage better sleep.  </p>
              <p>7) Sometimes neighbors are evil, when you complain something that bothers you, they most likely do it even more.</p>

                  again after the blue boys left. i call the police to come back
                  again.....and they off it. this type of "cat and mouse" drama
                  happens at least 4-5 days in a week.</p>
              <p>i tried talk to the neighbour after 5 mths of moving in, and
                  they shouted at me that they got no problem before we moved in
                  (which is 2 years now), bc before the owner rented out the whole
                  flat to indians, and they pays the HDB rent every mth, so who are
                  we to tell them wat to do. i explained nicely to them and asked
                  them to help by lowering the volume, and they said its perfectly
                  alrite with them. see.....how to talk to them???? then i suggested
                  that they come to my flat and hear for themselves (husband and
                  wife), but the wife stopped the husband,scared i XXX him.</p>
              <p>but for us, we find it very irritating and disturbing to bear,
                  and we have to wait to call the police or not, if necessary. we
                  cannot go to sleep early, otherwise we will be awaken by the noise
                  at midnite and find difficulty to sleep again. so we have to wait
                  until 11+ before we can confirm to sleep. we have to wake up at 6am
                  to prepare for work, and its quite terrible to fight the
                  tiredness.</p>
              <p>i have spoken to HDB and they said its the police business bc
                  its after 5pm. i spoke to town council, they said its the HDB
                  business, bc flats belongs to them. the police got adviced me to
                  talk to the hdb, and i told them the merry-go-round story. so lan
                  lan i called the police everytime or rather almost everynite.</p>
              <p>can anyone help me with any ideas, really appreciate it.</p>

              <p>my problem was worse as neighbours were Pinoys so i emailed several times to Town Council and problem went away.</p>
              <p>but later the Pinoys moved away and Ah Nehs moved in, Town Council also not effective so i took matters into my own hands but quite expensive</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if you don't mind spending money to get satisfying revenge, then buy the Paradigm Sub15 and blast at your neighbour with the woofer facing the wall.</p>
              <p>i bought mine 2nd hand and it literally blew Ah Neh's walls down ! no joke !</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>play a cd or dvd on repeat with super low and loud bass and see what 15 inch woofer with 3,400 watts can do !!!!!!!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>make sure your things are properly secured before using this sub.</p>
