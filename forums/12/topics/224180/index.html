            <div class='col-md body'>Hello.. I read your post and I have gotta say as long as u are in Singapore, there is only one thing that brings an individual up.. That is cert. Without cert you cannot do anything..<br><br>Many people say make an honest living will do.. But think of the pay and living standards in Singapore.. I am not siding you or your gf in this case, but your gf may want you to know that without a cert, you are not going to be a capable guy.<br><br>I think it is an unfair to say that people with certs are hao lian.. There are many people who have certs but who are still humble about it.<br><br>Regarding the temper of your gf, that is something you will need to control her about.. Something must be done on your side must be done if you wanna still keep the relationship.<br><br>Cheers<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by sango(POH):</div><div class="quote_body"><img src="http://hbtop50.com/button.php?u=malaysia"><br><br>i'm a guy and i have a gf of 4 yrs..thinking of breaking up wif her cause i cant tolerate her temper any longer.<br><br>I apologised so many times but she still dun want to accept..<br><br>I treat her so well, but tat;'s all i get  why? issit because i'm of low education? i quit sc h ard sec 3 to work, but she is undergrad so she haf the right to put me down and treat me like dirt?<br><br>why people have a cert and they r so hao liao abt it? everytime she does something wrong, i keep quiet.
