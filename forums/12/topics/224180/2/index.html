Unfortunately<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> local pretty girls are a dying breed in Singapore</span></strong> - in 20 years in sg meet less than 5.  But luckily pretty taiwan/PRCs abound!  If ur gf is being petty just give her the boot!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

I dun want to incur her and her complains and her frens sarport her not me, cause they see me of low education mah<br><br>guys, what wld u do if uwere in my shoes? why girls nowadays talk until like tat?</div></blockquote>Its seems that ur gf is not that flexible in terms of education and status. well all i can say that not all grads and undergrads can have a good job. so what if u have just sec 3 education? it doesnt mean u are losing out...<br><br>take me for example... i haf a gf (degree holder) for about a yr or so. she stick with me from the time i went halfway thru my ns till i ord. she earns quite good money, working as an exec. me? i earn 660 only. the difference between her pay and mine? 1.8k... right now i can only find a driver job... it doesnt pay me well but at i least i get to take home 1.4k...<br><br>for me, i have house bills, hp bills, car loan to pay. all with 660 and few extra dollars i earn parttime. my gf offered to help me and i couldnt be more happy about it. esp while im still in ns... but now when she doenst have enough to spend i give her some so at least she can eat.<br><br>to the TS, dont worry about it so much, even with low education, u can still succeed in life. dont be choosy abt jobs. if u can see thru it, 'low class jobs' such as security guards, driver, boilerman, etc actually pays quite a good sum of money. furthermore, u stand a good chance for a career advancement.<br><br>i actually told my gf this and she does agree.. sg is an equal opportunity employer. dont worry about pple saying u low class or shit like that. their mindset is just old school, jobs like this are low class. come to think of it, compared to those office jobs and the ones i described, the difference is only about 100-200 bucks.<br><br>dude, if i were u, i stay on with her, show her wat u can do, even with a poor education still can get a decent job. even when she graduates, she will only get an entry level salary. mostly at about 2-2.5k gross per mth...<br><br>im not saying u should not continue ur studies, but with any chance you get, upgrade urself. go for courses. it will help in ur technical abilities.<br><br>cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thread Starter... I really don't think it's about education.  Let's face it... when it comes to affairs of the heart, it's never just fault on one party... it takes two to tango...<br><br>For example, when your GF first start to do something wrong (at lease in your opinion), don't keep quiet about it... one of the fundamental elements of a good relationship is good and open communication.  Communication is TWO-WAY, not one-way.... Happy or not happy, be open about it...<br><br>The fact that you two have been together for 4 years, it does say something about this relationship isn't it?<br><br>It's only natural that humans take each other for granted at times...<br><br>Do not let this "education" fiasco get into your brain... Cos love is never about educational level compatibility...<br><br>Be open about it, if you are serious about this girl, it doesn't hurt to admit you are in the wrong or to talk to her about your worries and insecurities...  There's nothing more assuring to a girl than a man who makes clear effort to improve himself (by this, I do not mean she will look down on you because you don't have paper qualifications), a man who's serious with life, and a man who's comfortable in his own skin...<br><br>Think about it... it may just be your insecurities that's obstructing your objectivity...<br><br>All the best ah.... It's not everyday you meet someone who makes your heart skip a beat, someone who makes everything seem right... if she's the one, work hard on it...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To the threadstarter,i am also an undergrad,but frankly speaking,what the big deal about being an undergrad?<br>Like what one of my lecturers say,u go down to city hall,pick up a stone and throw,there 90 percent chance of hitting a person with a degree or master?<br>What matter most is that u work hard yourself  and if your gf is really that particular about education,why will she being with u for four years,i am sure there might be some other things that matter,or maybe it your personal ego that hurting yourself?<br>As for giving in to her,i am sure u should aga aga know her character before u are together or maybe after a yr,so why bother to suffer if u really hate to give in,it all lie in your own decision.<br>All the best to you.</div>
