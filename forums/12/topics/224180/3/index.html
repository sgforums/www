            <div class='col-md body'>hmm you have to admit.. education is pretty important nowadays. People judge you by your achievements regardless of how great you are as a person. In my opinion, that is really superficial. But society is superficial.. and girls are materialistic. Most likely the majority of girls would like their boyfriends to buy nice things for them. Boyfriends are somewhat like accessories for some girls.. to boast about in front of her friends.<br><br>But seriously, if your girlfriend loves you for who you are.. she will never put you down in front of her friends, in front of anyone and most importantly respect you. It wouldn't matter how accomplished you are.<br><br>If she can't accept that then I think you should break up with her. No one should ever put anyone down. Education doesn't make you a better person or a person with more character than anyone else. For all you know.. the smartest guy could have a crap personality.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>
