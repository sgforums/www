              <p>Seriously, to solve ur depression, GET OUT OF THIS THREAD! posting more posts and arguing won't do any good to solving ur depression. Get out of ur house and go find something meaningful to do. You have only urself to cure this sickness.</p>
              <p>Nobody can tell you what is life. Life is created, changed and enhanced by yourself. Get a BIG life and go change for the better. Tomorrow will be a better day.</p>

              <p>Guys.<br> Seriously I came here not to get flamed.<br> I came here to get help from all of you.<br> <br> I know you guys are a great bunch of people who will help and give
              some life experiences.<br> But I know I used to be cloning in this forum.<br> That doesnt mean I'm always that bad.<br> <br> It's like the judge sentence me to jail for 10years.<br> But you guys dont want to "SINCERELY" help.<br> And sentenced me to death for just some acts.<br> <br> I dont know why but.<br> Dkcx has a tendency to keep flaming me.<br> Whats the use of that ?<br> <br> I sincerely came to ask for help.<br> But yet not to get flamed.<br> <br> It seriously that I'm facing depression.<br> Just that no one knows.<br> How could you really know?<br> It's something that matters within the heart that needs
              help.</p>

              <p>Why do i flame u? I'm stating facts about u :p</p>
              <p>You're not always that bad? Its tested and proven your behavior is no different from few months ago since within 30mins you revert back to your old self. Why is your skin so thick to not understand that help is no longer something any of us is willing to give you? Begging won't help since we given up on you ages ago. I was stupid to even try give you a chance to redeem yourself since i should have known you better to believe you would change.</p>
              <p>You are no doctor so don't say you are seriously facing depression unless you have a psychiatrist report that states so. A person in real depression won't behave like you do and still be in the mood to argue with me etc cos i've dealth with severe depression people before. If you feel you so depressed, go see a psychiatrist cos none of us here are a qualified 1 and none of us want help u.</p>

              <p>Your best solution is just go die and live another life cos you will get nothing you want in this life. You failed even as a human being.</p>
              <p>No point for anyone to give you any advice since you take 0 action so why waste our time. Theres been countless times ppl ask u go see a psychiatrist liao and all you do is come here crying for help once again for the same old thing which we still have the same old answer.</p>
