              <p>Can meet one la. There are definately those that are out to milk the guys, but you win some you lose some ma. Plus not all that kana supposedly chopped really dont know what is happening ma. It may be the company, or widening the circle ma. Cause the girls will have more girls n more girls, then u got a big pool of girls for u to pick ma.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>I actually have the idea of seeking matchmaking agencies in Malaysia. I like malaysian girls. I think malaysian girls are better. No offence. Wanna go try sourcing together? Lol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But i duno if malaysian agenices do help sporean guys source for suitable ladies. But come to think abt it, spore guys earning capacity at least twice over their own guys there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why would they not choose sg guys right ?  Or am I over flattering my own kind here ?</p>

              right?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I actually have the idea of seeking matchmaking agencies in
              Malaysia. I like malaysian girls. I think malaysian girls are
              better. No offence. Wanna go try sourcing together? Lol.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But i duno if malaysian agenices do help sporean guys source for
              suitable ladies. But come to think abt it, spore guys earning
              capacity at least twice over their own guys there.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why would they not choose sg guys right ?  Or am I over
              flattering my own kind here ?</p>

              <p>Not human trafficking la.</p>
              <p>Its like how u know pretty girls they will know other pretty girls cause they all like to hang to know more pretty girls. Cause they get to go to the parties and as u guys say, chop other guys. But there are always the nicer and pretty ones among them ma. Its just a matter of weeding out, going through the pretty faces, tits and asses to get the girl u think is really the one lo.</p>
