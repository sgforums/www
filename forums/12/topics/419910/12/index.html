              <p>Sorry to interject, but SINCE WHEN do you honestly expect to find somebody decent in a pub?</p>
              <p>Decent ppl would be back home by 10  - 11 pm rather than stay out late to drink.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I despise guys who are misers. You cannot be calculative towards girls.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You really cannot afford to shortchange especially the girl you like.  Yet, only when you think she is worth it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are a sincere, decent guy, then all the more you Have To Be Smart. Not the evil smart, but smart in the sense to protect yourself, not let bad girls take advantage of you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You should be smart enough to know if a girl is attracted to you in some way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If a girl likes you, she will devote attention to you, willing to spend time with you, like to engage you in conversation, she'll often ask you what you think about her, the way she looks at you is different from others, and she'll generally treat you nicer than any other guy she knows.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If a girl will genuinely give you a chance, she will drop hints, I think a guy should be smart enough to know you can move on to the next step.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you sense any kind of uncertainty in the relationship, BACK OUT TOTALLY.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cos if a girl really likes you horr, no matter what she will give you chance one, you dont have to spend money &amp; gifts on her just to BUY a chance loh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its only worth to spend the time and effort on a girl who you know will reciprocate and appreciate what you do for her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Really loh, many girls that are not interested in you, but they will make use of your sincerity and keep you as a spare tyre. Then when you outlived your usefulness, she will just kick you one side.</p>

              <p>Sorry to interject, but SINCE WHEN do you honestly expect to
              find somebody decent in a pub?</p>
              <p>Decent ppl would be back home by 10  - 11 pm rather
              than stay out late to drink.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I despise guys who are misers. You cannot be calculative towards
              girls.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You really cannot afford to shortchange especially the
              girl you like.  Yet, only when you think she is worth it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are a sincere, decent guy, then all the more
              you Have To Be Smart. Not the evil smart, but smart in the
              sense to protect yourself, not let bad girls take advantage of
              you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You should be smart enough to know if a girl is attracted
              to you in some way.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If a girl likes you, she will devote attention to you, willing
              to spend time with you, like to engage you in conversation, she'll
              often ask you what you think about her, the way she looks at you is
              different from others, and she'll generally treat you nicer than
              any other guy she knows.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If a girl will genuinely give you a chance, she will drop hints,
              I think a guy should be smart enough to know you can move on to the
              next step.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you sense any kind of uncertainty in the relationship, BACK
              OUT TOTALLY.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cos if a girl really likes you horr, no matter what she will
              give you chance one, you dont have to spend money &amp; gifts on
              her just to BUY a chance loh.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its only worth to spend the time and effort on a girl who you
              know will reciprocate and appreciate what you do for her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Really loh, many girls that are not interested in you, but
              they will make use of your sincerity and keep you as a spare
              tyre. Then when you outlived your usefulness, she will just kick

              <p>Recently
                                   I knew this gal whos attached but initially hid this fact from me. 
                                  Later she claimed that she liked me and would be with me if she didnt 
                                  have her bf.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ya .. RIGHT man. Like i was so dumb to believe her words.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She is currently having a 2 week temporary breakup 
                                  with her bf and she got fired from her auntie's food stall where she 
                                  worked at. She asked me out to accompany her. I was hoping to console 
                                  her and probably even give her some $ to tide over her current period 
                                  without work.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Who
                                   knows she barely paid attention to me and all her mind was going back 
                                  together with her bf after the temporal breakup. So i realised i was 
                                  merely her spare tyre during this temp. break up period. She did hinted 
                                  to me if i wanted to lend her money. But i was having my reservations. 
                                  So i told her, its the responsibility of your bf to take care of you, I 
                                  have no stand to be doing anything. Only a short while after we met, she
                                   left and didnt even bother to say goodbye to me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I did liked her but all this cold treatment and unfeeling basically killed every good feeling i had about her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Even so, her cold attitude towards me, I wouldnt leave
                                   her in the lurch, so I spent a lot of time and collected a lot of job 
                                  ad links and emailed her. I promised i would help her in job hunting and
                                   I fulfilled my promise. The rest is up to her. Since she cannot be my 
                                  gf, I can only treat her as a normal friend, and there is a limit what a
                                   normal friend can do. I cannot be good to a girl who doesnt care about 
                                  me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She hasnt been calling/sms me these past few days. She would call/sms me as least once a day one. So.. thats her true colors lah. Thats a genuine nice girl to me loh  <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/plain/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm glad didnt lend her any money. She has no 
                                  concern over me and will simply take advantage of / wont appreciate what
                                   I do for her.</p>
