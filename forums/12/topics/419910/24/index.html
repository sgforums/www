              <p> Love comes in a package, just like a tour package, alots peoples do not know that Love ecompass hatre, maddness, jealous, dissatisfaction, wanting, quarrelling and even fighting, and because of these, peoples alway think love is so nice, beautiful, pinkish everywhere, and in the end, when all whole package start to come out, they feel cheated, betrayed, anger, etc etc.</p>
              <p>So if you really want Love, prepare to take the negative package too.</p>

              <p>For the name of love, one has to take the <strong>whole</strong> package. If one is somehow ignoring or dismissing negatives, one is blinded.
