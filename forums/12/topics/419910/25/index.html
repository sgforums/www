              <p>Quantify? Both parties walk their path as a better person than before. If possible , a fuller joint acct too. :-) its dependent on the 2 parties objective of what they want of the relationship. $$$ for &lt;3, &lt;3 for $$$, $$$ for $$$, &lt;3 for &lt;3...</p>

              <p>Look, Angel, the topic was focused on your justifications on chopping your guy acquaintences. So what in the blue hell are you suddenly twisting the topic to talk about some positive and negative Love package crap ?! You can fool anybody else but not me, sister ~</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You know you're the last person here whos even endowed to say this. Quit the pretense of portraying yourself from a bloodsucking whatever-dah-next-word-is, to a sudden cupid who knows everything about love. You gross me out ~~</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh yeah sure, no one can dispute about the negatives and postives about love and you just have to accept it when it comes along.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But the irony with you saying this is, those guys that you chopped, seems like they only got the negatives of the package, so where did the positive parts go to huh?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Btw, Mr. Aneslayer, why are you even here discussing about these raunchy stuff ? Your wife isnt keeping an eye on you is it ? Havent you learnt your lesson already ? Your skin is itchy huh ?</p>

              <p><br>why u need to chase until broke?? once you know that gal is materialistic, stop chasing, but you need a few dates to confirm it. As I said before, we gal also want to test the guy willingness to spend, some guys which I went out with can even as me to share share cakes and some foods, these goes to say a lots of bad about those guys way of living, and how can I marry a guy who is so selfish and miser.</p>
              <p>You must understand, once we gal committed, we really go into Love, and any set back will leave a deep scar in us, it is not something like you guys with a flower heart can today go see Angel, tomorrow see Lulu or cynthia type of life.
