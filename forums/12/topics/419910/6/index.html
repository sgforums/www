              <p>People go temple to replenish the soul. eat vege every 15 to cleanse the soul. So, higher chance you can find the rabbit than spot the wolf.</p>
              <p>People go karaoke n pub (not sure yr wan like how la) to drink. Drink liquor open heart n soul to sin. Sometime in bar oso got GRO. So men there talk, joke kiss n play game wif GRO while they leave their wife behind at home to take care of baby. Sorrie, I canot see how can gudness come out from there.</p>
              <p>And the same people white collar people back stab n play politic at office, instead come back home, go to karaoke, night club to dabble to sin.</p>
              <p>U say true, about not look at people at heart but people go to pub already misbehaving, so obvious la.</p>

              <p><br>If temple can really replenish a sad soul, there will be more temples than pubs and kopitiams. Going temple can be a gathering, boy meets girl session, donate money from evil taking, or simply because you have sins and feel remorseful. Going to drinks in pub or kopitiam is a leisure,...not to do with temple of doom or bird</p>

              <p><br>Troublemaker2005, stop making trouble here, you also never see all women on earth yet, some of these gals are really good one, not all are bad, with experiences working here , at Macdonald and offices of some stupid MNC, I read a men like a hunter looking at a wolf. All peoples have parents, born innocent and pure, but the society that nuture them, can be a major factor to make them what they are today, if you are born in a poor village where there is no education, parents trying very hard to earn a living, you hv to plough the field, bath the buffalos and many other job at the edge of 12yo, and after all these hard works, still cannot meet end need, father decided to sell you away to some gang for illicit business, you end up running away and end up with some agent you paid to bring you to singapore to in such industry, and they are trying to best to break away by hoping for a nice prince to come along to help them.</p>
