              <p><br>as i say, i hate the word return on human relationship. but if you really want to know, the return can help you make more friends, more networks and certainly more option for you to pick and choose, even so, you dun hv to pick and choose if you choose not to, and remain single.</p>
              <p>The stigma of guy is that whenever a gal decided to go out with him, he thinks of having a gf,  of love, sex and marriage, which is wrong, you should think of making friend, then from within hopefully the relationship can blossom toward the next stage. Guys who dated me are mostly very nervous, they dun treat me as fren, like I am some princess that need to take super care of. Keep asking "Angel, are you hungry, are you thirsty, you want to the lady, or are you tired...and so on"" that is not what we want, today, we gals can paid and even spend a dinner for our friend, be it guy or gal, so you dun have to spend on gal, just relax and treat us as your normal natural fren, because we feel very uneasy if you treat us like princess, very unnatural in a sense, then we reject the next date, and the guy start to have wild illusion of losing love, gf, hopes and so on...but it is only one time going out...aiyo.</p>

              <p><br>as i say, i hate the word return on human relationship. but if you really want to know, the return can help you make more friends, more networks and certainly more option for you to pick and choose, even so, you dun hv to pick and choose if you choose not to, and remain single.</p>
              <p>The stigma of guy is that whenever a gal decided to go out with him, he thinks of having a gf,  of love, sex and marriage, which is wrong, you should think of making friend, then from within hopefully the relationship can blossom toward the next stage. Guys who dated me are mostly very nervous, they dun treat me as fren, like I am some princess that need to take super care of. Keep asking "Angel, are you hungry, are you thirsty, you want to the lady, or are you tired...and so on"" that is not what we want, today, we gals can paid and even spend a dinner for our friend, be it guy or gal, so you dun have to spend on gal, just relax and treat us as your normal natural fren, because we feel very uneasy if you treat us like princess, very unnatural in a sense, then we reject the next date, and the guy start to have wild illusion of losing love, gf, hopes and so on...but it is only one time going out...aiyo.</p>
