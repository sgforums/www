              <p>Sometime at my places, i really pity all these uncles and ah peks, I did make a survey on them, as a gal, they tends to be more open to me, these old men are all actually good men when they are youngs, married and have grown up childrens as big as me and their PRC mistresses, but they feel lonely at home, or some even worst, alway get scold by their old wifes at home, even sons and daughters do not interact with them much, cos young time, he went to work all day to make a living, thus got no or not much time to be with childrens, therefore created a barrier in between. That's makes them feeling very lonely and neglected, so suddenly, one beauti come along, care for him, make him feels young with pride, what you expect?? Sure he fell for it lah. By and large, what they did was wrong, but old peoples, especially men, are very conservatives to their family, they should be more open to their family and tell them of his problems, his loneliness and his love for them.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, it can be society problem, with our govt welcoming foreigners and failingto identify the crooks, pros and thieves from the good, this give PRC gals or even other countries' gals a chance to prey on our already neglected old folks.</p>

              <p>Networking with we gals is also very important, by networking, you open yourself up and got more chances to meet other gals, and naturally, someone will turn up liking you and you liking her, but all these needs patience and money for networking. But if you those homemade type who only go to malls, wet market, or foodcourts and only like to gang up with your male gender friends, forget it, you either remain single or become gay</p>

              <p><br> First and foremost, you need to spend money, if you are those
              thrifty type, forget it, remain single till bury or burnt yourself
              with your money.</p>
              <p>Networking with we gals is also very important, by networking,
              you open yourself up and got more chances to meet other gals, and
              naturally, someone will turn up liking you and you liking her, but
              all these needs patience and money for networking. But if you those
              homemade type who only go to malls, wet market, or foodcourts and
              only like to gang up with your male gender friends, forget it, you
              either remain single or become gay</p>

              <p>become gay also need to spend money.</p>
              <p>so start spending guys! after u spend until penniless, the gals will still hop away! (or if they become ur wife they will keep nagging or complaining, this husband useless no money then dont know how to save.</p>
