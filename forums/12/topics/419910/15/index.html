              <p><br>Of course I am worked up. Because she was on the verge of going steady with me, only then she reveal to me that she has a bf.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She said that initially she wanted to break up with that bf and be with me , but decided she couldnt, so have to give me up. That makes me a spare tyre lah, isnt it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She still had the cheek to say that she had no motive in lying to me and said at least in the end she told me she had a bf. Oh, so i have to be grateful to her that she did lah?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She treats me coldly, practically ignores me and yet still has the audacity to think i will give her $ to take care of her cos I like her? What does she take me for? I dont owe her a living you know?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Really man, this society is so gender bias. Whenever something goes wrong in a relationship, the guy always get blamed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But when its obviously the girl's fault, her butt gets covered, society make excuses for her that oh, she dont like the guy mah. So UNFAIR.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Guys are also human, we also deserve some dignity and respect leh.</p>

              <p>Just now she asked me to lend her money, I wired a little $ to her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yeah, call me Stupid. But a girl can å¯¹æˆ‘æ— æƒ…ï¼Œ i cannot å¯¹å¥¹æ— ä¹‰ã€‚ </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She said she cannot find work now because of issues to settle. I assume its got to do with her bf. Fine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She doesnt have a dad, only a mother. I see a girl only PSLE educated and no work now also quite ke lian.  æˆ‘æ˜¯çœ‹åœ¨æœ‹å�‹çš„ä»½ä¸Š then help her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Though she said she will return to me once she found work, I am pretty sure she is just using me and I wont get it back.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>However this will be the only time I will give her monetary help. The rest is up to her. I already helped her find a lot of job ads that she can use.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If she cannot buck up and support herself, then I duno what le. Her useless boyfriend is not dependable one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Theres only so much me as a friend can do. I already å¯¹å¥¹ä»�è‡³ä¹‰å°½ã€‚</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Hope she can realize and find a proper direction in her life.</p>

              <p>Haha,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just now i thrashed things out with her. She said she has got relationship, family, work and money problems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I chided at her that she is the main cause for most of her problems. Her family i cant comment, but work, i've already helped her to scour for tonnes of job ads. All she has to do is to look and just call. Whats so hard about that? You just sit there $ wont drop from the sky you know? I'm trying to help her, but she wont even help herself. This sort of pple die already also no need pity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for relationship, lagi worse, she chose a lousy bf, who else can she blame but herself? She could jolly well do away with this relationship and end alot of her so called troubles.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She then said that i got no right to comment about her boyfriend cos I duno him well. Sure i got no comment lah. What kind of comments do you want me to have for a useless bump who cant even take care of his own girlfriend and his gf has to go ask other guys such as me for money? What a pathetic failure of a man that is.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Its not worth it to be nice to someone who doesnt show any concern for me or appreciate what i did for her. I'm glad that all i've ever given her was a few bucks. I've told her to return it once she lands on a new job.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If she doesnt, then i'll just take it i donate to some beggar on the street.</p>

              <p>Since she is not really a good friend also, you don't have to be afraid that she will get angry and don't want to be friends with you. You don't lose much too even if you lose her as a friend</p>

              <p><br> Of course I am worked up. Because she was on the verge of going
                  steady with me, only then she reveal to me that she has a bf.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She said that initially she wanted to break up with that bf and
                  be with me , but decided she couldnt, so have to give me up. That
                  makes me a spare tyre lah, isnt it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She still had the cheek to say that she had no motive in lying
                  to me and said at least in the end she told me she had a bf. Oh, so
                  i have to be grateful to her that she did lah?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She treats me coldly, practically ignores me and yet still has
                  the audacity to think i will give her $ to take care of her cos I
                  like her? What does she take me for? I dont owe her a living you
                  know?</p>

              <p>Really man, this society is so gender bias. Whenever something
                  goes wrong in a relationship, the guy always get blamed.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But when its obviously the girl's fault, her butt gets covered,
                  society make excuses for her that oh, she dont like the guy mah. So
                  UNFAIR.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Guys are also human, we also deserve some dignity and respect
