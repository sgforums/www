            <div class='col-md body'>Fate has got a way of playing with your emotions. It can be cruel, often giving you a semblance of hope when it really doesn't help matters to be hangimg on to what might not be. It prods your curiosity, and while it is good to be working toward something in Life, maybe you should not read too much into the coincidence of meeting up with her. Let nature take its course, and sometimes it gives u a ray of happiness when u least expect it. Don't worry too much over it ~ if you are meant to be together, u will be eventually.</div>
