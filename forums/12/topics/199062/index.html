            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, i'll try to make this as short as possible<br><br>I thin i'm cursed. as in i think i'm under some spell. I'm been having some bad luck really for months now.

Another thing i'm really concerned about is i having relationship problems as well. Two of my cloest friends are avoiding me.

These two are my closest friends, like we stay at each other places and talk problems in the middle of the night with beer type.<br><br>so in summary, things are not going smoothly at all, despite my best efforts.

I could really need somebody geniuely knowledgable and capable in these sort of spirtual things.<br><br>Another minor issue, is i was once a taoist then i become a christian then i become a free thinker. I feel this may be a root of my problem. i'm not sure.<br><br>Recently i had a obvious wrinkle line develop above my eye. Mind you, i'm only 20 plus...too fast for that ya. This really shock me...<br><br>In general, i feel my luck is really bad and i feel quite "down" often.<br><br>I think i may have offended something dirty or somebody put some curse on me, as i have offended a couple of people some times back. The bottom line<br>is i need to know whether i really have some dirty spirits or spell surrounding me? if so, i reaLLY NEED to resolve this. I really need somebody advice.....fortune teller or ???
