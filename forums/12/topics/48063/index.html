But of course, nothing is absolute in this world unless you're a GOD or someone with exceptional powers. So i think the best is to ask at the correct time when u can feel that you're close enough with her. Unless that girl's character is somewhat on the "open" side, if not i think girls will usually wait for a guy to take action first.</div>
