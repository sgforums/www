            <div class='col-md body'>it's the kind of mindset that you have la. i believe your friends are also affected by their past even though they don't seem to realise it. most people don't anyway. i had a frucked up past r/s and my family isn't quite complete. divorce and remarriage. all's well now but sometimes i have the mindset that good things will never happen to me and i sort of just push away what may be my future happiness or what i really dream and want. so i guess your friends have to strongly believe in themselves and understand that life has its ups and downs. walk through it and things will get better.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is always idea to have both parents to be there for you, especially during our growing years. I feel that it will be " healthier for the child".<br><br>I developed an inferiority complex since young. Always thinking others deserved a good relationship since they are from a complete family. Unlike mine, I grew up without a father figure. It also affects my brothers negatively.<br><br>They seems to be more sensitive, bad tempered and introverted. I think this is due to a lack of role model which is our father. It really affects their relationship with others.<br><br>While growing up, I am looking for the role model in the family. I cant find one.<br>It is very depressing to find my brothers so sensitve and grumpy and so on.<br>It affects me greatly.  It is like a dimino effect.<br><br>I sometimes find it difficult to relate to others, contributing to failed relationships. I feel that I should not marry because I may not able to bring up "healthy children". I do not want to destroy other's lives.<br><br>So for goodness sake, try to keep family intact unless due to unforeseen circumstances such as death or abuse.</div>
