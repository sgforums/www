I deduced that its another common classic break-up over nothing much. You are 17 this year - prime age of searching, sourcing and experiencing what people called love. I have to tell you something - this is natural and its all part of a cycle called life. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You can't stop thinking of him, you cry, you feeling lost is because of the fact that you 'lost' something important to you. Anyone losing things that meant alot to them will feel that way too. Imagine you lost your handphone - it creates similiar effect, except maybe you won't cry, because HP is a materialistic item, while love works the emotional ways. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>You said you dunno how to handle it; this is due to the fact that TILL NOW and ONLY TILL NOW, this guy happens to be the *best* among all your exes and guys. You said you are angry with yourself? Why? Because you feel that you haven't done enough for this relation? Because you never try to solve whichever problem there is? Because you never treat him *better*? My guessing list goes on... you know it better. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You are unable to accept it because it happened too fast and you are neither mentally nor emotionally prepared. Weep all you want today, but after today tell yourself - even though we may not be together, and since nobody can take his place: he shall remain good memories which I will treasure deeply. You have to move on - because i can bet with you he will NOT be feeling what you are feeling now. Maybe he will be a little down, etc, but definitely not as dramatic as you. So why shed wasted tears on a past relation? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You need time - take this opportunity to recuperate and calm down. Because you needed all that time to do so and remember the LAST thing to do is to get yourself entangled with another relation without sufficient break. You will have the strength to go through... trust me and most importantly - yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
