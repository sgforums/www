            <div class='col-md body'>it takes two hands to clap... if this guy chooses to be with u and u both are reali loving each other, it's a begining for both of u.... i dont know if this guy is reali a nice guy to have, maybe u can give both of u some more time to know each other better before u both choose to proceed on.... alert this guy about ur friend's likings for him and see his response.....<br><br>as for that ger, if she's ur so-called best friend, she should understand that breaking up a friendship for a guy she likes isnt worth it..... it's a fair competition... unless she really cherish the friendship between both of u, otherwise do u think the friendship for both of u is really from the bottom of the heart??<br><br>there are so many kind of friendships out there, clubbing friends, close friends, "hi" "bye" friends, etc.....what kind of friends do u want?? do u want someone who'll support you and appreciste ur friendship or do u want a friend who'll stab u on ur back and abandon u when u needed some encouragement.......<br><br>anyway, all the best to u..... but my last advice is: TRUST NO ONE~~!! u may not agree with mi, but u'll know in future........ good luck~~!!</div>

Care for him/her, going steady is noth.
