            <div class='col-md body'>Divorce will not solve the problem. It will aggravate the hurt both parties suffered from each other. Moreover, they're with a child already.<br><br>And since the husband is bo chup type, then all the more the wife has to drill some sense into him. I don't know how she's going to do it, but I would advise that she and her husband sit down and talk things out. It'll be wise to see the councellor for advices. If the husband is too BC to care, then he needs another relative to pump some blood into his brain and wake him up.<br><br>There must be proper communication and common understanding between a married couple. After all, they're married and planning a divorce just shows how immature and irresponsible both of them are. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>cheers..
