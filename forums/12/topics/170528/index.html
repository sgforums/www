            <div class='col-md body'>Yea, u gotta look to the future. U can look back upon the past, and learn from your mistakes, but learn from it fast, and proceed on to the future. Don't dawdle on things that have already happen, but instead look at how you can improve yourself. Even if you score good grades today, push yourself harder to score better grades. Even if you don't meet your expectations, at least you'll be consistently good.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Also, u gotta practice.. Choose something u wanna be excellent in and focus on making it great. Sometimes, external factors affect our consistency and that can't be helped but what can be helped would be ourselves. Cmon man.. Have faith in yourself and go kick some butt...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

When you have attain a good result, your attitude kinda slacken as you felt that when you have probably reached 'there', you are 'there'.<br><br>In fact, you can only be good at something ONLY when you are always 'there'. I know when people are damn good at certain things, no matter what happens, they don't fluctuate between the two extreme. Only those who thought they were 'there', fluctuate so much.<br><br>P.S: As we go higher, it takes more to advance than our initial path up. Spend more effort in fine tuning the minor details to get you higher. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
