Guess its hard to be faithful since they got a wide numbers of female friends. That means, those guys are emotionally weak.</div>

Maybe the cool crowd you hang out with really dont have the same values that you seem to want. I assuming of course you're hanging out with the cool crowd. Also do not mistake male bravado talk to be real. In my experience immature males like to brag to each other about their conquests but in reality thay are not like that at all. Its usually a load of bs. It's the silent ones who dont want to the caught that are the really dangerous ones IMO. As always YMMV.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well.  Guys do it commonly and some.. openly.  That's why you gets to learn about it.<br><br>Gals on the other hands, do it discreetly.  When a woman cheats, she don't publicise and her bf/ hubby will not be proud to publicise for her either. That's why you do not get to learn about it.<br><br>There are many cases of divoice and those due to Adultery are not mainly men's but there's a large percentage contributed by Women too.<br><br>So.. please be fair when you make such statements.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>There are good guys (probably nerds or too dumb to screw around) and naughty guys (who knows exactly what to do to win a woman's heart) in the market.  Whom do you prefer?<br><br></div>
