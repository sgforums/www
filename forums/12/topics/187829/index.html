            <div class='col-md body'>Come on guys, sg girls are known for being materialistic, fussy and domineering... and personally, i think it has something to do with them receiving higher education, being more independent, having their own source of income e.t.c. I know its beneficial for them, but i guess it somehow, it took over their mind and they succumb to the blind pursuit of money, looks, fame, all of which makes them so undesirable to us since most of them would actually resort to underhand methods... I'm sure all of us want a girl who would take care of things that they are supposedly good at and behaving in a way which makes them more "feminine" right?<br><br>And recently, i saw how the miss singapore universe contestants answered the impromptu qn on "What do you think of the notion that foreign guys are more attractive than local guys?". Basically, i think none of them answered well, though all expressed that they would prefer local guys (probably a politically correct answer) but none of them actually mentioned why local guys are specifically the preferred ones. I don't think its that hard to touch on the virtues of local guys IF they really prefer local guys right?<br><br>Well, i guess its just another talent(hypocritical) which they've learnt while they are growing up just to get wat they want...<br><br>No wonder local guys are going for foreign brides and local girls are going for foreign guys la, no denying that this is an increasing phenomenon...<br><br>Sigh... anyone care to comment?</div>

Most of them the figure superb, but must get them to dentist first. Bad dental hygiene &gt;&lt;<br><br>But seriously, I feel that the OP's comment only single out a bunch of SG girls that tend to be more difficult to please and mercenary. The bulk of my SG girl friends certainly do not fall into that category. Yes, they tend to have more expensive tastes that other Southeast Asian counterparts, but this is mainly due to our higher standard of living, and many can do without alot of luxuries. Besides, you as a BF/husband wouldn't want to try to give them a good life?</div>

I know its beneficial for them, but i guess it somehow, it took over their mind and they succumb to the blind pursuit of money, looks, fame, all of which makes them so undesirable to us since most of them would actually resort to underhand methods... I'm sure all of us want a girl who would take care of things that they are supposedly good at and behaving in a way which makes them more "feminine" right?<br><br>And recently, i saw how the miss singapore universe contestants answered the impromptu qn on "What do you think of the notion that foreign guys are more attractive than local guys?". Basically, i think none of them answered well, though all expressed that they would prefer local guys (probably a politically correct answer) but none of them actually mentioned why local guys are specifically the preferred ones. I don't think its that hard to touch on the virtues of local guys IF they really prefer local guys right?<br><br>Well, i guess its just another talent(hypocritical) which they've learnt while they are growing up just to get wat they want...<br><br>No wonder local guys are going for foreign brides and local girls are going for foreign guys la, no denying that this is an increasing phenomenon...<br><br>Sigh... anyone care to comment?</div></blockquote>You don't get to meet the good ones bcause they are all taken while you are wasting your time discussing about it at the forums. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
