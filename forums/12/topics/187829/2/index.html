            <div class='col-md body'>with all due respect, one should not classify personal traits of a person based on their nationality. every single sg girl is an individual with her own unique qualities. i understand that there is an increasing number of sg girls seeking out foreign guys but there is still a large number of girls who are adamant in their opinion that local guys are better. and i totally agree the msu contestants did not even come close to answering the question. guess it's rather pressurizing to think on your feet.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i would say that not all singaporean girls are like that.<br><br>in fact, i would agree that many sg girls are a little more demanding in terms of how capable their man are and how manly they r to look after them.<br><br>talking about career and stable income, it is a must when looking for a stable r/s as well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm... seems like we have mixed responses here... May i have a show of hands who kenna dumped by sg girls before and the reasons they give are like so so lame... and before its even one month, u heard they are attached to another richer, more handsome guy than you are?<br><br>i think its not just guys who are sharing the name of being fickle minded huh?</div>
