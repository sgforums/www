I know its beneficial for them, but i guess it somehow, it took over their mind and they succumb to the blind pursuit of money, looks, fame, all of which makes them so undesirable to us since most of them would actually resort to underhand methods... I'm sure all of us want a girl who would take care of things that they are supposedly good at and behaving in a way which makes them more "feminine" right?<br><br>And recently, i saw how the miss singapore universe contestants answered the impromptu qn on "What do you think of the notion that foreign guys are more attractive than local guys?". Basically, i think none of them answered well, though all expressed that they would prefer local guys (probably a politically correct answer) but none of them actually mentioned why local guys are specifically the preferred ones. I don't think its that hard to touch on the virtues of local guys IF they really prefer local guys right?<br><br>Well, i guess its just another talent(hypocritical) which they've learnt while they are growing up just to get wat they want...<br><br>No wonder local guys are going for foreign brides and local girls are going for foreign guys la, no denying that this is an increasing phenomenon...<br><br>Sigh... anyone care to comment?</div></blockquote>Doesnt it make u wonder.. whatever happened to the power of own beliefs ?

            <div class='col-md body'>I think being dumped by sg girls because you are not up to their standard is better than kenna cheated by money and love. Which one you prefer? Nothing is perfect, S'pore girls may not be the best in the world. But other countries gals maynot be better. Take Japanese as an example, they are more materialistic than S'pore and they buy branded goods and don't work after married. But Japanese men can afford and not going everywhere complaining about their wife. Why??? Is it because they are more capable? Or should I say S'pore men are less capable as compare to Japanese men.<br><br>We are educated and independant since young. To be frank I want my husband to be better than me not because I want their money. It is because I want someone to be same or better than me. If you have $50, you won't use $50 to buy a $0.50 paper right?<br><br>Lastly, you not a prince don't expect a princess to love you.</div>
