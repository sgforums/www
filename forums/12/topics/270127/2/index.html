            <div class='col-md body'>To not too much of what might already have been said, becoming a Christian does not mean you will stop facing difficulties and problems in life. What is supposed to change is your apporach to the situation.<br><br>I don't understand how your friends 'make use of you', but if you think becoming a Christian is about giving all your money and expecting it to come back to you two fold three fold, then that is a very wrong thinking as well. Somebody must have really taught you the wrong stuff.<br><br>One thing about letting anyone be able to help you, whether God or anyone human, you need to first trust and give the person a chance to help. I'm not saying your 'friends' are 100% reliable (I don't know them), but if you don't even give anyone a chance to help, they definitely can't help. But if you open up, at least there's a chance.<br><br>But whether Christian or non-Christian, hating everyone and everything is not the solution to anything. I do not know your situation directly, but I'm sure not everything in your life can be blamed on every one else. Perhaps it's easier to put the blame to everyone else sometimes, but I believe there is that tendency in everyone (myself included). But at certain point in life, we have to take charge of our problems.<br><br>God is not something/someone or a tool of some sort that you summon and expect to instantly resolve your problems by removing it. Sometimes, it's about learning howto deal with it so that you become a stronger person.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dyingpainfully:</div><div class="quote_body">I once believed in Christ.<br><br>The pastor told me everything was gonna change once I became christ, But even after I became christ. I did not feel any change around me. I was still being bullied, being picked on and disliked or even hated.</div></blockquote>Entering the Kingdom of God and staying there is no easy task. Like the rest before me have said, Christian life isn't a bed of roses. Don't believe those ridiculous advertisements you she everytime about Christians being "forever happy" and "care-free". We're humans as well. I had depression twice in my 17 years of life. I thought that God and Jesus had abandoned me as well. But then I realized it was me who had abandoned them. I'm still recovering from those utterly miserable days.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I then became very angry that I felt that my christian friends were just using me, Once I stopped believing, Everything wasn't as bad as before because I told myself it was time for a change.</strong></blockquote>Using you? How? We can't help if you don't provide details.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>Either I wait for it to happen or I take it into my own hands and change everything, I thought I did well in changing. But I eventually grew disgusted with myself and the things I'm doing. I felt even more alone.<br><br>I have people telling me that "XXX, You can come to me and talk to me when you need help"</strong></blockquote>You're growing away from the people you know, and that's not a helpful sign.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>But when I really need someone to talk to, I can't see them as someone I can trust and talk to. I even resort to changing the story alittle just to mislead them then off the issue off my mind.<br><br>But its really no use, My life i think is crashing down and I really don't know what to do. Now, I put on a strong front and try to cover my weaknesses but in fact, I know I don't have the guts to do it. I ever really had the thoughts to stab someone but I chickened out.</strong></blockquote>Was this character trait of being generally mistrustful something you had before you became like this? A really concerned person would not fall for the bait you put to lure them away from your problem. He/she will just keeping pressing, and you have to play your part too. Stop pushing people who are really concerned away.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I don't wanna talk to any counsellors because they cannot be trusted, I am afraid they will put me in some mental house or report me to the police. I keep telling myself one day I will make them pay. I dream about becoming rich then destroying their lives like they have to my life.<br><br>I sometimes I think of what I am living for, There is nothing I am anticipating to happen either that or I feel there is no need to suffer for that cause. I think of suicide.</strong></blockquote>General misconception about counsellors; not everyone's out to get you. Only the very, very serious cases are ever reported to the IMH, and that's only after long consideration and discussion. You show slightly misanthropic tendencies here. Try seeing the good in people, and then maybe you can find the good in yourself.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I don't really like my class as well, I prefer the other class as they welcome me more and I think I fit in better. It really sucks, And I don't know if there is any chance of me changing class at all. I really don't feel like going to school tomorrow but I have a project to rush but I really need the time alone.</strong></blockquote>If you judge yourself before others, then others will see that it's fine to judge you. So, break the bloody cycle. Take some time to prepare for it, then do it. It's not so hard.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I hate myself.</strong></blockquote>"Hate" is a very strong word.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>If there is a chance, I really wanna live my next life as someone with everything made for him or someone who doesn't know anyone at all so that I don't have to face any mockery at all.</strong></blockquote>Here, you're just being lazy. What's the point of living if there's no struggle?<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>I know running away isn't the solution but I think its either that or dying.</strong></blockquote>No chance of coming back after death; you realize that, don't you? I'm not saying this as a Christian, but think again. If you're so unafraid of death, what do you have to be afraid of in this world?<br><br>You can choose to believe in God, or you can choose to reject Him. Religion is choice. Christ gave the people who wanted to crucify Him that choice. Why should He show any difference to you, who have no great animosity towards Him?<br><br>Take your time to recover.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yes there IS a God. You have to trust and believe in that God because although you might feel the way you do now that nobody cares about you but God does care about you. You have to have faith and believe. Being righteous with God doesn't mean everyone will love you. A lot of Jesus' disciples were persecuted for their beliefs yet they didn't need the love of others because they had the greatest love of all - God's love. So just pray and trust in Jesus' sacrifice.</div>

The worst that can happen is there you are obeying God's word but there are evil chrisitans around in church, workplace, social circle to create trouble.  The worst is the evil chrisitans in workplace who go all the way to break a chrisitan's rice bowl. God just let them do so, and better still they are so blessed that they get promoted from one grade to another, from one position to another.  Chrisitans will say ,it is you who have no patience no trust in God that is why facing this !!  Or they will say is be patient let them to God God will judge them on judgement day.  Unrealistic!<br><br>Go try other alternatives, like going to the temple, mixing around with friends who are genuine (not necessary to mix with christians, for many times they add to problems).<br><br>God God God, no god, got god, got god to bless evil chrisitians to prosper to ill treat and bring evil to the innocent ones.  Crap, chrisitanity is nothing but crap!  So many restrictions - don't do yoga, it is not from God from the devil!  Cannot do this cannot do that, in the end Chrisitans are the most hypocritical people among the religious people.  Yucks!</div>
