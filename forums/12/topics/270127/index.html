Are we just meaningless specks in the wide universe?<br><br>Unfortunately, yes. We're born into this world with a void in purpose. We're like a blank cheque, with the Creator of Life's (not necessarily God) signature."</span><br><br>I can tell you there's NO GOD IN THIS WORLD, but if you do not believe, what good would that do? I can ALSO tell you THERE'S GOD IN THIS WORLD, but again, if you don't believe, what good would that do, as well?<br><br>If you think religion can INSTANTLY solve your problem, you're wrong. If priests are marketing professionals, they'd be earning big bucks, just by selling their product (i.e. religion).<br><br>Believe in yourself!<br><br>Stand up to those bullying you, stand up to those picking on you!<br><br>You're not born into this world to win awards at hospitality or likeability. So what if people dislike, or hate you?<br><br>Adjust your mindset - there WILL BE people who would appreciate you.<br><br>Nothing to achieve in life? Impossible! Be it that iPod you want to get, that girl you want to woo, that grade you want to achieve, there's always something for you to work towards! Take a step back, and stop focusing on your agonies.<br><br>Forget about the bullying, the picking on. Think, instead, about the things, no matter how little, that you want to achieve. List them down. No matter how stupid they seem, list them down!<br><br>Remember, <strong>no one can make you inferior, without your own consent</strong>.<br><br>And of course, feel free to PM me if you need someone to talk to; I am always available on MSN.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dyingpainfully, I can assure you that there is GOD in this world. And it doesn't means that believing in Christ will stop you from being bullied, picked on, disliked and even hated. Christianity is not a country club or secret society where you can purchase comfort, protection instantly in your lives.<br><br>Having faith is useful if you learnt heaps from the bible studying, but having true faith is more desirable when you prayed for something and GOD made miracle in your life.<br><br>Life itself is always full of difficulties and challenges to everyone. The reason for that is because nobody is perfect, and thus nobody can experience a fair, comfortable, neutral, genuine and safe environment.<br><br>That's why Christian believers always seek the bible whenever they have a problem in life itself and study how Christ Himself deal with similar situations more than 2000 years ago. In order to deal with difficult situations, we will first need to study deep into the bible to understand and apply the teachings to our own morals, righteousness, conscience and innocent heart. Everyone will have their own innocent heart deep within themselves...regardless how deep and lost they have hidden away within themselves...regardless of how strongly they tried to deny it. Everybody is borned with their own sense of goodness in them. That is what allowed them to know the difference between good and bad and right and wrong in the beginning of their lives.<br><br>dyingpainfully, I'm sure you are probably not happy with yourself more than what others have done to you. There is something in you that is bothering and preventing you from feeling happy about yourself, your body, your mind and your soul. What is it?<br><br>Remember we're constantly surrounded by sinners and the world has heaps of them. Every time of our life and every breath we take is a challenge as we need to constantly fight off ourselves. our inner fears, inner securites, inner confidence, inner self. You need to make yourself feel good about yourself first before you can adapt to the people around you.<br><br>It's not going to be as easy as what I'm going to tell you. Remembered I've told you that everyone knows the difference between right and wrong and have their own sense of goodness and righteousness in them? You have them inside you too! For example, you know that you have been wronged and you are angry and upset. But you will also know what a Saint/Good gracious person would react to your situations if he were you. What you need is to convince yourself to believe and accept the same reaction and manner that you would expect a good gracious person would have behaved. You are allowed to lie to yourself to trick yourself into believing that behaving in the same manner would not put yourself in a disadvantage/stupid/laughable position as what you're doing and behaving is actually the true right. Convincing yourself into believing the right behaviour is probably the toughest thing that you will need to begin doing to yourself. The rewards for doing so will bring you happiness in the long run...once you get so used to doing it, you won't need to convince yourself anymore and doing the right thing will just come naturally from you and people around you will see the light within you and they will come to you. And you will feel troubled no more.<br><br>You do realised that you are ultimately the best person to help yourself, I can only point you in the right direction.<br><br>Good Luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div>

One cannot be more wrong. The only thing that changes is that you will see things differently. You will learn to accept pain and suffering as necessary.<br><br>Please, do not entertain thoughts of violence, suicide and vengeance. If you keep thinking of it, you will definitely carry it out one day. When this happens you will be even more lost.<br><br>Well I guess you won't consider going to the pastor or counsellers...But don't worry, you can always post your woes here. There are plenty of helpful people around here.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Dyingpainfully,<br><br>In general sense, our emotions are a product of our thinking.<br><br>We are shaped more to our perception of our environment more than the environment itself. LifeÂ’s events do not determine who you are, God determines who you are and your interpretation of lifeÂ’s events determines how well you handle the pressures of life.<br><br>In reality, we have very little control over our emotions, but we do have control over our thoughts. And in turn our thoughts determines our feelings and responses.<br><br>ThatÂ’s why itÂ’s important to fill your mind with the knowledge of God and His word. You need to see life from GodÂ’s perspective and responds accordinglyÂ…<br><br>God does not perform witchcraft and magic, Christians die from cancers, Christians live in poverty too. ItÂ’s how you draw strength from His presence and understand your purpose in life. You are made for a purpose, nobodyÂ’s created by God for nothing.<br><br>If you have the time, do drop by Kinokuniya Bookstore and grab a book <strong>&lt; Answers to LifeÂ’s Difficult Questions&gt;</strong> by Rick Warren. ItÂ’s a very good book in times when we are down in the dumps and feeling worthless. Many people have times like these too, when we start questioning what we are living forÂ… you are not aloneÂ…<br><br>At the same time, religion aside, please talk to someone. DonÂ’t give up, my dear. You have your whole life ahead of youÂ… Keep going, you will get past this.<br><br>DonÂ’t give up. Please?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

How can you get the help you so needed from here?<br><br>You want instant results, but there never is any except instant noodles. You fall away from Christianity because you cannot persevere. You cannot hang on. I do not even know if you are telling 100% of the truth that is happening to you in this post.<br><br>You do not even have the courage to face yourself. You cannot even give yourself or anyone around you a chance to believe and have faith in.<br><br>You can say, "What do you know? Can you even begin to imagine this?"<br><br>Let me tell you something, whether you believe it or not:<br><br><span style="color: red;">I once gone through a life similar to yours. I once HATED myself. I once HATED the people around me. I once HATED humans &amp; I did not even know it until I discovered it many years later. I could not trust anyone, not even myself in the past.</span><br><br>I cannot understand your situation. Similarly you cannot understand mine. I can only sympathize and emphatize with you.<br><br>NO one's life is a bed of roses. Even a handsome, rich and wise guy falls into a pit so deep he needed help from everyone whom he once thought were 'beneath' him. Even a beautiful, intelligent and nice girl slams right into a wall of reality and needs help to support her back.<br><br>I can only see one positive thing from what you said, or claim to say: when you finally realise why you are going through all these and you learnt how to live life and deal with all these things in your mind, with the people around you and with your own perspective and values... you WILL become a stronger person at heart and many will envy you because of how you turned stronger despite such drastic cases in you.<br><br>I leave it to you to trust what is the best to your conscience and accountable to yourself.</div>
