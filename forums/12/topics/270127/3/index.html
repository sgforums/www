If they behave as caring people as are expected of them from God and the people then people will not have that sort of expectations.  Problem is there are far too many christians who love pointing fingers and judging people when things go wrong without looking at themselves.  Many many, it is 9 out of 10 are like that as compared to people from other religions.    Me together with many many others I know of - we have more pleasant encounters with people from other religions.  Christians if they want to win souls, they havve better do something to improve themselves rather than point fingers and judging people.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Asperger Syndrome or (Asperger's Disorder) is a neurobiological disorder named for a Viennese physician, Hans Asperger, who in 1944 published a paper which described a pattern of behaviors in several young boys who had normal intelligence and language development, but who also exhibited autistic-like behaviors and <strong>marked deficiencies in social and communication skills. </strong><br><br>Persons with AS show marked deficiencies in social skills, have difficulties with transitions or changes and prefer sameness. They often have obsessive routines and may be preoccupied with a particular subject of interest. They have a great deal of difficulty reading nonverbal cues (body language) and very often the individual with AS has difficulty determining proper body space. Often overly sensitive to sounds, tastes, smells, and sights, the person with AS may prefer soft clothing, certain foods, and be bothered by sounds or lights no one else seems to hear or see. <strong>It's important to remember that the person with AS perceives the world very differently.</strong> Therefore, many behaviors that seem odd or unusual are due to those neurological differences and not the result of intentional rudeness or bad behavior, and most certainly not the result of "improper parenting".</blockquote>If you are trying to "talk" TS into "normality" you are just simply. I believe wasting your time. You have no idea what AS people re like.</div>

MY experiences from church members were no better too.  and it is not a matter of only a handful of them but there were around 8 out of 10 (ratio) who were really yucks!!! I had been mistreated, abused, betrayed, accused, mistaken for, and so on.  they have problems I prayed and helped them, when I had problems they gave me the treatment - you die your business, even I asked for them to pray for me they said pray yourself.   The church is rather shallow, too!  pastors preach sermons take precaution not to offend the people, fear the people instead of speaking the truth, i shake my head!!!!  Members fighting for power!  Members shouted at each other during meeting!  sounds like those taiwanese politicians quarrelling !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Do consider whether to leave the church and try other church  or  think about what you want and is christianity really for you!!<br><br>As for me, after all these happening, i struggled for 7 to 8 years contemplating to leave the church and christianity.

            <div class='col-md body'>After reading the first post, I can see that threadstarter is suffering from some internally problems rather than external problems.<br><br>Since the problems came internally, you can only solve it internally by yourself. The rest of us here are just here to give you some advices on how to do it.<br><br>1. Learn to trust people.<br>Learn to understand why people lie, understand why people don't lie. If you can analyse these two points, it is quite easy to sense/check whether people are honest to you or not. In this case, I don't see any reason why a pastor/counsellor will want to cheat/lie to a teenager, thus there shouldn't be any integrity issue around.<br><br>2. Learn to understand yourself better.<br>The more you understand about yourself, the more you will appreciate yourself, the more you will love yourself and the people around you. If you do not understand yourself, you do not know what is your purpose, you do not know what you should do and you will not find value in doing anything. If you do not understand yourself, your mind will always be in a state of confusion, anguish, depression .....<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Is there really a god at all?[/quote]<br>I have been a free-thinker all my life, but it is quite easy for me see whether there is really a God at all.

And the above is a good answer. Let's not speculate what's the underlying problem TS faced. Then we are being presumptious.<br><br>Everyone has a problem - at home, in school, at work, with friends, parents, siblings, colleagues, etc. Some of us find solutions in a sensible, creative, logical way - either by oneself or with the help of another. Some seek charlatans, some seek mediums, some seek saints, and many seek god or gods!<br><br>One of the thing with any <strong>evangelistic</strong> religion is the 'promise' that god will help solve our problems. The truth is: we are the cause of our problems and we have to solve them ourselves. If I am 'God', I wouldn't be wasting my time listening to a lot of human craps and petitions for help of one kind or another. But I am not, and I know there are many kind humans without religious affiliation who are capable of helping.<br><br>Most times, we need to look inwards - at ourselves.

I had been mistreated, abused, betrayed, accused, mistaken for, and so on.  they have problems I prayed and helped them, when I had problems they gave me the treatment - you die your business, even I asked for them to pray for me they said pray yourself.   The church is rather shallow, too!  pastors preach sermons take precaution not to offend the people, fear the people instead of speaking the truth, i shake my head!!!!  Members fighting for power!

Let's look at it squarely. Is there a God - physical or metaphysical?<br>If it is physical - then human should be able to use his senses to determine whether real or not. If it is metaphysical, like cosmic soul, holy spirit, ghost, or some supernatural being, then I supposed it is beyond human senses. You may have come across '<strong>claims</strong>' by people who can see, hear, and feel God whereas quite a number of people can also tell you nothing of that sort happens to them!<br><strong>Personally, I have not seen God, nor feel, nor hear with my senses when I am fully conscious, awake, aware and in control of my FACULTY!</strong></div>
