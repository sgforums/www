Since, we do not know exactly the problem-situation, we should not try to come up with a prognosis. At best, we can try to answer the question posed. TS was quite right - discussing religion here is not going to help. I detect that TS has certain expectations of Christianity that were not met. Hence, the frustration. We all know that in times of need, we go to higher beings for help but will be greatly dissappointed when there is no result.<br><br>My suggestion to TS is to go for professional help.
