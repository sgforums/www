Whether she is serious or not, in time you will know. Most of them take time and lots of time... In the end, some will tell you that they have fallen in love with you; while others stay the same. This type of girls would behave and act like you are her stead while offically you are not. Well, just enjoy the moment while it last... sooner or later they will just blow up and throw away the friendship. Cheers!</div>
