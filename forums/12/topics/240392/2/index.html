If he's sick, I'm not surprised that he's speaking softly. Or maybe he felt that you did him the favour afterall so he's trying to be nice by not shouting at you this time.

Most guys generally mature later than 16. I think most brothers act that way anyway and I'm more inclined to correcting TS's behaviour so that she can handle the situation better. Afterall, at her brother's age and her age, it is not very likely that any reasoning will change her brother's mindset.<br><br>Anyway her brother did not come off as ordering to me, which is why I cited TS's rudeness. From the wording, her brother was making a request to which she replied by ignoring him. I would have been pissed by her behaviour too, had I been in her brother's shoes. Him spewing all the vulgarities and all was largely due to her rude and disrespectful behaviour, not simply because she refused to help him. Had she refused him in a polite manner, would he still have behaved the way he did? That is debatable but that is also the crux of the problem.<br><br>She was being very rude, and I believe that he had every right to be angry at her.<br><br>As I mentioned, she had been very rude to her brother all along so how else do you expect a hot-blooded young man to react?<br><br>Had I been her sibling, I would have disciplined her right on the spot.<br><br>And as I said, TS had every right to reject her brother's request or rather to you, an order. But that wasn't the real problem. The real problem was the way she chose to handle it, which is wrong.<br><br>Obeying and helping him do not mean defeat. Instead, it would have shown good qualities in TS which unfortunately did not happen for her.</div>
