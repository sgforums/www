              <p>i can't face my gf after what happened last night, not that there is anything wrong with it..but still.</p>
              <p>i had a serious and strong crush on a girl in my class since i took up a course early this year and it was extremely disturbing for me. my looks are what most people would consider gay simply because i have a slender physique slim enough to fit into girl jeans, have long and colored hair and have piercings on my nipples and also the other place but that really is my style. i can't help but think that i am strongly attracted to my classmate whenever i had a chance to see her but i do not know why.</p>
              <p>i had been faithful to my gf for the longest time and she is my first. she is also very jealous whenever i had female company and even went to the extent of deleting certain female contacts of my list in an online game that i play. later this year, i changed my classes just so i won't see this classmate of mine anymore to solve this problem. i never mentioned this to my gf at all because i did not even know my classmate as a friend. we never talked.</p>
              <p>last night, i had the strangest dream of all my life. it was a just a usual day at school and i happened to bump into her at the lobby. at that time i was wearing a shirt which was quite thin in material and she happend to brush against my nipple ring. somehow she took notice of it and we began to talk about it. i then told her about my attraction to her and before i know it, she was licking my nipples. what shocked me was that this was actually a wet dream literally although it was ages ago since i even had an erection. don't ask why. it was unthinkable and i can't forgive myself for fantasizing over her. how should i clear this thought?</p>

              to, i could have just stayed on and not change classes to avoid
              meeting her. and if i am unfaithful, why will i be creating this

              <p>Singapore is very small. No matter where you go, you might just see her again. </p>
              <p>And who knows? You might see another girl who will give you wet dreams, and what will you do then? Move to some remote country?</p>
