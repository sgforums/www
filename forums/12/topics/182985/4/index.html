And for the friend, he's gonna have a bad impression and.....<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Got bolder???!!!!!<br>When she enters the university, is she gonna kill???!!!!<br>(actually, if she starts using violence, we'll have a damn good excuse to send her off)<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Lastly, is it good to use sarcasm on her? Like indirectly "suan-ning" her in a manner that hints at her wrong behavior?</span><br><br>Thanks,<br>Nikar. </div></blockquote>No, that would probably just result in a meaningless debate...<br><br>Actually... I would quite like to second what Ozzy gurl has suggested except that you shouldn't be pushing her too far off into a corner... If she turns too resentful, her attitude towards the family just might be so much worse in the future...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sounds like me when i was young.. could it be her school that is affecting her? jc culture isn't all sweet and friendly. she could be very insecure about her environment like i did.. but still different ppl different problems.<br><br>i dunnoe how to solve it, but in general i know wad u shld avoid imo. mainly becuz my parents chose those.. sarcasm, avoiding her will not help but make things worse. don't talk bad behind her back too. don't call her names. don't scold her intentionally over her personality including screaming or yelling because she would probably remember it in her heart. don't change ur attitude suddenly too, because she wouldn't know how to react.<br><br>maybe. her reaction when u're kind to her isn't entirely because she is suspicious, but she probably doesn't know how to react in the first place.</div>

And to REALLY MAKE AN EFFORT to change her attitude... And the family's looking forward to a BETTER HER... Let her understand that you people are not trying to be hostile or anything but it's REALLY FOR YOUR OWN GOOD....<br><br>If she choose to STAY THIS WAY... SAD it might sound for MOST around her..
