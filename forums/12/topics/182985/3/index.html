            <div class='col-md body'>Auntie Yunnie,<br><br>I think the middle child syndrome theory may be applied here.  Have the thought in my head, but Not substantiated with academia.  Can you help?<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Nikar:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi all,<br><br>I really hope someone can share your advice here. It's greatly appreciated. The root of all the problem is my sister.<br><br>First of all, my family has 5 members : my dad, mom, myself, my sister and my brother. I'm the eldest(20 years) and my sister(18 years) is second-eldest; my brother is youngest and he's only in Sec. One.<br><br>Since we were kids, my sister always has a very very terrible temper and a vicious personality that seems to get worse with age. Her mentality and behavior  since she has a kid till now has always been that :<br>-if you do something nasty to her, she'll pay you back triple or more<br>-if she's nice to you, then she has a motive behind it(always the case)<br>-if you do kind things to her, she'll suspect that you plan to back-stab her<br>-if you tell her that a certain thing is wrong or she should change her mindset/behavior, she'll either pretend she never hear or will scream very very fierecely back at you; she will not accept any kind of feedback<br>-she has a must-win attitude in every scenario; if you scold her, she'll talk back until she wins the argument; if you eat 5 cookies, she must eat 6 or more cookies than you.<br><br>Normally, grown-ups like 18 years old(JC education, somemore) won't pick on little kids and siblings for little nitty-gritty things, but in her case, she has been shouting and verbally abusing my younger brother for no reason.<br>Here's some real-life examples :<br><br>-Whenever my brother dirties up the table after eating and my mom or me wipe it for him, she'll get very angry and uncomfortable and start verbal abuse on him<br><br>-Whenever my brother does a little thing to annoy her(un-intentionally) like speaking too loudly over the phone etc., she'll start verbal abuse, scolding him and cursing him non-stop for 10 - 15 mins a lot of times, and the tone is so scary that it's as if she's scolding her worse enemy(or someone who has killed her children)<br><br>-Recently, my mom told me to give some pocket-money to my brother since I've started working. I, the one who gives the pocket-money to my brother, have no problem with it. But my sister is very jealous and angry and she keeps verbal-abusing again whenever this subject got brought up.<br>If she's a small kid and she gets jealous/angry over this matter, fine. But she's going to be an adult soon(18 years old) and going to the university soon! Where can you find a big sister that keeps picking and verbally-abusing someone much younger than her?<br><br>-Sometimes, we've chocolates and snacks or ice-cream back home. Whenever my brother unintentionally eat one more chocolate or have 1 more serving of ice-cream than her, she'll get really extreme towards him and the verbal abuse is totally crazy. In addition, she starts to stomp the floor loudly and slams her things around.<br><br>-There's also times when, after eating or using the kitchen ultensils to cook her own stuff, she just leaves the ultensils in the kitchen and my mom/me has to remind her to wash it. And she has the cheek to ask my brother to wash his own plates?<br><br>-She doesn't know anything about consideration for others. At 11pm or midnight when everyone is sleeping, she still switches on the TV loudly or blast the radios(louder and louder these past weeks)<br><br>-Worse still, whenever she's watching TV in the living room and my brother is in the living room too, her left eye seems to be watching the TV and her right eye seems to be keep watch on my brother and finding fault with him.<br>Once she finds any mere fault, she goes in again and start verbal abuse.<br><br>My brother has a very meek, pleasant and those easily-pushover kind of personality. I told him to scold back and fight back, but he keeps saying no.<br><br>During her JC days and the A-level exams, whenever she studies and there's things she doesn't know, she throws a big temper again and upset the whole family.<br>Recently, the problem has got worse. Now that she's working and everyday when she comes home, she'll throw a terrible temper around the house and affect everyone's mood. Did you know that when she's out with her friends and there's only me, my mom, my dad and my brother in the house, everything is so blissful and happy?<br><br>The problem has got more serious these few weeks to the extent that we're moving the entire home PC from her room to the living room, so that my and my brother don't have to see her attitude or endure her temper whenever we use the PC(currently in her room).<br>My father, who used to dote on her a lot(I think more than me), has started to turn against her and sick of her behavior already.<br><br>I mean, my, my brother, my mom and dad don't deserve all these.<br>My dad comes home during 6 - 7 pm every day only to see my sister throwing tempers and abusing her brother?<br>My mom is at home most of the time, so she's really bearing the brunt of it.<br><br>For me, my sister doesn't dare to shout or go against me yet. I've been trying to maintain neutral ties with her, because if I start to scold her everytime she throws those sickening tempers/verbal-abuse my brother, the family would only get more worse-off. I now dread weekends and think that weekdays are better, because my sister stays at home during weekends more. Everything I see her throw those out-of-control tempers or treat my brother like some dog, I feel like grabbing her and throwing her out of the window, whatever it takes to rid her. I've been controlling myself but this may get out of hand one day.<br><br>Can someone please help me and analyse the root of the problem and find solutions for me? I've been thinking of beating her with the TV controller(not too lethal) everytime she throws temper/abuse my brother or knocking her against the wall........is this a good idea?<br>I'm not scared of her calling the police if I beat her, though. She's in the wrong and someone must do something before she gets worse and worse by the minute.<br>Hiring a counsellor is useless; she's always very sweet and nice to outsiders, but to family members, it's a different story. Even if the counsellor really thinks that she has a problem and advice her, her strong-will will not listen to any feedback which implies that she need to change.<br><br>Thanks,<br>Nikar.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>THink it's quite bad...  if you really can't solve the issues thru talkin with her or ur parents can't do a thing.. i think u can apply for PPO- personal protection order against her, especially for your younger brother.  It is not only for those that are physically violent, but verbally/emotionally threatening too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

In theory, the middle child is the most comfortable, because the 1st child has heavy responsibility(tough life) while the youngest gets bullied the easiest(tough life). The 2nd child has the best of both worlds, in theory. </strong><br><br>Is not always the case that the middle child gets the best of both worlds... When she born, she is the youngest in the family.. giving her alot of attention and love was given to her at that point of time.. Till when she was about 5.. your brother was born too.. All these was diverted to your brother instead of her..<br><br>And oso probably from young she has been pampered too much from your dad.. And now she thinks that noone love her anymore.. Noone concern and care about her.. That's why she's throwing her temper in a way to seek all attentions for the family.. This is to let you all know that she's not invisible.. She needed the love that she once had! This also explains that why she treat outsiders better than her own family because she feels that outsiders know her existence.. but she feels that when she go home.. noone bothers about her..<br><br>Yes, you all love her and care for her.. but she dunno.. she based on her own judgement and feels that you dun cared about her.. Therefore she keep picking faults on everyone but not herself.. She thinks that this is the only way to communicate with you all and know her existency..<br><br>Well, My aunt got 5 kids.. the middle child is the only girl in the family.. My cousin used to be like tat.. she become very very rebelious.. not wanting to study.. always come home late.. Cos my aunt is so busy taking care of the other 2 younger cousins and there's no time for her.. SHe feels neglected.. times after times my aunt will come to my mum and cry saying why her daughter become like this.. When she was young.. she wasn't like that.. only when the 2 younger cousins are borned.. she become very violent.. very unobedient.. Noone can take control of her.. My uncle too busy with work.. sometimes dun even come home.. he seldom communicate with his children also.. This means the relationship of her and the dad drifted even further..<br><br>She always throw her tantrum.. on ANYTHING ANYWHERE ANYTIME.. but they jus endure and let her be.. is not about giving her what she wants.. all she needed is jus the love and concern for the family.. Knowing wat she has been doing outside.. and asking about how's her school work.. communication is what she needs too..<br><br>It takes really a long time to let her understand that her family dotes and loves the most.. They are sorry that they neglected her at that point of time.. which is when she was 15-16.. They sit down with her.. talked to her.. of cos initially she din wan to listen..<br><br>But if you keep trying and trying.. letting her know that you do care.. one day she will jus sit down and listen to you.. YOu may not know whether she understand or is she really listening to wat you say.. but after the talk.. leave her alone to think about.. give her the care that she has lost..<br><br>Take things slowly and bit by bit.. Physically, mentally and spiritually.. she will be able to realise how much you all have done for her.. SHe jus need to open the barrier and the negative thinking inside her..<br><br>Pal, i know this is not an easy task.. but as the eldest.. this is wat you can do to get back a happy and healthy family if you really want.. it will stress you mentally and physical.. but do not give up.. there must be 1 person standing strong anf firm to do it.. if noone were to take the 1st steps and try to approach her.. forever she will be like this.. on the other hand.. she thinks that this is the only way to get all attentions from the family..<br><br>/pat pat<br><br>Cheers..<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>what i think is since the solf method of talking to her, or trying to understand her do not work, then you have to use the hard method. when ever she switch on the radio or tv loudly, swith it off. If she on it again, just switch it off again. or better, hide all the plugs as to prevent it from working. When she scream at your family, jus ignore her. How long can she scold and abuse you all, she will get tired de. Take it as she is invisable, she dun exist at all. worst come to worst, take out a PPO against her</div>

You and your family would have to tahan until that peak before she would stop. With initial ignorance, she would naturally try harder to be nastier to get what she wants, but you all need to hang in there before she realises it's not worth it. AT THE SAME TIME, all of you need to give her the positive attention when she is NOT nasty, and when she's calm and nice. Even if she does not mean to be nice, or she's just tired, praise her, and tell her how much you all like to talk to her when she's calm and nice. To be fair, just ignoring her and not returning her the attention when she's nice wouldn't work.<br><br>Yes, you may say you have not had any quarrel with her for a long time. What I mean is total ignorance, not even showing that you feel irritated by her, you get me? You may not have said it out, but I am sure your facial expressions would have given away that she has got what she wanted - to make you all angry.<br><br>PLEASE don't listen to those people who ask you to resort to violence, to hit her back, etc... (People, for goodness sake, please..) As I said before, if any of you do that, you are simply telling her that violence IS the way to solve problems, when it is apparently NOT. I am not a person that is into horoscope; I am a person into science, and in this case, social science. Nevertheless, there are kind souls out there who made suggestions according to horoscope, yet (for once..) are closer to what I advocate as well.<br><br>If you still feel vexed, PM me. I can give you further professional advice.<br><br></div>

(pls answer this question as it's crucial...)</blockquote>My mom told my aunts about her behind her back, through telephone conversations in Teochew when my sister isn't around.<br><br><strong>From ViciousKitty74:</strong><br><blockquote>You can't do much to protect your younger brother. He most likely already know how to deal with his sister.</blockquote>Actually, my brother has got rather used to it already. Nowadays, my sister can scream till all the neighbours can hear but my brother is quite oblivious to it, compared to the past. All I want is that he gets stronger and more aggresive before end of this year.<br><br><strong>From CryoLind:</strong><br><blockquote>i think u can apply for PPO- personal protection order against her, especially for your younger brother.</blockquote>But regarding PPO, do we apply it from the Neighbourhood police post?<br>Even if we get PPO for my brother, what does it do? will there be like, counsellors/police watching him 24 hours? Cannot be, right?<br><br>Thanks all! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Nikar.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Nikar...........<br><br>Going by my personal experience of what one of my older sisters was like to me when i was younger,here's some tips:<br><br>if she has that much disrespect that she is playing loud music late at night.....confiscate her stereo.<br><br>let her know that these things that she likes will keep being taken away from her until she starts acting her age,and being the responsible adult that she should be by now.<br><br>if she keeps it up,put a password on your pc,and dont let her know it,so she cant use it unless she has adult permission,then you have to physically type the password in for her,dont tell her what it is.<br><br>if she wants to use the things she likes,she will start to act her age.<br><br>spend a day with her,just you,her and your little bro,and tell her that if she cant treat him nicely,and take care of him like a big sister should,then there is going to be some very big changes in your family life.<br><br>never scold her while your telling her this....come to her like a mediator...not a father figure,you are her brother after all....not her father.<br><br>tell her how hard she is making life for your mother and father(through all that temper throwing,she probably doesnt actually see what shes doing to your parents),and be firm,but not too firm,when you put your foot down and tell her that if she keeps disrespecting your parents like that then she is not welcome in the family home.<br><br>it may seem a bit harsh...but it should make her wake up,and realise that she has pushed it too far.<br><br>counselling never works,because like you said,she wil put on an act for strangers.to make them think that she is innocent,and that she is the victim here.<br><br>take your little bro out,just you and him for a day at the movies or something,and tell her that when she starts treating both your little bro,and your parents with more respect,and once she has personally apologised to them,you will take her out and spend some time with her.<br><br>the fact that she hasnt yet used a foul mouth at you means that she respects you,and she would not dare to cross you.use this against her,but like i said.....nicely.dont ever lose your temper and yell at her,or threaten her.you will only push her away,and perhaps even forever.<br><br>i have seen this happen with a few spoilt brat friends of mine,so you have to tread lightly while gaining her trust.<br><br>goodluck.....i hope you can get her sorted out.<br><br>but i was serious when i said,let her know if she keeps it up she will have to leave the family home......this will shock her,but it should work <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>all the best,.................Ozzy.</div>
