            <div class='col-md body'>girls and guys have different reasons for wanting to leave their partner, I am not talking about the frequent changing of partner type of people, but just regular guys and girls.<br><br>I've known guys who had been unfaithful NUMEROUS times, who still doesn't want to break up with their poor deluded girlfriend. And amazingly, get really pissed off with her when she finally breaks up with him.<br><br>I have also known guys who are with girlfriends that seem insufferable to them, and completely incompatible, but for whatever reasons of their own, persist in dragging the relationship on and on until the girl 'dumps' them and she's a 'bitch to do that after all that I've put up with her." \<br><br>And of course the classic... 'i am waiting for her to break up with me'.... and usually will wait until he is well into another girl before the previous rship disintegrates.<br><br>These reasons I do not understand at all. If you can't love, respect a person, why would you still want to remain in a relationship with a person?? POssibly they don't want to be the 'bad person' in the relationship My guess is that many guys do not talk about their relationship with friends who would advise them when a relationship is not going the way it is supposed to go. With girls, the feedback of friends is often very important (again, let's count only well meaning, sincere friends).</div>
