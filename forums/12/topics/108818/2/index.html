Its circumstances that made your relationship into what it is now.<br><br>Perhaps, if i were to dive into her mind, i would find that she has separated her life into 2 parts. Pre-Success, and Post-Success.<br><br>She's enjoying her post-success life right now, and you're not in it. In fact, you're very dormant in her Pre-Success life.<br><br>She doesn't want to be reminded of it everyday, when she looks at you. And she may be feeling a bit guilty that she's throwing away her love, for her success. That's why she's feeling stressed.<br><br>In the book, the guy eventually let her go, but that's because he didn't really love her in the first place.<br><br>Maybe you would like to reverse that scenario in real life. But how..?<br><br>______________<br><br>Judging from your 2nd long entry. It does seem like there's little hope of her coming back to you, and that she has moved on.<br><br>You're right, the Post-Success her wants to make all the decisions now. What can you do? Nothing. Nothing but to stand by her and perhaps her finally realising that you've always been by her side. And perhaps, after she eventually sees the light, she'll come back to you (This may or may not happen at all. The chances of it happening should be apparant to you.)<br><br>Now that you're in financial difficulty, i suggest you prioritise and get out of the dumps. Only when you're back on track, do you go back to her. Don't sms her so often anymore, let her have her own life, since her current life doesn't have you in it...<br><br>Once again, get your life back on track first, before thinking about her.<br><br><span style="color: red;">...

Sorry that I had not replied to the forum for so long - I was hospitalised after an alcohol binge. Well, yes I was drinking a lot because when I was at Orchard, many memories came back to me again ... I think the 5 days in hospital really does help.<br><br>As much as possible, I will not be giving up this relationship, not without even fighting for it. I have been waiting for many years before getting together, and I think its that feeling of 'boredom' that's making me lose my patience towards the relationship now. I guess time really is the best medicine now. Its time I let go a bit and let the bird out of the cage. Whether or not this bird decides to leave or stay, its up to fate! Maybe another bird will fly by again, a better bird ...<br><br>Thank you all again for your help rendered once again. It was much appreciated.</div>
