              <p>My Fiance of  6 years recently joined a car forum 6 months ago .Since then he comes back at 5-6 in the morning and I hardly sees him anymore. From there, I am getting a little bit piss off.</p>
              <p>I have talked to him and quarrel over it however he stills go his way. Recently, I found out that he is seeing a woman in the club. This woman is just trying to hook some man there. I met her once and to my surprise, he is very close to my fiance.</p>
              <p>Lately, he never picks up my call and giving me excuses that he left his phone in the car. Would you belive it ladies if you were me. Obviously, he's having an affair right!!!!</p>
              <p>Last few weeks we got a race in KL and due to work i have to take a plane there @ night and he set off driving there in the morning. Everything was fine till I heard from THAT WOMAN telling me he took my fiance car there toghther. I confronted my Fiance and he just say "Oh, I forgottent o tell you". Do you believe that!!!</p>
              <p>Few days ago, I started to confront him and he says he's not having an affair. He swear to god blah.... I told him I will never belive or trust him any longer. I wanted to breakoff and he says no. I told him since he is not having an affair then prove it to me. I told him to draw a line with this girl but he says no as he don't want to lose THIS GOOD FRIEND. He claims that she is his very good friend. If he can't even do this, it's obvious he's having something with her right. I told him would you sacrifice a 6 years fiancee or 6 months GOOD FRIEND. He told me he wants to have both.</p>
              <p>I am really mad when i hear these. The reason he gave me for not drawing a line is because he'll become a laughing stock in his group when they know about this. He also says this whole thing is so stupid. Ladies, pleqase share your view in this.</p>
              <p>I have broke off with him yesterday and I am moving out of his place. We are planning to wed next year but all hope is gone. I have sacrfice my 6 years youth to a useless man. i don't even know how to describe these feelings in words.</p>
              <p>Ladies, this is just to let you know the power of forums. If your man is in this too much you got to watch out. Don't end up like me. I will never forgive him for the rest of my life. I detest him now..........</p>

              <p>Even tho do know that most girls would feel threaten if the bf/hubby is close to another girl. But, have you consider the fact that he dont dare to tell you about this lady friend knowing that will assume the worst (which you already are).</p>
              <p>Why not give him a chance to proof he can manage the r/s with you as well as a friendship with another girl. Both should talk and come up with a set of expections acceptable to both and should he fail then you can talk about break up.</p>

              <p>actually u dun have evidence tt he cheated rite? just tt he missed ur calls and forgot  or left out some things. maybe he was afraid tt u would get the wrong idea?</p>
              <p>i certainly dun agree wif his actions... and i must admit they do sound rather suspicious especially since he seems to be more concerned abt how he will look to his friends than abt ur feelings towards the matter.</p>
              <p>but of course, six yrs is a long time. u may wanna tink more carefully abt ur  decision and talk to him again abt how his behaviour made u feel.</p>
              <p>also, consider his character before the incident. does he have a habit of lying to you? has he cheated on his past gfs before?</p>
              <p>if no, maybe it is really a misunderstanding. u can ask him to let u meet the fren to clarify things... but if yes, he has lied to u abt such things before, drop him immediately and move on.</p>

              <p>Well, at least you have seen his true colours. You would rather waste 6 years now or another 6 years later?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just imagine you and him after marriage and he casually brushes off your discovery of him with another girl.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Men are like that, they never admit their affair no matter what. They (or we <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/shade.png" alt="shade.png">) have all sorts of reasons to explain "unfaithful behaviour". </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good luck and I wish you all the best in finding someone you deserve.</p>

              <p>My Fiance of  6 years recently joined a car forum 6 months ago .Since then he comes back at 5-6 in the morning and I hardly sees him anymore. From there, I am getting a little bit piss off.</p>
              <p>I have talked to him and quarrel over it however he stills go his way. Recently, I found out that he is seeing a woman in the club. This woman is just trying to hook some man there. I met her once and to my surprise, he is very close to my fiance.</p>
              <p>Lately, he never picks up my call and giving me excuses that he left his phone in the car. Would you belive it ladies if you were me. Obviously, he's having an affair right!!!!</p>
              <p>Last few weeks we got a race in KL and due to work i have to take a plane there @ night and he set off driving there in the morning. Everything was fine till I heard from THAT WOMAN telling me he took my fiance car there toghther. I confronted my Fiance and he just say "Oh, I forgottent o tell you". Do you believe that!!!</p>
              <p>Few days ago, I started to confront him and he says he's not having an affair. He swear to god blah.... I told him I will never belive or trust him any longer. I wanted to breakoff and he says no. I told him since he is not having an affair then prove it to me. I told him to draw a line with this girl but he says no as he don't want to lose THIS GOOD FRIEND. He claims that she is his very good friend. If he can't even do this, it's obvious he's having something with her right. I told him would you sacrifice a 6 years fiancee or 6 months GOOD FRIEND. He told me he wants to have both.</p>
              <p>I am really mad when i hear these. The reason he gave me for not drawing a line is because he'll become a laughing stock in his group when they know about this. He also says this whole thing is so stupid. Ladies, pleqase share your view in this.</p>
              <p>I have broke off with him yesterday and I am moving out of his place. We are planning to wed next year but all hope is gone. I have sacrfice my 6 years youth to a useless man. i don't even know how to describe these feelings in words.</p>
              <p>Ladies, this is just to let you know the power of forums. If your man is in this too much you got to watch out. Don't end up like me. I will never forgive him for the rest of my life. I detest him now..........</p>
