            <div class='col-md body'>Haha....my ai ai and me are separated by an ocean and more, but we still manage to talk to each other everyday for an hour at least. It all depends on how much effort you are willing to put into it. Of cos, the other party must be a willing participant as well...Trust and faith are very important as well, because without those the r/s would have nothing to support it and will crumble...<br><br>Try to communicate with each other everyday, if you want to save on phone bills, I recommend using skype, it is like talking to each other thru phone but it is free. Just need to download the software at www.skype.com and of cos, get yourself a mic.

            <div class='col-md body'>True love knows no distance. Don't make the mistake to reject a girl only becasue of a distance. It's the biggest mistake ever, to reject the person who loves you and who you love too.<br>The distance doesn't have to last forever. If you both really love each other, then you should start to make plans how to get together. Either she moves to your place, or you move to her place, or you both move to some other place together. Everything is possible when there is the will. Good luck  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
