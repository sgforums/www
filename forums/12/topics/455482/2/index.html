              <p>OK lah, you didn't meant it. But he was waiting for it.</p>
              <p>He will go back to you, only when he can't get a replacement for you. Remember that. Otherwise he will be busy with his new attraction.</p>
              <p>Suggest you move on, someone will come along.</p>
              <p>And its not that you are no good, you are alright, it is just that he is thinking of himself and not you. </p>
              <p>Just be glad the relationship is over, because he has quietly stayed for sometime out of pity for you. That's why when you say 'break', pooof! he is gone.</p>
              <p>Next time you see him, break his leg, and pity him.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/ccmathteam.com/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>

            <div class='col-md body'>I didn't use "break" test his love, because i knew it sure won't be successful. Actually most of time he is the one say break, but i didn't agree, because i believed he will fall in love with me one day. However, i found it is impossible n felt more n more tired. that's why i choose break this time. Sometimes people is contradictory, already decided break, but still hope he can come to me n say he love me. Very stupid right?</div>

              <p>Ya know. Its much easier for girls to overcome breakup. Why?</p>
              <p>1) You have your girlfriends to listen to you and comfort you. People tend to show compassion for girls. But for guys who get breakup, no mercy for them. The guy who whines is considered unmacho. Other guy friends would stay far far away from the guy because guys normally don't like to listen to whinners.</p>
              <p>2) Its easier for girls to find replacement. All they have to do is to put on some make-up, long hair and look nice, some fool clueless guy will be magnetically attracted to her. Right away she will get suitors. For guys, after break-up, not only we have to get over it but we also need to go out there and fight with other guys for the girls. The girls get to choose from a pool of 10 guys going after them simultaneously.</p>
              <p>3) People tend to show compassion to girls who are heartbroken because they are the "weaker sex". Or are they?</p>
              <p>4) As mention all the girl needs to go is to put on some make-up. For guys, we not only need to look handsome but also need to make more money to attract the desired girls we want. We need to have stable jobs, own property, drive nice and fast cars. We compete with other guys who have unfair advantage, such as those who already rich due to rich parents who spoil them with sports and luxury cars and armani business suits. We poor guys are no match against these competitive playboys. Competition is tough.</p>

              Hmmm.... some of your points are right, but not all the gal come over easier... i think the one who love more is harder to recover. The one who love more will be hurt more, no matter she or he.
              Yes, it's not difficult for me to find another guy after leave him. But, i won't be so easy have feeling with replacement. 
              Do you believe that he haven't ever bought me any gift? I'm not such money face, but i really suspect has he ever put me in his heart?

              <p>Besides, you should be thankful that you don't have any gifts from him so you don't have to stumble upon in his gifts at your room every day and remember back all those painful memories.</p>

              Today saw his photo with another gal on fb.. they are so sweet.. my mood just like shit...
              want to msg him, but i hold back, because i guess he won't like to receive my msg. 
              
              It's meaningless to keep think whether he love me. The answer is very clear now..

              <p>Taiwanese women are self centered and only want your money. Sometimes some Taiwanese women who claim to be women in the forum is actually a cross dresser guy (work in a pub all night long with no customers, dress like a girl). A very fat one.</p>

              <p><br>Oranges and apples in actual fact, do not differ much, both are from trees, both alway harvest side by side and place at supermart also side by side, wherever you go, if got oranges, there will be apples, so dun give me the shit about comparing, we are humans, born to make mistake.</p>
              <p>We can be kiasu, but not kiasee like Singa. And because of Kiasee and kiasu singaporean, that is why your govt open up the floodgates for foreigner to come, to see and to conqueror. Every PRC or Indian coming here think of doing business and earn Sing dollars, it is only the locals that still think how to increase wages, what to do? MNC breeded</p>
