              <div class="quote_body">Correct me if I am wrong but according the news report I read, I
              thought the Aussies hated the Indians even more. There were lately
              a lot of racial attacks against them as reported in the papers.
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have been to Australia 12 years ago. But at that time I had a
              bad experience whereby I was sitting in the train to
              Clayton and there was this drunkard shirtless Aussie walking
              from coach to coach yelling profanities to us Asians. And then
              there was this Indian student sitting there, the Aussie practically
              sat on top of him and called him a black shit. It was such an awful
              experience.</p>
              <p>And then there was another time, I got off the train at
              Frankston, then three teenage boys asked me for money. When I
              didn't give them any, they went back to theirbags and grabbed some
              metal sticks and switchblades. I quickly ran and they gave chase.
              Luckily my friend was supposed to pick me up at the Frankston
              station and I ran straight to his car and we sped off before the
              boys could reach me.</p>

              <p>Frankston and Clayton?  Man, what are you doing slumming in those low-rent neighbourhoods?  It's no surprise that you came across white trash.  Maybe I just hang out in the right spots or I'm just really lucky, but in 16 years I haven't encountered any such thing.</p>
              <p>As for the Indian thing, a lot of that crap was dreamed up by the Indian community, in particular by a jackass called Gautam Gupta - even the local Indian grassroots leaders have shunned him as a shit-stirrer.  People are too ready to jump to conclusions - the Indian government was in an uproar over a supposed attack in which an Indian man was burnt.  As it turns out, he later confessed to burning himself while trying to set fire to his car and calim insurance.  The cops charged him for false reporting and insurance fraud. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>It's a bit of a challenge to generalise about working attitudes of any race or nationality.  Certainly Australia's got its fair share of slackers, but then again, a competitive environment here is no less motivated here than it is anywhere else.  By convention, the working week here is 38.5 hours, but in my office, anything less than 50 hours means that you're dodging projects.  Not that it's all bad - when it's time to party we party hard.  All in all, it's going to be influenced by the company culture more than the Australian environment.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure what the de facto rules are in your case.  For de facto status with an Australian partner, IIRC you need to show documentary proof that you and your partner have been living together for at least a year by showing shared utility bills, leases and such.  If the relationship is serious, you might be able to declare that you're engaged, but that's just a guess.  I'd suggest having a chat with an immigration agent.</p>

              <p>australians hate almost everyone,,,especially those that they fought back in ww2.indians are least hated even though its advertised of them being murdered etc.....their skull structure look somehat european due to their indo european bloodlines thing...so they would blend well as an extremely dark "europeans".</p>
              <p>but after watching how their australian views from certain situation back in ww2 ..take ferinstance ,they had a australian destroyer with 300 crewmen ( all killed and missing )was sunk by a german fishing trawler near perth.and the german trawler was commanded by a german iron cross holder armed with some miserable cannons and small arms.so after the destroyer was sunk by the german fishing trawler(almost no lives lost)....the partially damaged german fishing trawler crew was captured and interrogated by the australians and the australians still refused to believe their magnificent destroyer was sunk by a fishing trawler from germany as claimed by the german commander.</p>
              <p>so now the australians shifted the blame to the japanese saying japanese submarine sunk their destroyer  instead.</p>
              <p>the australians could say their destroyer  n entire crew  were wiped out by german u-boats.but no...they still insisted till today that some japanese submarine wiped out their destroyer.sounds like some racist thing really as i read the same story every year on the ships sinking anniversary.instead of blaming it on the  germans they blame it on the japanese.</p>
              <p>so their attitude speaks volumes....u might meet a few good n kind australians..but im not so sure about the rest.</p>

              <p>I don't have a choice, I studied at Monash clayton campus. And I travel down to Frankston Monash to see my ex gf (last time). Clayton, low rent meh? Very near to Box Hill, got good vietnamese cuisine.</p>
              <p>Got one time I was attending a copperfield concert at the MCG and then it was late, so I took the tram back home. But the tram just crowded and the indian driver had to scold the passengers not to rush into it. Unfortunately the Aussie youths started harrassing the indian driver and made fun of his indian accent.</p>
              <p>The indians have now hit back. Recently according to newspaper reports, there have been a molester hitting out on young Aussie women near pubs. The Aussie women identified the molester as an indian who goes and ambush young aussie women walking alone and groupe them. Gulp, I hope I don't get groupe. Also, I have to escort my gf all the time because not safe to walk alone in Aust streets. Then again, the chance of me taking the transfer is very slim because of difficulty in bringing gf there. I am not appyuing for citizen, I am just an employee thinking of taking up the internal company transfer.</p>
              <p>Then there was also one time I heard of an Aussie Serial Killer called the Mutilater. He invites and befriends men in Pubs then he brings them back to his home, give them a beer, relax them on the couch or arm chair. Then he takes out a giant dagger or hunting knife and stabs them numerous times like the movie Psycho. I feel scared to befriend strangers in Aust and tell my gf not to trust anybody because a lot of wierdos there like Ivan Milat.</p>
              <p>In S'pore the only dangerous people you find are Mat Selamat and PAP ahahahaha.</p>

              <p>Crazy men in Aust are crazy because they are high on drugs or they are drunk. The problem in Aust is tht they dont institute capital punishment for drug smugglers. That is why the streets are filled with drug smugglers. Recently there have been mafia assasinations in Aust because of an ongoing mafia war over drug turf.</p>
              <p>Yeah lor, those Aussies always like to ask for small change. Irritating like hell. Sometimes, I felt that some of them don't need to work at all, lerk around in bus stops and start conversation with strangers wearing rags. I once saw an Aussie woman who is so overweight but she relies on unemployment cheques every month. And the addional income she gets by asking strangers for loose change is very lucrative income.</p>
              <p>For obvious reasons, the malays dont like the singaporeans. There is great culture clash. My advice to you guys is that after working in high performance singaporean culture, you will find surprise to see how lazy people are working in other enviornments. Try to push them, they have ways to snub you, talk behind your back, make a fool out of you, talk sarcastic at you. Their trick is to burn you out with their inefficiency. Few days ago, I went shopping over the weekend with my gf, i wanted to buy a t-shirt, so i asked the majority race sales man whether i can take off the protective tag to try on the t-shirt. I understand that the guy is fasting but he looks so half dead and ignored me. On the positive note, at least there were some kind majority race people in malaysia,that day i accidentaly dropped my parking ticket when i took out my wallet, didn't know, he kindly let me know that i dropped something. If only there are more people like him. Also at restaurants or mamaks, I have to wait like 10 min, sometimes the indian mamak ignore my order. So inefficient. My gf being a malaysian, is so patient with them. But when i bring her to singapore, eat eat at paragon, she so amazed at the level of service compared to dying malaysia.</p>
              <p>Australia may be strong with trade unions but if management wants to retrench people it is easy. In Malaysia, you need to get government permission to retrench people particularly the malays. So, MNCs here have difficulty in doing so. And that is why some companies like Panasonic shipped out.</p>

              <p>It's a bit of a challenge to generalise about working attitudes of any race or nationality.  Certainly Australia's got its fair share of slackers, but then again, a competitive environment here is no less motivated here than it is anywhere else.  By convention, the working week here is 38.5 hours, but in my office, anything less than 50 hours means that you're dodging projects.  Not that it's all bad - when it's time to party we party hard.  All in all, it's going to be influenced by the company culture more than the Australian environment.</p>
              <p>I'm not sure what the de facto rules are in your case.  For de facto status with an Australian partner, IIRC you need to show documentary proof that you and your partner have been living together for at least a year by showing shared utility bills, leases and such.  If the relationship is serious, you might be able to declare that you're engaged, but that's just a guess.  I'd suggest having a chat with an immigration agent.</p>

              <p>6.11 Clearly some of the items in this ABCI report are not of great weight, at least when taken isolation, as the Queensland Premier, Mr Goss, pointed out. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note141"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#141</span></span></a> Also the report has to be read for what it is - intelligence and allegations based on a variety of sources of varying quality and reliability, rather than information proven in court proceedings. Subsequent investigations failed to confirm some of the suggestions in the report, such as the suggestion that yakuza were involved in the commission arrangements by which tour guides brought Japanese tour groups to particular shops and tourist venues and intimidation of local businesses. Claims relating to casinos, and to money laundering generally are examined in <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#para631"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">paragraph 6.31 below</span></span></a>.</p>
              <p>6.12 In 1992, there were further claims that the Japanese company, Daikyo, had yakuza associations. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note142"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#142</span></span></a> Daikyo was at one stage a shareholder in Jupiters Casino on the Gold Coast and was part of a consortium interested in bidding for a licence to operate a casino in Brisbane. It also has other tourism-related interests in Queensland. The claims were strongly denied by Daikyo.

              <p><a name="_Ref310919473"></a><a name="para613"></a>6.13 In 1993 it emerged that Mr Masaru Takumi, second in charge of the Yamaguchi-gumi yakuza group, was a frequent visitor to Australia and a company he owned had bought a penthouse on the Gold Coast. The Minister for Immigration subsequently cancelled Mr Takumi's visitor's visa on the basis of his admitted membership of the Yamaguchi-gumi. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note145"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#145</span></span></a> In the publicity surrounding this case a newspaper reported that a Japanese businessman had lost a large sum to another Japanese businessman on the Gold Coast in 1992 in a 'shonky business deal'.

              <p>6.14 Some yakuza members have been deported from Australia because they failed to disclose their criminal records when applying for visitor visas. In some cases these visitors have apparently had large sums of cash in their possession. For example, according to a media report a group of three deported in November 1991 had more than $500,000 in Australian currency in their possession, which they were allowed to take with them because Australian officials could not prove that they had obtained it illegally. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note147"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#147</span></span></a> The AFP's <em>Annual Report 1991-92</em>, p. 22 stated:</p>
              <blockquote>Several Japanese Yakuza members and gang leaders have been identified as having visited Australia. A number of Yakuza members were detected violating immigration laws - mainly through failing to declare their past criminal records when applying for visas - and in co-operation with the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, AFP officers 'supervised' their departure from Australia. </blockquote>
              <p>6.15 In May 1991 Mr Sueharu Suzuki was deported for failure to disclose his criminal convictions when applying for his entry visa. He apparently admitted that he was a former yakuza member. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note148"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#148</span></span></a> It seems he had visited Queensland for two years before his arrest and had, through companies, purchased properties in several parts of the State, one of which he said he was planning to develop into a rural retreat for the staff of his car dealership in Tokyo. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note149"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#149</span></span></a></p>
              <p>6.16 In 1991, a yakuza visitor was successfully prosecuted under the <em>Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988</em> for failing to declare that he was carrying more than $5,000 when attempting to leave Australia via Brisbane Airport for Japan. The person involved, Mr Chun Yong, was a Korean national said to be the leader of a yakuza gang called the Toa Yuai Jigyo Kumiai, and he had an extensive criminal record. He was reported to have had $155,000 in his possession when he arrived, and was attempting to leave with $68,000 in yen and Australian dollars. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note150"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#150</span></span></a></p>
              <p>6.17 The Australian Federal Police <em>Annual Report 1992-93</em>, p. 29 stated that inquiries into Japanese organised crime in Australia indicated that an Australian and a Japanese national were allegedly involved in a fraudulent migration scheme to qualify Japanese investors under the Business Migration Scheme. A total of $8 million was apparently lost by several Japanese businessmen in the scheme. However, the annual report makes no explicit reference to any yakuza involvement. There are other cases where a Japanese living in Australia has allegedly attempted to defraud visiting Japanese, but there has apparently been no evidence of any yakuza involvement in these cases.</p>
              <p>6.18 On 21 March 1994 the <em>Australian Financial Review</em> reported:</p>
              <blockquote>Japan's organised crime syndicates are moving into Australian industry and targeting legitimate companies as a crackdown on the gangs at home sends them looking for new opportunities abroad. </blockquote><blockquote>The Federal Police have recently opened five separate and substantial investigations into yakuza investment and crime in Australia. Four of these involve attempts to either invest in, or extort money from, legitimate businesses and business people operating in Australia. </blockquote><blockquote>There are indications that a Japanese syndicate is attempting to buy into an established Australian export industry to provide the conduit and cover for a major international drug trans-shipment route. ... </blockquote><blockquote>From what the Australian authorities have been able to uncover of the gangs' activities, they are now investigating: </blockquote>

              </ul>
              <p>6.19 In June 1992 seven Japanese, ostensibly tourists, were arrested on arrival at Melbourne airport from Malaysia when their luggage was found to contain 12 kilograms of heroin. Five of them, and a Malaysian national, were subsequently convicted and sentenced to terms totalling 105 years of imprisonment. One of those convicted was the leader of the tourist group, Yoshio Katsuno, who was sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment. One media report identified him as a 'former member' of the yakuza. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note152"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#152</span></span></a> Another said that Katsuno 'had been identified as a mid-level member of a Tokyo cell' of the yakuza. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note153"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#153</span></span></a> However, there was no suggestion that the yakuza had organised the importation. Rather the reports seems to suggest an ethnic-Chinese group based in Malaysia was the organiser. One media report described the case as 'the only known arrest which involved elements of ... the Yakuza in a South East Asian drug syndicate'. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note154"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#154</span></span></a></p>
              <p>6.20 Finally in this collation of reports of yakuza activity in Australia, the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission has reportedly investigated claims that recruitment of Australians to work in Japan may be connected with yakuza-linked organised prostitution in Japan. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note155"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#155</span></span></a> According to a media story based on a leaked CJC report, 'A member of the political staff of the Australian embassy in Japan has confirmed Australian women are being recruited for the Japanese sex industry after their passports were taken by Yakuza members'. <a name="_Toc310924725"></a><a name="_Toc311017328"></a><a name="_Toc311092158"></a><a name="_Toc315077688"></a><a name="_Toc315078080"></a><a name="_Toc315078392"></a><a name="head621"></a><a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note156"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#156</span></span></a></p>
              <h4>How Real is the Threat from the Yakuza?</h4>
              <p>6.21 A fair summary of the above would be that there is clear evidence of recreational visits by yakuza gang members, some of which have involved false statements about criminal antecedents in order to obtain the necessary visa, and at least one of which involved a breach of cash reporting law. There is evidence of some relatively minor real estate investments by yakuza-related companies, but these investments are not in themselves illegal. There are many other claims and allegations, as the preceding paragraphs have indicated, but there appears to be no hard direct evidence of illegal activity by yakuza gangs in Australia. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note157"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#157</span></span></a></p>
              <p>6.22 In August 1990 the Director of Intelligence at the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission, Mr Jack Morris, was asked what evidence it had that yakuza principals had infiltrated Queensland and were involved in organised criminal activities. He responded by saying that 'we really have no hard evidence that would point to it, except that some overt or open source people have told us that they have seen them, and that they have visited different areas of the State, and I'm talking about a very small number [that] have been observed'. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note158"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#158</span></span></a> The Queensland Tourism Minister, Mr Gibbs, said in 1991: 'I am concerned about the fantasy that some people have suddenly developed about the Yakuza. If the Yakuza operate in this State ... nobody ... would support more thoroughly than myself a full investigation ... I understand that there is no proof that that is happening. There is suspicion of it, but there is no proof.' <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note159"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#159</span></span></a></p>
              <p>6.23 In 1992, the Committee raised a current media report <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note160"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#160</span></span></a> about yakuza infiltration into Australia with the National Crime Authority. The response included a note of caution from Authority Member Malcolm Gray, QC:</p>
              <blockquote>One of the problems about this area is that a lot of it is anecdotal. Indeed, if you read that article it is really more anecdotal than based on any specific instance. The mere fact that a person is Japanese and that he buys property does not make him a member of the Yakuza or imply that there is a Yakuza takeover of property, particularly in Queensland. </blockquote><blockquote>I just make that as an observation because it is a little bit like Chinese and Triads, or Italians and the Mafia. There is a tendency to associate the ethnic group with the criminal element within that ethnic group without necessarily there being any justification for doing so. </blockquote><blockquote><strong>Mr Cusack</strong> [a Member of the Authority] - The AFP had a report on the Yakuza. At that stage, although they were still investigating it, the AFP could show no link between people buying property on the Gold Coast and the Yakuza, as was being alleged. There are members of the Yakuza who are coming into Australia, they can show that, but as regards any links, so far that has not been achieved. </blockquote><blockquote><strong>Senator JONES</strong> - There have been a number of reports, and not just this one, about the purchase of property. There have also been a number of reports in relation to the Yakuza and child prostitution. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note161"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#161</span></span></a> Those sorts of reports have been coming through too. </blockquote><blockquote><strong>Mr Sherman</strong> - It is something we cannot take for granted. I agree with everything Mr Gray has said and we will keep an eye on it. ... <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note162"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#162</span></span></a> </blockquote>
              <p>6.24 In written answers in October 1992 to questions asked in the Senate, the then Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, said that the AFP was not aware of any evidence which would support the suggestion that the Queensland tourist industry was being used to launder profits from Japanese criminal activity. Nor did the AFP have any evidence to support the claim that the yakuza's penetration of the Queensland property market could be well above 25 per cent. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note163"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#163</span></span></a></p>
              <p>6.25 A media report in May 1993 noted: 'Australia's law enforcement agencies believe that the Yakuza have not moved into Australia in a big way. They believe that most identified Yakuza who visit are here for a holiday and nothing else.' <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note164"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#164</span></span></a> Two criminologists, Paul Wilson and Phil Dickie, expressed the view in a paper published in 1993 that there was:</p>
              <blockquote>no compelling evidence of widespread Japanese involvement in traditional criminal activities in Queensland; however, there is a legitimate concern over the potential for illegally sourced incoming investment flows to produce local and regional economic and social distortions. It appears that what law enforcement agencies and governments need to do in relation to the Yakusa 'threat' is to be more sure of where money for such things as tourism development come from. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note165"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#165</span></span></a> </blockquote>
              <p>6.26 The section of the <em>Report of the Review of Commonwealth Law Enforcement Arrangements</em> dealing specifically with the yakuza suggests that yakuza groups are not currently operating here. The Report notes that historically in Japan the yakuza were to some degree a tolerated part of society and comments:</p>
              <blockquote>4.79 Since 1991, however, there has been a major government push against these groups. Armed with new anti-gang laws, Japanese authorities have been mounting successful operations against <em>Yakuza</em> groups and their leaders. While law enforcement agencies have known of recreational visits to Australia by <em>Yakuza</em> members for much of the past decade, the Japanese Government initiative may eventually cause <em>Yakuza</em> members to try to establish themselves in this country. <em>Yakuza</em> groups may see Australia as a place where they could recoup some of the profits lost in Japan. </blockquote><blockquote>4.80 A number of AFP investigations have revealed the presence in Australia of <em>Yakuza</em> members. </blockquote><blockquote>4.81 As with the Colombian syndicates, the resources available to the <em>Yakuza</em> groups would make them difficult for Australian law enforcement agencies to counteract <span style="text-decoration: underline;">if</span> they established a presence here. (emphasis added) </blockquote>
              <p>6.27 The absence of a large, geographically-concentrated, Japanese community in Australia makes it less easy for yakuza to prey on Japanese here, in the way that Vietnamese and Chinese criminals have been said to prey on their (larger) respective ethnic communities in Australia. In addition, the close interest taken in yakuza visitors by Australian law enforcement agencies, and the attendant media publicity, may have discouraged visiting yakuza from seeing Australia as anything more than a holiday destination.</p>
              <p>6.28 It has been pointed out that most yakuza cannot speak English, and that this provides a considerable barrier to their gaining a foothold in Australia. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note166"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#166</span></span></a> On the other hand, the language barrier also poses difficulties for Australian law enforcement agencies trying to investigate alleged yakuza activities: the use of standard techniques for investigating organised criminal activity, such as undercover investigators, infiltration techniques and telecommunication interception and electronic eavesdropping, all become more difficult.</p>
              <p>6.29 The view was noted above that the economic slow-down in Japan, combined with the boryokudan countermeasures law, would push the yakuza overseas to places such as Australia. However, another view is that the chance of a concerted push by yakuza gangs into Australia has dropped sharply as a result of the changed economic climate in Japan. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note167"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#167</span></span></a> If the main interest of the yakuza in Australia to date has been the investment and laundering of profits, there is some logic is believing that the interest would decline as yakuza profits in Japan declined. If the number of media reports about alleged yakuza activities in Australia is any guide, there has been a marked reduction in the last year or so.</p>
              <p>6.30 There are no reported cases in Australia of violence by yakuza groups, or of yakuza-organised drug trafficking into Australia. Nor have there been any reported prosecutions for yakuza-related extortion or any reports identifying specific companies on the receiving end of the sort of corporate blackmail which has been a noted feature of yakuza activity in Japan. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note168"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#168</span></span></a> There have been no proven cases of corruption of politicians or public office holders in Australia by yakuza. Apart from the false visa application cases and the failure to declare cash at the customs barrier, there have not been any media reports of arrests or convictions of yakuza members in Australia. There is manifestly a close media interest in anything relating to the yakuza that occurs in Australia. It is fair to assume from this, that had there been any arrests or prosecutions in cases with clear or even peripheral yakuza involvement, they would have received publicity.</p>
              <p><a name="_Ref311085995"></a><a name="para631"></a>6.31 Claims that yakuza members were visiting Australian casinos in the early 1990s to launder money must be read in the light of the NCA's 1991 investigation into money laundering generally. This found 'no known cases whereby casinos were used to conceal the origin of criminal funds'. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note169"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#169</span></span></a> The popular view that legal casinos provide a ready means to launder money is simply not correct. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note170"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#170</span></span></a> Monitoring of Mr Masaru Takumi (referred to in <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#para613"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">paragraph 6.13 above</span></span></a>) revealed no evidence of his participation in casino gambling that could lead to money laundering. It did reveal that his wife had lost about $10,000 at Jupiters Casino. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note171"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#171</span></span></a></p>
              <p>6.32 The NCA's investigation also noted the claims that real estate was used to launder the proceeds of overseas crimes. On this point, the study found: 'There are, however, only a very few confirmed cases which document the laundering or investment of proceeds of crime generated overseas in Australia'. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note172"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#172</span></span></a> The study did note, however, the need for better information on the proceeds of crime that might be entering Australia. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note173"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#173</span></span></a></p>
              <p>6.33 It was also said in 1991 that there was no logical reason why yakuza members would want to come to Australia to try to launder money, given that there were at the time no restrictions on money exchanges in Japan. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note174"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#174</span></span></a> The relative sophistication of Australian measures for the detection of money laundering must surely lessen Australia's attractiveness for this purpose. The presence of strong Australian legislation against money laundering makes it risky for overseas criminal groups to use this country. There are still many other countries in which money laundering is not a crime, or where few measures are in place to detect it.</p>
              <p>6.34 Although not involving the yakuza, the Law and Chun case illustrates the risk of confiscation for those investing the proceeds of overseas criminal activity in Australia. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note175"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#175</span></span></a> Law Kin Man is alleged to have made profits of at least US$100 million in the late 1980s by smuggling heroin from south east Asia into the United States. He is currently in custody there awaiting trial, after having been arrested in Hong Kong in 1989 and extradited to the United States in 1992. His profits from the United States were moved to Hong Kong. From Hong Kong, some A$23 million was sent to Australia and invested in real estate by Law's wife, Deborah Chun, at his direction. She had been an Australian resident since 1983. On receiving information from the Hong Kong authorities, the NCA had taken an interest in her activities and discovered the real estate purchases. Action under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 was taken against Chun and the family company she controlled. Both pleaded guilty. In September 1983, the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) obtained forfeiture orders in relation to $1,440,025 in cash and real estate valued at $4,050,000. In addition, the DPP obtained pecuniary penalty orders against Chun and her company totalling over $10 million. As at 30 June 1994, some $8.9 million had been recovered and paid into the Confiscated Assets Trust Fund.</p>
              <p>6.35 The success in the Law and Chun case was attributable in considerable measure to the close cooperation between Australian, Hong Kong and United States authorities. However, close international cooperation is not always possible, and the absence of any proven cases of investment of yakuza money in Australia does not mean that no cases have occurred. Australian investigators have difficulty in verifying the source of funds coming from Japan so as to determine if they are the proceeds of crime. United States investigators have experienced similar difficulties, as a recent report noted:</p>
              <blockquote>Despite the fact that Japanese organized crime groups are believed to have invested hundreds of millions of dollars of profits from their criminal enterprises in U.S. real estate during the past decade, U.S. law enforcement authorities have had almost no success in dealing with this problem. The reasons are twofold: First, U.S. officials face almost insurmountable difficulties in tracing the source of Japanese funds used to purchase U.S. properties; second even if such information is obtained, loopholes in current U.S. law on money laundering make successful prosecution unlikely. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note176"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#176</span></span></a> </blockquote>
              <p>6.36 Apart from the inherent difficulties in following money trails in foreign countries, Japanese privacy law limits the ability of its police to provide information on Japanese citizens to foreign law enforcement agencies. It seems that in at least two instances yakuza members or associates have sued the National Police Agency for releasing information to United States officials. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note177"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#177</span></span></a> Information may only be provided if there is a suspicion that a specific crime has been committed. Moreover, the crime must involve an act that, if committed in Japan, would be illegal under Japanese law. <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/#note178"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0066cc;">note#178</span></span></a> As noted above, yakuza membership <em>per se </em>is not a crime in Japan. Because Japanese money laundering law covers only the profits of drug trafficking, Japanese agencies will only cooperate in trying to identify a source of suspect funds in drug trafficking cases. As noted above, much of the yakuza gangs' income comes from non-drug activities.</p>

              <p>The Finnish-led study was based on analysis of 2,214 middle-aged British civil servants.</p>
              <p>It found that those working more than 55 hours a week had poorer mental skills than those who worked a standard working week.</p>
              <p>The American Journal of Epidemiology study found hard workers had problems with short-term memory and word recall. </p>

              Lead researcher Dr Marianna Virtanen, from the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, said: "The disadvantages of overtime work should be taken seriously."</p>
              <p>It is not known why working long hours might have an adverse effect on the brain.</p>
              <p>However, the researchers say key factors could include increased sleeping problems, depression, an unhealthy lifestyle and a raised risk of cardiovascular disease, possibly linked to stress.</p>
              <p>The civil servants who took part in the study took five different tests of their mental function, once between 1997 and 1999, and again between 2002 and 2004.</p>
              <p>Those doing the most overtime recorded lower scores in two of the five tests, assessing reasoning and vocabulary.</p>
              <p><strong>Cumulative effect</strong></p>
              <p>The effects were cumulative, the longer the working week was the worse the test results were.</p>
              <p>Employees with long working hours also had shorter sleeping hours, reported more symptoms of depression and used more alcohol than those with normal working hours.</p>
              <p>Professor Mika Kivimäki, who also worked on the study, said "We will go on with this study question in the future.</p>
              <p>"It is particularly important to examine whether the effects are long-lasting and whether long working hours predict more serious conditions such as dementia."</p>
              <p>Professor Cary Cooper, an expert in workplace stress at the University of Lancaster, said it had been long established that consistently working long hours was bad for general health, and now this study suggested it was also bad for mental functioning.</p>
              <p>He said: "This should say to employers that insisting people work long hours is actually not good for your business, and that there is a business case for making sure people have a good work-life balance.</p>
              <p>"But my worry is that in a recession people will actually work longer hours. There will be a culture of "presenteeism" - people will go to work even if they are ill because they want to show commitment, and make sure they are not the next to be made redundant."</p>
              <p>Harriet Millward, deputy chief executive of the Alzheimer's Research Trust, said: "This study should give pause for thought to workaholics.</p>
              <p>"We already know that dementia risk can be reduced by maintaining a balanced diet, regular social interactions and exercising both our bodies and minds. Perhaps work-life balance should be accounted for too." </p>

              <p>Always travel in groups when you're out in the night, ensure that no one in the group is a coward.. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"> The best option would be never to go out in the night..well, unless you're a teenager.</p>
              <p>Clubbing till 8am in the morning is a norm with one visiting 3 clubs in a night..</p>
              <p>Stay at places near Melbourne Uni, such as leichester street. Sub-urbs worth living: South Yarra.</p>
              <p>Gangs are common...don't wanna name any certain countrie<strong>s</strong> here (did I just gave a hint? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">)</p>
              <p>The locals in Australia don't percieve a huge difference between a Singapore chinese, china chinese, malaysian chinese or brunei chinese because they are simply regarded as chinese. A simpler term would be asian.</p>

              They cannot cook steak and it really sucks. I tried twice and I
              kinda gave up. You would think that they should be able to cook
              steaks well.</p>
              <p>They do make very good fish &amp; chips though.</p>

              <p>They actually make good steaks..It all depends on who made it and who ordered it...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>The reason why japanese are not well-liked in Australia is...(think about it)</p>
              <p>Another point to note: The china chinese kids who study in Australia on expenses paid by their parents are very rich...Likwise for Indonesian chinese kids and malaysians. China kids are much richer though...</p>
