              <p>For those who don't know me, I am a Singaporean who over the years been transferred to various working locations in the SEA region. I worked in Bangkok for 2 years, and I am now in the Malaysian branch for 1.5 years running now. Recently the head office in S'pore offered me a place in Australia.</p>
              <p>This is really good opportunity for me because I was really sick and tired of working in the Malaysian branch. I am not racist but truly enough the way the Malays work have been utterly uncooperative and they have a huge attitude problem. I have been facing problems in trying to solve logistical breakdowns due to their attitude problem and lack of inititiative in their work. Not able to fulfill my KPIs I get the blame.</p>
              <p>So I am mulling over this transfer to Aust and thinking whether if it would be a great idea. I hv heard that some Aust may have this kind of attitude problem so I just want to ask if there is anybody who have worked there, how are the working attitude like?</p>
              <p>Moreover, I have to consider my sabahan girlfren. If I were to go over there on a working VISA sponsored by my employer, how do I bring her along? Can she qualify as my De-Facto partner? what requirements do I need to prove that she is my De-facto partner?</p>
              <p>I know the grass is not greenier on the other side but its more grenier than the shitty working culture in Malaysia. You have no idea how horrible their working attitude is, they just cohort with each other to make your life difficult. They collude and help each other to sabotage the work. Its like managing a kindergarden full of adult miscreants.</p>

              <p>Different companies got different terms and conditions, if you are a talented person, I believe your partner can get a 3month to a year visa depend on the Aust immigration policy. Since you have decided to leave malaysia for Aust, go ahead, aust should offer higher oversea compensation than malaysia.</p>
              <p>Oversea expatriate who came here as senior mgt get full boarding, car, if available, and family or partner can also come along, but no working for them.</p>

              <p><br>The posting is to Sydney. I hope no hillbillies there. Last time when i was in Bangkok, my Australian boss is quite hardworking and he is a good organizer. This gave me the impression that Aussies can work. But I am surprise to hear from you that it is otherwise. Terminator Hitman....you still working in Aust or are you back? If the situation there is not good, why you still want to work there and not come back?</p>
              <p>Yes, I am not surprise they can be violent especially the Aussie labourers, because they are so big size. Sad to hear that they play Monopoly. Perhaps the problem is worldwide. The malays play monopoly but they are not violent, good thing they don't beat people up.</p>
              <p>I am not very sure yet. But there is 60% chance i say no, sighhhhh, because my gf probably wouldn't qualify for VISA. I would want to register marriage ASAP but aiseh, my father want proper wedding dinner and tea ceremony first....sighhhhh</p>
              <p>So I have to start saving money. How nice if wedding can be a simple marriage in Las Vegas, just few friends and family. But now have to book big big hotel, invite half the people strangers (mostly father and mother friends).</p>

              <p>Don't expect too much from the Ozzies. I think the experience might be more or less the same, depending on where you are posted too</p>
              <p>From what I understand from my husband all they do everyday is stand around and drink coffee and smoke at his work place and not work at all.</p>
              <p>Just so you know if you are there as Management, the unions in Australia are very very strong and you really don't want upsetting them.</p>
              <p>Oh yeah one thing about the Ozzies is that I think they all suffer from verbal diarrhoea; They cannot stop talking. They perceive you as unfriendly if you don't engage in the meaningless prattle they indulge in eg. "How is your day? It's fine weather today isn't it ...I picked up xxxxxxx over the weekend and blah blah blah blah" .</p>
              <p>The Ozzies are also tightening their import of FTs so I'm not sure if your GF will qualify for anything. Anyway, maybe you should consider how long you are there. She can just drop by to visit. Personally I think a long distance relationship will work if there is strong mutual trust between the 2 of you and that she is very independent.</p>

              <p><br>No lar, she won't qualify, sighh, she is only a marketing grad in Malaysia. Looks like I have to wave the offer. I do not like LDR, never work for me and for her. Tigthening FTs? My cousin just got his PR last week.</p>
              <p>I hv handled unions in malaysia, frankly it is not the union problem, it is more the people problem stemming from Malaysia govt policies. I am in logistics so as long as the quality problem from union strikes don't come to my warehouse, then I am fine.</p>
