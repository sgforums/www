              <p>I can't help but agree with you on this.</p>
              <p>The worst steak I ever ate was in Oz... with all the beef they hv you should think they can cook a steak properly -_-" and the restaurant was supposed to serve pretty decent steak. My medium rare steak came to me so well done I swear I could hv killed someone with it. (At least if it came to me Medium well, I wouldn't complain so much)</p>
              <p>Oh ya, they have a lot of very good pies though.</p>
              <p>I think though you can get very decent Asian fare in Sydney, especially if you like Korean food. I still miss Madang ... the Korean BBQ is way better than the ones we get here in SG.</p>

              <p>really elindra???u too had that steak problem???</p>
              <p>first steak i ate was at a hotel....didnt remeber anything bout it cept it was brown and so so....spore steak at jacks place seems more professional.</p>
              <p>second steak i had was at some place where u could select your steak, salad etc.u hand it over to cookwith a paper that says medium rare ,rare etc.up to now i cant remeber what the steak looked ot tasted.</p>
              <p>3rd steak was at some gambling house and i remebered it as the cheapest steak i ever came across....thin but ok.but seems like their steak dun taste as good as US beef.</p>
              <p>after that i went to fish n chips n they were the best compared to steak!!!!</p>
              <p>korean food......i should say the meat is well marinated as compared to ang mos in oz.food in oz is dull and tasteless.</p>
              <p>i havent went to sydney or melb.....but i heard its alright ...is it?????is kinda afraid.i have went to brisbane and found that they have more chinese food at the food courts there.wanton noodles,shanghai noodles...those kinda stuff all prepared by asians.tasted their roast duck rice....duck was so salty and not really nice....went around and ended up eating a whopper meal at  burger kings hungry jacks and KFC instead...stuff i always eat in spore.</p>
              <p>sure they have chinese fried chicken wings or char siew rice but somehow it tastes as exciting as the takeaway sushi shops......</p>

              <p>Sydney &amp; Melbourne you can get very good Asian food.</p>
              <p>I think it's much better cooking your own steaks at home in Oz. They cannot cook steak and it really sucks. I tried twice and I kinda gave up. You would think that they should be able to cook steaks well.</p>
              <p>They do make very good fish &amp; chips though.</p>

              <p>Terminator,</p>
              <p>You have a point about returning to singapore, that is why I've been happily taking up postings from my company to work regionally. Over the years, I worked short stints in Thailand, Cambodia but unfortunately I got myself into Malaysia which the working culture here is so racially divided. The chinese and indians are made to work like the majority because if they don't they will be snubbed and treated like a lone wolf. For so-called expats like me, it is even worse, they look at me like I am an occupier.</p>
              <p>Whenever they hear of words like "JIT", Kanzai, zero defect, lets work harder, lets work smarter, more KPIs, the majority race sniff at your initiatives and they go around the corner in thebush somewhere or in the cafeteria to talk behind your back and tell everyone how rubbish your proposals are. And they are smart at playing monopoly, they get the old serving chinese and indians to support them so that it won't look like a racial thing. The chinese and indians have no choice but to support them because they know they are the minority and they have the capacity to tolerate more than any other race. If they don't, they get excommunicated.</p>
              <p>Sometimse I get into heated arguments with other managers of the majority people because they like to play tai chi and they always hide figures that distort their records. Some schedules i need to complete my work don't get completed by them for months. And then when you ask them for things or information, they answer you in a very rude and sarcastic way to disrespect you. Also they like to do repetittive work that don't require much thinking like a cashier or a toll booth operator, but when you want them to do exciting work that make them think out of the box and analyse, they get angry at you because for them it means more work and less pay. They want more pay without having to do any more harder work. When I say "majority", I don't want to say who they are but you can make your best guess.</p>

              <p>aged beef????i prefer them fresh....i age them in marinade sauce in fridge.but ones i got from spore supermarkets had been in freezer for sometime and they taste better than  the ones i get from qld supermarket t-bone steak....or porter house steak.veal is nice.....cuts from lamb especially lam shanks are great.....lamb shanks after boiling for 45mins ...their meat taste kind of like sea turtle meat from my lost years.</p>
              <p>melb beef i had  seems like any beef from packaging.didnt say it was cured or not....but it did had that buttery taste not often associated with qld beef.</p>

              <p>well,,,,,,,as long as u can be happy with your wife.if they want u to do their werk.....then time to get transferred to a nicer place with wife.i dont know who is on the other side of your sydney operations but sydney is multicultural with japanese being there for a generation or so.however the japanese are the folks the australians truly hate and seems like that jap dude didnt have a job in sydney  even though he had a business degree when i first met them back in 2001.&gt;&gt;aka kenzi.....i actually dunno what to make out of sydney from past exposure.what did your relative tell u about australia???are u going there to oz or not?</p>
              <p>but if u do goto sydney u are allowed to bring a wife u need to recheck on what the immigration visa category says about your visa.im sure they would allow.just check it out again to confirm....dont rush and end up like some dude who came back to spore from holland.then u need to see if u are allowed to apply for a p.r. in oz....from DIAC immigration website followups...its all linked step by step from website.</p>

              <p>aged beef????i prefer them fresh....i age them in marinade sauce in fridge.but ones i got from spore supermarkets had been in freezer for sometime and they taste better than  the ones i get from qld supermarket t-bone steak....or porter house steak.veal is nice.....cuts from lamb especially lam shanks are great.....lamb shanks after boiling for 45mins ...their meat taste kind of like sea turtle meat from my lost years.</p>
              <p>melb beef i had  seems like any beef from packaging.didnt say it was cured or not....but it did had that buttery taste not often associated with qld beef.</p>

              <p><br>You should try the Alberta AAA Grade dry aged for 45 days beef.</p>
              <p>It's really really really good. 1 inch thick medium rare steak that melts in your mouth with super buttery fat and the flavour is to die for!!!</p>

              <p>well,,,,,,,as long as u can be happy with your wife.if they want u to do their werk.....then time to get transferred to a nicer place with wife.i dont know who is on the other side of your sydney operations but sydney is multicultural with japanese being there for a generation or so.however the japanese are the folks the australians truly hate and seems like that jap dude didnt have a job in sydney  even though he had a business degree when i first met them back in 2001.&gt;&gt;aka kenzi.....i actually dunno what to make out of sydney from past exposure.what did your relative tell u about australia???are u going there to oz or not?</p>
              <p>but if u do goto sydney u are allowed to bring a wife u need to recheck on what the immigration visa category says about your visa.im sure they would allow.just check it out again to confirm....dont rush and end up like some dude who came back to spore from holland.then u need to see if u are allowed to apply for a p.r. in oz....from DIAC immigration website followups...its all linked step by step from website.</p>

              <p>No plans to immigrate, just a job transfer. We're engage but we're not married yet due to me have to safe money for all those $$$ wedding expenses. I don't think i can take the transfer because I do not want to be in a LDR.</p>
              <p>Correct me if I am wrong but according the news report I read, I thought the Aussies hated the Indians even more. There were lately a lot of racial attacks against them as reported in the papers.</p>
              <p>I have been to Australia 12 years ago. But at that time I had a bad experience whereby I was sitting in the train to Clayton and there was this drunkard shirtless Aussie walking from coach to coach yelling profanities to us Asians. And then there was this Indian student sitting there, the Aussie practically sat on top of him and called him a black shit. It was such an awful experience.</p>
              <p>And then there was another time, I got off the train at Frankston, then three teenage boys asked me for money. When I didn't give them any, they went back to theirbags and grabbed some metal sticks and switchblades. I quickly ran and they gave chase. Luckily my friend was supposed to pick me up at the Frankston station and I ran straight to his car and we sped off before the boys could reach me.</p>

              <p>Of course they heard of Kanzai and JIT. They are smart people and very monopoly wan. But they want money the easy way. They want to earn money without having to work hard. That is why the chinese and indian work hard. Unfortunately some chinese and indian also beginning to become like them due to bad influence and no incentive to improve.</p>
              <p>Biggest problem is the attitude problem. You can give them how much incentive also, they will never improve wan. As I say, they want to earn more money but work as less as possible. Where got such thing?</p>
              <p>Company is still generating profit so who knows ? They may stay around for a while but I believe there is always karma, one day the plant may close down.</p>
