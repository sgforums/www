See, I am trying to give B a chance but I dunno why, I can sense that he is kinda 'colder' towards me now...Maybe it is becos we are both busy with exams and stuff, but the truth is I need someone even more during this time. Maybe I am being too demanding, I dunno. Last time, before the exam, he used to call me all the time to ask me out for meals but now he didn't call anymore, and I am the one who is calling him now and he won't be in his room. I think I should just continue to play hard to get like last time...and then he will pay more attention to me again hehehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> But anyway just need opinions here...feel free to comment...<br><br>i.c.y</div></blockquote>U said B seems colder. Probably exam fever. But it could possibly be some signal that u gave him before. Think back. Did u say anything or indicate to him that u like another guy then? It may be that u did and he decides to back off, because he respects your decision. He also will not want to be hurt himself if he believes u only have feelings for another person. That is normal. He may not know u are giving him a chance. <strong>DO NOT </strong>play hard to get or u may regret it later on! As i said before in the other forum, just ask him! It's the 21st century already!</div>
