It seems like once the guy knows I like him, he will start distancing himself from me. Now you know why I am sick of guys. I feel like I can't trust them. I feel like the moment I am ready to entrust them with my heart, they will just walk away. I just dun understand guys anymore. I should just stay single my whole life and then I wouldn't have such headache. </div></blockquote>icy, sometimes guy can feel insecure too... does he know abt the previous guy? if yes, does he know how u feel? sometimes it is not walking away but taking a step backwards and observe the situation.. if he think tt this is gonna be a rebound, he will of cos think twice... thus explaining the "distancing"..<br><br>sometimes a love that comes easily, goes easily too.. a love that never experience testing is not necessary one that can last...<br><br>dun judge so soon, have a chat.. find out the real situation before making any decision... when u have considered everything and made a decision, stick to ur decision..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess tat most women like to feel treasured. So if the guy gives up too fast or gives up after facing small rejection, then we'll think tat the guy is either juz fooling ard or not sincere at all. Sometimes we need to play hard to get even though we like the guy oredi juz to see how determined n sincere the guy is to us.</div>

See, I am trying to give B a chance but I dunno why, I can sense that he is kinda 'colder' towards me now...Maybe it is becos we are both busy with exams and stuff, but the truth is I need someone even more during this time. Maybe I am being too demanding, I dunno. Last time, before the exam, he used to call me all the time to ask me out for meals but now he didn't call anymore, and I am the one who is calling him now and he won't be in his room. I think I should just continue to play hard to get like last time...and then he will pay more attention to me again hehehehe  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> But anyway just need opinions here...feel free to comment...<br><br>i.c.y</div></blockquote>Go ahead and play hard to get. You seriously need to know how much you meant to him.
