              <p>There ARE women in the army and marine forces etc. etc.</p>
              <p>And if the govt makes it compulsory for women to serve then they are gonna face a labour shortage of younger workers in the particular age group. And then who's gonna pay the taxes?</p>
              <p>Not to mention that this would probably lead to a sharp decline in birth rates (and our birth rates are already damn low). Since women who are conscripted in would probably find it hard to fire rifles while pregnant.</p>
              <p>And here's a fun fact. Do you know why women usually do not serve as soldiers in war? Simple. Because if 50% of the women are killed in war, the country would find it damn hard to repopulate, as compared to when 50% of men are killed. Because a man can impregnate many women at any one time, whilst women can only bear one child (in most situations) at any one time (in fact for the entire 9mths-1yr).</p>

              <p>I don't blame you for not knowing much about SAF because you have never spent a single day in the organisation. So, you should not be putting down guys who complained about NS when you don't know too much about it.</p>
              <p>It's true that there ARE woman in SAF. But why are they all there? By laws and legislations? No, this is their career. They chose to e there. It is very different from the CONSCRIPTS. The pay, benefits,promotions etc. You can't do a direct comparison.</p>
              <p>As to your point about lack of workers in a particular age group, the problem could have been solved easily by reducing NS to 1 year for both guys and ladies. Lol. Fairer to the guys also right? And FYI, I seriously doubt tax revenue collected would be affected. How much do you think those young women are earning? Not everybody pay income tax!</p>
              <p>And I had a good laugh when I saw the part about affecting birthrate. How many women actually gave birth when they are younger than 20? Of course, those who are pregnant can be exempted from all military activities. There are other roles that they can play. Clerks? Nurse? SAF not all about guns and tanks.</p>
