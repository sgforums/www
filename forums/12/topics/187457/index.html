Problems you meet at work? Maybe both of you can find a common hobby / take up a course that both of you are interested in. This way can spend time more constructively and have more things to talk about.<br><br>And I think if on the phone until nothing to talk about already, just put down until you want to talk to her/she wants to talk to you. Don't slam down the phone lah.. just say you will call her back to say goodnight, now need to do something etc etc.<br><br></div>
