Even if it's a vagrant who doesn't know anybody/whom nobody knows. Because the peeps who're gonna pick up his body are going to feel upset by the death of an unfortunate.<br><br>Since you can't leave this world without creating more problems, the sensible way is to live it to the end.<br><br>There are good things, there are bad things. We all can't avoid misfortunes, even the most fortunate. So why focus on it and make yourself suffer?<br><br>When you have problems, the best way to run away from it is to solve it. It takes time. Even if it takes alot of time, attempting to solve the problem can make you feel better because as you try to do so, you see the problem shrinking, albeit by a minute bit.</div>

It's just about 'carrots'...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  Medically proven and evidence over the place... 'Carrots' can also leads to a WHOLE LOT of other good things... Like being more civilised.. Less brutuality... Well... In a way? Depending on how you get your 'carrots'? And others are not robbed of their 'carrots' in the process?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Then I wanna talk about... What do you know?? MORE 'CARROTS'....

The challenges and failures coming in together with the 'carrots' which makes life SO INTERESTING...<br><br>MAN... Won't it would be a VERY DAMN IDEA if humans are just born into this world to 'eat carrots'?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Might as well be RABBITS??  ~WAHAHAhahaha... &lt;<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">&gt;<br><br>And here's to the reply to your quote in BLUE.... I was ONCE (or maybe more than that...) at a CROSS POINT like you have... And my decision on where I should be heading... And in the end, I was a bit like you... A DEVIL... At least during that very moment I was having that form of mentality... A PURE BREED...<br><br>Until I've come to understand and realise what it really means to be a Devil... And understand the 'power' of mystery 'love'... Don't misunderstand me, I'm still on the way of 'research' though?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">&gt;<br><br>But I've already come to realise... LOVE... HAPPINESS... 'Carrots'... CLOSELY CONNECTED... Is probably crucial to this world's proper evolution and survival...

But on the other hand, i guess the past year has been pretty lousy. I'm feeling this lack of companionship. it doesn't stop at being single but extends to platonic relationships as well. I guess my friends have all been busy and after the JC phase, they've all got their own lives to lead either in skools or whilst serving NS. likewise, though i've got really crazy people back in camp to waste our youth away(haha) i just can't connect with them the same way i do with friends i've found out of the army circle.

Though I admit.. Often it does?<br><br><strong><br>i guess i will feel happy when i'm fulfilled.. and i'll be fulfilled when i attain success... </strong><br><br>It's not necessarily a happy thing to attain success... Though often the case as success would usually bring about fulfillment or sense of satisfaction....<br><br>Take for example... If you manage to bring up a pair of chopsticks to feed yourself (provided that you're already used to using them), would you be extremely happy? Probably not, because you're EXPECTED to be able to do that.. Thus it pose as no surprise nor challenge that you could do it...<br><br>On the other hand, if you're someone who's with a bit of physical handicap... And you MANAGED to feed yourself with it.. There'll be 'sense of satisfaction'...<br><br>And some things done would actually be accompanied by more than one form of 'affection'... Maybe you managed to achieve something.. And you're happy about it.. But then you have to sacrifice someone which is what you're unwilling to do... There'll be a 'plus / minus' effect or sometimes mixed feelings...<br><br>Of course, there're also some people who downplay the part where they actually need to hurt others in the process.. In order to better taste 'the fruit of fulfillment'? Well... This can actually be a very long and windy story.. Think I'll just stop here for now?<br><br><strong><br>but till then... since i have no success... therefore no fulfillment... am i entitled to feel unhappy?</strong><br><br>Nope. You're not 'entitled' to it... It's quite VERY UNLIKELY that there'll be one person living on earth with 'zero success'... For being alive itself is already at least one 'success'? Feeding yourself? Able to walk? To talk? Yes... The 'fulfillment' varies though? That's why it's often how you choose to see things?<br><br><strong><br>even happiness derived from fulfillment is temporary. i think i'm searching for happiness of the contentment type. to be contented with life.</strong><br><br>'Fulfillment' can of a constant achieval type too? And yes.. Like you've mentioned, very often most of them should be quite temporary...<br><br>To be contented with life is actually very much of your own mindset? Which is what the others have been trying to tell you all along?<br><br><strong>i dun need fulfillment... i want contentment. but i dun forsee myself ever achieving contentment with life.. therefore i'm striving for fufillment...as mentioned in one of my earlier posts... haha devil.. u helped me summarise what my take on life is at the moment.. thanx...(its in bold u dimwit)</strong><br><br>To tell you the truth... I don't see myself being able to achieve contentment with life too in the many years back? And the truth is, you can never really give a 100% prediction for the future... That's why it's called the 'future' you see?<br><br>If you want something, you'll have to work for it.... Which kinda reminds me of your post to the others? Want 'happiness' but reluctant to it? Just like a man who wants to know the taste of a carrot but reluctant to put it in his mouth... Hmm... What to do?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></blockquote></div>
