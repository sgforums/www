            <div class='col-md body'>the way i hear my gf complain about her office and how people are always bitcching about each other, i have two things to be grateful about.<br><br>1-that i'm not a girl.<br>2-that i signed on.<br><br>Don't get mistaken, not that i think that i can't cut it in civvy street, but to work around people who have nothing better than to gossip and backstab each other makes me thankful i'm a regular combatant, working with people who can learn to put aside their differences to get the job at hand done for a common goal, and that is, to finish and phuck off.<br><br>Granted there are pros and cons. But at least i don't have to worry about people sabotaging my work. Because in the office, doing that can earn you credit, but in the army, doing that will just get yourself (and everyone else in your team) killed.<br><br>So TS, maybe your officer is right in a sense, if you can't tahan the army, how can you tahan the civilian life, where friends might backstab you, steal your work, sabotage your plans and spoil your reputation, just so they can get promoted faster?</div>
