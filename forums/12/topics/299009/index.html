But later somehow, I felt my officer was right in a way to say that to me.<br><br>I had been less capable, less street-smart compared to all my colleagues in the office. I was an army clerk, you see. I have always have trouble with understanding simple instructions and carrying them out perfectly (efficiently and effectively).<br><br>Maybe it boils down to maintaining a positive attitude, but my self-esteem has never been healthy since kindergarten days. For I have been very slow in understanding stuff and clumsy when it comes to most tasks.<br><br>I'm still seeing a psychiatrist and taking medication faithfully. However, as it is, self-esteem issues are too big for me to express adequately and accurately to mental health professionals.<br><br>I also have a deep distrust for and a deep dislike of people due to various life experiences. So all this, together with my VERY slow to understand and inferiority complex, this has made staying on jobs for at least a year an almost impossible task.<br><br></div></blockquote>The key and crux to the issue here is your self-esteem and confidence. It really isn't so much about what has been said and who has said something. The best thing you could do is take the views of others (excluding those who know you extremely well) with a pinch of salt - regardless of whether they're criticisms or compliments.<br><br>If you're going to allow your worth and self-esteem to be founded on the basis of what others say, I'm afraid you'll be living a pretty sad life trying to pander to all and sundry. Really, at the end of the day, it's your life you're living - and you certainly do not live on the criticisms and/or compliments of others, much less rely on their endorsements. Live life the way you want and you'd be leading a far more satisfying and productive life - for a start, even living with your own mistakes which had arisen from your own convictions would be an awful lot easier...</div>
