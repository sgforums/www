            <div class='col-md body'>Ok new developments.<br><br>As i had known this friend of mine for quite a long time, I know she like to complain to alot of people. So i guess she complains the matters between two common friends of ours. she basically enjoys a much closer relationships to this two friends than me.<br><br>Something happens today and these two common friends of mine kind of ignored and treat me coldly. Probably one even lied to me but what got me mad, is that i can't help but feeling being <span style="font-style: italic;">stabbed at the back </span> by a supposedly-closer <strong>fren</strong>.<br><br>Isn't this a matter between two of us ? She probably dramatise some matters.<br><br>I kind of suspected our friendships are based on survival sake. She is a person who think for only herself and how to survive. Every actions come with a certain intention for her benefits. The longer i got to know her, the more i think she is like that.<br><br>The whole darn thing escalates and explodes when she fails to asked me to join their group since only the three of us taking there class. I kind of expected that we will look one another back cos we are in the same boat. Instead, she did her projects with new,third friend and she didn't give a <span style="font-style: italic;">courteous notification.</span> I was quite taken aback by her 360 degree change.<br>In fact, i know her longer than the third friend.<br><br>Frankly, i treat this [new, third friend] of our with no ill-feelings. In fact i think i treat her quite well! I'm aso disappointed in her now cos i have high expectation of her. I thought she was a nice person to befriend with and was even thinking of trying to be nicer to her.<br><br>I'm mad cos i feel being taken granted for just b'cos i'm a very easy-going person. WT MUTH FACKER.<br><br>Prior before this incident, she kind of psycho me to do this things and there. i'm kind of annoyed with there. I wanted to do other things but do i have to be obligated to her? I don't think so. This is my life. But my friend kind of get abit annoyed when i'm not joinin her in some matters. Even in an attempt, to provoke me.<br><br>Frankly speaking, I think my friend clicks better with this new friend as they also lived on the same level in the hall block while i stay in another block. Oh well, u know, i kinda of accept that.<br><br>I was quite sad initially but then i learn to accept that friendships dift. But my friend kind of ignored me when the three of us are together.<br><br>ok.. I feels so weird and awakard when the three of us are together. So i try to get to know the other girl but then not long later, this stupid incidents happen.<br><br>She shows me a fake "attitude" today and she has<span style="font-style: italic;"> probably</span> lied to me. In fact both of this two friend behave very werid today.<br><br>I really think that third party friend was a nice person. I'm stupid enuff to think so quickly...<br><br>No one is perfect. That why i hanged on for so long as i really want to accept her as who she is. This series of incidents has rather exceeded my limit of tolerance. Since we are mis-matched in terms of personality and character.. oh well, i'm not gg to care abt it anymore.<br><br>oH I'm so pissed now. that i don't think i want to patch up with my old friend.<br><br></div>
