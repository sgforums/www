              <p>There is this guy in my office where both of us are quite close to.. We would always have our breakfast, lunch together at time during weekend we do get together for movie and clubbing.  We click so well that both of us have the same frequency.  <br>There are lots of stuff and hint that make me feel he like me.  e.g. he would look into my eyes at times when he chatting with me then look away hidding his stare.  <br>When other girls came along in the club caming hugging him, he would stare deep into my eyes as if checking for jealousy in me..</p>
              <p>There are lots of things he did made me feel he like me, like telling my his lifestyle, bringing me to meet his friends and keep telling me he like me to know what kind of lifestyle he is leading.. i couldn't think of anything else other then he is interested in me.</p>
              <p>on xmas night, he held my hand and lead me onto a cab towards our next destination, he asked lots of questions about my liking on what i liking for lifestyle to physical and emotionally.. :((  <br>But then one night over a few glasses, he spouted that he like my company but not as gf.  So i leave the friendship as it is.. but his "gf type" treatment continue.. but he would always remind me not to fall for him.. But but.. but...</p>
              <p>I am lost.. i really dnt know what to do.  <br>tonight i muster all my courage to tell him, stop contacting me anymore except if its on business concern dealing..  It hurts inside me to tell him this, but i just tell myself i need to cut the string off to prevent hurting myself in future. <br><br>Can someone tell me what is going on in this relationship ?</p>

              <p>Apart from the above stances, we will always try to wait for each other after work to walk out of office together.  If he wasn't interested he could jolly well avoid and ignore me. But he didn't .. humh.. and he has been responding hints to me that he dnt wish for me to fall for him, if not i will be upset.  Coz he keep telling me he isn't good enough nor suit me.  if so.. why did he hav to show me those "GF Treatment" :(</p>

              <p>just like what user@user said. if not, he is not prepared for a relationship. but the way he gets hugged by girls in club and on-off relationship shows that hes quite a player. dont get fooled. </p>

              <p>hmm you're right. but this guy is making TS sad, something which a guy should never do. plus he quite playing TS. you dont do all the couple stuffs and say hey dont fall in love with me in this love game, if you do, you lose and i win.</p>
              <p>oh..that married girl thinking about her crush, well, you cant say shes a slut, she just need to give herself and her husband a some time. shes a human like us too, it justs that her emotions and infactuation are toying with her only.</p>

              <p>There is this guy in my office where both of us are quite close
              to.. We would always have our breakfast, lunch together at time
              during weekend we do get together for movie and clubbing.  We
              click so well that both of us have the same frequency. <br> There are lots of stuff and hint that make me feel he like
              me.  e.g. he would look into my eyes at times when he chatting
              with me then look away hidding his stare. <br> When other girls came along in the club caming hugging him, he
              would stare deep into my eyes as if checking for jealousy in
              me..</p>
              <p>There are lots of things he did made me feel he like me, like
              telling my his lifestyle, bringing me to meet his friends and keep
              telling me he like me to know what kind of lifestyle he is
              leading.. i couldn't think of anything else other then he is
              interested in me.</p>
              <p>on xmas night, he held my hand and lead me onto a cab towards
              our next destination, he asked lots of questions about my liking on
              what i liking for lifestyle to physical and emotionally..
              :(( <br> But then one night over a few glasses, he spouted that he like my
              company but not as gf.  So i leave the friendship as it is..
              but his "gf type" treatment continue.. but he would always remind
              me not to fall for him.. But but.. but...</p>
              <p>I am lost.. i really dnt know what to do. <br> tonight i muster all my courage to tell him, stop contacting me
              anymore except if its on business concern dealing..  It hurts
              inside me to tell him this, but i just tell myself i need to cut
              the string off to prevent hurting myself in future.<br> <br> Can someone tell me what is going on in this relationship ?</p>

              <p>depending on the relationship status of both of you..if you like him tell him..</p>
              <p>there is a gamble here.</p>
              <p>1) he likes you and wants to get into a relationship with you but he wants u to make the first step. because all along he treats you like a princess so he hopes that u reciprocate that reaction by asking him whether you want to date</p>
              <p>2) he is just plainly flirting because he "does not want to shit and eat at the same place". he can't date you so the best he can do is flirt with you.</p>
              <p>either way, if this reaction is making you unhappy, you have to take a gamble and ask him to make a stance. do it in a subtle way like over a quiet drink or something to lighten the mood. The gamble is that either you lose a friend who is treating u like gf or you gain a bf who might still treat u like a gf after dating you haha</p>
