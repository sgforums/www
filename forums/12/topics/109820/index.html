            <div class='col-md body'>OKie, sorry for whining again.<br><br>let's say you know someone cares about you very much a little while before this. then he went back for a vacation in Malaysia, you wrote to him, he replied, you wrote to him again and then he stopped writing. And today is ur birthday and he totally forgot. No phonecalls, no emails, no nothing.<br><br>Only disappointment.<br><br>Before he went back, he has convinced me that he cared enuff and I had assumed he would remember. We have spent a lot of time together before he went back, and he even thanked me for giving him good memories to bring back home. And at that moment, when he walked me back to my dorm for the last time before he went back, I truly believe.<br><br>that I had found love.<br><br>But maybe I am wrong.<br><br>Do you think it is fair for me to judge him based on him forgetting my birthday? He has given his 'gift' to me a while ago actually cos he told me he wouldn't be here, but still I would like him to at least email me to let me know he remembers....<br><br>i.c.y</div>

No, Probably nothing serious, but given the state of emergency in that area, I think he has more things to do than to email to you wishing you a happy birthday.<br><br>But if heÂ’s not in one of the affected areas, then perhaps you should just talk with him and ask him about it. He should have his reasons, or he just plain forgot. Some times when we get caught up in something, we just do it all the way, ignoring the rest of the world. It could happen.<br><br>But I think youÂ’re feeling very insecure about this whole Â‘relationshipÂ’ thing. But if this is the way he is, being forgetful, you may have to live with it should you decide to be with him.<br><br>Its your birthday! Get out of the house and have some fun! DonÂ’t mope about someone whoÂ’s not with you now, go out for some cheer! Cooping yourself up will only make you more depressed!<br><br>From your Didi<br>Aaron</div>

I am sort of speaking from a recent experience and thus I advise you that finding a proper moment to have a talk with him is the best thing to do. Btw guys are really terrible with dates even if we make the effort, take me for example, eventhough I once use her birthday as my company password to remind myself but sometimes I still get her exact birth date wrong.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks everyone for the reply..I guess I will give him the benefit of the doubt. But still I think he has a lot of explaining to do when he gets back here. I never doubt that he cared for me before he went back, it is just that after he went back, things seem to change...I am really afraid that he has forgotten me, because he hasnt contacted me for a very long time..the last email I wrote to him was like a week ago...but he hasn't replied or anything *sigh*<br><br>Do you think guys can change this fast? We were still really close the day before he left, we even went out the whole day and that was the most beautiful day in my life for this year...<br><br>i.c.y</div>

So now mebbe I should concentrate on all the good things he has done for me instead of thinking too deeply into this.<br><br>i.c.y</div>
