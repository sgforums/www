              Need some light on why man can change that fast.. We just had our wedding 5 mths ago . No quarrel for the past mths. My husband invited his friends to our place for mahjong and I told him to end at 1am.. We had quarrels previously on mahjong, coz he always come back late. So Usually I ask him to be done by 1am.
              
              Today, he behave like he has brain freeze and insisted that he does not know if they will end at 1,2 or 3am. I am very pissed and asked him if he wants me to text them to find out. I went ahead ahead with it since he said I can. But after I sent, he says he will end the relationship and divorce me if I text his friend.
              
              He took his laptop, left the house. Came back agin to take his shoes and his essentials. I confronted if he really wants a divorce. He replied there is no way he can get along with me. He says that I threaten him and that he is pressurized even with playing mahjong. For goodness sake, he is challenging me when he says they may be up till 2,3am. 
               
              
              I was really surprised.. We were still talking about having a baby days ago.. He was even talking abt it to his mum.. 
              
              I am very disappointed that the word divorce can be mentioned so freely.. This is his 2nd marriage &amp; we been through a lot to be together..
              
              I did not stop him from doing anything, except that he is to watch his time..
              
              I am wondering if he actually not want this marriage all the while..

              <p>He does not need to listen to your command. You are not his mother.</p>
              <p>He busy play mahjong.. then you go out have fun with your own friend.</p>
              <p>The more you pressure him.. the more he wants to piss you off.. so try to back off.. learn to pick your battles.</p>
              <p>I think the problem is you are too clingy and needy for his attention. That's why you keep trying to control him.</p>
              <p>Sorry to say this.. but both your personality clashes from the beginning..and it only means divorce unless one/both of you relent.</p>

              <p>Yes, other wifeys are unhappy.. that's their own problem. They will deal with it on their own. You don't have to behave like them.</p>

              Not these gracious type of wife for sure. And Precisely I don't wanna quarrel in front of his friends, that's why I wanna tell him my limits.
              
              Instead, he complain he is pressurized etc.. And its once in a blue moon mahjong..Frankly He has been unhappy with his job and has brought the grudges back home for a long while.. His mum asked recently how I can manage his temper.. And I am not feeling good abt all his crap.. 
              
              I don't quite under std.. Isn't our partner suppose to put effort and not burden the other party with too much worries.. I seldom told him abt my worries.. I felt like I m the one absorbing all this while..
