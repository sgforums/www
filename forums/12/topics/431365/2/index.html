              <p>Not these gracious type of wife for sure. And Precisely I don’t

              my limits.</p>
              <p>Instead, he complain he is pressurized etc.. And its once in a
              blue moon mahjong..Frankly He has been unhappy with his job and has
              brought the grudges back home for a long while.. His mum asked
              recently how I can manage his temper.. And I am not feeling good
              abt all his crap..</p>
              <p>I don’t quite under std.. Isn’t our partner suppose to put
              effort and not burden the other party with too much worries.. I
              seldom told him abt my worries.. I felt like I m the one absorbing

              <p>Your husband is, emotionally, not as mature as you. But you are expecting him to think and behave as you.</p>
              <p>Most men mistakenly think it's ok to treat their wife as emotional dumping ground. They think they are sharing.. but they are actually not.</p>
              <p>Being able to deal with problems inwardly and not need to vent or take it out on our partner... requires a good level of maturity.</p>
              <p>Your husband is still very immature.</p>

              <p>I agree with jojo.</p>
              <p>Your husband has gathered excess negative energy maybe because of his frustrations in work and playing mahjong is his way of releasing the excess negative energy, when you disrupt the process, he redirects his excess negative energy onto you.</p>
              <p>So just play it cool, it has nothing to do with you.</p>

              <p>No job is without problems and/or frustrations. Even a business owner has tons of problems.</p>
              <p>He can change his job.. but he will continue his negative behavior.</p>
              <p>Divorce is not something that will solve your problem..there are many "undivorced" couples out there.. who live separate lives.. due to lack of "better choices".</p>
              <p>Some divorced people are more depressed than before they got divorced.</p>
              <p>If you are strong enough.. you may emerge unscathed. And perhaps be able to lead a better life after the split.</p>

              <p>U married a mahjong player....so you shd have known his habits. You married a divorcee whose ex wife didnt trust him......hmm I think you knew what sort of matrimony you were getting into. Then you messaged his friend to check on him......wow that part really sucks :)</p>
              <p>You can't keep a man if he decides to leave. Today he may just be blurting, tomorrow he's walking out. These are signs of things to come. Don't try too hard to hold on to a divorce happy husband......seems he can't get a grip on rationality. It takes both hands to clap....and seriously, a spouse who plays mahjong till 3am is a shitty one. I don't think he would take it lying down if you were to be playing mahjong till that time and it's something which is not his pastime.</p>

              I am no angel myself.. I stayed away from my parents since young.. I am easy going with most things.. But when things get on my nerve, like this mahjong thgy, I flared up and went all out to argue.. 
              
               I can call to apologize.. But he will respond like I am begging him to stay and say things like things will happen again blah blah blah.. Basically stuff that make me felt like I am not good enough.. And conclusion is stll the same.. He can get along with me..

              No la. To be fair to him, he is not addicted to mahjong. It's just that I don't understand why he can't compromise to the same 1am like in the past. He doesn't play very often But I do know they very much want to..  
              
              Also, I NEVER check on him. Not so stupid.. I am in sales and mktg.. This Is a big no no.. I meant I text to ask his frn if mahjong will last till 3am when he refuse to answer to me and say I can ask them. But right after I send the text, he says he will divorce if I send. I can't retrieve the message obviously..

              <p>You made the decision, you knew the score.</p>
              <p>You disregarded the facts, and went into this marriage with eyes wide open.</p>
              <p>You gotta face it, you will have a rocky life ahead of you.</p>
              <p>You know the kind of man you willingly married. He gave you a very clear indication early. You chose to marry him. You have to make the adjustments, not him.</p>
              <p>Don't expect the world to be namby pamby according to logic. Your idea is: marraige what, both of us have the responsibility to make it work. The others here would agree to that notion, but in the real world it doesn't work that way. You can cry foul all you want to, and have all your supporters back you up, but it is not going to change the tone of you marriage. You have to practically find that out now and make the adjustment.</p>
              <p>As for mahjong, you must understand that there are rounds that must be completed and that the four players get equal chance. So a game ends when it ends and not at a pre-set time. And when another round starts, it cannot abruptly end, it has to complete its course. So cannot treat him like a kid, and get him to come home like Cinderella.</p>
              <p>You say you only ask him, he says you threatened him. This means that you both have not understood each other well yet. You want to modify him to suit you? You can only if you are strong and domineering over him and he is submissive. I don't think that is the case here.</p>
              <p>So in the give and take equation, You give, He takes.</p>
              <p>He must have some qualities that you find attractive, dwell on that, build on that, he may come around.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>
              <p>PS. <em>I hope you are just releasing your pent up frustrations here</em>.</p>

              Before marriage, we have tonnes of argument. That is the time we both adjusted. In fact for the mahjong thgy, we had rolls over it previously and that is how this 1am thingy comes abt. I knw the mj rules. 1am is a ball park and he agreed to it. This time round he is out to push my limit by saying he is not even sure if it will ends at 3.. Which is what I can't reconcile..
              
              You are right that I have to be the more accommodating one in this rel. But there is a limit.. As he always mentioned, when the limit is reached, all hell broke loose.
              
              In this instance, he is out to test my limit. He told me last night and this morning that he is changing the venue. He had a very serious relapse of backache today. So bad that he his back is slanted and he has to move slowly. Yet he refuse to agree with me. Its obvious he can't make it till 23am..
