              <p><br>All men are like this, those coming to my pub are mostly married or attached, but men do need a time of their own, give them the space but not to the extend for them to go hanky panky, there must be a control. If he wants a friday nite chiong with frens that you know, so be it, let them go. As long as they tell you where they are and what time they will be back and when you called, they are reachable, no harm to let men go out and join their buddies to hv some happy hours and men talk.</p>
              <p>If you insist on your way, which most guys, in a manly manner will not give in. Then you are doing them a place, even corks once a while get together, not say men</p>

              <p>Hi Carb,</p>
              <p>you cannot understand why they cannot stop at 1.am - is like I cannot understand why you like such a man in the first place - let put it that way - somethings just does not have any clear answer to it !</p>
              <p>Frankly you say it they also mahjong at other people house, how often can they do it at your house ? Just put on ear plug and go to zzz !!!  Why you care !!! - If neighbour complain - police come let your husband they all settle loh !!!</p>
              <p>if not spend some money sound proof the room !!!</p>
              <p>Think of it this way - at least you know he is play mahjong in the house and not at geylang !!!</p>

              <p>Need some light on why man can change that fast.. We just had
              our wedding 5 mths ago . No quarrel for the past mths. My husband
              invited his friends to our place for mahjong and I told him to end
              at 1am.. We had quarrels previously on mahjong, coz he always come
              back late. So Usually I ask him to be done by 1am.</p>
              <p>Today, he behave like he has brain freeze and insisted that he
              does not know if they will end at 1,2 or 3am. I am very pissed and
              asked him if he wants me to text them to find out. I went ahead
              ahead with it since he said I can. But after I sent, he says he
              will end the relationship and divorce me if I text his friend.</p>
              <p>He took his laptop, left the house. Came back agin to take his
              shoes and his essentials. I confronted if he really wants a
              divorce. He replied there is no way he can get along with me. He
              says that I threaten him and that he is pressurized even with
              playing mahjong. For goodness sake, he is challenging me when he
              says they may be up till 2,3am.</p>
              <p>I was really surprised.. We were still talking about having a
              baby days ago.. He was even talking abt it to his mum..</p>
              <p>I am very disappointed that the word divorce can be mentioned so
              freely.. This is his 2nd marriage &amp; we been through a lot to be
              together..</p>
              <p>I did not stop him from doing anything, except that he is to
              watch his time..</p>
              <p>I am wondering if he actually not want this marriage all the
              while..</p>

              <p>See is my deductions correct?</p>
              <p>No marriage = No Divorce</p>
              <p>Marriage = Divorce = Alimony.</p>
              <p>To TS, when are you signing the divorce papers with your husband? 5 months ago when you walk down the asile with your friends envying you, did you expect 5 months later you will be close to signing the divorce papers?</p>
              <p>To guys out there, if you die die wanna marry the girl you think you "love" right now. Don't be afraid to sign the pre nup agreement because you cannot guarantee what's going to happen 10 years down the road. See TS one good example, 5 months only. If possible, don't marry just stay together.</p>
