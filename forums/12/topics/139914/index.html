            <div class='col-md body'>okz my hubby committed adultery and his other woman is now pregnant and pressuring him to divorce me. we were married for 11 yrs.<br>i muz say i hv been a gd mother and wife all these years and did nothing unforgiveable. his only grouse was that i am a housewife and cannot share his financial burden.<br><br>i know it is both of our fault that our marriage breaks down. i had given him the chance, and told him that if he is able to give up this woman, we can always start anew.<br><br>he tried to use delay tactic and said he needed time to consider (makes it sound like i'm begging him for a chance!duh!) and meanwhile living with the woman in a rented flat, paid for by the woman. so a month has passed and he said he is sticking to THEIR original decision.<br><br>so now.. i need advice.<br>- he is 32 and i am 31. he is not rich and earning about $2000/mth.<br>- i stick to him when he was bankrupt from 98 to 2001. and he was earning $800/mth and my parents paid for our utilities.<br>- he does not want my kids' custody. i do not intend to give him any.<br>- he is a wife-beater and i have ever made a police report at Alex.Hosp.<br>- he shows NO sign of guilt or remorse. in fact, he still feels he is doing the right thing 'living for himself' to quote him.<br><br>- the flat is the 2nd we bought. the first with both our CPF. this current one from his CPF alone. he wants to divorce so that i have to pay him his share of the flat. my kids and i definitely needs a roof over our heads.<br>Qn. how does this law work here?<br><br>my main qn. is, will a divorce benefits me and my kids?<br><br>i do not want to be so mercenery and end this relationship at a bad note. but, i am not financially independent yet and is now trying to. i have to protect my kids' interests and get a good bit of alimony outta him in the case of divorce. or maintenance in the case of no divorce.<br><br>thanks in advance for your advices.<br><br></div>
