Been reading through your whole story. Please do not feel guilty or remorseful about making a choice in divorcing your husband. In my opinion, as a husband he should be supporting the household (you and your kids) and not use the excuse of "you not being to help him financially". Also, worst of all, is that he's having an affair outside. <span style="color: red;">This kinda husband is a disgrace to all men.</span><br><br>Here's some of my personal advice for you:<br><br>Before you go on a divorce, there are matters which you need to prepare. Try to have a record book of your daily/monthly households expenses, keep all the reciepts of the bills you have paid.<br><br>Also, seek help from Legal Aid Bureau in your divorce matter, as they will be able to help you in getting lawyer aid at a subsidised rate.<br><br>When lodging in the divorce case, please be truthful with the lawyer and tell them everything. Regarding your husband having an affair outside with another woman and the woman is pregnant with his child; that previously you have ever lodged in a case of him abusing you at Alex. Hosp; how he abuses your kids; and you and your kids are constantly under emontional pressure when he's at home etc.<br><br>When the lawyer asks for the terms that you want. You can request for a Police Protection Warrant to deter him from further absuing you and your kids; also request for a Court Order for him to move out of the house immediately and not to stay together in the same house; your kids custody to be under your care; ask for a flat % divide of 70 (you):30 (your husband) and buy over his share of the flat; and also one lump sum of alimony from him (don't request for your alimony to be paid in installaments, b'cause guys like him will go MIA after paying a few months.).<br><br>Try to get the most money out of him, you and your kids still have a long way to go. You can always check out the women's charter to understand more of your rights as a woman.<br><br>http://www.familycourtofsingapore.gov.sg/principles/act353/acts_act353_frame.htm</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello commonsense.  I have read your tproblem and your concern.  Many have ask you to leave that worthless piece of shit.  However I like to let you know the power of you and your kids over him if he is still married to you.<br><br>As long as you and him is not divorce, he can sell the flat.  Good, have a root over you and your kids.  He can quit his job all he want.  Now remember he is with another woman.  So if he fail to give you the household money, take him to the family court and demand it from him there.<br><br>Since your heart already died best if he dont come home, why bother. But if he ever beat you, got to the hospital and make a police report and demand protection from him.  Even if you dont get it, there is a record in the file that he did beat you up before so that the next time you can demand it more easily.<br><br>In simple word, if he is married to you and not willing to do a job of the man of the family, there are loopholes in Singapore that can happily make him end up in jail.<br><br>Regards</div>
