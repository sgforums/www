Try to have a record book of your daily/monthly households expenses, keep all the reciepts of the bills you have paid.<br><br>Also, seek help from Legal Aid Bureau in your divorce matter, as they will be able to help you in getting lawyer aid at a subsidised rate.<br><br>When lodging in the divorce case, please be truthful with the lawyer and tell them everything. Regarding your husband having an affair outside with another woman and the woman is pregnant with his child; that previously you have ever lodged in a case of him abusing you at Alex. Hosp; how he abuses your kids; and you and your kids are constantly under emontional pressure when he's at home etc.<br><br>When the lawyer asks for the terms that you want. You can request for a Police Protection Warrant to deter him from further absuing you and your kids; also request for a Court Order for him to move out of the house immediately and not to stay together in the same house; your kids custody to be under your care; ask for a flat % divide of 70 (you):30 (your husband) and buy over his share of the flat; and also one lump sum of alimony from him (don't request for your alimony to be paid in installaments, b'cause guys like him will go MIA after paying a few months.).<br>[/b]</blockquote>thanks for your advice. i will be going down to Legal Aid sometime later this week.<br><br>i've already kept a record of the contacts we have made so far (contents date/time) and family expenses. right now, i'm more concern about my kids' rights than my rights as a woman.. basically i want as much maintenance $ as possible for my 4 kids.<br><br>by the way, does anyone know whether his bonuses at the end of the year will be included in the maintenance ruling?</div>

BuT please just get back wat u rightfully should get for ur alimony and kids!!!<br><br>it sounds as if he does not want to pay alimony or pay much... no matter go consult a lawyer ASAP don't let this drag. i believe even if he quit his job he has to pay. but it's the matter of finding him....<br><br>but it can be tricky. cos my ex's father just dissappeared without paying so since no one can find him... there's no payment!!!<br><br>bottom line. CONSULT a LAWYER. they can advise you better.</div></blockquote>erm... i consulted 2 lawyers already...<br><br>the first woman lawyer was at AWARE .. i reckoned they would be quite PRO in this kind of woman issues .. so the advice she gave was to drag the marriage because by divorcing now, my kids and i would have nothing to gain from it. the flat would have to be split, i'll have to wait another 20+ years before i can get his CPF $$ even if the ruling favours me (20+ yrs is a long time and things would be different by then)...  she suggested me to go to Family Court to apply for maintenance instead.. then at least we can be sure to still have a roof over our heads for the time being. so that was her advices to me.<br><br>the second was a male lawyer friend.. he said it would be tricky to get alimony outta him because his basic pay is just $1500, though he can easily earn up to $2200+ from his OT and that the court does not punish but will be fair and just to all parties in its ruling... so what he advised is, since my hubby suggested giving us $1200/mth (all bills and expenses included),  then i should just take it and leave him alone. in his words, "it's better than nothing".<br><br>quite confusing coming from 2 different lawyers.. which is why i wanted to find out the benchmark for such cases and whether the court will take into account his bonuses beside his monthly salary.<br><br>3 of my kids are schooling next year lah... so there will be lots of other expenses at the end of the year (school books etc). i will need his bonuses more than he  needs it.<br><br></div>

"nevermind lah... you just tolerate lor.. don't quarrel and get beaten up mah!.. the kids will suffer if you quarrel with him.. as long as he doesn't bring the women back then it is not a problem wat!... just let him do what he wants outside lor.. at least he still bring $$ back to you right? he still has sex with you right?? not like his father! ... you have to understand.. he grew up with little luxuries and without a father to love him..  you  both married too young lah!... so it is understandable that he still wants to fool around.. blah blah..." nabei... she should have told me this 11 years ago and not now.......<br><br>now that he wants to divorce. great lah! i asked mom-in-law whether this is considered 'bringing women back' or not.. and she didn't dare to go on and on anymore.<br><br>on hindsight.. i shouldn't have close an eye for so long! i feel so stupid.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>still, the greatest blessings that came out of all this bullshti is that, i know for sure now that no matter how disobedient i used to be, my parents are still the ones who stand by me in times of crisis. my bros too.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  and also, s'poreans aren't as mercenery or heartless or selfish as what the media portrays lah.. consider the overwhelming encouragement and advices i got from virtual people in the forums. i want to say thanks to all here for all the words you've said and the benefit of doubts given to my side of story, consider you don't even know me in person. thanks!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I feel sorry for u. U are lucky u have supportive family.<br>Be strong &amp; learn from this.<br>My  former colleagues went through bitter divorces. Their irresponsible husbands didn't pay alimony/ purposely delay payments. They broke down &amp; cried many times cos very stressful having to attend court to chase alimony.<br><br>One husband even disposed of his prop./ asset so his wife can't lay her hands on them. He didn't want the kid. Not all guys are honorable, so their wives have to learn to protect themselves.<br>Always make sure u keep a separate a/c. so he cannot squander yr money.<br>One fren, purposely inflate household expenses so she can squrriel some money away.<br>Also when he starts behaving abnormally/ suspiciously, confront him.<br>Don't let him continue.<br>My advise to all the girls- don't marry in haste. Check the guy out. Date him for at least 3 yrs. Visit his family. Avoid pple  from dysfunctional families- they are trouble. Also don't have too many kids &amp; have them only after yr marriage is stable. Divorce is so common now. Feel sorry for the kids cos they  suffer emotionally.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not sure how to advice u on this as although my parents did divorce, it was a very quiet affair. ( only got to know abt it 10years later)<br><br>I guess right now what you can do other than these divorce things is to try to get some other income. try job agencies... etc... ( i know it's the obvious)<br><br>how are your kids taking all these? probably should monitor them... sometimes we will try not to show the effects to not make our parents worry... but we need talking to at times...</div>

At least that will settle the "where to stay problem".<br><br>Not to worry, I am not asking you to get him to jail.  Getting him to jail or not is not my concern. But do know where your rights are.  Before you are financially independent (which could take some time) you need him to pay the household money for you and the children.  Yet you cant have him taking that as a threat and endanger yourself and the kids, especially.  Knowing that you have the power to get his ass in jail will first secure your financial until you are ready and second enable you to protect yourself and your childrens physically.<br><br></div></blockquote>ok.. i will bear that in mind if things get uglier. thanks!</div>
