            <div class='col-md body'>I would sugest the following steps.<br><br>1.  Do not go for any legal actions first. Because a legal actions triggers many actions following on.  Talk to him. Ask him for $, telling him, he can be with the women outside but he need to support you &amp; also cannot touch you. He have to live outside. Talk to him slowly.<br><br>If he agrees....good... grap that $ &amp; do something to stablise you life first.<br><br>If he don't agrees it's still not too late to go legal.<br><br>2. going legal. Just apply for maintenance &amp; a PPO to let him stay away from you. Also apply a order for the temperory kids custody &amp; to stay in the house. Don't go any further than that. Because if he wants to divorce, still need to wait for 4 years for single party applying for divorce. You have all this time to yourself. Also by the time 4 years, everything should be smooth out.<br><br>3. When divorce comes, then talks about details of the house. You are not required to sell the house immediately. Usually there is a granted time of 6 months first. Of course as a wife you can have a share of the "PROFITS" of the house. Profit means after returning all Monies to his CPF. If staying somewhere is a problem. You can use this as a reason to raise maintenance. This is a valid reason, he wants to sell the house, he have to provide you higher maintenance for a roof. Else there is possible you can stay put in that house.<br><br>Mainly is to play time. Only if you wanted to remarrys fast... else don't go divorce fast.<br><br>One other good reason to paint in court, "If him have another kid with another women outside, shows he is not responsible towards this marriage &amp; the privous kids." Court takes family responsibities very seriously. If it's been proven he is irresponsible, a very high maintenance is ordered.<br><br>Take care. Proceed with care also.<br><br>Divorce is not a good path to walk.</div>

If you're getting any $ from him, best to have it in terms of 'black and white' from the family court and hence maintence order. Tell him it's also for his own good as there'll be a record to it.</div>
