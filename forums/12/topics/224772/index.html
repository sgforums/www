            <div class='col-md body'>My O' Levels has ended. I used to have this strong friendship with a female classmates of mine since sec 1. We can be considered best friends. Almost all the great and sad moments, we've been spending it together. So I guess the term 'Best Friends' really suits us well. But during the Aug period, I had a major quarrel with her which led to the both of us ignoring each other afterwards. I tried to repair the friendship creaks then. But to avail. Maybe tension was too high to be mend then. Since O' Levels was apporoaching then, I decided to put the matter aside. Now O' Levels is over, it's time I should really gain back the strong friendship I once had with her. I really missed the times with her. Not to say I have an infatuation on her la, but rather I feel really wasted that such a friendship didn't last. I hope to regain the friendship and we can be back as normal before it comes too late when I can't see her again for the rest of ours lives as I'm going JC and she's going Laselle.<br><br>What should I do?</div>

But don't seemed to work. As said, the tension was rather high then.

            <div class='col-md body'>Try talking to your friend and resolving matters. It could possibly revert back to what you had before. I used the term "possibly" because there is also a chance things wont be the same. Most likely during that period, you guys would have drifted apart, the unresolved argument would have made it awkward for you both to talk again.<br><br>You could be friends again, but because of the major quarrel you had, it probably has changed your perceptions of each other.<br><br>I think Im rather lucky though. All of my friends regardless of whatever problem or issue that arises, even after a huge argument, my friendships with them has never changed. If it ever had, our friendship probably grew stronger. I don't know its weird. We can just argue oneday, apologise then be normal again the next second. Its important to resolve the issue as soon as you argue with them. The longer you leave it, the more stale it gets. Then everybody forgets what its like to have the other person around and it gets awkward. Yep =D all the best.!</div>

She isnt replying to my messages when I started talking about the past. Tried asking her out. No avail. So I just sent her a last msg ( 5 messages long ) to tell her how I feel all along about this friendship and how much I missed her. Hope she's touched by it bah..</div></blockquote>Looks like she could be really very angry and pissed this time round.<br><br>Like what you say you have taken her for granted, so I guess this time she's not going to let herself be so easily taken anymore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Hmm, if you really want to regain back this friendship, then you may need to be really patient and use your sincerity to move her. Send her an sms or email everyday to express your sincerity. She will probably forgive you and give this friendship another shot?<br><br>Hang on there coldzero. It takes time to heal a wound, so give your friend some time too.<br><br>All the best! Good Luck!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Aiyo... you did your best by apologising. Now it's up to her to accept it. If she's still petty over the incident, there's really nothing much to help.<br><br>I once had a major argument (which almost led to a fight) with a buddy. We didn't talk for one year but we shook hands at xmas after one year and still were good buddies again. Just give it some time... what will happen, will happen.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by coldzero:</div><div class="quote_body">My O' Levels has ended. I used to have this strong friendship with a female classmates of mine since sec 1. We can be considered best friends. Almost all the great and sad moments, we've been spending it together. So I guess the term 'Best Friends' really suits us well. But during the Aug period, I had a major quarrel with her which led to the both of us ignoring each other afterwards. I tried to repair the friendship creaks then. But to avail. Maybe tension was too high to be mend then. Since O' Levels was apporoaching then, I decided to put the matter aside. Now O' Levels is over, it's time I should really gain back the strong friendship I once had with her. I really missed the times with her. Not to say I have an infatuation on her la, but rather I feel really wasted that such a friendship didn't last. I hope to regain the friendship and we can be back as normal before it comes too late when I can't see her again for the rest of ours lives as I'm going JC and she's going Laselle.<br><br>What should I do?</div></blockquote>What ya quarrelled over?</div>
