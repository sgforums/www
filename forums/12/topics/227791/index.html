            <div class='col-md body'>So its the "good friends with love element inside" eh? She appearing in your life is for a purpose. I do not know what it is for I am not you. You have to find out it yourself.<br><br>You are too accomodating to her. If you really treat her as a friend, you would not have posted this, but you just happened to like her, thus the vexing problem. A simple sms stating someone like her and you felt like crap. What if she decided to DATE SOMEONE ELSE?<br><br>And you lack self confidence. Period. You know you are nothing to her, then why she keep calling you so often and chat so much? That is because at the very least she is a genuine friend to you as you are to her.<br><br>If I were you, I would not talk to her on the phone for so long. I will still hang around with her outside but I will NOT center my life around her. Its a  spiraling trap obviously. She has indicated she only wanted to be friends only, bear that in mind.<br><br>I would widen my social circle and hang out with other friends. She is not the only person in "my" life. I will also make good use of the time to prepare myself for life AFTER the course study. What will happen? Prepare for the next stage. Get ready for NS, work, meet more people.<br><br>So many things to do, yet you chose to be troubled by this. Really, you are not ready. Sorry I am hard and cruel but I woke up pretty cranky and I read a few, new AA topics which happened to be boy-girl-issues...</div>

I personally think if you can't handle her at all, the other best alternative is to avoid her at all cost. Tell her you're busy, you can't meet, you can't chat. After a while she would get the idea.<br><br>I would say avoiding her or being hooked up by her, both moves would likely torment you in their own ways... On given the fact that you can't handle the 'addiction'. Avoiding her would be a wiser choice for the long run?</div>
