              <p>Hello. I'm new here and I hope that people with similar experiences or can help me with this harassment problem:</p>
              <p>Recently, my contact number and address has been posted online WITHOUT PERMISSION on dating sites. Sites include gay sites and those one night stand type.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Horny men would come right to my doorstep asking for me or even someone who doesn't even exist. This is causing much distress to my family of five... I have young siblings. The peak number was around 5 in just ONE night. They come at the wee hours of morning and has disrupted my entire family's sleep when they knock persistently on the door.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have received messages/whatsapps from men and sometimes even nudes owing to this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have an idea of who is behind this but I'm at a loss at what to do next. Police reports have been made last year but the case has been closed for months. This harassment has been ongoing for one year already, on and off.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Any suggestions would be great appreciated. Thanks.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I can assure you all the gays will stop coming after you tell them you've made a police report. Show them the report if they say they dun believe.</p>

              <p>Like what Jojobeach had said, you are not at your wits ends. Get a PI, lawyer and anyone that can help you. Such nasty psycho cannot be left alone or he will hurt even more people. Get to know who are his victims (ex gf...etc), band together and form a force against him. </p>

              <p>If you all must know, that guy used to be a friend of mine but then slowly I began to suspect that he began to treat me like a boyfriend, being overly clingy and such. Totally not into gay stuff so I brushed him off. Afterwards, he began his nonsense and never stopped since then.</p>
