I'm not sure if she would be doing what you've said about her again, but give her some benefit of doubt? It's not like such a wonderful thing to condemn someone even before that person has taken any action or even show any sign of doing it? Based on SPECTACULATIONS ALONE is NOT enough...<br><br>You should know her 'background' better yourself... She needs SUPPORT... Though she might not be doing it the right way now, let her LEARN... It's not like she's really doing GREAT HARM to the others (or the forumites) now...?<br><br>Regarding her parents and other more personal stuffs, please talk to her in private...

            <div class='col-md body'>I din noe the exact story. BUT I feel ALL she need is some1 to support her (Not depend on) . Personally i feel u r too harsh to her.  Every1 went thru tat stage. How bad they took after a r/s differ from each person. some may juz be lucky to have friends overcome tat stage.<br><br>Previously, some1 was so emotional tat I tot she will commit suicide. I accompany her everywhere, hoping she will feel better with some1 to hold on. I din ask for her gratitude. But hope she can now put some persistence in helping another in need. She is not hopeless even if the world feels she is...<br><br>======================================================<br><br>my words to tweety....<br><br>U need a purpose in Life. Time to move forward... A Time when to let it go. Life is precious &amp; please remember that death is NEVER a solution. PERSISTENCE is the word. U shd know the feeling of losing some1 dear. Spare a thought for ur the many who cares for U - Ur family members, friends, Susan....  It may take time to heal the wounds in U. &amp; I URGE U <strong>NEVER TO GIVE UP</strong>.<br><br>If U r studying, channel the thoughts into the books. it will hurt less. If U r working, keep urself busy so U wun have the time to daydream. U muz find a will to live on.<br><br>I always use the following to encourage ppl when they r down<br><br><strong>DUN CRY WHEN IT'S OVER...... SMILE 'B COS IT HAPPENS</strong><br><br>Hope the next time when i see u, u will be bleaming with joy. Dun let susan always worry about U. She have her own problems to solve.
