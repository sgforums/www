            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SpecOps87: <span style="color: blue;">text</span></div><div class="quote_body">1. I want to go to a local uni, because my parents can't afford to send me overseas. Although when I ask/hinted to them, they said "Sure, no problem" but thing is, if I do go, they will have little/no savings left. Dad's in his mid-50s and Mum's in her late 40s, how much longer can they work? Besides that, I've got a younger brother who's 15 and I've to think of the amount of work my dad has to prepare to finance him through man. And why Uni in the first place? Lets be utterly frank, I feel that there's a larger beckoning to what I have done in my life. There's something bigger for me to be accomplish and this can't be done in our society why? Because here we need 2 things to make a statement that has both weight and credits, you need to be qualified (better if you are over-qualified) with degrees, masters, PhDs or you have to be wealthy, very wealthy. If not, nobody will pay attention to what you say no matter how proven it is. And also, its not the power/ego that I seek, but I'm seeking a way to also improve the living conditions of my family man. I don't wish to see my parents having to slog another 10-15years.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">I applaud the family values you have about wanting to improve living conditions and relieving your parentsÂ’ workload. I also applaud the fact that you understand that there is something bigger for you to achieve. IÂ’m not going to talk stories about great people in History that change the world, did this this this, change this change that without college education/money/support. IÂ’m just going to say depending on what you want to change, there are various ways to do so. There are million and one things to change, and they are different with time. There are also things that are not within our control or power, even if one is Bill Gates, Warren Buffet or Ban Ki-Moon. IÂ’m not pouring ice water, but I admire the spirit for wanting to do something and taking the action to prepare for it. </span><br><br>2.Why do I want to work for the government, its because I'm passionate about serving as an officer in the Armed Forces.And its career suicide for me if I sign-on with an average-Joe poly results and even after 10years max out at the rank of Captain or Major. By then, there's no point already. I wish to be there to be the movers and shakers, not just because the money is good. If the money there is good, I would say that money in the private sector would definitely be much much better.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Fully agreed. YouÂ’ll definitely need degrees in SAF. </span><br><br>3.Yes, I do know what I want in the future. I want to be a distinctively outstanding officer in the Armed Forces, I don't aim to be some BG or what, but at least a LTC or COL. would be sufficient,and venture into side businesses with 2 of my best friends.<br><span style="color: blue;">Things changes with experience. Perceptions changes with experience. Dreams changes with experience. Perhaps 5 years down the road you might be thinking of doing a different thing. Columnist Janice Wong aspired so much to be a top journalist in sg, but change to corporate marketing three years later. </span><br><br>4.I wanna be that because its my passion, not the money, the fame, recognition.If its for the fame, I would have chosen to be a movie star or singer, but sadly I look ugly. If its for the recognition,  I would have chosen to be a scientist whom discovered the secrets to immortality or the cure for cancer/aids. Thus, my aim of being in the military is purely for the passion to serve my country and my people. Yes, I can be a specialist, but frankly, how much difference can a specialist make to the policies?<br><span style="color: blue;">Passion is important in whatever you do. Passion is definite as a powerful emotion such as love or hate. However one will need to have experienced it before having an emotion for it. Simply saying, if youÂ’re not in the army now, how do you even feel anything about it in the first place? NCC is very different from regular. </span><br><br>5.No, I won't do it..$5million to fail my poly and not go uni, though tempting, its still silly. Its not like the $5million to the last penny, but like the saying goes "Give a man a fish, he will not be hungry for a day. Teach a man a fish, he will never go hungry" And I'm a firm believer that whatever that you don't earn or fight for, its not yours.And you would treasure whatever you have achieved more then ever because you can see your blood and sweat in it. Though I occasionally bitch about the life I'm living, I'm thankful for being more able then those handicapped, broke and destitute people in the streets.And that I have the opportunity to make a difference,if I want to make a difference. Thus Frankly I won't do it even if its $50million. I also do not wish to be indebted to this person.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Sure? Haha. Ok, if you are so true to your aim.<br><br>The bottomline is<br>1.	There is nothing you can do except to work hard, get better grades and see if you can get into a local Uni, since overseas uni are out of the question.<br>2.	Everything changes with experience. ThereÂ’s no need to be so depress because you may find yourself loving something else in future. Plan well for the future but take life as it comes.<br><br>Perhaps understanding the 2 above points make you a more mature person. Anyone who is very disturbed by what they cannot control, cannot be great leaders.<br></span><br></div></blockquote>my 2 cents...hopefully, they're worth more to you...<br></div>

Except their own students living in their own little deluded world, believing they are the best uni in Spore. You are better off in a recognised, decently ranked uni like NUS or NTU. Alot of things can still happen for you. Start hitting the books, work smart, and then look at your options after graduation.</div>
