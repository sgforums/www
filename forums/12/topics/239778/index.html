            <div class='col-md body'>Its damn bloody frustrating because frankly, my tutors/lecturers have pulled me aside to talk to me, and always ask me to explain why am I able to produce A and B grade projects, but I'm unable to do well when it comes to tests/exams. Its seriously frustrating man...why is it that somebody able to perform practically, think on his feet, be fluid to the changes in the situation, be unable to go far just because he has a tendency to be unable to remember stuff?<br><br>Also,I've come to the understanding that seriously...many students have a tendency to mug hard for the exam, and after that, shed whatever that has been studied. Whats the point of doing so man? End of the day, you don't take anything away from you other then your diploma, degree, but do you have a core understanding of whatever you've studied?

You'll need to address the root of "Feeling Depressed and Down in the Dumps..."<br><br></div></blockquote>1. I want to go to a local uni, because my parents can't afford to send me overseas. Although when I ask/hinted to them, they said "Sure, no problem" but thing is, if I do go, they will have little/no savings left. Dad's in his mid-50s and Mum's in her late 40s, how much longer can they work? Besides that, I've got a younger brother who's 15 and I've to think of the amount of work my dad has to prepare to finance him through man. And why Uni in the first place? Lets be utterly frank, I feel that there's a larger beckoning to what I have done in my life. There's something bigger for me to be accomplish and this can't be done in our society why? Because here we need 2 things to make a statement that has both weight and credits, you need to be qualified (better if you are over-qualified) with degrees, masters, PhDs or you have to be wealthy, very wealthy. If not, nobody will pay attention to what you say no matter how proven it is. And also, its not the power/ego that I seek, but I'm seeking a way to also improve the living conditions of my family man. I don't wish to see my parents having to slog another 10-15years.<br><br>2.Why do I want to work for the government, its because I'm passionate about serving as an officer in the Armed Forces.And its career suicide for me if I sign-on with an average-Joe poly results and even after 10years max out at the rank of Captain or Major. By then, there's no point already. I wish to be there to be the movers and shakers, not just because the money is good. If the money there is good, I would say that money in the private sector would definitely be much much better.<br><br>3.Yes, I do know what I want in the future. I want to be a distinctively outstanding officer in the Armed Forces, I don't aim to be some BG or what, but at least a LTC or COL. would be sufficient,and venture into side businesses with 2 of my best friends.<br><br>4.I wanna be that because its my passion, not the money, the fame, recognition.If its for the fame, I would have chosen to be a movie star or singer, but sadly I look ugly. If its for the recognition,  I would have chosen to be a scientist whom discovered the secrets to immortality or the cure for cancer/aids. Thus, my aim of being in the military is purely for the passion to serve my country and my people. Yes, I can be a specialist, but frankly, how much difference can a specialist make to the policies?<br><br>5.No, I won't do it..$5million to fail my poly and not go uni, though tempting, its still silly. Its not like the $5million to the last penny, but like the saying goes "Give a man a fish, he will not be hungry for a day. Teach a man a fish, he will never go hungry" And I'm a firm believer that whatever that you don't earn or fight for, its not yours.And you would treasure whatever you have achieved more then ever because you can see your blood and sweat in it. Though I occasionally bitch about the life I'm living, I'm thankful for being more able then those handicapped, broke and destitute people in the streets.And that I have the opportunity to make a difference,if I want to make a difference. Thus Frankly I won't do it even if its $50million. I also do not wish to be indebted to this person.</div>

Its seriously frustrating man...why is it that somebody able to perform practically, think on his feet, be fluid to the changes in the situation, be unable to go far just because he has a tendency to be unable to remember stuff?<br><br>Also,I've come to the understanding that seriously...many students have a tendency to mug hard for the exam, and after that, shed whatever that has been studied. Whats the point of doing so man? End of the day, you don't take anything away from you other then your diploma, degree, but do you have a core understanding of whatever you've studied? You can answer that yourself.<br><br>Haiz...the more I think about it, the more depressed I get man.</div></blockquote>If you're as good as you've said yourself to be... You'll probably still be SOMETHING when you step into teh society in the future...</div>

Thats what my friends said to me too. But that part might change, but its been there for the past 10-15yrs of my life. Its either that or going out to be a marketing exec. and use the money to start up something...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think you plan to far already.<br><br>Be realistic, right now, u left one year, getting good grades is still not a problem.<br><br>If u cannot remember word for word then use your other skills to remember stuff, using reasoning and logic skills and chaining up information as a flow, mind map, etc.<br><br>The thing is from what I read, instead of adapting and finding a solution out of your current predicament, you whine about it. Yes, understanding is good, but if u are running short of time and have too much to do, then I dun see why mugging is not a good idea. I dun see why one cannot review and understand all he/she wants AFTER the exam. Duhh....<br><br>Seriously, base on this u are depressed and down, dammn, I cannot imagine u becoming an Officer man and I seriously do not wish to be under your command.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i managed grades A or B+ projects most of the times, but my exams pull me down...<br><br>I dont blame anyone, because i never attend lectures or do any homework or study for exams. My GPA sucks now too, but i guess is still average or above average for my course.<br><br>For GPA, it got to depend on what course you are taking as well. Fret not bro, there are many degrees out there that you can take. If you are worry, take a 1 year degree after your NS and apply for NUS/NTU/SMU with that in the future. You still might stand a chance.<br><br>Cheers.</div>
