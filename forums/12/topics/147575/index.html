            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by drx:</div><div class="quote_body">Yeah i know my limits<br><br>I told them firmly to settle themselves and stop coming to me for any quarrel at all.<br><br>They stop after one of 2 days then the whole cycle again.<br><br>So is my fault that they keep coming back to me?<br></div></blockquote>Your fault? Honest opinion?<br><br>No and Yes.<br><br>You've clearly stated that they should settle the matter themselves and should not get you involved.<br>It's not your fault.<br><br>You've also created this impression of a - relationship solution agent/counsellor.<br>Which is why it is natural for them to come to you whenever problems arise.<br>Their dependance and weight of relationship is onto you when in the first place, it shouldn't be.<br>It could be possible that you've not been drawing the line clear between counselling and friendship advice.<br>So on this point. Yes it's your fault for not stating clearly what and how you can help.<br><br>From a friendship point of view. Again, you're not at fault.<br><br>_______________<br><br>If this couple's relationship is unable to keep within two person. Their problems will always need third party to be resolved.<br>This r/s is seen unsustainable in my point of view - <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> A relationship not being able to stand on it's own is not a grown/matured form of Love.<br>The basic foundation is soft and sinking. Either one of them are unwilling to tie matters up, looking at facts plainly and trying to solve it.<br>Weak parties + weak/miscommunication = dying r/s<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> It is human for us to look at matters in a logical manner.<br>However when it comes to people whom are close to us who faces problems, we can't help but to include emotions into our logical solution. Which actually is distorted already.<br><br>Again, it's the line where you'll draw.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Today was the day for the big ROM which almost never went through.<br><br>Both were quarrling so much that everyone thought that it was over. I managed to pull both of them into a small room and lectured them for a full half and hour.<br><br>In the end both of them managed to hug and cry and everything went on smoothly after that. Sometimes pre ROM can be very tough on some couples and the pressure can be very great but I believe that if there is still love between both of them is possible till the very end.<br><br>Thanks everyone here for your comments and I am glad to inform you that they are enjoying their time together as I type this.</div>
