              <p>I dont understand why ppl like to take advantage of someone who's very nice to them.. like my best friend i treat her like my own sister, help and do all the things that she cant manage. Sometimes when she's angry or not happy she shows the attitude and i have to bear with it. But she cant juz wait for me for 30mins??? i dont understand~~ She can juz angry with me for waiting for me at her house... And it's not always, it's juz like once in a life time~~ and she can juz hangup my call.. not that i didnt give her a reason~ she also cant accept. So tired~~~ is this call best friends?</p>

              <p><br>She never take advantage of u. It just that she has a bad attitude and a non grateful manner. U never make a stand that whatever good things u do to her, she must repaid u,right?  So in first place, I don't think she owes u anything.</p>

              <p><br>Best friends will almost never do something like that to each other.</p>
              <p>Unless you're talking about those once in 10years kind of incident, if that's the case...I think you should overlook pass that one particular incident if that's your best friend...because I will overlook pass it if I were you.</p>
              <p>Maybe your best friend is very one-sided?</p>
              <p>You could be treating her as your best friend, but you may not be her best friend and she may not be thinking of you as her best friend either.</p>
              <p>Alot of things in this world are one-sided, but yes, people especially Singaporeans....likes/enjoy/thrives to take absolute advantages of one another like a bunch of hyenas from the ZOO.</p>
              <p>But that's also one of the reason why I don't like Singaporeans cos they will never be good enough for me, but not my beloved Singapore. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Hi just had a similar incident today .</p>
              <p>Planned a movie for 2days with my best female friend. Apparently asked her a few times and she confirmed she would be free . Even till the time i online book ticks , she is still agreeable.</p>
              <p>Apparently she conveniently 4got abt it is ALREADY PLANNED and told me she had to go somewhere to get materials for her stuff. Timing and place clashed , so i was like pissed off and gave her attitude.</p>
              <p>She has this kind of bad habit like whenever i asked her out , she would say ' see1st ... confirm with u again ... bla bla ' so i will know she will nv confirm with me , cos she is waiting for the best option available and it rarely fall on me .</p>
              <p>Most of the time i relent and just laugh it off , but this time i was rather pissed. How can some1 just promised and forgets abt it . Not to mention we r like best friends and soul mates those kind of things.  So i told her straight that i cherish her and do not want to be taken for granted , and let this be the last time .</p>

              <p>I always wait for my friend and she always turn up late.. everytime. If I say I'm not pissed or what, it's fake.</p>
              <p>So it depends on how tolerant u are towards ur friend. If u really can't stand her attitude, then just move on and find other friends who treat u like one.</p>
