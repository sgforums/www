For a moment here, I should say you're really thinking too much... I would advise you to hold your horses and not imagine too many things..<br><br>Increase meet ups if you want to (and if you can?), but take rejections in the face and not be a sore-loser pls...?<br><br>Personally, whether you're getting it or not...

But I don't know where I got my guts from and I dated her out. Since then, we have gone out for 3 times to catch movies and have meals alone after work. And I made it a point to see her home each time.<br><br>Once, she came over to my cubicle to say hello when she saw me there. And during a lunch organised by the company, she came over and stood next to me to talk to me when I stuck with my group of colleagues from my own project team. But then she never initiates any conversation over MSN if she sees me online and we've never talked for days. It was always me who initiates conversations and dates. But she was always obliging and cheery when I do.<br><br>She has not indicated she likes me. Yet I'm not sure if she's waiting for me to initiate something. So I'm in the gray area. I've dated her a couple of times and although I might not have "performed" well on our dates, I showed her the due respect and treated her well to the best of my ability.<br><br>I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I'm clueless, lost and at a deadend as to what to do next. It seems like I'm in a quagmire - neither advancing nor retreating but stuck at a point. I'm wondering if it is time that I should just do the ultimate and make clear to her about my feeling so that she can:<br><br><ul><br>[*] Reject me straightaway if she's not interested or already attached<br>[*] Keep me on waiting list<br>[*] Accept me<br></ul><br><br>How? It has been 3 months...And I cannot be a irritating parasite to pester her to go out with me every week as well.</div></blockquote>I think a prevalent trait that I've observed among Asians in general(basically those brought up in an Asian culture) - and I'm not just talking about girls - is the lack of want to take an initiative in forging inter-personal relationships(and I don't just mean boy-girl ones). Having studied and worked in many parts of the world myself, I do feel that is often a major obstacle which prevents strong bonds from being formed.<br><br>Back to your issue  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> . If this(the part where you lament she doesn't take much initiative to start a conversation or ask you out and you had to do everything) hadn't been described in an Asian context, then it'd probably mean she has no interest in you. That said, I don't think her body language(or lack thereof) should put you off just yet - as many have already said on this thread, the fact that she has been willing to go out with you should leave you with some hope. Then again, how and what you're prepared to do with this 'hope' also depends on you - are you prepared to be the one initiating things every time for the foreseeable future, for instance? In essence, I think you need to reassess your objectives(ie.how far you're prepared to go to win her over) in this endeavour and re-strategise your moves to attain what you want. Nevertheless, just keep in mind that her body language may not indicate a disinterest in you.<br><br>Personally, such a problem has never - and in all likelihood, will never - plague me simply because I've never believed in any sort of a relationship where both parties are not prepared to move on to "the next level" mutually(so basically, I wouldn't even see myself having a future with someone who doesn't want/bother/dare to take the initiative to initiate something with me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"> ).</div>
