Why do you need to tolerate him and his behaviour, let him found out how bad this gal for himself and if he comes back to you. Dun be so soft hearted as to accept him, since he abandoned you once.

I dunno..I just like him..at first, I dun have a good impression of him cause he has that heck-care attitude. Erm, ya, he is handsom, if not why girls come to him, right?

Erm.., I have to admit, ya, I sometimes come late to get his attention.<br><br>Why is he a hypocrite? tat's cause he doesn't like ppl who bully me and yet he goes with the girl that is the mastermind behind my bullying? isn't that hypocrite or what? His friends are those that also come late..so I dun get it why is he hating on me doing this? or issit his friends dun like, then he also follow them dun like?
