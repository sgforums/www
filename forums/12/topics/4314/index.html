            <div class='col-md body'>been thinking lots lately ..<br>i have a friend whom i know for almost 9 years. A pal whom i guess thru these years carry a touch for me, but we were both attached during our school days.<br><br>ONly till last year when we get to see each other more often.. guess he was dumped by his girlfriend (tat's wat he claims)<br>and i was not really in good shape with my boyfriend (we broke up in the end).<br><br>He went for his service after graduation and study part time as well in the evening, he is lucky that he doesnt need to stay in ..<br>Then, the efforts of spending time with me was noticed. But i did not accept him as i do not want to have any love on a rebound kind of thing.<br><br>He understands, but soon we see each other less often. this is the time when i start to grow fonder of him .. he kinda MIA for a few months, then claiming that he is really busy with his work and studies..<br>I didn't call or msg him either ..<br>try not to get into his way ...<br>But this is not for long, i told him what has been bugging me - asked him why the sudden change?<br><br>He said he is going away and not want to pull me into the picture. He is afraid that things will not work out since its a long distance relationship. He doesn't have the confidence in it..<br>i accepted that .. and i drew a line ...<br>i din take the initiative to contact him after that .<br><br>He calls occasionally and we will go out .. sometimes .. getting me so confused with his actions and what he says ..<br><br>ONly till recently that i got to know from some reliable source that he has a girlfriend for almost 6 years .. devastated<br>issit true?<br>We have no common friends, and there is not one i can ask as to what he is doing .. this is bad ...really bad ..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>He often appears when he feels like it and MIA for all he wants after that ... well, that's how i feel.<br>I do like this person .. but seems like i should give him up .. even as a friend ...<br>Sigh!!!<br>VEXED ~<br><br>[This message has been edited by Pink Polka Dot (edited 12 February 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually Dotty, I've been in a situation similar to yours... very similar in fact.<br>I just hope that my friend doesn't have this same feeling as you, because if she does..<br>then I'm terribly late in making amends.<br><br>I've had this female friend of mine.. since primary school. On and off.. we still bump into each other... I'll be the first to admit that I have a major soft spot for her...<br>but then, in my case... I'll never do anything about how I feel because, it probably won't work out as a relationship... and if it doesn't work out.. then I'd lose a very dear friend.<br><br>I don't know why your friend seems to have lied to you... or how he pops in and out of your life.. it's terribly irresponsible.. and I ashamedly must admit that I tend to do that too... my reason? because I can't juggle the schedules between having a gf and keeping up with all my other friends.<br><br>I do miss my friend and I'd do anything for her... in fact, I flew up to Melbourne for a week because I heard that she'd be alone in Oz for her birthday.<br><br>But then, some friendships just work this way... and you have to make your feelings clear to the other party, so that you'll know just what both of you are thinking and facing... don't just stop contacting him...<br>or something like that...<br><br>What you have between you and him is special.<br>Perhaps it has evolved into the most basic kind of love between two people. A feeling that doesn't demand anything from either party.. nor does it expect anything..<br><br>Don't just give it up.<br><br>------------------<br>Don't like what I'm saying? Bite me....<br>but not too hard please.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for all you know, he could be one of those two-timing jerks. probably is, the way he keeps disappearing, and appearing when he just wants someone to be with.<br><br>i`m guessing you should just ignore him, next time he calls. girls are usually way too soft-hearted, after he begs a coupla times, you`re going to go out with him again. Don`t.<br><br>let him be the one to do the chasing. if he`s serious, he`ll be persistent enough. make him work for it. make sure he`s serious about you before you waste your time on him. otherwise forget about it and do something else. you can`t waste your life waiting for someone who isn`t going to like you.</div>

It's a tad sad when things like this happen... you know, when friendships go sour, especially when one party doesn't treat the other right.<br><br>I guess the most important thing when you're in a situation like yours, is to make sure that you're constantly aware of what's going on in your mind and the body language that the other person is conveying. If he's outrightly flirting, for the sole purpose of messing with your mind then drop him. If he isn't doing it on purpose, but there's actually an attraction there... then painful though it might be, I know I'd bear with it.<br><br>I believe that we are moving like orbiting stars in our lives, once in a while, our paths will cross and for that period of time, we'll be close again... then it fades off after a while. You never know when the time comes for him/her to pop into your life again, but you tend to recognise the signs after a while (I believe in signs too..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">)<br><br>I'm actually meeting this friend of mine again tonight. By some chance, I saw her when the MRT whizzed past today... so I ran to the carriage. It really was her! We're going out tonight. So life does move in mysterious ways, of all the trains and all the timings.. I had to meet her today.<br><br>Take a look and see.. and don't be surprised by what you might find.<br><br>------------------<br>Don't like what I'm saying?

When I start to embark my service days as a combat personnel, duties and responsibilites became heavier and heavier. I failed to book out during weekends and the frequency of going out with her became less and less.<br><br>Nevertheless, I tried to call her during weekends whenever I could from my campus. Too bad she doesn't hold a hp or a pager. I could only call her hostel now and then. As her hostel was just near my campus, I could cycle there now and then during my free time just to see her, but she's seldom around.<br><br>She broke up with me eventually on my birthday, when I was in Pulau Tekong for training by paging me(finally). She claimed that my vocation was very free according to a friend of mine. Well, I have to accept the fact that since she's gone, she's gone. I took the "offer".<br><br>Should I trust women from there on?? I was with her for only a year, but trust me, the affection is there. What I could do is to forget her and move on. I hated her for a while, but after 3 days, I got over with it.<br><br>It can be done, trust me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br></div>
