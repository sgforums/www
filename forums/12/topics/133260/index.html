            <div class='col-md body'>it was more than half a year ago, when i first saw the gal in my one of my uni classes.  Back then, i developed a crush for her but secretly just keep it by myself and din do anything about it.We were not even friends but i think were just merely classmates who knew each other's names as we were in a particular module's class. Time pass and its a new semester, we are now totally different classes and there was no chance of meeting each other. Somehow as i was helping my fren to buy some things, i managed to get her hp number as my fren told her that she also wanted to buy. So as a kind and helpful person, i sms her regarding this and din wanna expect much as i just oni wanna help out of kindness with no other intentions. i would say its a miracle out of the blue when we actually start to be friends. There were MSN chats, smses. And slowly i felt this gal whom is my secret crush is trying to get to know me. Until one day, she asked me out for some activity. And tats when we started chatting on the telephone. I did some soul searching and considerations, thinking why not try to be closer to her since she is my crush and i felt there was some interest. so i proceeded to accelarate and get closer to her. We chatted a lot, sms more, tok on the fone too , started to sit together at the lectures and occasionally have meals and go out together. All this gave me an impression that its possible between me and her. and i decided to confess my feelings to her on valentines day that i like her. She did not comment much but also did not reject me. So our normal activities like chatting, sitting together, msging one another, etc continues. until one day i asked her to be my gf. Again she did not accept and did not reject or avoid me. So i was rather confident that i can get this gal to be my gf. thinking that she wanted to wait after the dreaded exams. i continue to shower her with sincere care and concern. until one day , i found out from her that she is uncertain if i am the guy for her. and has no confidence and assurance if this relationship will work out well. I was very sad but persisted to fight for what i cherish. I told her i love her and have a serious talk with her. She felt the love from me from the things i did, and she appreciate some of them which i had done for her. but she claimed tat she felt my courting is not enough. i was also commented as being a boring person and unromantic. timid and scared of things and need to be more man. The way i dress when i went to meet her for dates and the my height and unbroad shoulders were also mentioned. I was kinda disappointed in this gal whom i love so dearly. i feel that She is demanding a lot from me. and din realli get to know my good points. though i admit i can an ordinary guy with no riches, no car, and oni mediocal looks. Unromantic as i seemed, but deep down i know she understands that i sincerely care and love her. Those small simple things which i had done for her. i feel unappreciated. Is it because she is rather immature in the way she defines her suitable guy? is there really a criteria or a limit as to what type of person u will love? she is also not perfect but i had unconditionally accept her to be my soul mate whom i placed at the centre of my universe. seemed to me that she wanted to some changes in me and she told me i also need to think of more ways to convince her to accept me as her guy. Seems to me she does not like me for who i am. I had talks with my close friends who told me to just give her up cause its a presurrising and unhappy relationship if somehow i managed to court her. kind people of aunt agony, pls share ur advice to me. i am on at a loss. could she be playing with my feelings all along?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>Thanks for your kind help/advice.</div>

How you know? Hahaha, anyway no offense. I think C2ON2, this is the best advice I got some really smart ppl, and makes alot of sense to me. It's for you to decide - <strong>If you have to work so hard in a relationship, it's probably not gonna work out.</strong><br><br>Relationships is a two way thing, if one party is doing all the giving, how can it ever last. You are in a uni, take part in all those CCAs so many chances to meet so many people, go out and find someone else. When you found someone new, you will forget about her already. I'm not saying find someone to take her place, but it's true that when u are with another person u like, then can u truely get over the previous one, if not it's like me, took me 3 yrs to get over it without any new relationships</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Once my friend say, a gal when reach around 25 and above, they usually dun care so much about looks for they next half. I dun know if it really applies to all the gals, but at least it happen to me.<br><br>i also heard from my another friend, he has a colleague who likes a gal very much but reject him alot of times. Takes him 7 year for him to make the gal to be his wife. He used this kind of phrase to encourage me to woo a gal.<br><br>Moral of the story is:  The gal might say she goes for looks, but in time to come, she might realize that it is not important after all. But this is provided that she does not meet the one that fits in her bill. Yes, u might still stand a chance if u are persistant to shower her with care and love, but that is not a gurantee. Would u risk ur future to meet other nice gals out there which might be 1000 times better than her. If u r really sure about getting her to be your gal, then please dun give up. Otherwise, for any normal guy, i think we will just stay as friends and see how. Keeping ur option open rather than staying for one target is ming zhi de xuan ze. Its all up to you</div>

It doesn't seem fair to me. She should accept me for what i am and for who i am. its good at least that i know wats she is thinking inside her mind. In a sense my confidence was shaken to some extend even though i do not want to let this thing affect me. She is actually a good and nice gal. mabbe we shd just be friends and keep it that way...</blockquote>When a girl tells a guy that his "courting is not enough" for her to accept his love, it usually means she has no love for him. There are two possible reasons why such an excuse is used:<br><br>1. She does not find him an ideal mate, but she does not want to lose him as a friend -- a potential "best guy friend" -- either.<br><br>2. She could be waiting for "something" to move her into loving him. While it is possible for such a relationship to work, the odds are not high. The problem usually is not in how hard it is to get the "something"; but the possibility that when that "something" is eventually gotten, the girl would realise it isn't what she actually wanted, and the guy would still end up with no love. Or that the girl could lose her patience and go to another guy instead.<br><br>If you don't wish to fight the odds by changing yourself yet you can't give her up, you could give her some time instead to date a few so-called "happening and romantic" guys first, let them maybe break her in along with her heart, and she just <span style="font-style: italic;">might</span> come to realise the advantages of being with "boring and unromantic" guys. That is, if you don't mind playing the waiting game of course.<br><br>Nevertheless, it is heartening to hear that you have bravely tested the waters and have identified her incompatibility as a mate, thus saving yourself from some potential big-time hurt. Perhaps the next challenge is to ask yourself whether you can continue to be "just a friend" after having been rejected more than once.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey dude... well, i might be wrong but i think the gal just enjoys the attention you have given her... she never rejected you or given you a clear and firm answer in the beginning whether she liked you or not means she just enjoyed being pursued and that's it. ( you have placed the ball at her court by telling her you liked her and thats when she took advantage of the situation )<br>Like what someone mentioned earlier, you need not try hard to pursue if she''s interested in you. But dun despair, she can jolly well wait for her prince charming while you move on and find someone else better. And I guess when u stopped ignoring or caring about her, she would feel loss n missed the attention you have given her....<br><br>If she's mature enough or a good friend of urs, she wouldn't have critised about your dressing n character. Everyone has its own qualities and short comings....we r different in our own way.<br><br>Anyway, learn to pull back, you can't just give her everything or attention all the time.  You are making yourself miserable by doing that. The period during where you have put in lotsa effort n sincerity in going after her was enough, if she didn't feel it...well, then she probably dumb or just attention seeking.</div>

Back then, i developed a crush for her but secretly just keep it by myself and din do anything about it.We were not even friends but i think were just merely classmates who knew each other's names as we were in a particular module's class. Time pass and its a new semester, we are now totally different classes and there was no chance of meeting each other. Somehow as i was helping my fren to buy some things, i managed to get her hp number as my fren told her that she also wanted to buy. So as a kind and helpful person, i sms her regarding this and din wanna expect much as i just oni wanna help out of kindness with no other intentions. i would say its a miracle out of the blue when we actually start to be friends. There were MSN chats, smses. And slowly i felt this gal whom is my secret crush is trying to get to know me. Until one day, she asked me out for some activity. And tats when we started chatting on the telephone. I did some soul searching and considerations, thinking why not try to be closer to her since she is my crush and i felt there was some interest. so i proceeded to accelarate and get closer to her. We chatted a lot, sms more, tok on the fone too , started to sit together at the lectures and occasionally have meals and go out together. All this gave me an impression that its possible between me and her. and i decided to confess my feelings to her on valentines day that i like her. She did not comment much but also did not reject me. So our normal activities like chatting, sitting together, msging one another, etc continues. until one day i asked her to be my gf. Again she did not accept and did not reject or avoid me. So i was rather confident that i can get this gal to be my gf. thinking that she wanted to wait after the dreaded exams. i continue to shower her with sincere care and concern. until one day , i found out from her that she is uncertain if i am the guy for her. and has no confidence and assurance if this relationship will work out well. I was very sad but persisted to fight for what i cherish. I told her i love her and have a serious talk with her. She felt the love from me from the things i did, and she appreciate some of them which i had done for her. but she claimed tat she felt my courting is not enough. i was also commented as being a boring person and unromantic. timid and scared of things and need to be more man. The way i dress when i went to meet her for dates and the my height and unbroad shoulders were also mentioned. I was kinda disappointed in this gal whom i love so dearly. i feel that She is demanding a lot from me. and din realli get to know my good points. though i admit i can an ordinary guy with no riches, no car, and oni mediocal looks. Unromantic as i seemed, but deep down i know she understands that i sincerely care and love her. Those small simple things which i had done for her. i feel unappreciated. Is it because she is rather immature in the way she defines her suitable guy? is there really a criteria or a limit as to what type of person u will love? she is also not perfect but i had unconditionally accept her to be my soul mate whom i placed at the centre of my universe. seemed to me that she wanted to some changes in me and she told me i also need to think of more ways to convince her to accept me as her guy. Seems to me she does not like me for who i am. I had talks with my close friends who told me to just give her up cause its a presurrising and unhappy relationship if somehow i managed to court her. kind people of aunt agony, pls share ur advice to me. i am on at a loss. could she be playing with my feelings all along?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>Thanks for your kind help/advice.  </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Believe it or not, consciously or unconsciously - we calculate and factor in certain attributes or qualities of our potential partner to deem if he/she is suitable for a relationship. Love and Relationship is strongly co-related, however, they are still separate entities (meaning you can love someone, but you choose to opt out in a relationship structure). You must understand that you had an immerse crush on her, but it is not the same way round. She treated you like a good friend, with improving impression, but do you consider it anywhere near the border of love? Not entirely.<br><br>Because you do not belong to the category of guys whom she will have hasty infatuation for - you have tap on honest, dependable characteristic to sell yourself. This is a good thing and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>do not</strong></span> be discourage with whatever you are doing.<br><br>And because she doesn't fell hard enough, technically, she has her own rights to choose the kind of partners she seek. Reality is pretty cruel: do not presume that just because you treated a girl well and shower all your love and affection onto, something gonna happen. Something is amiss here; regardless of the goodwill and stuff you always did, she just doesn't fall hard enough... for a relationship to begin on proper basis.<br><br>Therefore she has chosen an alternative: attempting to shape her given variables to convince her heart to accept you into a relationship. Her psyche would probably react like this:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">'Ok fine, I think he's a good guy. I <strong>don't know </strong>if I love him anot (or even so, not till that extend), but I <strong>don't mind </strong>giving him a chance.

If you have come so far, just to give it up, you got to tell yourself that you won't ever look back and regret.<br><br>You could also TRY to fill-in-the-blank with what's missing currently and create a relationship with her. It could be difficult to define each other's love definition, individual expectation, etc - however, we will learn two very important skills: compromising and evolving. It will be difficult though, but at the very least, you won't regret having to give up when you had the advantage to do something about it.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
