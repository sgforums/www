              <p>Is pleasing to learnt that she is doing good mentally now. Not easy for mother's 10th pregnancy, upbringing and then ended up in the corporate world devastated to such an extent. In fact, everyone has its predefined destiny for peace and harmony. The sole purpose of Corporate world as a big family is sort of a big charitable and generosity organisation to assist its government to look after the well being of all.It really suck to learnt of such tragedy in an educated society like singapore, what the suck. There may also many similar instances that may have suffered in silence. suck so suckingggg ! hope that the future young promising generation of sg will be in good shape of moving corporate world into another milestone of everlastin joys and peace. so suck!</p>

              <p>You are right when you say that. But oftentimes have to look at the employees' status in the co. Too small a fish go point out the error of a much bigger fish, who do you think will get fried first? Whose 'death' will be easier to cover?</p>
              <p>At first, the person I report to give me problem. Den I ask her why, she say higher-ups. When I know part of it is her problem. And she keep shooting me. So I have no choice but to go and tell HER boss. And after that, she resign. But things have not improved for me, they simply got another person to replace her. The only way to do improve the situation, is to move up and step on them.</p>
              <p>But I know, every co. is like that larh...esp in corporate world, dog-eat-dog, employees are no longer seen as humans but robots.</p>

              <p><br>some of teh managers have karkia to help them be their allies. coz manager primary 6 only, last time proud GM when time sgood, but latter got retraneched cannot even afford car already. so see his subordinates also same 1 , only can survive in this company, so they keep to each other and work iin a team. the problem stems from the mangers, in times of bad they will  do anything to keep their own rice bowls.</p>
