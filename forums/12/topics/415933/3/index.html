If TS give up and use this as the reason, proves that TS doesn't really love his gf as much as he thinks and he is only proving her parents right ! Some parents want the best for their daughter so they are putting a test to the would be son-in-law to prove his love for their daughter. Is TS up to that?</p>

              <p>oh, i am also 21yo, but i do not use cents, i use senses,</p>
              <p>I believe issue such as this are not within our scope to argue over it, cos we do not really know the head and tail, what we heard is only TS point of view, there are many others, the gf, the parents, the friends and so on.</p>
              <p>Ultimately, I only believe in one thing, that is LOVE, if TS really loves his gf, care for her and is willing to go thru the thick and thin of life together, the issue of separation will not be an issue anymore, no matter what happen, not even earthquake, nuclear strikes, volcano erruption, etc etc, TS must be there for her. And just becos of her parents dislike of TS, he seek separation is completely a non sensical relationship, it show that LOVE did not exist in him.</p>
              <p>do you take this woman as your wife, love her, care for and protect her and forever together for the rest of your life?</p>

              <p><br>I totally agree with Angel.</p>
              <p>Many people today don't truly know and feel true unconditional love, which explains the high divorce rates. When times are good, couples act lovey-dovey, and spout all sorts of "I'll love you forever and ever, etc...". But when times are bad, or when there are tough obstacles, all feelings of love are thrown out of the nearest window, as both parties don't bother to put in efforts to heal the wounds and regrow the love feelings.</p>
              <p>Are people getting married just to fulfill societal and family expectations, or are people really deeply and genuinely in love with each other, and love and care for each other in sickness and in health, throughout their lives???</p>
              <p>In TS' case, both him and his gf are part of the problem, one way or another. TS must have done something that greatly angered/offended his gf' parents, which only he will know. As for his gf, is she doing anything or enough to convince her parents to accept TS? If not, why not?</p>

              <p>Till one understands and reconciles to the fears and reasons (within oneself) to love or not - it is an illusion one is experiencing and sooner or later along the ''journey'' when the reasons and fears if unreconciled will encroach and most likely only pain and regrets would be the mainstay!</p>

              <p>Yes you have money, maybe you have looks, perhaps your family is wealthier than hers. But these are your ego talking. Superficials that doesn't matter in the longer term.</p>
              <p><strong>I am just responding to others queries in regards to background differences and as per my previous post, I did mention that I am not on the good looking side.</strong></p>
              <p>You may think you are a good catch. Her parents think otherwise.</p>
              <p>Why you wonder.</p>
              <p><strong>There are definately better guys out there.</strong></p>
              <p>Because you lack something, what her parents believe will make a blissful marriage.</p>
              <p><strong>Together with my gf, we are trying very hard to figure out as her parents had no response to it.</strong></p>
              <p>Your personality. Are you an egotistical guy ? A narcissist ? A man who holds low level of morality ?</p>
              <p><strong>Nope.</strong></p>
              <p>How well do you treat your gf ? Have you ever abused her before ? (Physical, verbal, emotional abuse).</p>
              <p><strong>Never.</strong></p>
              <p>How long ago was it when you decided to give up your vices ? 1 month ago? 2 months ago ? Span of time you lack, given your age is only 29?</p>
              <p><strong>A year into our relationship when I realise she is the one I want to spend my life with, which was yrs ago.</strong></p>
              <p>Her parents are being protective of her daughter's future, and rightfully so.</p>
              <p>Your gf stuck with you all these time, despite having to endure her family's deep disregard for you.</p>
              <p>Yet today, you are ready to ditch her simply because her family disapproval busted your big ego.</p>
              <p>Your gf deserves better, someone who's ego is not as big as an elephant. Some one who's ego is not as important as her. Fact is, she shoulda dumped you long time ago.</p>
              <p><strong>It might be wrong of me to carry such thoughts, her parents stance was not that strong during our courtship. It only grew worse when she broke the news to them that we are getting married next year which when we were out dating, she'll feceive endless calls from her parents.</strong></p>
              <p>Learn humility and some respect, only then will you earn some in return.</p>
              <p> <strong>Please get your facts right before criticism.</strong></p>

              <p>What you are doing is damage control.</p>
              <p>Did you ask her parents in-person for your gf's hand in marriage. Or did she had to tell her parents when you are safely bumming out elsewhere ? I hope you didn't just "texted" her parents to let them know of this life time decision.....</p>
              <p>Why didn't you try to find out what went wrong at the first sign of disapproval ?Instead, you continue to date your gf out and incur more of her parent's wrath.</p>
              <p>The amount of disregards and condescension for her parents is apalling. Yet you wonder why they hate you ?</p>
              <p>Frankly, there is a serious denial issue in you that will eventually frustrate your marriage many years down the road.</p>

              <p>I've been with my current girlfriend for a while now, we are in the stage of planning to move on to the next chapter and live our lives together. However, I only know recently that her parents is forcing her to end our relationships since the 1st day i met them as they do not likes me without any particular reason. I don't know where went wrong as I've treated her parents with the upmost respect when i see them. And for the sake of my girlfriend, I've given up the vices that I picked up during my younger days (smoking, drinking and clubbing). I also earned a decent salary of more then 5k though I'm only in my late 20s. </p>
              <p>Her parents even went to the extend that if she chose to marry me, they would try their best to stand in our way. I've tried to find out te reason by trying to invite her parents out for dinner her parents, but they do not even want to see me. And whenever my girlfriend is out with me, her parents would take turns to call her and chide her for being with me. As we are from traditional chinese famillies, customary weddings is must to my parents. If her parents strongly objects and choses not to even meet my parents to discuss the wedding details, I am worried that my parents would not approve to this marriage as well. I wonder what should I do. Should I just give up on this relationship or should I get on with it and put the marriage issues at the back of my mind and pray that her parents will mellow down one fine day??? </p>

              <p><br>It is obvious that her parents don't like you, if you didn't make any efforts to build any relationships, establish good rapport with them, charm/attract them with your personality.</p>
              <p>You only treated them with utmost respect only when you meet them, how is that enough for them to approve you as their future son-in-law and be convinced that you are the person for their beloved daughter if you don't even make efforts to win them over?</p>
              <p>I know you have claimed to have done alot of things, give up alot of bad habits for your girlfriend, but what have you done for the parents of your girlfriend?</p>
              <p>Like I have already mentioned 938476252928494 times that when you marry someone you loved, you also marry their family and loved ones because a marriage is actually a bonding of two families, not just as simple as you think it's the grand affairs between your cock and her vagina.</p>
              <p>It's not about how much you are earning and how good you are towards your girlfriend that will determine the outcome of your application of consent to her parents.</p>
              <p>If you have won over her parents, half of your battle is already won because it is easier for your girlfriend to like you if her parents loved you. But there is nothing wrong with doing it in the difficult but popular self-centred manner such as winning over the daughter first then you work on her parents. Maybe you really have thought that once your girlfriend have accepted you, her parents should have STFU because your love relationship is purely between you and your girlfriend. Now you will know that you are wrong IF you have really imagined along that line.</p>
              <p>I don't know how you treated towards your own parents, and maybe you can share with us about that.</p>
              <p>Maybe you don't understand the value of your own parents, but I can tell you the value of your girlfriend's parents is very important and equally as important as your own parents. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I don't think you should go and seek for her parent's approval. You are not going to like hearing their side of their objection. It would only serve to discourage you. Most important thing is how sincere are both of you willing to work through this problem. You must find out your gf's heart, if she truly loves you deep enough for both of you to go through this trial. That is the most important. If her parents disapprove and refuse to attend the wedding, you both can always elope and it also save you a lot of money.</p>
              <p>You shuold instead go and have a talk with your gf. If she is willing to go through the whole 9 nine yards with you, then you should proceed.</p>
