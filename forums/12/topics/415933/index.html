              <p>I've been with my current girlfriend for a while now, we are in the stage of planning to move on to the next chapter and live our lives together. However, I only know recently that her parents is forcing her to end our relationships since the 1st day i met them as they do not likes me without any particular reason. I don't know where went wrong as I've treated her parents with the upmost respect when i see them. And for the sake of my girlfriend, I've given up the vices that I picked up during my younger days (smoking, drinking and clubbing). I also earned a decent salary of more then 5k though I'm only in my late 20s. </p>
              <p>Her parents even went to the extend that if she chose to marry me, they would try their best to stand in our way. I've tried to find out te reason by trying to invite her parents out for dinner her parents, but they do not even want to see me. And whenever my girlfriend is out with me, her parents would take turns to call her and chide her for being with me. As we are from traditional chinese famillies, customary weddings is must to my parents. If her parents strongly objects and choses not to even meet my parents to discuss the wedding details, I am worried that my parents would not approve to this marriage as well. I wonder what should I do. Should I just give up on this relationship or should I get on with it and put the marriage issues at the back of my mind and pray that her parents will mellow down one fine day??? </p>

              <p>Frankly, it is not a relationship though on the surface it seems to appear so - a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mutual benefit scheme</span> is what it is.</p>
              <p>Till that is acknowledged one can delude oneself (n another) and start anew and seek another or ... it is still the same.</p>
              <p>The parents views/opinions are an excuse - what one is has surfaced. Being self-honest mite avail what is the true motive or the needs/expectations now parading and masquerading as love.</p>
              <p>Love is not bad, it never hurts, it never disappoints - it is the neurosis, the dysfunctional who screw up ( within oneself first) and shift and rationalise and defend one's position.</p>

              hi ts i got a few questions for you, how do you look? What is your profession? ( Engineer? Manager? ). What about both of your religions? Are they different. Are her parents very 'religious' ? Check ba zi ? Are you a local Singaporean ? 
                  
                  And most importantly what is your girlfriend's age. Does she have any bad past experiences with her ex-boyfriends. 
                  
                  
                  People do not read minds, sometimes you have to talk to them in their face. Make them believe and trust? And how long have you guys been together?
                  
                  PS:If darkness is right then very very very very very very very very sian for you, seriously.
              
              &amp; Never give up. Unless you don't love her anymore.

              <p><br>Hi KendrickkD, I would say I look decent enough, just like any other executives you see on the road. Not on the good looking side. I am a project manager in the engineering industry. We have the same religious belief and yes her parents as well as mine are very religious. Not been to any fortune teller to checked ba zi. Yes I am local. She is 27 and I am 29. We have agreed not to bring up the experiences in our past relatioships so I didn't probe.</p>

              <p>Hmmm I think you can't do much, since you don't even know where the problem is. So it's up to your GF to try and get her parents to cooperate. She has to make it clear that she's already 27 and can decide for herself, I mean legally she does not even need her parents' permission to get married.</p>
              <p>And if her parents cannot give her any reason not be with you, then they're just being unreasonable.</p>

              <p>@Kendrick,</p>
              <p>I meant parents, this guy, this gal, all - i m not making them or anyone ''wrong'' - the tendency is the mind tends to rationalize and delude and justify. As such, the real is missed and hence the agony lah.'It is the misunderstanding , the misinterpreting that is divisive.</p>
              <p>Considering the ages 27 and 29 relatively speaking they are not teenagers who need to toe the lines set by parents, me , you or society. It is the responsiblity that seems lacking, to blame someone or use another as an excuse is a cop out.</p>
              <p>Any parent who means ''well'' for their or .. would allow another to be and respect - mistake or wrong or is always subjective. This is respecting and allow the other or another to grow UP. If not it is simply not helping but conditioning another and worse still - one is unconsciously gravitating towards growing OLD!</p>
              <p>N o one is privy to what are the real motives of such a stance of being protective or otherwise, being self-honest and communicating the fears and what-not might see the light of the day!</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I've been with my current girlfriend for a while now, we are in
              the stage of planning to move on to the next chapter and live our
              lives together. However, I only know recently that her parents
              is forcing her to end our relationships since the 1st day i met
              them as they do not likes me without any particular
              reason. I don't know where went wrong as I've treated her parents
              with the upmost respect when i see them. And for the sake
              of my girlfriend, I've given up the vices that I picked up during
              my younger days (smoking, drinking and clubbing). I also earned a
              decent salary of more then 5k though I'm only in my late
              20s. </p>
              <p>Her parents even went to the extend that if she chose to marry
              me, they would try their best to stand in our way. I've tried to
              find out te reason by trying to invite her parents out
              for dinner her parents, but they do not even want to see
              me. And whenever my girlfriend is out with me, her parents would
              take turns to call her and chide her for being with me. As we
              are from traditional chinese famillies, customary weddings is must
              to my parents. If her parents strongly objects and choses not to
              even meet my parents to discuss the wedding details, I am worried
              that my parents would not approve to this marriage as well. I
              wonder what should I do. Should I just give up on this relationship
              or should I get on with it and put the marriage issues at
              the back of my mind and pray that her parents will mellow
              down one fine day??? </p>

              <p>Some random guesses in the ascending order of dramatization:<br>1. They don't like you because of your past / something you did in the past.<br>2. They don't like your family background.<br>3. There's a deep enmity between your family and her family.<br>4. You and her are blood-related and must not marry each other.</p>
              <p>Seriously, if you want to know the reason, you gotta ask them personally. Go pay a visit to her parents and try to have a good talk with them (but be prepared for the worst).</p>
