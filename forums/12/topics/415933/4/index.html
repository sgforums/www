              <p><br> It is obvious that her parents don't like you, if you didn't make
              any efforts to build any relationships, establish good rapport with
              them, charm/attract them with your personality.</p>
              <p>You only treated them with utmost respect only when you meet
              them, how is that enough for them to approve you as their future
              son-in-law and be convinced that you are the person for their
              beloved daughter if you don't even make efforts to win them
              over?</p>
              <p>I know you have claimed to have done alot of things, give up
              alot of bad habits for your girlfriend, but what have you done for
              the parents of your girlfriend?</p>
              <p>Like I have already mentioned 938476252928494 times that when
              you marry someone you loved, you also marry their family and loved
              ones because a marriage is actually a bonding of two families, not
              just as simple as you think it's the grand affairs between your
              cock and her vagina.</p>
              <p>It's not about how much you are earning and how good you are
              towards your girlfriend that will determine the outcome of your
              application of consent to her parents.</p>
              <p>If you have won over her parents, half of your battle is
              already won because it is easier for your girlfriend to like you if
              her parents loved you. But there is nothing wrong with doing it in
              the difficult but popular self-centred manner such as winning over
              the daughter first then you work on her parents. Maybe you really
              have thought that once your girlfriend have accepted you, her
              parents should have STFU because your love relationship is
              purely between you and your girlfriend. Now you will know that you
              are wrong IF you have really imagined along that line.</p>
              <p>I don't know how you treated towards your own parents, and maybe
              you can share with us about that.</p>
              <p>Maybe you don't understand the value of your own parents, but I
              can tell you the value of your girlfriend's parents is very
              important and equally as important as your own parents. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Win over the parents of your girlfriend and you shall have your
              wedding.</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>Parn has said it all. I also think this is likely where the problem lies. Building r/s with her parents is very impt. It is the BOND thing. You may have the $$$, career, gave up smokin clubbin etc, but thats just not enough. Perhaps they just dun have that kind of trust in you yet.. like not convincing.</p>
              <p>How many times a week did u spend time with her family? How are you like when your with them? How do you behave? What does your gf say throughout all these?</p>

              <p>-then if their reasons are because of misunderstandings, or something you did displeased them, admit your mistakes. or if it's just a misunderstanding, explain to them slowly in details.</p>
