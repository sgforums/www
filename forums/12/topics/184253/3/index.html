Firstly, she had $20 in her wallet and she said she does NOT have ANY money and demanded for it back. And when I asked what about the $20, she said that was for going to NTUC later to buy groceries for the house. And I got this feeling she was lying because she said "Err.." before she said the sentence and gave this "faraway" look. Oh, now I remember. Last month, we went to the arcade together and she said she will pay me back the $30 I spent. STILL DIDN'T. Wtf is this?! Thank you people who reminded me.
