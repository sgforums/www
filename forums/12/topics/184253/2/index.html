Need I say more...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> "<br><br>Like they've said, it's about principles not materialistic.. Perhaps she might just be thinking that you're not having the intention of returning her the $...? And have you even explained to her why are you not returning the $ to her...? Like... Not forgetting that she's actually doing you a favor...? There's an old saying that goes.. "If you borrow and return, it's easier to borrow again... But if you borrow and not return... Face it next time you're in trouble..."<br><br>$10 itself won't necessarily spoil a friendship... It's just how people use it... If you don't wish to return it... Isn't it like your own doings to spoil a friendship..? Any valid reason...?<br><br>And... It's FUNNY that you've even mentioned the $20 in your friend's wallet...<br><br>What has the $ in her wallet got to do with your decision to return her $ back to her...? Even if she have a $100 bucks... Does that mean you would not return what you've borrowed..? If asking back for $ you lent is materialistic, then what does not returning the $ you've borrowed makes you... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>How do you know if she doesn't have other important uses with the $20 in her wallet...?<br><br>Be GLAD that yuo even have a friend like this...

Its not the amount of money that matters, as long as it is borrowed, it should be returned.<br><br>Am the sort who would ask my friend back for 10 cents if he/she borrowed from me, alot of people ask why am i so calculative and stingy, 10 cents also want.<br>But it matters because of principle. I am not stingy, calculative or poor, i am willing to treat my friends to a meal, or buy expensive gifts for them. But i don't expect anything back cos it was meant as a treat or gift.<br><br>Last but not least, i hate people who 'bui zhi dong', ie don't automatically pay back a loan and i have to ask from them instead.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>I hate it even more when they say things like 'huh!? 10 cents u also want?!' This shows that these people don't have principles.<br><br>I once had a good friend who owed me 2 dollars, when he did not return me, i broke off our 6 year friendship.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>I already TOLD her that I give her back in a week times.

            <div class='col-md body'>I usually borrow money to friends but seldom ask them pay back...even now, I have a friend who owes me from 8years ago, but I didnt ask for it back. I guess my generosity makes me being taken advantage of. Sometimes I know they cant pay it back yet I still borrow it to them. Am I stupid or what for doing it?..I do not know.. But what I know is they need the money more than me and if money can help them ease their situations abit, then let it be~</div>
