            <div class='col-md body'>LOL alot of grey areas. Can't offer any concrete rules. However I think some things are true for everyone guy or girl<br><br>1.  Your partner cannot fulfill your every need. Most your needs yes, but not all.<br><br>2.  Life is more than just a relationship, you need to have your own interests and friends<br><br>and lastly<br><br>3. People are innately selfish.  You want to enjoy lax rules, but it's difficult to accept your partner doing the same LOL</div>
