              <p>I am very unlucky dude. Each time I fall in love, the girl is actually in love with another person. Why? Why?</p>
              <p>It all started when I was sent abroad to study in UK. I fell in love with Samantha. I stayed in the boarding house with Samantha, George, Lam and Sarash. Me and Samantha always do project together, I sometimes will walk Samantha home from classes. Then one day, i fell sick, Samantha decided to take care of me, boil porridge for me. Another day, when I felt unprepared and fear that I was going to fail my exam, Samantha helped me by sitting next to me during exam and exposing her answer sheet so that I can copy her results. I fell in love with Samantha, so I confess my feelings to her. But she wanted us to be friends. She began to spend more time with George. Having group study in his room until she fell asleep in her bed. I felt so hurt, I wanted to confront George but Lam told me that by then, George and Samantha are already a couple.</p>
              <p>Years later, I came out to work. I began doing assignments with Amanda. The manager always assign us together, so I would drive her to the client's place and sometimes I took her back home. I began to admire Amanda's hard work ethic and our relationship grew closer as we began to work more closely and more often have office lunch and later night one to one supper together. Then I began to pursue Amanda. But it was this moment that Amanda began to stay away from me. Then the manager assign me to another team. Months later, I heard that a guy name Kee Ann was doing the same assignm,ent with Amanda, successfully pursue her and she became his girlfriend. MY heart is broken again.</p>
              <p>Years later, I went out with a group of friends and within this circle of friends, met Cindy. Whenever we group of friends go out together, me and Cindy would joke a lot and laugh very loud. Cindy sometimes don't want to eat so much, she would give me her bowl of noodles or food to eat. Then sometimes, we joke a lot on the facebook. It was then I began to have feelings for her. There is this other guy, Norman who also seem to like Cindy. One day after finishing watching movie, I decided to go home like the rest of our friends. Then Cindy excuse herself to the washroom. I notice Norman still hanging around. I ask him what is he doing? He told me that he was waiting for his dad to drive over to pick him up. Apparently it sounded like an excuse. Then months later, Norman and Cindy are a couple. Again, I missed out, my heart is broken again.</p>
              <p>Then now there is this girl, Sandy. We got close and there is this other guy, David. After we group of friends hung out at a shopping mall, I notice Sandy and David stayed back, while the rest of us left.</p>
              <p>Should I approach Sandy? Or am I going to be missed out again? Why am I so unlucky in love? Why all the girls I like always get stolen by other guys?</p>

              <p>You are not unlucky in love.</p>
              <p>1. You only have wishful thinking that you have a chance with a girl, when you are wrong. You should be more observant of the girl you are hopeful about. So that you won't target a girl that is already attached.</p>
              <p>2. In all the cases, you mentioned, you did not pursue the girl, they came to you or were placed infront of you, and you started getting excited. The girls were sociable, and you mistook that as your chance. You must take the initiative, start by helping the girls, just like they help you. They must see you got something that they admire, at present you are just like a helpless boy, and they are compassionate to you.</p>
              <p>Wishing for girls is like wishing to strike the lottery, they'll never happen and you'll wonder why you are so unlucky.</p>

              <p>I am very unlucky dude. Each time I fall in love, the girl is actually in love with another person. Why? Why?</p>
              <p>It all started when I was sent abroad to study in UK. I fell in love with Samantha. I stayed in the boarding house with Samantha, George, Lam and Sarash. Me and Samantha always do project together, I sometimes will walk Samantha home from classes. Then one day, i fell sick, Samantha decided to take care of me, boil porridge for me. Another day, when I felt unprepared and fear that I was going to fail my exam, Samantha helped me by sitting next to me during exam and exposing her answer sheet so that I can copy her results. I fell in love with Samantha, so I confess my feelings to her. But she wanted us to be friends. She began to spend more time with George. Having group study in his room until she fell asleep in her bed. I felt so hurt, I wanted to confront George but Lam told me that by then, George and Samantha are already a couple.</p>
              <p>Years later, I came out to work. I began doing assignments with Amanda. The manager always assign us together, so I would drive her to the client's place and sometimes I took her back home. I began to admire Amanda's hard work ethic and our relationship grew closer as we began to work more closely and more often have office lunch and later night one to one supper together. Then I began to pursue Amanda. But it was this moment that Amanda began to stay away from me. Then the manager assign me to another team. Months later, I heard that a guy name Kee Ann was doing the same assignm,ent with Amanda, successfully pursue her and she became his girlfriend. MY heart is broken again.</p>
              <p>Years later, I went out with a group of friends and within this circle of friends, met Cindy. Whenever we group of friends go out together, me and Cindy would joke a lot and laugh very loud. Cindy sometimes don't want to eat so much, she would give me her bowl of noodles or food to eat. Then sometimes, we joke a lot on the facebook. It was then I began to have feelings for her. There is this other guy, Norman who also seem to like Cindy. One day after finishing watching movie, I decided to go home like the rest of our friends. Then Cindy excuse herself to the washroom. I notice Norman still hanging around. I ask him what is he doing? He told me that he was waiting for his dad to drive over to pick him up. Apparently it sounded like an excuse. Then months later, Norman and Cindy are a couple. Again, I missed out, my heart is broken again.</p>
              <p>Then now there is this girl, Sandy. We got close and there is this other guy, David. After we group of friends hung out at a shopping mall, I notice Sandy and David stayed back, while the rest of us left.</p>
              <p>Should I approach Sandy? Or am I going to be missed out again? Why am I so unlucky in love? Why all the girls I like always get stolen by other guys?</p>
