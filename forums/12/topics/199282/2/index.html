The WHO part is the difficult one. The fellow don't gel, then you will end up having to deal with the sitation and the fellow also suffer. To fire the person also takes a lot of effort and high turn over is never a good sign. So you have to decide if hiring the person, the person need to have a good fit into the company and there will be at least some challenging work for the fellow to do and grow. You also have to plan some path for him. Be objective, clear and hire the person for the right job and the right fit and the right reasons.<br><br>I had not met a good manager who did the above for any employee including myself. Most local managers are really sh!tty and racist. My own ex-team-lead refused to hire a Malay colleague cause she is a Malay even though I told her the Malay is good. But she had hired another person who is naive to become her stepping stone up the ladder. Anyways, it turned out better cause everyone got re-orged badly and the ex-teamleader b!tch got brought down to my level. She was never leadership or manager material but she can act and manipulate and she's got looks that the guys just give way. Stupidity in humans knows no bounds.<br></div>

You would be building good karma (i.e. will be blessed) if you let people have to chance to work and earn a living<br>3).
