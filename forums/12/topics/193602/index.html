            <div class='col-md body'>Actually it's both parties at fault. They only see what's in front of them, sg girl see sg guy and sg guy see sg girl.

Well, to all here...since it seems like the norm that is happening around us...so might as well accept the fate since it's the easiest way out for all and get hitched, married, reproduced, and live the safe and normal life like everyone else and trying very hard not to avoid thinking of regret since everyone else is doing the same thing as you, it's very comforting to know. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Whenever a guy/girl complained to me about the other guy/girl, I always have this truth that I really wish to share with them...provided they are open enough to handle the truth. Ask yourself, since you all wanted the other half (guys/girls) to be almost perfect+obedient+absolutely gorgeous/cool+witty+humourous+ETC...are you also on-par with those qualities that you've wished? When you are unable to attract/find the other half, it's never their fault. You are just not good enough to have one.<br><br>Remember...whenever you failed to achieve something that you've wanted, it's never anyone's fault but your own fault. Whining and complaining does helps a bit if they can awake you after that, otherwise...you are still back to your same old self and be a regular patron here posting about your repeated loops.<br><br>So when is the loop going to end?
