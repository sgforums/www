            <div class='col-md body'>pringles, I am in a slightly different situation from you but I think the choice we have to make is almost the same...I used to think that as long as I wait for her...it will prove that I do love her a lot...but I realised that not letting go is immatured...for now, I truly believe that if you love her...you should learn to give her up...I don't know how old you are...but maybe you're still too young to realise that letting go of someone you really love is the ultimate way of letting her know that you do love her...Trust me on this...<br><br>Anyway, the choice is in your hands...you can do whatever your heart tells you too...I made my decision already...and I have decided to let her go...and I feel so much better now...so I hope you can find a good solution to yours too..<br><br>That's just my 2 cents.<br><br>Ciaoz for now.</div>

I doubt so, she said she just want to be friends. Atleast you're still friends with her, that means you still have a chance. Please do not pester her with gifts and romantic words like guys in the movies do, this is the real world and such things don't work in the early stages of dating. Be a man, and don't give power to a women by telling her she's a superior creature just because you like her alot. Don't look like you're desperate! Be a MAN.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>&gt; &gt;Tree<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;===<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;The reason I'm called tree is because I'm good at<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;painting trees.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;Overtime I start to use a tree on the right hand<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;corner as a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;trademark for all my watercolors painting. I have<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;dated 5 gals when<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;I was in Pre-U. There's one gal who I love a lot but<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;never dare go<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;after her. She doesn't have a pretty face, doesn't<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;have a good<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;figure, doesn't have outstanding charm. She is just a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;very ordinary<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;gal.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;I like her. I really like her. Like her innocent,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;like her<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;frankness. Like her cuteness, like her intelligence<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;and her<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;fragility. Reason for not going after her is because<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;I felt<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;somebody so ordinary like her is not a good match for<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;me. I'm also<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;afraid that after we are together all the good<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;feelings will<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;vanish. I'm also afraid other's gossips will hurt<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;her. I felt that<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;if she's my gal, she will be mine ultimately &amp; I don't<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;have to give<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;up everything just for her. The last reason, made her<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;accompany me<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;for 3 years. She watch me chase after gals, and I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;have make her<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;heart cry for 3 years.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;She wants to be a good actress and I'm a very<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;demanding director.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;When I kissed my 2nd girlfriend, she bumped into us.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;She was<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;embarrassed but smile &amp; say "Go on!" before running<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;off. The next<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;day, her eyes was swollen like a walnut. I purposely<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;didn't want to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;think about what causes her to cry but laugh at her<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;the whole day.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;When everybody go back home, she was alone crying in<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;the classroom.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;She didn't know that I returned from soccer training<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;to get<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;something. I watch her cry for an hour or so.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;My 4th girlfriend didn't like her. There was once<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;when both of them<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;quarreled. I know that based on her character she's<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;not the type<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;that will start off the quarrel. But I still sided<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;with my<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;girlfriend. I shouted at her and her eyes was filled<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;shocked. I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;didn't care about her feelings and walked off with my<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;girlfriend.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;The next day, she still laugh &amp; joke with me like<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;nothing has ever<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;happened. I know that she's very hurt but she didn't<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;know that my<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;heart ache is as bad as hers.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;When I broke up with my 5th girlfriend, I asked her<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;out. After<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;going out for a day, I told her that I have something<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;to tell her.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;She told me that coincidentally, she has something to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;tell me too.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;I told her about my break up and she told me about her<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;getting<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;together. I know whose the guy. He has been going<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;after her for<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;quite a while. A very cute guy full of energy, lively<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;and<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;interesting. His pursuit for her has been the talk of<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;the school.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;I can't show her my heart ache but could only smile &amp;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;congratulate<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;her. When I reach home, the heart ache is so strong<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;that I can't<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;stand it. It's like a heavy weighted stone on my<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;chest. I couldn't<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;breath. Wanted to shout but can't. Tears rolled down<br>&gt;&amp; I broke<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;down &amp; cry. How many times have I seen her cry for<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;the man that<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;doesn't acknowledge her presence too.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;During graduation, I read a sms in my hp. It was send<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;10 days ago<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;when I broke down and cry. I haven't read it since<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;then. It<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;says "Leaf departure is because of Wind pursuit. Or<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;because Tree<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;didn't ask her to stay"<br><br>&gt; &gt; &gt;Leaf<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;===<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;During Pre-U days, I like to collect leaves. Why?<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;Because I felt<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;that for a leaf to leave the tree she has been relying<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;on for so<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;long it takes a lot of courage. During the 3 years of<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;Pre-U I was<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;on very close terms with a guy. Not BGR kind but as<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;buddy kind.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;But when he had his 1st girlfriend, I learnt a feeling<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;I never<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;should have learnt - Jealousy. The sourness in the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;heart can't be<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;describe by using a lemon. It's like 100 rotten sour<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;lemon.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;Sourness to the extreme limit. They were only<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;together for 2 mths.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;When they broke up, I hide my strong sense of<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;happiness. But after<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;a mth, he got together with another gal.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;I like him &amp; I know he like me. But why won't he<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;pursue me? Since<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;he love me why he doesn't want to make the first move?<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; Whenever he<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;had a new girlfriend, my heart would hurt. Time after<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;time, my<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;heart was hurt. I begin to suspect that this is a one<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;sided love.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;If he don't like he, why does he treat me so well.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;It's beyond what<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;you will normally do for a friend. Liking a person is<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;very heart<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;wrenching. I can know his likes, his habits. But his<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;feelings<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;towards me I can never figure out. You can't expect<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;me a gal to ask<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;him right?<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;Despite that, I still want to be by his side. Care<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;for him,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;accompany him, love him. Hoping that one fine day, he<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;will come &amp;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;love me. It's like waiting for his phone call every<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;night, wanting<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;him to send me sms. I know that no matter how busy he<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;is, he will<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;make time for me. Because of this, I waited for him.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;The 3 years<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;were the hardest to go through &amp; I really want to give<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;up.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;Sometimes, I wonder should I continue waiting. The<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;pain and hurt,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;the dilemma accompany me for 3 years.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;Till the end of my 3rd year, a 2nd year junior begins<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;to go after<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;me. Everyday he pursuit me relentlessly. From<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;outright rejection<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;to a point in time when I felt that I'm willing to let<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;him have a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;small footing in my heart. He's like a warm &amp; gentle<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;wind, trying<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;to blow a leaf away from the tree. In the end, I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;realized that I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;didn't want to give this wind a small footing in my<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;heart. I know<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;this wind will bring this badly battered leave far<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;away &amp; better<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;land. Finally I left tree, but the tree only smile &amp;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;didn't ask me<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;to stay. Leaf departure is because of Wind pursuit.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;Or because Tree<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;didn't ask her to stay<br><br>&gt; &gt; &gt;Wind<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;====<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;Because I like a gal called<br>leaf. Because she's so<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;dependent on<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;tree so I have to be a gust wind. A wind that will<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;blow her away.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;When I first met her, it was 1 mth after I transfer to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;the new<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;school. I saw a petite person looking at my seniors &amp;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;me playing<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;soccer. During ECA time, she will always be sitting<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;there. Be it<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;alone or with her friends looking at him. When he<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;talks with gals<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;there's jealousy in her eyes. When he looked at her,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;there's a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;smile in her eyes. Looking at her became my habit.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;Just like she<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;likes to look at him.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;One day, she didn't appear. I felt something amissed.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; I can't<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;explain the feeling except it's a kind of uneasiness.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;The senior<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;was also not there as well. I went to their<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;classroom, hid outside<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;and saw my senior scolding her. Tears were in her<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;eyes while he<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;left. The next day, I saw her at her usual place,<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;looking at him.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;I walked over and smiled to her. Took out a note &amp;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;gave to her.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;She was surprised. She looked at me, smiled &amp; accept<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;the note. The<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;next day, she appeared &amp; pass me a note and left.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;Leaf's heart is too heavy and wind couldn't blow her<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;away<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;It's not that leaf heart is too heavy. It because<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;leaf never want<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;to leave tree<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;I replied her note with this statement and slowly she<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;started to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;talk to me &amp; accept my presents &amp; phone calls. I know<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;that the<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;person she loves is not me. But I have this<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;perseverance that one<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;day I will make her like me. Within 4 mths, I have<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;declared my love<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;for her no less than 20 times. Every time, she will<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;divert away<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;from the topic. But I never give up. If I decide I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;want her to be<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;mine, I will definitely use all means to win her over.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt; I can't<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;remember how many times I have declared my love to<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;her. Although I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;know she will try to divert but I still bear a small<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;ray of hope.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;Hoping that she will agree to me my girlfriend. I<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;didn't hear any<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;reply from her over the phone. I asked "what are you<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;doing? How<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;come you didn't want to reply?" She said, "I'm<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;nodding my<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;head". "Ah?" I couldn't believe my ears. "I'm<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;nodding my head"<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;She replied loudly. I hang up the phone, quickly<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;changed and took a<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;taxi and rush to her place &amp; press her door bell.<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;During the moment<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;when she opens the door. I hugged her tightly. Leaf<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;departure is<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;because of Wind pursuit. Or because Tree didn't ask<br>&gt; &gt; &gt;her to stay</div>

I doubt so, she said she just want to be friends. Atleast you're still friends with her, that means you still have a chance. Please do not pester her with gifts and romantic words like guys in the movies do, this is the real world and such things don't work in the early stages of dating. Be a man, and don't give power to a women by telling her she's a superior creature just because you like her alot. Don't look like you're desperate! Be a MAN.</div></blockquote>I really like ur one sentence: Dun be a wuss! =) Suits pringles well..</div>
