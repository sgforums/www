Though hard to part with that feeling its possible. Or take Dolphin's advice instead? Just let nature take its course...?I didn't advise on that because I've sense you probably won't quite know exactly what it means...<br><br>Anyway, it's YOUR LIFE...? ~good luck...?  </div></blockquote>to me letting nature take its own course is like giving up already... to me it is like now u wanna eat smthing... chocolate etc.. if u let nature take its own course, u will b like waiting for people to buy them for u?eg: your mum suddenly buy them back?

DID U SAY "I love you?" What did she say?<br>- how was her behavior when she said tt?<br>- the exact words? be it a letter or from e mouth?<br>- how long has it been? and how long you knew her?<br><br>- and finally i STRONGLY advise u do it after her exams and let it not affect ur studies/work/future<br><br>if she is really worth your time... which i feel since she's treating u so well... persevere<br>your sincerity will touch her...<br><br>because that shows the true side of love. giving without receiving.</div>
