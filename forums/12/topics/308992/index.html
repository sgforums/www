              <p>must go for a r/s one meh? after break off cannot be alone for a yr or 2 of even 5?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>most breakups end up with more breakups coz people tend to just go for anyone that is available during times of distress just to fill the void. after weeks or months the same thing will happen again coz the new partner was chose in the height of desperation.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>after u break up...settle down for a while.</p>

              <p>I always like to ask questions.</p>
              <p>Coz I realised that advises from the agonies are usually not taken. Only through their own confession that they truly realised and admit.</p>
              <p>You hate him for having someone else so why do you still love him?<br>Also, has he been very loving towards you (bedside talk not counted).</p>
              <p>Maybe you are only attacted to a personality (minus the ECA).</p>
