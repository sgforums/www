Time to rough it out on your own. Otherwise, people may label you as the slut who is trying to break up a 'perfectly normal' relationship.<br><br>Pardon my language, but I seriously think that guy is a b*st*rd.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My only suggestion is to find a better guy than that. It doesn't mean that you will live a miserable life if you part ways with him just because you have been spending a lot of time with him. You'd be surprised to know that there are a lot more friends or guys out there who can spend far more valuable time with you. Try to widen your social circle like some people have already mentioned. You sound like someone who does not have clear life goals. That's why you place so much importance on this.</div>

I too met many situations when I felt useless &amp; weak. I do not understand your situation fully but I can more or less emphatize with you in a sense.<br><br>It is good you want to talk it out. Maybe someday you will find your friends to talk more about it? I believe you would have wanted that. I know I would.</div>
