            <div class='col-md body'>This is really a profound question on your ability to get hitched in a healthy, romantic relationship.<br><br>First thing first. What is the level of relationship you are talking about? Most teenagers today are confused on the level of relationship they have with the opposite sex depending on the scenario they are in. One scenario would be love at first sight. Another would be childhood friend or through befriending in a social setting. It makes difference in the process of a relationship.<br><br>Next, your ex alleges that she left you due to your immaturity. How about this then: older women, especially celebrities, go after younger men? Duh. What is your ex thinking? More like she is the one who is immature. However, there must be a reason if every ex told you the same thing and this requires you to assess your goodself. Ask this question: Who am I?<br><br>Having more than one ex has its own implication. Just like there is yin and yang, black and white, good and bad.... Some may perceive you as playboy, some may perceive you as not-the-husband material. As rightly pointed out, not everyone could not find Mr or Ms Right on the first try.<br><br>My conclusion is that both of you have a conflicting expectation of what is an ideal couple. A relationship is in a fact a delicate process that many do not pay attention to small details. Better focus on the education first if you are under 21 years old.<br><br></div>
