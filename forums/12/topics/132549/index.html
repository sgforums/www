Everybody is trying their best to tell you Not to give up, &amp; what do you do?  You say that this has been going on constantly.  So?  You want it to continue?  What steps are you taking to improve?  I don't see you taking any steps.  How can anyone help you, when you don't even seem motivated to help yourself, &amp; all you seem to want is sympathy?<br><br>I'm a girl, &amp; I've been through many failures.  Many people in forums know my story.<br><br>1.  You failed 1 module?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  I failed an entire semester.

I don't have hordes &amp; hordes of "hi-bye" friends, but I have a few whom I know I need to make just 1 phonecall &amp; they'll help me.<br>5.  You failed to get what you want.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">   Oh boy, am I supposed to feel sorry for you?  I want to be able to buy myself a whole cupboard of Fendi bags, Prada shoes &amp; MiuMiu clothes.  I want to be able to buy myself hordes of jewellery.  But up till now, I can't.  SO?<br><br>Sorry if I sound harsh, but I'm a girl, &amp; I don't bleat like a permanently wounded lamb.  At most I just turn to my guy &amp; cry for 1 day.

But I'm going to take 1 soon because it'll help my career.<br>4.  You failed to help your friend?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  I've failed to help many of my friends.  So?  I don't have hordes &amp; hordes of "hi-bye" friends, but I have a few whom I know I need to make just 1 phonecall &amp; they'll help me.<br>5.  You failed to get what you want.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">   Oh boy, am I supposed to feel sorry for you?  I want to be able to buy myself a whole cupboard of Fendi bags, Prada shoes &amp; MiuMiu clothes.  I want to be able to buy myself hordes of jewellery.  But up till now, I can't.  SO?<br><br>Sorry if I sound harsh, but I'm a girl, &amp; I don't bleat like a permanently wounded lamb.  At most I just turn to my guy &amp; cry for 1 day.  The next day, I go back &amp; face whatever troubles I have, &amp; try to overcome them.  If I can be strong enough, then why can't you?<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br></div></blockquote>i like you.<br><br></div>
