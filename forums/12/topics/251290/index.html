            <div class='col-md body'>Why r u so tensed to get this? Popping pills will only be a short term solution. I suggest you try to get some fresh air and exercise. Meditation can be beneficial. It's not difficult to do and you dun have to do it very long to get the bebefits of relaxing your mind............ Drink lots of water too!

The simplest form of yoga is deep breathing. Inhale in deeply and push it all the way down to your stomach before exhaling slowly. Practise this breathing exercise daily and your headache will disappear in no time. Good luck  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
