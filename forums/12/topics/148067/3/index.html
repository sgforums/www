True enough, he didnt login but who knows, few days back, I happened to look into his hp. He had created another account, using other name. I was so heart-pain. I dun understand y he did tat.<br><br>He had treated me rather cold recently. Imagine, we were shopping at NTUC, he could walked in front &amp; I walked behind. Kaozzz....<br><br>Yesterday, I went in &amp; created an account. I duno if I m luckily or wat, he came &amp; msg "me". I juz played along wif him. See if he would take the initative to ask "me" out lor.<br><br>I just dun understand y he did tat. Is it really tat fun 2 know gals online?<br>Everyday, i had been waiting to see if he did msg "me".<br><br>Frankly speaking, I doubt theres any point of confronting him again lor. I had already gave him one chance previously but now, wat had he done again? Sometimes, I think: M I too sensitive or m I really taking things too hard?

There's just no trust within this relationship of yours at this moment.. But of course, whether he's really trust-worthy or not is more for your own determination...?<br><br>Since you've got so many doubts... What do you intend to do about it...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Heard this year plenty of "tao hua" in r/s.<br><br>So when a r/s makes you feel troubled and not secure, ask yourself what wrong has he done to you and the r/s. if it's a character problem (no respect, no integrity, lie, evasive), he will still commit it again when he's got the chance<br>and character is something hard to change.<br><br>I know when my sis have this type of bf, she'll tell him to go ahead and chat with the girls as many as he likes. Her real meaning starts to sink in only when he couldn't reach and find her. She'll essentially leave her "trouble" behind and moved on ready for someone better to come along. Cruel you may say but she never takes r/s with any man lightly and for fun. When she meets a man like that, she stays "far away" from him.  The guy blames her? He's only got himself to blame.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br></div>

Why?? Cause I feel that what she is doing is actually protecting herself..<br><br>She has given that trust to her bf.. when she confronted him the first time.. But the guy has done it again.. Which made her do things this way..<br><br>I do agree with you on the fact that this is a deep scar that will be left in you for the time being.. But don let the scar affect you in future relationships as it won't do you good and will not be fair to your new partner.<br><br>Start afresh. There is always a down most time in a relationship..
