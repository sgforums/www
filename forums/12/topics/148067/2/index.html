I know we gals like to settle things ASAP. hence we tryto talk to our bfs while we are fired up. and since we are fired up, we naturally take on the offensive role... or our fingers will be pointing at him...  Most guys, get all defensive and will lie or attack back....<br><br>that's why before you talk to him think of what to say, calm down. try to explain to him why is it affecting you. but stay in control of your emotions.

            <div class='col-md body'>Good evening everyone<br><br>Few weeks ago, I had confronted him straight. He said he onli knew gals for fun &amp; didnt meet any of those gals online. The messages were all cut &amp; paste.He consoled me, saying tat I need not be so worried as in future as he wont login anymore. True enough, he didnt login but who knows, few days back, I happened to look into his hp. He had created another account, using other name. I was so heart-pain. I dun understand y he did tat.<br><br>He had treated me rather cold recently. Imagine, we were shopping at NTUC, he could walked in front &amp; I walked behind. Kaozzz....<br><br>Yesterday, I went in &amp; created an account. I duno if I m luckily or wat, he came &amp; msg "me". I juz played along wif him. See if he would take the initative to ask "me" out lor.<br><br>I just dun understand y he did tat. Is it really tat fun 2 know gals online?<br>Everyday, i had been waiting to see if he did msg "me".<br><br>Frankly speaking, I doubt theres any point of confronting him again lor. I had already gave him one chance previously but now, wat had he done again? Sometimes, I think: M I too sensitive or m I really taking things too hard? Shall I let things take its nature course and wait for him 2 break off with me?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br></div>
