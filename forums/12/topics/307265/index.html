              <div class="quote_body">Few months back, I developed a fondness for someone I shldnt have. Before she is already happily attached. Its been few mths since I started to have feelings for her. i didnt tell her in the begining its because of my inferiority complex. Her boyfriend is my good friend.<br><br>Its been a very long time since I had those feelings. Is it love or is it just infatuation? Or isit just that I need someone to hug me and put her arms arnd my neck and whispered 'I love u' in my ear to make me feel loved.make me feel wanted?? Am I really ready for a relationship with her?? I myself donÂ’t even know the answer to these qns.<br><br>I love her for who she is, not wad she can give me. I donÂ’t care bout her past. When I look in her glistening eyes, i can see a tint of sadness among the happiness in her beyond the happiness is a little girl lost and suffering the constant torture of trying to balance bf, studies and parents itÂ’s a very important year for her this yr. I love her bright and cheerful character. I think of her everyday. I would be happy even if she just called or msg me. But I am very afraid to make my feelings known to her, cause my past experiences keep haunting me the fear and the agony of rejection again is really to much for me to take furthermore my already plummeting confidence in myself keeps hindering me. Many people like her, I donÂ’t think I will even stand a chance if i confess to her, yea who would like to be seen with a fat and ugly bf<br><br>I am at a loss.</div>

              <p>The story continues...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She has just broken up with her boyfriend weeks ago. Its been more than a year and i still like her alot. I am confident its not a crush or an infatuation. We have become very close aft they broke up. I decided to bring her out with one of my friends and let her have fun and cheer her up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But then overtime and after few outings, he confessed to her that he likes her and she too feels the same. The feelings are mutual. The reason she haven got together with him is that, she feels that she is treating him as a substitute and she still love her ex.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You people may think im stupid and did not strike and confess to her straightaway. It is because she was very depressed and i dont wanna scare her off. I also dont wanna pressure her and therefore tried to give her some time to get over. Another reason is that i dun wanna lose her as a very close friend. I really dont want to.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But looks like i was wrong. Am i wrong for giving her time to settle down? I am now at a loss. If i tell her now and confess, is it too late? Shld i just forget her and cut contact? I dont knw wad to do now. Haiz.</p>

              <p>This is the classic case of '<span>å·¦å�³ç‚ºé›£'. Either you lose the love, or you lose the friendship.</span></p>

              If you really value the friendship, walk away from her, cut off all contact for 6 mths at least. At least you still can resume your friendship with her 6 mths later after all the dust settle.
              
              If you reveal your feelings now, and it turns out she don't like you, then habis lor, friends also cannot be liao..
              
              so, u gotta decide now, friendship better, or try to be bf/gf better. However since your friend already confess 1st liao, if you step in now, will be like horizontal knife stealing love.

              <p>Nobu,</p>
              <p>How well can you handle rejection ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It seems you are afraid of losing the friendship if the confession fails.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When it comes to keeping the friendship part. It really depends on how you handle yourself in the aftermath.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have rejected many guys who are my in my circle of friends before.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Some are still friends. Some dissapeared into thin air.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The ones who remains friends are the ones who can get over the rejection.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The ones who dissapear, are those who became awkward around me, and eventually shun any gatherings I attend.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Rejecting a guy, is something we girls need to do rather often.</p>
              <p>So we do get used to it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So Nobu, you can keep wondering, if you can't handle it well, I suggest you don't even try.</p>

              <p>I knw. But i feel so like sort of envious or jealous of the guy as she keeps on tell me abt him. Like how cute is he, how sweet is he. Its wrong for me to think that way. I am having mixed feelings, sad and angry and happy. I think i will just have to wait patiently for it. I waited 1 yr. Wads another few months?</p>
