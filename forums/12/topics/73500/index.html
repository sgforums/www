My mother just cant understand the simple concepts of how a computer works. Every little thing shes calls out for help - even to turn off the computer!!!<br><br>she tells me " you must show me how to fix the problem  so  i can do it next time"...  well, for me to show her how to fix it, i have to solve it myself then show her.<br><br>Alot of the time it is very basic things which anyone with common sense can solve. Then i get scolded because i say anyone can solve it if they just try and think about it, and then next time comes around and she forgets and asks me to show her again!!!!!<br><br>not easy...  i guess just have to be patient, like they were when we  they were teaching me to speak, read and write....<br></div>
