The first love always indeed has great emotional and great significant meaning to someone, perhaps thorugh his ex that he has learnt how to be a better person and how to love you properly, imagine that you 're the gf before his ex, do you think your bf will be mature enough to know how to treat you well? Do you think you will be able to last?<br><br>Perhaps you might be pissed by how immature he is and how badly he treats you. Why not share those memories and lessons in life he has learnt so that you too can improve your relationship with him, instead of getting jealous of who occupies his mind? Love also needs a listening ear, you cannot always expect a guy always to listen to a girl's problem, and shut off when the guy pour out his supplications on her. Guys can be emotional and cry over things too, if you are not going to be his pillar of support then who is?<br><br>Give it some thoughts.</div>

How else would a guy expect the galfriend feel or think when he keeps telling her wat crazy and unbelievable things he had done for his ex?</div></blockquote>I don't think you are oversensitive.  On the other hand, your bf is being insensitive toward your feeling and I could categorised him as being selfish.  I think he has not gotten over his ex yet and probably he is in the rebounding period right now.  Maybe you want to put on hold of your relationship with him for now and just be his friend until he is get over his ex.  It will be healthier that way.</div>
