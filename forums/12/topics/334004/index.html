              it will be perfectly fine to leave her at home. just make sure you feed her before u leave the house, then keep some dry food in the bowl just in case shes hungry.
              
              more newspaper will solve the problem. it will just take abit more time to clear up when u get home. but i think its worth it. im sure she doesnt want to leave you too. :D
