Then, I noticed a letter nesting beneath the hamper and painstakingly, I positioned myself in a way I could reach for it. It turned out to be a deathly feat; I absolutely had neither strength nor the ability move and somehow when I sat myself up, an insane pain that caused me to squniched in agony indefinitely.<br><br>Â‘Hey! DonÂ’t do that! ItÂ’s very dangerous! Next time please call me or other missy to help you!Â’<br><br>It was Angeline. I was so absorbed in testing out my current physical condition that I didnÂ’t know she had arrived for work.<br><br>Â‘Hey Cloud! We came yesterday, but you were sleepingÂ… didnÂ’t want to disturb you, so we wrote this letter just to tell you that we came. Take care dude! Must recover fast ok? =)Â’<br><br>Seriously, those warming words felt wholesome.<br><br>The effect of anesthesia gradually abated and somehow, I felt like puking. I donÂ’t know if it was the Â‘normÂ’, but it felt uneasy and nauseating - closed to having a hangover. At the same time, I felt ubiquitous bodily pain, especially where the tubes were inserted. I finally understood how it felt to be bedridden and sickly and how, especially those sick aged, felt when they become an emotional and financial burden to people who cared for them.<br><br>Â‘Well, at least I lived through and will recoverÂ…Â’<br><br>As I was dwelling in my train of thoughts, student nurses started streaming in; doing their routine checks. And I saw my Â‘nurse-in chargeÂ’ Angeline Â– her lips shaped a smile, before moving towards my direction.<br><br>Â‘How are you feeling today?Â’<br><br>Â‘Not so good, but still manageableÂ…Â’<br><br>We chatted causally as Angeline proceeded with taking my temperature, checking my blood pressure and pulse rate. Satisfied with her findings, she drew out her pen and recorded the results.<br><br>Â‘Your BP a bit higher than normÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Huh? Really?Â’<br><br>Â‘DonÂ’t worry! Not a problem actually. A little bit onlyÂ… and ahÂ… yesterday, your family and friends got visit youÂ… you know?Â’<br><br>I nodded my head.<br><br>Â‘All these hampers and cards are gifts from them... so goodÂ… I also wantÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘You want the giftÂ… but I think you donÂ’t want to be lying hereÂ…Â’<br><br>As a natural response, we laughed and immediately, I felt a vicious jerk-pain in the left flank region where I was operated. What? I couldnÂ’t even laugh?<br><br>Â‘Hey!Â’ admonished Angeline, Â‘you had just finished your operation. DonÂ’t laugh! Hold your wounds when you laugh or cough. Ok, talk to you laterÂ…Â’<br><br>Finishing the conversation, I closed my eyes and descended into another deep sleep. Seriously, there was nothing I could do except to sleep. Furthermore, at the weakest state of health, my body needed the rest to rejuvenate itself and accelerate healing. I was only awakened at intervals when the nurses have to take my temperature, blood pressure and pulse rate (standard procedure). Usually it was Angeline who attended to me, but when she was busy, then someone else would.<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

I couldnÂ’t consume solid food, so my lunch consisted of soup, jelly and apple juice. My jaws dropped when I was told that it will be the same until I get better. Though fortunately, I had no appetite to begin with, but it wasnÂ’t my kind of idea of filling the stomach.<br><br>Â‘Why donÂ’t want already? Must eatÂ… then will recover fastÂ…Â’<br><br>I actually had to be coaxed by Angeline to take my lunch. Somehow, the food just repulsed me and after about six spoon of soup, I gave up. I donÂ’t know why, but it seemed that energies in my body were unstable; I just felt I needed to sleep through until I get better. Then I got frustrated with myself, on why I was born with such kidney defects and poor health.<br><br>My mood became that of a cranky old man - depression is definitely easy target for the sick. If it wasnÂ’t because of AngelineÂ’s euphoric deposition, hospital is surely a gloomy atmosphere. Every hourly check, her action and words seemed so gentle and delicate that it wouldnÂ’t surprise me if she sets other male patientsÂ’ hormones raging, especially those with nurse-fetish like Johnny. Haha! (To be frank, I was too indulged in pain to be thinking along that line).<br><br>Â‘Hey! I will be going off! See you tomorrow! And hor, donÂ’t do silly thingsÂ…. Call the other nurse ah! DonÂ’t naughtyÂ… donÂ’t want anything to happen to youÂ…Â’<br><br>Time sped through quickly; it was three OÂ’clock - the time when the next shift of internship students will take over the morning shift.

You see, since I cannot get around, my only solution is to pee in a canÂ… ever since I requested them to remove the accursed bladder tube. And talking about bladder tube; that was the closest thing to hell anyone could endureÂ… only applicable to guys.<br><br>The pain delivered from an external tube attached to a manÂ’s vital organ screamed an unspeakable, excruciating suffering that only those who have been through would sympathize. No words could describe my ordeal. I have never felt so much pain before.<br><br>For some reason, the Filipino nurse unlatched my bedÂ’s safety bar, thinking I wanted to go to the gents.<br><br>Gawd! I canÂ’t even get upÂ… let alone having to walk myself to the gents. Literally after rolling my eyes, I told her I needed a pee can instead. Looking slightly annoyed, she returned with what I wanted and left in a huff.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â‘So much for foreign Â‘talentsÂ’Â…Â’ </span><br><br>I finished my personal business and returned her the can (containing generous amount of my waste), before settling myself for another bout of sleep. And yes, she has apparently forgotten to latch the safety mechanism back into position, but I couldnÂ’t care less as it would be impossible for me to fall off anyway.<br><br>Suddenly, a thought stuck me and I decided to play a bet with myself.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â‘Angeline will latch it back when she comes for work at 7 plusÂ…Â’ </span><br><br>All through the night, I tossed and turned as much as I could maneuver myself without causing a pain reaction. In fact, there was a stinging pain around my abdominal region that was hindering me from resting. It felt like something was eating me inside out. Oh no, what could have happened? Could be complication?<br><br>I checked time Â– it was only 4.00 a.m. in the morning.<br><br>I bit my lips, clenched my fists, counted sheep, prayed, negotiated with my body and did everything else I could just to force myself back to sleep.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â‘Come on Cloud, you will recover wellÂ… endureÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Come restÂ…and sleepÂ… you are getting sleepyÂ…ignore the painÂ… just sleepÂ…Â’</span><br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">21 Sep 2005 (Wednesday), 0730 hrs</span></span><br><br>Â‘<span style="font-style: italic;">Cling ClankÂ’</span><br><br>I was rudely awakened by the sounds of metals and natural response caused me to break my sleep mode immediately. Regain focus, I saw Angeline standing beside my bed, looking terribly apologetic.<br><br>Â‘Oh, I am so sorryÂ… did I wake you up?Â’<br><br>I looked at what she was doing and realized I was right; she secured my bed, exactly what like what I had predicted. I checked the time, it was seven plus.<br><br>Â‘Hey, why are you grinning?Â’<br><br>Â‘You know something? Yesterday when the nurse unsecured my bed and leave it that way, I was SO sure that you would be the one who will secure it for me the next day when you see it. Great, you didnÂ’t disappoint me.Â’<br><br>AngelineÂ’s cheek flushed with slight redness and beamed into a girly smile.<br><br>Â‘AiyoÂ… I am your nurse mahÂ… got responsibility over youÂ…Â’<br><br>I raised my finger and draw a horizon across the ward.<br><br>Â‘Every single one of them came before youÂ… but I was so sure it was youÂ… interesting isnÂ’t it?Â’<br><br>AngelineÂ’s smile deepened and sank two visible dimples. Then she puts the clinical thermometer into my mouth and proceeded take my pulse rate. I donÂ’t know why, but I looked fixedly at her while she counted my pulse rate silently. Every time when her gaze caught mine, she would smile bashfully and moved her sight elsewhere for a moment, before coming back to mine and repeat that cycle again.<br><br>Â‘Why are you looking at me?Â’<br><br>Â‘Angeline, you are so seriousÂ…I wanted to disturb your sequence of counting thoughts.Â’<br><br>Â‘DonÂ’t be mean!Â’<br><br>We laughed.<br><br>Â‘Will come and talk to you later,Â’ said Angeline as she winked at me.<br><br>I elevated my bed higher and quietly observed Angeline as she worked. I discovered that she has a habit of washing her handsÂ… once every three to four times she entered into my ward. Maybe she was particular about cleanliness or it could be NUH hygiene directives. Whatever it was, all I knew was, every time Angeline came into my ward, my sight never leave her until she disappeared from my vision.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â‘DamnÂ…I better stop looking at her that way before it gets out of handÂ…Â’ </span><br><br>Â‘Hey kidney boyÂ… how are you feeling?Â’<br><br>It was Johnny, with one assorted basket of fruits.<br><br>Â‘Yeah, surviving stillÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘You are a lucky bastardÂ…Â’ whispered Johnny cautiously, almost feared being heard, Â‘I surveyed through all the nurses in your level and your nurse ranked the highest, in my gorgeous meter.Â’<br><br>Â‘HahahahahhahaÂ… gorgeous meter?Â’<br><br>Â‘ThatÂ’s what I mean by God is fair; you went through a health crisis, you get a pretty nurse to serve you? AinÂ’t God fair?Â’<br><br>I couldnÂ’t help but to laugh at his theory and unfounded deduction. I mean, to me, there wasnÂ’t any significant connection. In exchange for ONE kidney, you get ONE cute nurse for four days? ThatÂ’s such a bad trade.<br><br>We chatted for a while, before Johnny had to rush off for work. Sigh! I was brought back to loneliness, again.<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>
