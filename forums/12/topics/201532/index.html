            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 1</strong></span><br><br>I was sweating profusely under the blazing sun. The sunÂ’s piercing rays shone provocatively across the rows of standing humans and I had trouble trying to prevent droplets of sweat from infiltrating into my eyes. To be truthful, I wasnÂ’t feeling well and had initially thought of falling out. But, everybody else was falling out and ironically, ALL these fallen personnel came from my unit. Thank God, the Regimental Sergeant Major yelled out his final command, beseeching us to stand at ease before uttering another command to end my torment. Peering through my blurred vision, I could see him putting a fist in the air Â– SAFÂ’s way of gathering people.<br><br>My first step forward was wobbly and my ear was very much blocked. I thought I could almost hear the movement of my blood cells flowing rapidly through my head.<br><br>I swallowed hard as I felt a wholesome weakness engulfing my body, especially this incessant dull aching around the left flank region of my body. I tried to ignore it, but in fact, it was gaining on me.<br><br>Â‘Ok gentlemanÂ…Â’<br><br>I couldnÂ’t even wait for him to finish; a shade of darkness clouded over my eyes and I blacked out completely as my body gave in to the searing sun and plain fatigue. I was lying like a defeated soldier, lying at the mercy of circumstances, with my consciousness slipping away every minute.<br><br>Then, I felt a shift in altitude; someone carried me on his shoulder and I could hear much commotion rumbling like a faraway crowd. I can sense the vibes from people around my vicinity, whom I suspect to be medics, talking frantically to me, but I couldnÂ’t make out any sense from their blabbering.<br><br>Â‘Wake up!!!!Â’<br><br>I felt someone invading my solar plexus with his hands, attempting to execute pain to teleport me back to reality from the abyss of unconsciousness. My eyelid jerked a little before I narrowly forced opened them.<br><br>Â‘StoppÂ…. PainnnÂ…Â’ I murmured meekly.<br><br>In this very next moment, I vaguely glanced my surrounding Â– A doctor was trying to hoist open my heavy eye; I felt a syringe stabbed into my right arm; a needle pricked one finger of my left hand; somebody was unbuttoning my shirt; another fellow trying to take my temperature.<br><br>Â‘His pulse is forty twoÂ…Â’<br><br>Praise the lord; I could hear what he was saying, although not exactly loving this medical ordeal.<br><br>Â‘DonÂ’t close your eyesÂ… whatÂ’s your name? Can you hear me?Â’<br><br>I was bombarded with questions as if I was struck with amnesia. I pointed to my left flank and signaled to them that there was some dull aching there, however, for some unknown reason, the doctor seemed more interested in checking out my temperature. By now, I was semi-conscious, although extremely debilitated from my concussion.<br><br>Â‘Corporal Lin, next time, when you not feeling wellÂ… must sound out. DonÂ’t push yourself too hard.Â’<br><br>The voice came from Tengah AirbaseÂ’s RSM. He fatherly touched my forehead and I could see his meticulous concern over someone almost a stranger to him. In the midst of this dizzy chaos, I felt touched emotionally.<br><br>After what seemed like eternity (I have severe distortion of time and space within that disoriented frame of mind), I was pushed into a nearby ambulance. The ride was short before I was unloaded and brought into SAFTI Medical center.<br><br>Initially, my case was mistaken as heat injury; icepacks were all over my vital points. Yes, I was stripped nakedÂ… almost. Together with the blasting air-con, I was literally freezing.<br><br>Â‘I think we over-cooled himÂ…Â’<br><br>What?<br><br>Â‘Standard procedureÂ’Â… again?<br><br>So much for Â‘THINKINGÂ’ soldiersÂ…zzz<br><br>At this point of time, I was very much back to Earth, despite the persisting aching.<br><br>Â‘I think there is an unnatural enlargement hereÂ…Â’ said the Medical Officer as he circled his finger around my left flank region. As soon as he finished his statement, the Medical Officer began to perform palpate their discovery, as if trying to confirm his findings.<br><br>Â‘I think this is a kidney enlargement.Â’<br><br>Â‘WHAT?Â’<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 2</strong></span><br><br>I dazed blankly at my bed wall, recalling what happened, before it dawned on me that I was actually medically ill for twenty years. What a ghastly enlightenment!<br><br>The doctor diagnosed: I am suffering from Hydronephrosis Â– a congenital disorder where my ureter (the long, narrow duct that conveys urine from the kidney to the urinary bladder or cloaca) is naturally narrow. Think of this condition like a funnel with narrow tube; water flowed slower, compared to one with a wider tube. Relating back, therefore, years of accumulated fluids were trapped within my left kidney, which causes the enlargement and dull aching I had, unknowingly, over the years. Obviously, the kidney becomes damaged over time.<br><br>Â‘The test has shown that your left kidney only got about 12% function leftÂ…Â’<br><br>I freaked out when he revealed my test result. The word Â‘NKFÂ’ was flashing maliciously all over my mind. I couldnÂ’t imagine myself going through dialysis and in fact, I would rather choose death.<br><br>Â‘We are born with two kidneys Â– and we can still survive with one.Â’<br><br>Sigh. A major operation was the final thing I had in mind Â– the renal specialist proposed that I were to undergo unilateral kidney removing operation, in National University Hospital. Everyday, I prayed for safety, hoping that I could complete my national liabilities without a flinch, but looked at what happen now? I do hear stories like chamber explosion of a M16 rifle that permanently disfigured the poor soldierÂ’s (NSF) face for life. I just want to ORD without problems and get on with my life.<br><br>I havenÂ’t even embarked my inaugural journey of lifeÂ… my higher studiesÂ…careerÂ… and of course: a decent girlfriendÂ…<br><br>So many things listed in my personal billboard and I have yet to achieve them.<br><br>How man? What if the operation becomes a failure? What if God wants to bring me back Â‘homeÂ’ earlier?<br><br>I appreciated all my good friends and buddies, who gave words of comfort during this shadowy moment of my life. It was too suddenÂ… too unexpected, even for them to digest mentally when I revealed about my sad medical condition. I needed all sort of positivity to help prepare myself for this coming decisive battle and those little encouragement gave me a lot of determination to banish the Â‘what ifÂ’.<br><br>I came on MSN and was flooded with messages.<br><br>I checked my phone and it was flooded with messages.<br><br>Â‘So are you scared?Â’<br><br>It was Johnny Â– my best buddy since my days in ACS (BR). We were the best of friends since we knew each other. Sports, gaming, fighting, gambling to chasing skirts Â– there was nothing we didnÂ’t do together or nothing we donÂ’t know about one another.<br><br>Â‘Promise me,Â’ my voice became serious, Â‘if anything were to happen to me, please take care of VickyÂ….Â’<br><br>Â‘Gawd!Â’ exclaimed Johnny, Â‘Vicky is already history and you are still pinning over her? And nothing will happen to you lahÂ’<br><br>Â‘You know Johnny, I had never really been in love and she was the closest thing that could paint an example of what Love probably meansÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘She is, no doubt, a bad example: and you two have never even started!Â’<br><br>I couldnÂ’t respond to his reply. Words choked at where my throat was.<br><br>Then I sighed.<br><br>Â‘Listen,Â’ began Johnny as he put his hands around me, Â‘what you experienced is known to the common folks as puppy love. It was pretty ethereal. In fact, it was what we all felt when we were young.Â’<br><br>Â‘Then how do you know if a Love was substantial?Â’<br><br>Â‘Vicky wasnÂ’t even genuine in the first place! Come on, she was just unstable.Â’<br><br>Â‘SighÂ… quite difficult to find someone whom is genuine and sincere. I think my situation is worsened by the fact that I am not only NOT good looking, but also unexciting. Think girls just get turned off by me. People probably laugh at me for having blank pages in aspects of love and relationship and now, I am struck with this medical condition where it would be the end of me when my other healthy kidney deterioratesÂ…Â’<br><br>My eyes became watery.<br><br>Â‘Look, your thoughts are running wild because I know you are afraid of tomorrowÂ’s operation. Yes, I understand everything seemed to be going wrong, but reassure that God is fair; he takes something from youÂ… he will give you something back in the future.Â’<br><br>Â‘I hope you are rightÂ…seriously hope soÂ…Â’<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>
