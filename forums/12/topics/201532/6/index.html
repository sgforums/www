            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 9</strong></span><br><br>Johnny proposed to chill out in town before the sun sets. Although I was feeling quite reluctant, I thought that a causal walk would be benefic for my recovery. To be truthful, I still feel the pain whenever a wicked sneeze caught me by surprise or if I did something drastic that stretched my abdominal region. But wasting myself at home isnÂ’t something I fancy; furthermore, how long could anyone spend their time playing Warcraft 3? Personally, I know some people have this ability to game their life away, but I have grown to detest such life within two weeks of personal experience.<br><br>Then I uncovered the truth; there was actually a secondary agenda to his proposal; he was planning to meet his latest fling he got to flirt around with in the internet. And he actually wanted me to be around to rally some courage.<br><br>Â‘This is so stupidÂ… do you even know how she looks like?Â’<br><br>Â‘NopeÂ… but we have talked on the phone beforeÂ… she sounded so sweet on phoneÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘So you are presuming that she will look as good as her voice?Â’<br><br>Â‘ItÂ’s a risk I am taking CloudÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘And what if she doesnÂ’t appear as good?Â’<br><br>Â‘Ah! ThatÂ’s when we will quietly exit ourselves and leaveÂ…Â’<br><br>I was quite astonished by his reply; that was so mean and shallow of him. And I am actually part of this operation? His evil accomplice?<br><br>Â‘Ok you seeÂ…,Â’ began Johnny, Â‘we agreed that we would come aloneÂ… but I brought you along so that she wouldnÂ’t know that Â‘I am JohnnyÂ’. At first sight of disappointment, I would signal you and we would just walk off somewhereÂ…Â’<br><br>I rolled my eyes.<br><br>We were at the sixth level of Cineleisure; where the movies theaters where located. And we were just sitting around some couches waiting for the advent of his blind date. For the plan to Â‘succeedÂ’ Â– we have to be constantly talking to each other, as if we are either waiting for the movies to begin or waiting for someone. Johnny began to rattle about how he got to know her, their conversation and all sort of mundane stuff that I am not particularly interested in. My mind was sealed after he told me about this crazy plan of his.<br><br>Maybe I am just a prude; I donÂ’t fancy bad pranks.<br><br>Suddenly, a group of people sitting around the couches stood up and walked towards the theater; my guess was that their movie was about to start. I causally looked around and realized that apart from us, there were two women, obviously friends, sitting directly opposite us.<br><br>Â‘SheeshÂ… I think one of them is herÂ…Â’ whispered Johnny.<br><br>These two women werenÂ’t particularly good looking. Knowing him so well, in fact, I doubt Johnny would be interested in anyone of them. Then Johnny pointed to the nearest escape Â– the escalator - suggesting that we should flee as soon as possible, witnessing the change of tide and triggering the contingency plan.<br><br>It was cracking the hell out of me because if Johnny was right and one of them was indeed his blind date, it goes to show how ridiculous this whole online-shit is about. People are just narcissistic and self absorbed Â– unable to look beyond the surface to causally know a new friend or somethingÂ…. everything is sadly based on physical looks.<br><br>Then the two women, too, got up from their seats and apparently, there were behind us.<br><br>Â‘Oh noÂ… I think that they are tailing us! Ok level four! Quick turned left into the arcade.Â’<br><br>I regretted not bringing my Oakley half jacket shade; I am so embarrassed by this whole scenario and swore to myself that I will never ever let this happen to me, again.<br><br>Â‘OkÂ… must remember to change some tokensÂ…letÂ’s act normallyÂ…Â’<br><br>The women were still behind us. I suspected that they knew one of us was Johnny and there was a possibility that they would approach us to confirm their suspicion.<br><br>Then, in midst of this mindless fast-paced chaos, there was this girl, hanging near the entrance of the arcade, with her back facing us. And when she turned around and our gaze caught each other; I was stunned.<br><br>Â‘Angeline?Â’<br><br>Her eyes were startled, but gradually soften into her usual sweet feminine doe-eyes. Even though she mentioned that she has apparently forgotten how I looked like, but when I am presented to her in reality, she recognized this familiarity immediately. Johnny was frozen in this track to change some tokens as he was considering this Â‘new circumstancesÂ’. Then, at the corner of my eyes, the two women were maliciously closing in on us. I was staring at Johnny and I could see a change of plan weaving above his head. It was so transparent to me that I knew what he was thinking.<br><br>Â‘Angeline! So you are at the arcade? We were waiting for you at level six.Â’<br><br>And before I allowed Angeline to exude any puzzling expression, I went up to her, shielding her expression from the oncoming Â‘dangerÂ’ behind us.<br><br>Â‘I need a favor; just act along with what I have to say,Â’ I whispered.<br><br>Angeline knowingly looked at me and smiled.<br><br>Â‘Of course,Â’ she replied notably loud, Â‘I have forgotten to bring my mobile and when you people change the venue, obviously I wasnÂ’t informed.Â’<br><br>Â‘Yeah man,Â’ chipped Johnny, almost wanting the whole world to hear, Â‘we are sorry!Â’<br><br>The women then stopped behind us. I could see them having a mutual discussion and my guess was that there were deciding if the guys they were Â‘pursuingÂ’ was the man they were looking for. I wasnÂ’t sure if they would buy our Â‘taleÂ’, but our conversation continued, as if were we planning to meet Angeline.<br><br>Shortly, they left.<br><br>Â‘Phew. Thank GodÂ…Â’ exasperated Johnny.<br><br>Â‘I am sorry Angeline; this arse-friend of mine did something incredibly stupid today and you just got us out of certain embarrassment.Â’<br><br>Â‘YouÂ’re welcome! But why are you not resting at home?Â’<br><br>I glared at Johnny.<br><br>Â‘ItÂ’s a long storyÂ… but I will explain you next timeÂ… so what are you doing here?Â’<br><br>Â‘I am meeting someone for movieÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘OhÂ…boyfriend?Â’ asked Johnny instinctively.<br><br>Â‘Nah, no boyfriend currentlyÂ… just a causal friendÂ…Â’<br><br>Then I saw this man walking towards our direction and his hands were holding some drinks. Then it dawned on me that it was the trainee doctor in NUH Â– Richard See. Somehow, the feeling wasnÂ’t too good.<br><br>Â‘I guess I shouldnÂ’t bother you anymoreÂ… enjoy your show?Â’<br><br>Â‘I will call you later at night Â… and you could tell me what happened,Â’ chuckled Angeline before bidding me farewell.<br><br>I nodded, before hauling Johnny away with me as I caught him scrutinizing Richard from head to toe, with contempt.<br><br>Â‘Hey! I was trying to warn him to stay away from your Angel,Â’ exclaimed Johnny as we were taking the escalator down to level three.<br><br>I rolled my eyesÂ… again.<br><br>Â‘NO MORE STUPID STUNTS FOR TODAY BEFORE I MURDER YOU OUTRAGEOUSLY!Â’<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 10</strong></span><br><br>It has been three months since my fateful operation. Surviving on one kidney didnÂ’t seem to invite any further hindrance into my daily life, apart from that subconscious fear of Â‘NKFÂ’ glooming at the back of my mind, should my other healthy one fails me.<br><br>Life was also wonderful ever since I went back to work. I was promptly downgraded and now dealing with administrative work. The medical officer revealed that if my condition was discovered earlier, I wouldnÂ’t even have gone through all those cheong sua. In retrospect, although regimentation was strict and training was tough, I was glad that I have survived all that was thrown into my path. More importantly, with all the friends I had made during my inaugural journey in BMT and RSAF, it will still be the route I would opt for, should I have a choice.<br><br>At the same time, Angeline and I became very good friendsÂ… too good to be true actually. I have never picture such possibility of engaging with a member of the opposite gender at that sort of level. It was a breakthrough from previous Â‘levelsÂ’, almost to a point where I could safety tell myself that I am hopelessly falling for in love with her.<br><br>The feeling was mystically intimate yet shrouded with an aura of comfortable serenity Â– Angeline was emotionally close to me, yet awkwardness has never sunk in.<br><br>We never felt weird in each otherÂ’s presence.<br><br>Today is the day where I had to go to NUH for a medical check-up and we have decided to meet up, since she was just nearby. At first, I was a little reluctant as I was donning my SAF number four uniform and I hated the notion of wearing military attire into public places. I didnÂ’t want Angeline to see me in that NSF state, but I donÂ’t really have any alternatives as I was involved in a mobilization recall and had to go back to camp after my appointment.<br><br>I waited placidly at my specialist clinic for her arrival. I put my appointment card in a transparent square box and sat near the reception, knowing that the nurses will call me anytime.<br><br>Â‘Cloud Lin JiashunÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Yes yesÂ…Â’<br><br>To be frank, I hate people to address me by my full name.<br><br>Â‘Please wait over there; you will need to take blood test.Â’<br><br>SHUCKS!<br><br>Moments later, in the midst of drawing blood, my phone rung and instinctively I picked up the call.<br><br>Â‘Where you?Â’<br><br>Â‘Wah bad timingÂ… I am drawing bloodÂ… wait!Â’<br><br>I came out of my room and Angeline was at my 0840hrs position. Because she was so blind, I had to wave frantically to catch her attention. Obviously, my feat attracted some of undue attention and only after she sat beside me (waiting for payment Â– it was free for civil servant of course), I began to realize why people are staring at us; she was wearing her NYP nurse uniform and I was in my number four. I suspected that it was this combination that fueled the strange aura we exude to outsiders.<br><br>Somehow, putting two people in uniform of different settling looked very drastic. I donÂ’t know how to discern this strange phenomenon, but my guess was: neither does people. And so the staring continued with everyone we passed, until somehow it became quite irritable.<br><br>Shortly, we left NUH and walked towards the bus stop. I understand that it was home after work for her and luckily, we are on the same direction. Suddenly, I saw this particular NSF wearing number four, in the same bus stop. Likewise, he was observing us.<br><br>Â‘SeeÂ… everyone is looking at usÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Yah lorÂ… why ar?Â’<br><br>Â‘Because of our uniform la! You see that guy over there? I bet he must be thinking how on Earth did I managed to hook up a nurse while having my medical appointment.Â’<br><br>We laughed and I could see Angeline stealing a fraction of a second to catch the manÂ’s expression.<br><br>Â‘I am going to tease him?Â’ I whispered softly to Angeline.<br><br>Â‘How?Â’<br><br>Â‘Just look shy and bashful. When I give the signal, shake my hand likewise.Â’<br><br>Finishing my statement, I could see Angeline trying to portray that chaste, innocent and virginal expression, which almost swept me off literally (Ok, I swear that wasnÂ’t part of a greater plan to fulfill my possible unconscious fantasy). Regaining myself, I stretched out my hands and we shook, as if I was attempting to know her.<br><br>Â‘Nice to meet you,Â’ I said, notably loud.<br><br>Instantaneously, I could see the NSFÂ’s eyes almost bulged out of its socket; his mind was probably left dangling with exclamation marks and I-donÂ’t-believe-this expression. It was simply too hilarious for me to contain and thank goodness, our bus came. We exploded with roaring laughter when the bus left and as again, the undue attention returned.<br><br>Â‘See? I was right! I knew he would react that way!Â’<br><br>Â‘Maybe it is just him laÂ’<br><br>Sigh. Maybe. Actually, I wasnÂ’t surprised at his reaction; national service kind of degenerate our social life - not many girls to know (or ogle) at camps. To stir deeper thoughts; many guys broke up their relationship while serving the nation. Not too sure about the actual reason/s, but perhaps one of it would be the lack of time to spent together like before.<br><br>Â‘And lack of understanding?Â’<br><br>Loyalty to country - the first core value of SAF - but whatÂ’s left for these guys is emotional desolation. Loyalty to country probably meant certain degree of personal sacrifice, but I believed this is opened to interpretation. I heard of cases, from my ex-sergeants in BMT, about people gunning themselves over failed relationship. They cannot handle the psychological impact when their girlfriends left and in midst of this madness, folly occurred.<br><br>Â‘So sadÂ…Â’<br><br>In that split second, the image of Vicky slipped into my mental frame. Old memories stirred old wounds; I discovered that I was subconsciously talking about the past; after all, I have always blamed National Service as one of the reasons why Vicky didnÂ’t chose me. However, I finally understood what JohnnyÂ’s words meant and why Vicky wasnÂ’t suitable at all.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â‘Â…God is fair; he takes something from youÂ… he will give you something back in the future.Â’</span><br><br>Perhaps, God had replaced a Guardian Angel, in exchange for a lost kidneyÂ… in exchange for Vicky.<br><br>Angeline knew about Vicky; I bared my heart to her in our previous conversation. And what I liked about Angeline is the simplicity I enjoyed as I relate myself to her. Maybe liking someone grants you the ability to speak with them along that Â‘levelÂ’ of communication.<br><br>Angeline squeezed my arms gently - it was her way of saying Â‘cheer upÂ’.<br><br>We reached our destination and soon to be walking in separate directions. Although I was feeling this reluctance to leave her company, but all good things must come to an end.<br><br>Â‘Anyway, my birthday is coming next weekÂ… and of course I expect a present from you!Â’<br><br>I just smiled schemingly.<br><br>Â‘Bye bye! I donÂ’t care,Â’ replied Angeline, as she sticks her tongue out at me while running away Â‘I donÂ’t care! BYE!Â’<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>when i first came to this topic, there was only chapter 1.<br>Found that it was an interesting read n swore to follow up the story since i am a NSF and was really concerned about what happened to the guy who fainted in the midst of the parade <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">.<br>Somehow, i forgot about the thread due to myself being too busy. When i was casually reading thru threads at AA, i came back to this Angel story. Of course i was rather elated and read it all the way from chapter 1 to 10.<br>Really nice. Good job Yunhaier! Continue giving us more great reads.<br><br>Cheers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
