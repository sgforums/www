            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 11</strong></span><br><br>Today is her birthday dayÂ… her big day.<br><br>And mine too.<br><br>Why?<br><br>Because, I have decided to charge that hidden affection into action. It was simply too painful trying to keep that suppressed emotions at bay.<br><br>I have decided to release that inhibition and to reveal my inner feelings.<br><br>I have decided to tell her how much I like herÂ… in my own ways.<br><br>Johnny advised me to instill some surprise into my chase; therefore I had told Angeline that I was confined in camp, unable to celebrate her big day with her. To put my conscience at ease, I wasnÂ’t technically lying - I am the duty clerk for today and although I donÂ’t have to stay in, I must be the last to leave after my superiors and everyone else.<br><br>The carefully crafted plan was to catch her at her house, try to woo her with flowers and gift before declaring my affection.<br><br>Â‘Sorry Sir, do you still need the printer?Â’<br><br>Â‘ErmÂ… in fact I do. I may have to print something later.Â’<br><br>Â‘Ok sir, I shall wait for you.Â’<br><br>I rolled my eyes immediately upon closing the door. What luck! I still have to go home and grabbed my Â‘arsenal of weaponsÂ’ before rushing to her house. If my Commanding Officer (CO) delayed my plans or worst, ruined them, I would have cursed him with all my might, known languages and vocabularies.<br><br>Time ticked maliciously towards 1930hrs and counting Â– I am flabbergasted by how idle and nonchalant my CO is towards me waiting for him, almost to a point of desperation, to merely print some useless documents (And I donÂ’t even know if it was official or non-official Â‘documentsÂ’). Come on! How Â‘LONGÂ’ does it take to navigate your mouse to the print icon and click it? I have been waiting since 1750hrs! And there wasnÂ’t any news from him? Could he have forgotten about my existence?<br><br>Â‘Hey LinÂ… never mind about this,Â’ said CO as he barged into my room and pointed at me, Â‘I will print tomorrow. You can lock up everything now.Â’<br><br>SHEESH!<br><br>Within a short span of twenty minutes (believe me, that was VERY fast from my squadron to the main road), I was out of my camp waiting for cab. One thing I hate about Sembawang Airbase is the long stretch of walking distance before I could see civilization. And for someone without a car, itÂ’s a daily hassle.<br><br>WAH RAO! SUAY MAN! NO TAXI SIA!<br><br>To spice things dramatically up; I saw this middle-age lady, with obvious intention trying to cut me in front to cab flagging. Then, I purposely walked in proportion against the distance she traveled towards me. I am leaving NO chance to anyone trying to ruin my big day!<br><br>And just when I almost called a cab, one yellow-top cab came.<br><br>Â‘UncleÂ… Serangoon Central! Quick Quick! Late alreadyÂ…Â’<br><br>A quick check of time revealed 2011 hrs. From the information gathered from our past conversations, I understand that she would reach home before 2230hrs because that was the curfew set by her mum.<br><br>I reached home, almost 2035hrs, dashed up to my house and went straight to the bathroom for a shower. As I was donning my Bathing Ape tee and Levis jeans, I was doing a final Â‘inventories checkÂ’.<br><br>Bathed? Checked.<br><br>Flowers? Checked.<br><br>Gift? Checked.<br><br>Card? Checked.<br><br>Hair? Checked.<br><br>Â‘Boy ar! Where are you going?Â’<br><br>Â‘Mum, I going to see a dance performance and the flower is for my friends performing.Â’<br><br>Even an elaborated lie was weaved to counter ANY questioning by mum. I donÂ’t know if she would buy that story, but that was my answer to shut further questioning.<br><br>Â‘WISH ME LUCK!Â’<br><br>Last time check? 2100hrs.<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Chapter 12</strong></span><br><br>My heart was pounding and slamming my rib cage repeatedly. The adrenaline flowing in me is like thousands of horses scattering over a vast plateau Â– the madness was so intense for me that I felt like it had possessed me to do things I normally wouldnÂ’t. It was so powerful that I became another person - all those negative psychological impacts that Vicky has inflicted to me has vanished momentarily, as if being devoured by the passion that has maturated.<br><br>I am free. Free from my past bondage to pursue a new future.<br><br>Maybe when you released the suppression in you, you get tsunamis. I realized that the built-up energiesÂ… those tidal waves can create wonders, if properly utilized and I want to tap on itÂ… I want to be able to love freely, without the burden of my past.<br><br>I was waiting at the highest level of her block, albeit it was two levels above her house. Surreptitiously, I was cautiously peering through the metal railing as I could see her if she returned home because she would definitely use this staircase. I gotten this knowledge from Johnny because he stayed near her and this was what he suggested to catch her Â‘at that momentÂ’.<br><br>I dropped her a SMS; she mentioned that she was on her way home.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â‘Ok CloudÂ… this is your glorious moment ever. DonÂ’t ever lose them!Â’</span><br><br>Final time checked: 2245hrs. Oh yes, hair checked again.<br><br>Although my wait was almost an hour; I felt that time was simply too hasty because there was this significant fear that I may screw things up at last minute and I am trying to overcome it:<br><br>What if I sprout some nonsense and turned her off?<br><br>Or what if she hated blue roses?<br><br>Most importantly: what if I have failed?<br><br>What if she rejected me?<br><br>I quickly diverted that notion away, deciding that I should just do it and handle the consequence later, should it ended up this way. I hope we could still be friends (somehow I am pretty sure that it wouldnÂ’t be much of a problem), but I could never be too sure.<br><br>Then, I heard footsteps.<br><br>I peered through the railing for the twelfth times and finally, I caught a glimpse of Angeline. Oh waitÂ… there was a variation to my forecasted plan; someone was with her Â– a guy. They were taking the stairs down, somewhat one half-level below me.<br><br>Â‘Thanks for the dinner tonightÂ…Â’<br><br>I could barely hear AngelineÂ’s voice, but I have managed to make out some words.<br><br>I realized who the guy was when his face was in view; it was Richard See, the trainee doctor.<br><br>My heart sank when I saw him reached over and hugged Angeline. I could also see him murmuring something into her ears and they remained in that position for a moment. AngelineÂ’s expression was initially startled, but gradually accepted things that were happening.<br><br>My world paused immediately; I was stunned.<br><br>If not for the sudden ringing of my mobile and I wouldnÂ’t know how long I would remain in Pluto, fourth dimension, or whatever you called it.<br><br>And I guess it was either my ring tone was too loud or the environment was extremely quiet; Angeline probably hear and recognized my ring tone. Before I could regain myself and sped to the lift, she was standing right in front of me, somewhat surprised.<br><br>Instantaneously, I could feel my tears bursting from my glands any moments.<br><br>Â‘Happy birthday... AngelineÂ…Â’ I said meekly, Â‘hereÂ’s the present I promised youÂ…Â’<br><br>I gave her the gifts and flowers, but secretly tried to keep the card away from sight. But I guess it was pretty futile.<br><br>Â‘IsnÂ’t the card for me too?Â’ said Angeline as she tried to reach for the card.<br><br>Â‘ActuallyÂ… noÂ…Â’<br><br>I fled into the lift and hit the close button.<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

I just want to be solitary for a moment to adjust my disrupted flow of thoughts. How could I ever be so stupid not to know that Richard is wooing her the same time as my liking developed? I should have anticipated it when he dated her for movie at Cineleisure, so that I could Â‘speed upÂ’ my progression and development.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â‘Cloud, you are so are still as fuucking stupid as everÂ…Â’</span><br><br>Emotions aside; I tried to be rational and in telling myself that all is fair in love and war. But the more rational and logical I became, the less helpful it was to my esteem and ego. You put a future doctor-to-be: one with great career prospect in life juxtaposed a NSF soldier struggling with a miserable $420 allowance from the army and worrying about his bleak future this in era of economic uncertainty.<br><br>Her choice would be obvious.<br><br>I was wandering around her neighborhood until I found a playground to sit around. These days, the playgrounds around the estate were devoid of sand and the good-old swings. Kids these days are too protected - so sheltered that even the swings are removed. This is the childhood we get in Singapore. I thought it was pretty redundant because later on in life, these kids are going to get hurt by life anyway. Therefore if you shield the children about the existence of pain, they are going to suffer more during their encounters with Â‘hurtÂ’.<br><br>This is how I portrayed Love to be; the more I injured myself in the course of finding my mate, the less hurt I felt. Although I know that I was the weakest link, but at the very least, I put up a decent fight, despite knowing that all will crash when the truth is revealed as the decision is made.<br><br>Maybe Richard popped the ultimate question in his quiet whisper?<br><br>Perhaps today marked their union, as girlfriend and boyfriend. Maybe I should just back out before I sustained more Â‘injuriesÂ’.<br><br>A drop of tear fell from my cheek. It denoted sadness of a defeated warrior, fighting for a lost cause because I was inadequate. My moral and confidence fell sharply as if I was armed with fourth-grade weapon against a formidable foe with state of art weaponry.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â‘Why are we training so hard? Why are we pushing you guys to your limit? Because care for soldiers means having to teach them to survive in war and not die in battle! You canÂ’t win the war by dying for your country; you make the other poor bastard die for his. If you are ill-trained or inadequate, you wonÂ’t be able to handle the chaos of war or worse, bring death upon yourself or your buddiesÂ…Â’</span><br><br>I remember that was what my platoon commander told us during course. Somehow, it seemed relevant to my situation now.<br><br>An SMS came: Â‘Where are you?Â’<br><br>It was Angeline.<br><br>I was battling the urge to reply her - maybe because I feared to know the truthÂ… her choice..<br><br>Another SMS came: I know you are near my house.<br><br>A quick check round me discovered nothing.<br><br>Ok, this is scary.<br><br>Third SMS came: Meet at my void deck of my flat.<br><br>I froze on the spot, holding tightly onto my mobile; I didnÂ’t even reply her and she seemed to know my whereabouts and intentions.<br><br>Should I meet her?<br><br>(To be continued... final chapter).</div>
