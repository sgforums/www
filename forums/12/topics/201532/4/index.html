I mean, itÂ’s amusing and it says much about someone to have that someone telling you something which you overlooked or has never mattered to you in the first place.<br><br>Â‘No lar, my friend thought that you were cuteÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘SiaoÂ… Â’<br><br>Somehow, Singaporean ladies are not receptive to compliments. Their initial respond to a complement is to reject that complement verbally and accepting it emotionally. Maybe it is because of Asian values/culture where we are psychologically bred to practice humility. Or maybe we are so focused on whatÂ’s so unlovable about us that when someone says something nice, we are unable to accept the notion that we are actually lovable.<br><br>Â‘Hey, when are you discharging?Â’<br><br>Â‘On Thursday I think? ThatÂ’s what the doctor told me, provided there is no complicationÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘AiyoÂ… stay one more day lah! My internship ends on FridayÂ… so you can repay me by accompanying me until it endsÂ…Â’<br><br>Excuse me? Me accompanying you? Since when has it Â‘becomeÂ’ that way? Accompanying? It seemed that I have been promoted from a nurse-patient relationship to that of a friendship.<br><br>Â‘Cause can chat with you whatÂ… can help me to kill time fasterÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘DonÂ’t think itÂ’s up to me to decide thoughÂ… we shall seeÂ…Â’<br><br>Then I saw mum entering hastily into my ward, carrying newspapers and magazines.<br><br>Â‘Your mum is here,Â’ whispered Angeline, Â‘I will exit myself to the bed beside yoursÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Boy ah! Mum has brought you some things to read so that you wonÂ’t feel so bored in hereÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Thanks mumÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘You know, mum is working on Friday and nobody is at home to take care of you. I was thinking of extending your stay by one day, although ah ma wanted to come up and take care of youÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘ItÂ’s ok mum, donÂ’t want to trouble ah maÂ… aiyaÂ… no need lah! I can take care of myselfÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Cannot! You just went through a major operation, how can you move around? And I donÂ’t want you to eat rubbish food outsideÂ… after operation cannot anyhow eatÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Doctor says I can eat anythingÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Doctor says is doctor saysÂ… Chinese always very particular about food intakeÂ… you will listen to your mumÂ…Â’<br><br>I think Angeline overheard our conversation. I causally looked over and caught her giggling to herself.<br><br>Â‘Yes mumÂ…Â’<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

Seizing the chance, I told them about my sudden acute pain last night and after some discussion, they suspected it to be Gastric.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â‘Â…Damn the GastricÂ…Â’  </span><br><br>Satisfied with my improving condition, those unnecessary tubes were removed from my body Â– another set of agony, especially the tube connected to the region of my non-existence-left-kidney. Living in hospital is like living in hell; you are NOT only going to get bored to death, you will also receive ritual Â‘pain tortureÂ’. To be frank: I am already dying to get back home on the second day, as I was missing my internetÂ… my Warcraft 3Â… my personal bedÂ… and everything else which had slipped out of my mind, but I know it mattered to me when I see them at home.<br><br>Today marked the fourth day and a weird phenomenon is surfacing - somewhere within my psyche, I was actually not looking forward to leave NUH. I seemed to be growing a progressive attachment to the hospital and something is fuelling this strange vibes that is gaining rapidly on me.<br><br>I donÂ’t know what has gotten to me but it has reached to a boiling point where I could see myself feeling depressed about leaving NUH. Even just thinking about it made me low.<br><br>From where I was, I could see Angeline, chatting happily with the other trainee nurses, oblivious to me stealing occasional looks at her. And surprisingly, I realized I wasnÂ’t the only one Â‘spyingÂ’ her: one of the male trainee doctors, attending to me, was doing exactly the same thing - his eyes blatantly betrayed him. And yes, he was Â‘caughtÂ’ by me.<br><br>Guess I was the last patient in their round check; this male trainee doctor went over to where Angeline was and spoke to her. From where I was, obviously I couldnÂ’t make out what their conversation was, but after he has spoken, the other nurses broke into shy giggling, mixed with a little shuffling and soft cheering.<br><br>I couldnÂ’t see my petite nurse as he was obstructing my line of sight and somehow, I donÂ’t feel good about this.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-style: italic;">22 Sep 2005, (Thursday), 1000</span></span><br><br>Â‘HahaÂ… you got no choice but to stay here with me and let me take care of you one more dayÂ…Â’<br><br>Taking care of me? Hello? More like me helping her to burn off the Â‘slowerÂ’ period of her working hours. I meanÂ… just look around my ward: everyone IS at least three times her age - who else could have the ability to connect her world and thoughts as easily as I do?<br><br>Â‘YaÂ… like realÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Well, unless you are talking about trainee doctorsÂ… like the guy who went over and talk cork with you earlier just nowÂ…?Â’<br><br>Â‘You mean Richard? DonÂ’t anyhow thinkÂ… he is just being friendlyÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Yeah I agreedÂ… just extra friendly to specific peopleÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Why youÂ…Â’ whispered Angeline softly as she took out the thermometer from my lips and came close to my ears, Â‘Â…so jealous?Â’<br><br>With that, she broke into a suppressed laughter.<br><br>Jealous? Me? ThatÂ’s crazy.<br><br>Over who? Her? ThatÂ’s madness.<br><br>On what basis? Undefined liking? ThatÂ’s insane.<br><br>Then, a sudden disruption interrupted our conversation; an old man (bed beside mine) fell off his bed. Almost instantaneously, Angeline and one other nurse came over to help him up.<br><br>Â‘Uncle! How can you move around like this? Must call missy to help you!! You cannot afford to fall again, you know? Very dangerous!!!Â’<br><br>I could almost see Angeline bursting into tears as she admonished him; Angeline seemed terrified by what had happened to the old man, who was also under her care like myself. She stood there motionlessly, while putting a hand across her mouth and I could see liquid amassing near her eyes.<br><br>Grabbing my box of tissue lying quietly on my table (my mum bought it for me the other day), I walked over and placed it gently on her shoulder, with her back facing me.<br><br>Then, Angeline ran out of the ward, without even turning her head over.<br><br>Â‘Wah piangÂ…so much for being a gentlemanÂ…Â’<br><br>She came back a while later, looking slightly embarrassed.<br><br>Â‘Did I cause a scene?Â’<br><br>Â‘No you didnÂ’tÂ… but you rejected my good willÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Oh my gawdÂ… you have seen me cry le!Â’<br><br>Â‘You are too emotionalÂ… I mean, such things do happen in a hospital setting, donÂ’t they?Â…Â’<br><br>Â‘Ya I know, but when I see elderly falling to their knees, it pricks my heart so badly that I would just cryÂ…Â’<br><br>That was WAY too angelic!<br><br>Â‘Anyway,Â’ said Angeline, Â‘thanks for your tissue. Appreciated that thoughtÂ…reallyÂ…Â’<br><br>(To be continued...)</div>

My mind was like resisting my every attempt to put myself into sleep mode. Chaotic thoughts were saturating my mind, made up of incongruence pieces and formation of ill feelings.<br><br>Somehow, I have grown customized to the hospital beds, the constant service, the stale food, and of course, my Â‘personalÂ’ nurse. By the looks of it, it seemed that I only have a couple of hours more before this person would disappear from my lifeÂ…unlessÂ…<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â‘Wah raoÂ… ask for contact number? Sure reject one lorÂ… she is a nurse and I am her patient lehÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘If you donÂ’t ask, that would be the end of your Â‘relationshipÂ’ with her Â– be it nurse-patient relationship or even friendshipÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘ButÂ…butÂ…how am I supposed to request? That would be hell of an awkward situationÂ…and imagine if she rejects me outrageously, then how? Leap out of the window and commit suicide?Â’<br><br>Â‘CloudÂ… why are you thinking so much? Just DO first and FEEL laterÂ…Â’</span><br><br>HmmÂ… do first and feel later? It sounded like a good strategy to adopt. Maybe the first step to this strategy is to decide when will be the right moment to pop the question?<br><br>HOW MAN? I SUCK AT THIS!<br><br>Not resigning to my fate, I stared at the ceiling wall, praying to God to provide me some viable solutions, for time is ticking furiously and she would be here for work soon enough. I congregated all my human resource - mental focus, decision making ability, crisis management skills, probability calculation, spiritual assistance and rally of courage Â– into one powerful surge of energy flowing inside of me.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â‘This must succeedÂ…this must succeedÂ… this must succeedÂ…Â’   </span><br><br>Then my object of desire arrivedÂ… and the formidable energy, that I could probably rule the world with, dissipated simultaneously.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â‘Ok, I am deadÂ…Â’</span><br><br>Â‘WahÂ… you woke up so early?Â’<br><br>Â‘Â…Â’<br><br>Angeline raised her brow, not expecting that sort of silence from me. She smiled, before proceeding with her usual standard procedure.<br><br>My emotions were intense, which cause my heartbeat to escalate and I wondered if she could detect the Â‘abnormalityÂ’ when she checked my pulse.<br><br>Â‘Why man? You are weird todayÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘ErmÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Yes?Â’<br><br>Â‘ErmÂ… ermÂ…Â’<br><br>Â‘Go onÂ…?Â’<br><br>Â‘Â… Since today is our last dayÂ… and ermÂ… probably we wonÂ’t see each other ever againÂ… I was wonderingÂ… ifÂ… ermÂ… we could still remain friendsÂ… after my hospitalization?Â’<br><br>I swore my heart almost jumped out after I said what I had just said eight seconds ago. What was worst was that: there was a pause. And this pause had seemingly brought me into an alternative dimension and got me trapped into some pocket of time, which spelled eternity.<br><br>Â‘YesÂ… we willÂ…Â’<br><br>With that, she stepped out of the ward to indulge in her work outside. Apparently, she seemed busy.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Â‘Siao liao lahÂ… ask also donÂ’t know how to ask properlyÂ… what does that mean manÂ…Â’ </span><br><br>(To be continued...)</div>
