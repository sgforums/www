              <p>Genetically identical twins may start off having the same genetic materials at birth. However, as they grew older, they will begin to differ from each other more and more. It is natural. Eventually, you will lead your own life.</p>
              <p>It is normal that people compare against each other. It is just human. However, everyone has its own niches and flaws, so how to compare equally in the first place?</p>

              <p>Take a holiday off to Phuket, and relax on a beach. Picture yourself sun-bathing on the white sand and crystal clear blue waters.. You will feel much better after returning back.</p>

              <p>Hi there, I know you are so desperate to feel happy. Whatever it takes, and you feel like doing, just do..go cycling or what..go swimming, float in da water and all that.</p>
              <p>I dono if u shld separate from your twin since u said she completes you. How about you share your fears with her? I'm sure as your twin she will be very, very very in tune with your feelings. She will understand (or try to, even if she can't), even tho u said she's the more outgg one of the two of you. Try not to keep comparing, though it's easier said than done.</p>
              <p>Ge you qian qiu. You are not her, she is not you. Even if you both look alike. That's where the similarities end. You both may have the same passions, same talents, same upbringing, same culture, same parents, same friends...but both of you are different ppl. A good analogy would be two leaves dat share the same stem. Do you think you would see the same veins on each leaf?</p>
              <p>If anything, you really want to chat about, you can pm me, I don't bite. And I'm a girl btw so no worries about anything.</p>

              <p>Good for you. You must now live a different life from your twin sister. YOu must tell yourself, you are yourself, you are not her, you do not live in her shadows.</p>
              <p>Suicide is not the answer. I had a friend who committed suicide. He told everyone that his life was terrible, he was suffering from depression and he felt his life was not going anywhere. He jumped out from the 13th floor. But years later, I wondered how he would have been had he lived on. I thought his life would have been much better. He never counted his blessings. First he had many friends, at school he was the "hot" guy - many chicks were after him, his studies were doing ok and most of all - his parents loved him so much. He wasted his life for nothing, his mom was so heartbroken because of his actions. I saw his mom cried terribly during his funeral. If he seen her sadness, he would surely not have jumped.</p>
              <p>So do not follow his example. There is no turning back for suicide.</p>
              <p>You must learn to love yourself. Count your blessings. Tell yourself, what is the positives in your life? Do you love school? Your parents care a lot about you? etc. I am sure you have been blessed.</p>
              <p>You must seek a hobby or interest. Something to get away from the shadows of your twin sister. Do something you like. Maybe drawing, art, martial arts, sports, comics, board games, etc. Anything to get your mind off her.</p>
              <p>If things get too stressful, you may consider doing what Julia Roberts' character did in "Eat, Pray, Love". You may find solace by going to an ashram in india to medidate and clear your mind. Or you can go backpacking in some poorer asian country, help you to see that there are people much worse than you and make you appreciate what you have in your life.</p>

              <p>Dear, you are still identical twins larh. You say you both are mirrored twins ma. Small differences like mono- and double eyelids don't matter. Parting all can change one mah, den which hand you write with also depends on which hand you both start griping pencils with.</p>
              <p>Fraternal twins do not look alike at all cos they are from two eggs.</p>
              <p>Does your twin also have this same problem? Cos you said u both got discuss suicide.. =S not good..</p>
              <p>Depression can be caused by genetics de...so even if it happen, it is not entirely your fault although you can still change it for the better. =) And that's not to say to give up cos it's genetics, but still must try, just that will be harder for youuu.</p>

              <p>The term twins may be used, but she is actually your sister, born not a year apart, but only by a few minutes.</p>
              <p>So she is your separate sister.</p>
              <p>You don't have to impose on yourself the expectations of others that you should be like your sister. People like to see the magic of exactness between twins. They will always compare, and that is annoying, and belittleing. You cannot control that, but you should tell them off.</p>
              <p>You are your own person. Just as your sister is her own person, and realised that sooner than you.You need to go your own way.</p>
              <p>Remember, if you compare yourself with others, you may become vain and bitter for always there will be greater and lesser person than yourself.

              <p>angel of darkness,let go gacha! :)))</p>
              <p>macha,that is so truth i think im the one keep using the term "twin".im the one feeling being part of the twin is special,when i never realised that being oneself can be special as well.everyone has the right to be here.</p>
              <p>Desiderata ,inside say avoid loud aggressive person,im going to be like that soon if i dun recover. hahaha later all my family and friend avoid me.</p>
              <p>Thanks you so much for the encouragment, i really feel better so much.I feel that my sister found her love,is the time to allow me to finally wake into sense from all this year of doubting. stand proud of being myself.</p>
              <p>And also i could listen to their love story,when i look at my sis and her lover into the love mood. i actually feel im in love also.I dunno whether it is a good thing la.</p>
              <p>and i could still have few more years or decade to imagine about my perfect dream husband or lover.anticipate for it.Good thing come to those who wait right.haha console myself.</p>
              <p>I don't know if my sister understand my feeling or not,i know i find myself very very emotional and if i grow up and look back i will laugh at all the things i have did.However ,i know that i feel this way because i never learn to appreciate my own artwork and life ,and only look at what other achieve.</p>
              <p>i always put in my heart in everything i do,i often imagine a perfect ending.And when things dont go my way.I say that life is being tough on me. lacking of confident.even though i understand what is happening to me,but sometimes i felt so lost. a lot of things is running in my head ,alot that i cannot focus in life anymore. little things like sweeping the floor ,or just eating a meal will send my mind into boundless of imagination and thoughts.</p>
              <p>Remember, if you compare yourself with others, you may become
                                      vain and bitter for always there will be greater and lesser person
                                      than yourself.im so afraid to admit that my sister is a greater person than i am. a lot of people tell me this phrase,and i often think that i want to be the one greater than her. that is why i cannot move on in my life.im all vain and bitter now.</p>
              <p>i will try to relax myself more,try not to push myself.i will focus teh right thing on the right time.Taking slow step.no matter how slow and steep the journey is i will walk out of this .:-)) learn to love myself more.thansk you everyone for the great advices.thanks you.</p>

              <p>Life is not about comparing, you compare only when your want to learn, comparing cannot be taken as jealousy or envying or in layman term, scare lose, kiasu, if you do that, the more you compare, the more worst you become frustrated and dissatisfy with oneself leading to long term depression that even medicine cannot compress it down.</p>
              <p>If really want to compare, there are tons and tons of comparison, not just only your pathetic sister, the best is to compare with those famine or people who lost their parents, siblings and house due to fire, or some other natural diseasters, then maybe you will feel very lucky to be here and have a very capable twin sister. God give you a pair of eyes to see far, to see many roads, to see the beautiful and the ugly of this world, not just narrow it to your sister capabilities. Depression is mostly self created due to inner having no peace with yourself, the ability to make your friend to be a good friend is nothing comparing to the ability to make an enemy to become true lovely sister</p>
