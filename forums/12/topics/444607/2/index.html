              <p>1 thing you have to understand to realize true happiness is... never compare yourself to others... you're only making yourself miserable... put it this way, some people born and immediately got AIDs, just waiting to die, if they want to compare, they will never be happy from the day they are born until the day they die because life is so unfair, they never do anything wrong it's not their fault... but life is unfair, you have to accept it and be happy with what God gave to you all the same...</p>
              <p>God never takes away anything from you... since the day you're born, you have nothing, everything else came from God... so how could he have taken anything when he gave you everything...</p>
              <p>You need to see the things you have, rather than the things you think you do not have. To compare oneself with others is an endless process, you can be the richest person but then you can also die of cancer like Steve Jobs at a young age so how do you compare? Age? Health? Intelligence? Looks? how do you predict the future that if you're smart/good looking/feeling healthy etc that you won't die of heart attack the next moment?</p>
              <p>Rather than worry about so many things, be thankful and appreciate what life has already given you. What you already have has some goodness in them. You must not lose hope. Hope is very important. Trust me, life is not as bad as you think it is... I mean compared to people born with hands and legs and born with a terminal illness, how bad can your life be?</p>

              <p>You know what. The only way to deal with suicidal people is not to give in to their self pity.</p>
              <p>Lets put it simply to you, nobody is going to give a damn about your funeral. Nobody but your family will turn up. If you are going to kill yourself, you are dying for nothing.</p>
              <p>People in Syria are getting killed and matyred because they fought for freedom. And you? You are wishing you die for the most stupidiest reasons, because you feel lonely after your sister gets a boyfriend. Come on !</p>
              <p>You need to grow up. We are not going to feed your self-pity. It is so negative.</p>

              <p>From one twin to another...</p>
              <p>Dear TS,</p>
              <p>I would say, I most certainly hv the same problems as you did for most part of my 50 years. Except maybe I was the better half in my early years. Now, he's more outstanding academically than me thru his hardwork. As an identical twins, we really look very much alike in our younger years.</p>
              <p>Very often we would get teased by friends that our spouses may mixed us up. Having our in-law mistaken us outside with our wives didn't help. What's worse were our "little names" given at home by our parents. Neighbours and friends made fun of our little name. Friends often mixed us up and sometime creating problems like us being "cocky". Having being in the same school and classes didn't help either. We were so alike during our young days that we almost have "telepathy" understanding each other without having to speak. Most time we fall ill together or after one another. Today, I take it that's because we were in the same roof to past on to each other our illness.</p>
              <p>But things took a change when we went to a different secondary school. We have different friends for the first time. Enviroment change also changed our personalities and behaviours. Our thinking changed mostly. My friends (I have little friends because I was abit shy in my young days) are mostly his friend and his are not so (He has alot of friends).</p>
              <p>What I can tell you is this. Be yourself. There's no point in comparing because you are you. Open up to have friends in the outside your sister's circle. Be generous! Wish her the best she can be. Strive to be the best yourself(comparing to yourself).</p>
              <p>Life's short. Why bother what other's think. You can only be you, so be the best you and stay happy.</p>
              <p>Regards</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Hi 7-11,</p>
              <p>im Glad to read your reply,:)</p>
              <p>We seperate at secondary school too! Due to academic result and also a little decision to try to study seperately in a new enviroment.</p>
              <p>And we have telepathy too! once she forget to bring her recorder to music lesson in primary sch ,she run back home to fetch it.And when she run back,i was in the school feeling very uneasy and worried.i knew something wrong will happen to her.she return school with the recorder with an injured knee as she fell into the drain.i often say this to everyone i meet .everyone call us "ah sian ,ah min"and i love when they call us this.</p>
              <p>sometimes we will sing the same song,speak the same word at same times.</p>
              <p>i also came to realised it is all because we live under the same roof have the same gene,sometimes it is just pure coincident.and just because we are twin,it make telepathy more conviencing.</p>
              <p>we often said if we fall in love if another set of twin it will be so wonderful.and i always tell everyone my greatest wish is to die the same time same day ,like the way we born. when i say all this i will cry infront of anyone.</p>
              <p>hahaha ,i m really happy that she found her another half first.</p>
              <p>and im all available and free to any man in this world. hahahaha lelong lelong,who want me. hahahhaa</p>
              <p>thanks 7-11 for sharing with me about your life.</p>
              <p>i wish you all the best in your future and now!</p>
              <p>thanks you all so much!</p>

              <p>And we have telepathy too! once she forget to bring her recorder to music lesson in primary sch ,she run back home to fetch it.And when she run back,i was in the school feeling very uneasy and worried.i knew something wrong will happen to her.she return school with the recorder with an injured knee as she fell into the drain.i often say this to everyone i meet .everyone call us "ah sian ,ah min"and i love when they call us this.</p>
              <p>sometimes we will sing the same song,speak the same word at same times.</p>
              <p>i also came to realised it is all because we live under the same roof have the same gene,sometimes it is just pure coincident.and just because we are twin,it make telepathy more conviencing.</p>
              <p>we often said if we fall in love if another set of twin it will be so wonderful.and i always tell everyone my greatest wish is to die the same time same day ,like the way we born. when i say all this i will cry infront of anyone.</p>
              <p>hahaha ,i m really happy that she found her another half first.</p>
              <p>and im all available and free to any man in this world. hahahaha lelong lelong,who want me. hahahhaa</p>
              <p>thanks 7-11 for sharing with me about your life.</p>
              <p>i wish you all the best in your future and now!</p>
              <p>thanks you all so much!</p>
              <p>twin no.2,ah sian .</p>

              <p>Hi.....</p>
              <p>I believe maybe your relationship with the whole twin thing....is unhealthy.....</p>
              <p>First of all.....stop bathing together......because you are already 20 years old......I believe the act of bathing together is making you unhealthily obsessed and attached to your twin.....Stop bathing together ok....</p>
              <p>Second....</p>
              <p>Dont worry about her getting a boyfriend and you will be left out....</p>
              <p>You will still see her and have a special relation with her because she is your twin sister, it doesnt matter that she has a boyfriend, married, has kids, you will forever still be in contact with her and talk to her and maintain relations. It doesn't mean you are cut off.</p>
              <p>Dont worry about that at all.</p>
              <p>Dont be so pessimistic.</p>
              <p>Third,</p>
              <p>Try to get your own friends, hobbies, activities, and even a boyfriend one day. And again, while at the same time, you still maintain relation with your twin sister and be close to her, just like other siblings and other twins do. It's possible to do both.</p>
              <p>If you have a healthy relation with your twin sister, and with other parts of your life (hobbies, interests, friends), you will not feel so depressed. You are feeling depressed because you are misadjusted. You are too attached to your twin sis.</p>
              <p>But you dont need to "escape" overseas either. Just start with something small.</p>
              <p>For instance, instead of taking a trip overseas, try taking a trip to a mall somewhere on your own, go there, read books, watch movies, go ice skating, or call your friends and hang out with them.</p>
              <p>Go do something that you enjoy.</p>
              <p>And I strongly suspect your bathing habit maybe contributing to your unhealthy attachment. Please stop bathing together with her.</p>

              <p>Hi veggie Bao,</p>
              <p>Thanks you so much for the great reply and advices.This morning we bath again,haha.Maybe cos the toilet in the kitchen is the most well-equipped with shampoo and stuff,that is why we just bath together and after that we go work together.</p>
              <p>This morning i tell her that i have came to wake into sense.Yesterday i saw an art article,an male artist he do a drawing of him and his twin brother .the title of the art is "he is a bit taller" which my sister is a bit taller than me too. The two twin brother both enjoy art in their own ways too.</p>
              <p>I came to realised that there are also so many twin around me ,why so i be so hard on myself.Maybe because im a female which tend to be more emotional.</p>
              <p>And there are conjoined twin that are born into this world.They too spend their life together in a special ways and live through thick and thin together .</p>
              <p>Yes i have decided to occupy myself with healthy lifestyle.Maybe it is time that im teh only daughter without a boyfriend and i can spend more time with my lovely dad and mum. I will try to get into a healthy lifestyle,into some sport and get myself into great body shape and look good to seduce more guys hahah joking.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Veggie bao thanks for all the advices i will try to avoid bathing with my sister too,cause she always put put ,pang sai in the bathroom when we bath.smelly lo.hahaha.</p>
              <p>Thanks you everyone !</p>
              <p>yesterday i started doing art i feel happy ,getting my interest back.And i listen to Carmen <span class="st"><em>habanera</em></span><span id="eow-title" title="æœ±å’ªå’ª -  å�¡é–€" dir="ltr"> ,å�¡é–€ to cheer myself up hhaha.</span></p>
              <p>However, my elder sis say im seeking attention from all the crying and all,she dont like me at all i know.i also feel that sometimes i cannot control my emotion,getting talkative and sometimes veyr moody black face.</p>
              <p>how can i control the way i feel and behave?Taking small trip right and dont lock myself in the room.i dunt wanan cry ever again,it is too silly.FROM 1/5/2012 onwards no more tears only a big bright smile planted on my face.:)</p>
