Till now sometimes, I still find it hard to forgive myself for treating my 1st gf badly, even though it had been more than 10 years.<br><br>But the thing is, people do move on. So while u are griefing over here, she has probably moved on in life, and get on with it.<br><br>So, shouldn't u too?<br><br>Everything takes time, no one is asking u to forget her at once.

Grief is appropriate. Healing is mandatory. Restoration is possible.<br><br>Nobody gets to live life backward. Look ahead, that is where your future lies<br><br>Let yourself be open and life will be easier. A spoon of salt in a glass of water makes the water undrinkable. A spoon of salt in a lake is almost unnoticed.<br><br>Don't be dismayed at good-byes. A farewell is necessary before you can meet again. And meeting again, after moments or lifetimes, is certain for those who are friends.<br><br>He who cannot endure the bad will not live to see the good.<br><br>Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.<br><br>you'll learn more from your accident than anything that you could ever learn in school.<br><br>Mishaps are like knives, that either serve us or cut us, as we grasp them by the blade or the handle<br><br>What does not destroy me, makes me stronger.<br><br><span style="color: red;">Watching you walk out of my life, doesn't make me bitter or cynical about love. It only makes me realize that if I wanted so much to be with the wrong person, how beautiful it will be when the right one comes along</span><br><br>It's hard to lose someone you love, to finally have to say goodbye. You try to be strong but the pain keeps holding on and all that you can do is cry. Deep within your heart you know it's time to move on, when the fairytale that you once knew is gone<br></div>
