It took me years to get over my ex though I initiated the break up and he was reluctant to let me go.<br></div>

And it kind of suck, to be honest.<br><br>But then, why do you feel heart-pain, when you think of her?<br><br>Instead of letting the separation overshadow the happiness, the joy and the love you two once shared, why not remember only the happy ones? Whether you choose to be happy or sad, life still goes on.<br><br>Remember the happy memories, and not let the separation cloud them, for they are once the best of your life.
