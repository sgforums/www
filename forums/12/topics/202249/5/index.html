When I was in the Navy, I had 2 go the Civil Defence Academy to learn fire-fighting. Those 3 days were tough. Imagine having 2 carry heavy equipment to fight fire, and then climbing on all fours in narrow spaces, and the risk of losing your own life too. If u go into CD, u probably will have 2 go thru this, and more.<br><br>Actually, no one wants 2 enter army, but after u come out of it, u will feel better, and  then next time when u come into the forum and read about how someone else don't want 2 go into Army, it will be ur turn to f*** them upside down, and scold them pussy</div>

You'll learn to make new friends inside....<br><br>You're not the only one who's afraid / detest / tired of entering the army... The fact is we really don't have much choices for now. The best advice I would rather give you for now is to EMBRACE IT with an OPEN MIND...<br><br>Make friends, gain experience, live a different lifestyle and meet different types of people... The more you try to step backwards, the more it'll approach you like a fearful monster...</div>

Most if not every single person who went through the Army felt anxious and apprehensive when they were in your shoes at this point in time.<br><br>What nobody here understands is the fact that instead of asking for tips on how to deal with your apprehension and anxiety, you asked for tips on how to skive and cut corners. Let me tell you this frankly: you are being utterly selfish when you do so. Every soldier who skives and does not do his duty properly will end up hurting many other good soldiers who simply want to do their job and go home in one piece.<br><br>One of my platoon medics under me (I'm a medic spec) had your mentality; he would skive and come up will all sorts of excuses to escape outfield missions. As a result of his frequent skiving, the rest of us had to take on his responsiblities on top of our own. And he had a nonchalant attitude towards treatment of casualties. As a result, his platoon mates would come to me when they're injured instead of him, adding on to my already heavy workload.<br><br>And at the same time, my senior commanders would give me hell for being unable to control him properly. And all this happened while he was happily sitting in the tonner waiting for the exercise to end.<br><br>Because he was thinking only about escaping responsibilities, the rest of us suffered. If you choose to run away from your responsibilities, others will suffer as well.<br><br>The problem is not the army; the problem is your mentality towards it. By your own admission you didn't train precisely because you had no motivation to do so. Then in that case, you should be working on your motivation problem. Tell yourself that if you want to be fit for the army, then you should get off your seat and do some exercise.<br><br>If you ask on how to deal with your anxiety and lack of motivation, everyone here will do their best to help you.<br><br>If you continue asking for tips on how to keng, be prepared for more flaming.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>its no point talking so much when  the actual problem is not being tackled.... YOURSELF.  Also notice you have written about alone with no one going with you to army, while your friend go Civil Defence....ha..ha.. you said it.. need company right? that's why even  more scare.   Guess you listen too much to them.. who ever told you so much ..all negative thoughts.  Of course, Who is not apprehenisve about going to some where you are not familiar and worse, thinking you will be suffering terribly.  Do you think you will not suffer in Civil Defence? Ha...Ha.. guess you are wrong to think so... only Army is tough?  just plain simple sense, you have are the problem rather than the topic you is talking about is the problem, therefore, its pointless since you are bend on not going...<br><br>You think with whatever health problem you have, you can get through easily.... depends..  MO are more scare to let you go then get themselves screwed up their own army carrer, that's what happen to my downgrading.... they only merely recomend, but not commend.  Ligament in my time.. are easy reason for downgrading... but not anymore with new knowledge and technology improvement.  So what even if you manage to be down grade.. you still have to serve your 2 yrs NS.  Be ware, some of the older batches of my time, during reservist period, they were upgraded from C to B... ended up doing reservist combat training.... things like FLat foot no longer a issue, cause they can cater to your feet specification.....  Think the more you try , may end up worse than what you expect .. .who suffer?  ... hope you can really "keng" your way out of AMRY........ if not complete and get it...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Depends on your attitude man...<br><br>Sometimes I think kengsters suffer more. Sure they may be excused the tought stuff at times but when it comes to the shit jobs and tanking all the stuff. Guess who is first on the list?<br><br>Being a kengster is a quick way to get on people's blacklist, esp. if you are putting in less effort then them and making them do stuff. Don't be surprised if you find yourself buring a lot more weekends and having your commanders wanting to charge you for the slightest mistake.<br><br>Everybody might be out to get you and you will end up the company scapegoat. Trust me, that is NOT fun.<br><br>And the MC trick won't work if you play it too much or if you are already blacklisted. In the end its up to the MO to endorse your external MC and believe me the citerial to is a lot stricter then paying 30 bucks to get out of trouble. Or worse the MO and your commanders pakat to keep you in camp with no hope of booking out doing stupid things. And nobody will pity you.<br><br>Sometimes the kengsters get into so much trouble for their actions just to get 2 or 3 hours of no-work time. It is so much easier to just do your part and leave it as that. You might get a little extra work here and there but in general people will respect your rest and book-out time, not to mention people are willing to HELP you when you need it.<br><br>Kengster? When you need help see all your buddies flee like flies or make things worse for you.<br><br>And here's a tip. Try not to talk too much about your medical conditions during BMT. It's a sure way to piss your commanders and fellow men off, and get on their blacklist. If you have one keep quiet about it and mention it only when it is necessary or really stopping you from doing some stuff. Believe me, your commanders can tell when you are really down for the count or when you are just using an excuse... I was a BMTC instructor.<br><br>It's all not that bad nowadays (in fact life is rather good), and hence there is less tolerance for people who like to wave their conditions around.<br><br>And frankly BMT makes you a lot fitter and more confident if you try your best. You don't need to ace everything at all but just go in there with the attitude to endure some pain to improve yourself. I went in as an IPPT 3 pointer and passed out managing to get into SISPEC. And I am not the kind who likes physical activity (unless its martial arts).<br><br>It's a good and eye-opening experience, as much as it caused me much sadness and pain at times. It makes you a more mature person if you are willing to be taught. I find it a waste for people to go in there and try to keng their way through suffering so much but learning nothing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I am a MT spec in the army. Very Very fun and in my opinion, life is more happening compared to life in poly days becos, my guys will do things beyond your imagination.<br><br>Dun worry too much abt how to go the sufferings during NS life but rather how you appreciate each phase of your NS life. i.e. knowing your buddies from BMT to your future unit. Its memorable.<br><br>Anyway, 2 years is really nothing compared to 2 1/2 years which I have gone through.<br><br>Cheer up. You will be a better man after this. You will think differently.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I was exactly like you 4 years ago when i came out of poly. I was scare of army. First i just want to say it is almost impossible to keng out of bmt, i believe you have to go no matter what happens. I become famous in just one day during my bmt school, i remember it was a route march and after  marching we had to take off our field pack and sbo and rifle and quickly assembled it. Somehow i got tangled up andi become the slowest guy to assemble my field pack. Then my sergeat will punish the whole school because of me and i remember i became famous from that day onwards. No body will sit with me during my meal time and even my buddy despised me, i know i am to blame for all this but deep down inside i feel terrible too. Finally towards my passing out parade, i contract dengue fever and was ooc just 2 weeks from pop. I was thrown to depths of hell thinking i had to recourse bmt all over again. I was posted to maju camp to be a store man awaiting recourse. At that time someone told me if i perform well as a storeman i may not need to go back to bmt again and i actually believe him. So i was under a tamil female warrant officer for 6 months. One day i was told i needed to go back for recourse, by this time i was not a blur recruit anymore and i knew i had to go and i had been training for a few months. At this time i still 3 more months left beofre my recourse, suddenly my female warrent officer traded my name to the RSM and i was attached to do permanent guard duty because i was of no use to her anymore. I plead with my warrent saying i had to prepare and train but she just did nothing. Anyway those 3 months remaining in maju camp was terrible as i had to do 24 hours guard duty session almost every day. I remember clearly by the end of 3 months i did 38 "24 hours guard duty session". Then i was sent packing off to tekong without even clearing my off. Fortunely i pass my bmt and was posted to sispec. Now i have ord and i just want to say please train hard and try not to avoid bmt. If someone as lousy as i am can pass it i think you should be able to do so.</div>
