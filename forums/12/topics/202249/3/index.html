Think that's a common problem among the guys...That's why SAF came out with 2 kinds of running shoes, with one design specially for those with flat foot!<br><br>There's no way you can downgrade until you dont need to go army, that's crap! please lah, be a man can or not? You only feel lousy now, but when you go in, you find everyone suffering like you, and end up will be fun! I was enlisted 5 years ago into Commando, life there sucks 10 times than in BMTC! Actually, now NS really changed a lot, so dont have have to worry... But I hate BMTC because they train sissy there...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't be botherrf by whatever..... just take it as it comes.... hello, nowadays, SAF changes so much unlike my time... 20 yras ago... things has changes so much and they are improving mind you.  so don't be alarm.  When you get in, you find out.  What's the point of trying to escape, because you will still have to to go eventually, only a matter of when.  Go through ocmplete it and start civilian life after 2 yrs.  I can only say this, My NS days were where I was moulded, like many say, become MAN.... where I build up my confidence, learn to command, leadership, team work,...etc ....  I serve 2.5 years and got out a better MAN then before I got in...  To me, that's the best of my time although I won't say the life is "good", but that's where I learn and find it fullfilling for me.<br><br></div>
