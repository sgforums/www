            <div class='col-md body'>To the threadstarter:<br><br>I have flat foot + heart murmur + elevated blood pressure + acute tinnitus + astigmatism. And I'm PES B.<br><br>Type all those terms in Google if you have no idea what they mean.<br><br>Just because you're flat-footed and asthmatic does not mean that you will be instantly downgraded to a lower PES status. It also has to do with the degree of your medical condition. If your medical condition isn't all that bad, then you will be considered combat-fit. Personally, my own flat foot didn't hinder my normal physical activities; I just can't stand straight for extended periods of time. As it stands, PES B means that they won't post you to the ultra-siong vocations.<br><br>You're going to be in the army; live with it. Finding ways and means to weasel your way out of the training and regimentation. Otherwise, I can tell you that you will always have a negative view of the army, and the Pygmalion Effect will come into play.<br><br>'What is the Pygmalion Effect?' you may ask. It is when something bad happens because you think it will happen. Since you keep thinking that you should try to weasel your way out of the army, you will never have a good army experience.<br><br>You should instead be learning more on how to cope with it both mentally and physically.</div>

Maybe when you are inside,you will learn what is one for all,all for one.If you think that just because you are better than some others and will not be punished cos of it,you will find yourself so fricking wrong.<br><br>And i can tell you with your kind of attitude even if other people may not be as fit as you initially but if they have the right attitude,you will still end up as  the sore loser in training in the end since you view that you cannot get better already while the others are all improving and going pass you,so continue to think like that,you will only end up being the loser in the end</div>

But then somewhere along the line i actually started enjoying it.You will do things you never thought possible.When i enlisted i did 20 pushes max. Now i'm doing 100 no problems. my 2.4 timing was 14mins...it was 12 before i got injured. Life is not easy in there i'll tell you that. But it's actually quite fun.<br>Go in there with and open mind.

I haven been excercising since ... sec 2? man... its gonna be hell.<br><br>I'm sure there's way to get downgraded right? I heard from my friends, they say its easy.</div></blockquote>Why is it unfair? U yourself didn't bother 2 train for the army at all, of course u are not going to keep up with the rest.<br><br>And pls, 90% of guys have gone through 2 1/2 years(previously) to 2 years of hell and TAKE IT AS A MAN. From this post, i can easily say that u are the person who will take the easy way out. Life, my friend is never a bed of roses. Welcome to the REAL WORLD.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>cb...havent go inside already thinking of ways to chao keng...don't u think it would be better to do something inside you can be proud of?<br><br>Let me put it this way. When a hot pretty chick you just met in a club asks you what are you doing in the army, would you rather say you're a combatant, or go "oh, i'm a clerk/driver/jia liao bee" (NO OFFENCE TO DRIVERS AND CLERKS, i know the pen is mightier than the sword) which do think turns the chick on more? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>So, up to you. If you're really medically unfit, then you cannot blame anyone. I've some friends who are really into the combat stuff, but unfortunately due to their medical status they are relegated to administrative vocations. My advice to you is to participate in every activity you can, but sound off when ur condition is hampering you. Don't use your physical condition as an excuse to skive, which i can already forsee you doing. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
