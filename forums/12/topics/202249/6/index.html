The black sheep of the platoon is almost invariably the one who takes every opportunity to keng.<br><br>I can tell lots of stories about my BMT platoon's black sheep who missed at least one-third of his BMT by taking external MCs and countless in-camp reporting sick. I just don't feel like slugging him online over things that are ancient history. Suffice to say, he was the most-hated guy in my platoon and BMT was hell for him.<br><br>To the threadstarter: if you ask us to keng, it means that you are asking us to create hell for you. As I've mentioned before, one of my men who keng-ed a lot was literally signing extras till the day he ORD-ed. I don't know about you, but in Aunt Agony, we help people out of their agony, not make it worse for them.<br><br>On top of that, you are also asking us to help you be cruel and unfair to your peers and commanders who have to work doubly hard and take lots of sh*t from above by your constant absence. That same subordinate of mine who keng-ed caused me to have extra workload - HIS workload. On top of that, I took lots of sh*t from my senior commanders who blasted me for not being able to control him.<br><br>Want hell? Fine. Go and keng then.</div>
