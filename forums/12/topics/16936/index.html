Now I understand why you were 'labelled' as pessimestic...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>Not like those above questions of yours never popped into my mind before...? But it was REAL LONG way back lah..... Why about hearing things from a MORE REALISTIC point of view.... Just like normally when 'Devils' whisper things of such nature as above to you... They also NEVER told you that....<br><br>(1)Human minds are GREAT... If not 'superb'.... But it's not like they come without limits....? Whatever you can store in your 'short term memory' is LIMITED... And your ability to RECALL is also LIMITED (Varies from people....) Rather than thinking that this friend of yours or that friend of yours are REALLY SELFISH creatures or only think about THEMSELVES and have no time to put you or a REAL GOOD FRIEND (gf/bf who can't THINK PROPERLY... LISTEN to this ALSO...) on his/her mind, why not think of his/her LIMITATIONs as a HUMAN...?? Hmm... Talk about SELFISH huh....? Try thinking about how SELFISH you've been as a friend also if you don't even give YOUR FRIEND a bit of FREEDOM on his/her mind to think of the things he/she need to attend to...? Or just let his/her wander...? Think of the RESPECT and MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING you should've given your friend....? COMEON... THINK....<br><br>(2) Though I have to admit that some people have REAL ATTITUDE PROBLEMS (Friend or NO friend). ALOT I believe are just their characters..... The kinda person they are which YOU cannot get used to... Next time you have that kinda thinking, see how your other friends are reacting to it...? If they're also giving NEGATIVE response, then THINK about why the person wanna do it in the 1st place...? USED to it? Can't control? Not bothered...? THINK.... If there's a REASON for him/her to be so, then there's an ANSWER to your THINKING...<br><br>(3) If you KNOW that your friend is giving you a LAME EXCUSE, why don't you just EXCUSE them...? May it be that they're TRULY TIRED, LAZY or whatsoever (For all you know they might not even be interested in YOUR ACTIVITIES... &lt;- Shouldn't force them to do things which they don't like to do right...?) they gave you A REASON.... Fact or not, they surely have their REASON (may it be the one they've told you or other hidden ones..) for doing so.... Before you start to blame them the NEXT TIME, try thinking of the moment when you gave yourself a little EXCUSE just to SPARE yourself from something..? Hmm....<br><br>Friends OR NOT, it's up to you to decide.... But COMDEMNING is EASILY DONE on others... And when that HAPPENS.... It could also be EASILY DONE on YOU.....<br>Time to take more rest my friend....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>------------------<br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....  DEVIL PHRASE II<br><br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>
