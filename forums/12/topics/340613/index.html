              <p>Pip, no I am not but I suspect someone has a crush on me,  falling in love, or just has a sexual attraction for a few years now.   I have been avoiding him (for your info I am a female).    Told friends about it and they all said he stalks me.   This is a juvenile, he has yet to grow up leh.    Have unpleasant encounters with him.    ONe day happened that we took the same lift, he was moaning loudly in the lift and I did not hesitate to look at him to embarass him but it did not work.    From then on he was fond of taking the same lift, witnessed him rushed into the lift when he saw me waiting for lift, I immediately walks away.   Scary to take the same lift with him.    A couple of times,   when he saw me he just sat down with legs opened wide apart and stared at me with dirty look.   Yee yucks, pui!   My good friend in fact advised me to be very careful of him.</p>

              <p><br>er gosh... this kinda is not crush la.... a crush is something like, u like some1 but u dun dare to him/her to noe.. like kinda secert admire thing...</p>
              <p>the way this juvenile is doing seems more like a pervert to me instead of a crush lae...he doing to the extreme somemore....</p>
              <p>i think ya, best way is to avoid him, try not take same lift with him ... if he still persist then maybe u warn him that u will call police for sexual harassment .. try scaring him away..</p>

              <p><br>er gosh... this kinda is not crush la.... a crush is something like, u like some1 but u dun dare to him/her to noe.. like kinda secert admire thing...</p>
              <p>the way this juvenile is doing seems more like a pervert to me instead of a crush lae...he doing to the extreme somemore....</p>
              <p>i think ya, best way is to avoid him, try not take same lift with him ... if he still persist then maybe u warn him that u will call police for sexual harassment .. try scaring him away..</p>

              <p>He is tracking me for very long already.  Worst, he knows which unit I stay, scary leh.   He knows when I go to the food centre near my house and will be there to look, stare at me.   He will be sitting at the area downstairs my block at night, sometimes very late at night.   I know this for I am monitoring him very closely.   Once if it warrants for report to police, I will give him the honour of letting his inappropriate behaviour be recorded by the police.</p>
              <p>There was once when I was talking to a couple of people in the food centre, he just appeared from nowhere and stood there staring at me as if expecting me to do as he pleased. When I saw him, i just walked away.   Too bad, those people whom I talked to were sitting with their backs facing him.   The next couple of weeks later, he complained to his friend in the food centre about me and the friend stared at me with disgust and anger.   This is really bitchy of him to do such to me.    If he genuinely wants to be friend that is not the way to go.   I believe he is only interested in my body. </p>
              <p>No worry, I am finding ways and means to avoid him.   I change time to go to food centre and market already.  </p>
