            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all. Does it matter if a couple both of different race go out together?<br>i have been getting STARES from countless ah pehs and ah sohs and ah longs and ah bengs whenever i am out with my gf. its so irritating. Despite the multi racial slogan of singapore, it seems that the citizens do not seem to understand the meaning of it or are they very old fashioned?<br>i have seen countless mixed race couples on the streets as well. Whenever i walk past coffeeshops etc, i see those bloody uncles looking at my gf i feel like punching them. my gf has told me to ignore them say that they are lik ethat one but sometimes i cant stand it. Once yesterday one trishaw man even had the cheek to say that my gf chose me is it because my dck is very big. hear this make me so bloody angry when my gf told me about it. but too late cause the trishaw old man had already rode off. wherever we go, we seem to be the center of attraction. btw she is chinese and i am malay but look like indian.<br>very pissed initially but now i am less pissed but still pissed..haha... if u know what i mean...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually, its normally the older generation who view this concept of interracial relationships as a novelty to them. Its just like the same thing in the US. Relationships between the blacks and white. I used to have a Eurasian,Chinese,Malay and Caucasian gf and i guess i am widely accepted by my friends as they have nothing to object about but normally, i usually get questions from hawkers etc (the Generation A) whether i am not proud to be of my own race. Actually, i am proud of my own race be it mixed(which i am). Even my gf is mixed blood.<br><br>As time goes by, i think the society will slowly learn to accept such intteracial relationships in their daily tidbit of life and hopefully, not staring at such abnormalities<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

I do try to ignore most of what is happening. Sometimes i do ask my gal why she is so pretty that everyone tends to always look at her.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think race does matter. I have half french and chinese, yet I cant get dates at all from any girls... my friends say I should be alright and should have no prob...but yet I am still single and lonely. I feel like I am being shunned cos of my race... cos its like when talking to girls,,,, no conversation ever comes back my way. I find it extremely hard to get an interracial relationship going, one guy said to me " wtf r u doing here, you should go back to France and find a girl there, don't take our girls". I feel so dirty sometimes cos I am not of pure blood, perhaps if i was pure chinese I would be accepted...but i am mixed... even though I am part chinese... the same blood as the girls i like to chase, i think its my western side/culture difference that drives them away.<br><br>Yet some of you people are mixed and can have gf, i wonder how? But I think it is probably cos you are mixed...but your mix is Asian and Asian...not like mine.... Asian and something completely heathen; caucasian blood. So maybe that's why you people can hit it off...cos you all fall under the same group: Asian/asian/mix?</div>
