            <div class='col-md body'>Woot my virgin post ^^<br><br>Okay going back to the topic, seeing from how u ex treated u during ur O`s i personally feel that he doesn`t deserve your trust once again. He had it once and abused it. Chances dun come again that easily. However if you cant bring yourself to totally let go of him i suggest u can put him under a trial period. This can let you see if he has really changed for the better. But if he still doesn`t learn how to cherish you its time to let him go and get a move on.<br></div>

Most probably.<br><br>Don't turn back.<br>He is immature. (Have read your Nov thread).<br>He knows nothing about commitment.<br>He will treat you nice now but his devil horns will appear anytime.<br>By going back, you are encouraging him to cheat again because he will think that he can get you back whenever he wants. So, you become his spare tyre or float.<br>You will likely to regret if you go back.<br>So, give up on him.<br><br>Make more male friends.<br><br>Cheers!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey i understand how u feeling cos i've been thru this.. it's definitely a hard decision to make.. i chose to patch up the other time cos i noe i loved him dearly.. but frankly it's hard to build up the trust... when there's small incidents of cold attitude from him, it might jus link u to the tot of whether he's flirting wif other girls again or stuff... lots of emotional warfield involved if u do patch up..<br><br>sad to say mine did hurt me again after the patch..so u haf to be prepared for this: getting hurt again is a high chance... if u're willing to go thru all these 'stress', u might consider a patch up...make the decision base on his character.. is he usually the guy who will keep to his promise sort.. is he the playful kind.. is he the ego kind.. most importantly ask urself u still love him? if u do patch up rmb if he does hurt u AGAIN, nv turn back to him AGAIN!  all the best girl!</div>
