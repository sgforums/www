            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Guns And Roses </strong></span><br><br>In December 2002 I went to visit the 'Sook Ching' (Cleansing) Chinese victims WW2 memorial at the Esplanade in my country of Singapore. There I touched a large black urn that symbolises the dead ashes of those victims. These were the ashes of the cremated bodies of Chinese found all over Singapore after the WW2 ended, especially, at the Changi Point Beach whereby they were gunned down by the thousands. It reminded to all the people of Singapore not to be like the Imperial Japanese during WW2 and looked at the intolerance and atrocities committed by Imperial Japan, in Singapore and Nanking of mainland China during WW2.<br><br>After that I went to the war memorial of WW1. It was at the Esplanade too. There I silently offered a prayer of peace to them. Near the vicinity there is a 'shrine' for Tan Bok Seng (The War Hero of Singapore). He was trained by the British in India to lead the men of Force 136 and fought the Japanese Occupation of Peninsula Malaya and Singapore during WW2. He was captured and tortured by the Kampetai (equivalent to the Gastapo). He died during captivity. There I said a prayer to him.<br><br>My father went for a tour to Europe in 2003. Besides visiting the beautiful places of interest in Europe, Jew's Concentration Camps of WW2 in Europe were included part of the package. He said that while he was there he felt the most mystified feelings because the ovens and gas chambers were all still there as though it were only yesterday they had cleared the camps. He showed me the pictures he had taken and I took a looked at it.<br><br>Then I asked my father whether he knew anything more about Osman Bin Komeng. He said that once Osman told him that he put people on to the lorries (trucks) for work assignments. That was about all he said to me, but in my mind and in my heart I knew he sent those people to be executed or the PoWs and civilians alike were sent to the railway station bound for force labour of constructing the railways (Death Railways) in Burma.<br>I went to Changi Point Beach where the Chinese victims were executed in WW2 just to reflect what it was like for them to face the Japanese firing squads. I said a prayer of peace to them and apologised on behalf for my uncle's sins.<br><br>I went to the Changi Chapel and Museum just outside Tanah Merah Prison near the vicinity of Changi Prison, to view the atrocities committed by the Japanese and to read the notes of those living loved ones and survived PoWs to their fallen brothers in arms during WW2. There were notes; flowers, pictures and even medals pinned on the board for visitors to express their hearts.<br><br>I went to the Kranji WW2 War Memorial of the Commonwealth Soldiers to see their names written on the walls. You can see men and they all saw the mankind war with sorrow. I said my peace and prayers to them within my soul and talked to them to make me a better man than I was in the past. In the beginning there was nothing. Then there were pictures and signs. And these pictures and signs became words and the words form into meaningful things. The word is, "My Soul is wiser too." I have done my part to apologise to the world for Osman on earth and in heaven.<br><br>"As one ex-prisoner of war when visiting a fellow survivor, <strong>"Have you forgiven those who imprisoned you yet?"</strong><br><br>The survivor said, <strong>"No, I haven't. Never." </strong><br><br>The first veteran said, <strong>"Then somehow they still have you in prison."</strong><br><br>Quoted from the book 'A Path With Heart' written by Jack Kornfield.<br><br>The constructions of Changi British Military Base were completed in the thirties. It was the fortress of Singapore that was supposed to withstood any foreign armies invasion. Changi Gaol was the memorial for many WW2 Commonwealth veterans and they came every year to honour their friends in Heaven. I was imprisoned at Changi Prison from Feb 1996 to November 2002, for a cheating crime. It was the memories of the past that I have gained so much learning about myself. Is there such a thing as Karma? You have read about my past life and my present life. That is Karma for me.<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Zulkifli Mahmood<br><br><a href="http://www.thetrenchmovie.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thetrenchmovie.com/</a><br><br></div>

Well, we are talking about the Vietnam war era here and most Westerners would see this part of the world as a terrible place to be at that period of time because there were wars, diseases, poverty and etc. Now, this part has been able to maintain peace and I wish there is no more wars to fight amongs us or amongs mankind.<br><br><strong>Quinn</strong> wrote:<br><br><strong>"I do remeber the rich Muslims going to expensive hotels in Kuala Limpur to engage in all the vices forbiden in the Koran."</strong><br><br>It happens in all faiths. They have their freewill to choose the good and the bad. I find it rather interesting why they do that, I mean not only amongs Moslems but in believers from other faiths too. This is what I call Human Nature and its the will of theirs against or for the religious precepts. I have no quarrels with them and so, I let them be as long as they do not stop me from doing something I love or like to do and they are not standing in my way. So far so good and if I cannot do those things I like to do, then I just go away to another place where I could or else I just tolerate and keep my mouth shut.<br><br><strong>Quinn</strong> wrote:<br><br><strong>"My money (US dollars) went a long way back then though"</strong><br><br>I think its still does though it is not as much as in your time back then, but if you are talking about going places like Thailand, Indonesia, The Philippines and Indo-China, US dollar is still the main currency that most people would like to trade for.<br><br>Hey, thanks for the respond.

I just got back from Johor Baru and I am now in Singapore for a few days.<br><br>I will be most delightful to have this conversation with you Quinn. Really interesting discussion here we are having but is this alittle out of the topic from the current objective and motive of this group. I hope the other members within this group do not mind of our little 'foreign affairs' discussion here.<br><br><strong>Quinn </strong>wrote:<br><br><strong>"I can understand people who do not accept the death penalty on spiritual grounds."</strong><br><br>I don't really consider my opinion as on spiritual ground, rather on moral values. I am not religious or pious myself for your information. However, we cannot deny too that moral values originally derived from spiritual or religious beliefs. That came to be adhered by many after they have or had done their part to become good and faithful believers. I would think of that as a way to make humans more civilized and perhaps more intelligent or conscientious in looking at serious matters from various angles before we could actually judged and condemned someone to death.<br><br>I for one would like to know who was the one that had actually found out that death sentence is inhumane and unjust. You know of any or anyone? Let me know please. I think that would be Jesus himself if I am not mistaken.<br><br><strong>Quinn</strong> wrote:<br><br><strong>"I just do not number among them."</strong><br><br>Well, I guess you have your own equal rights as to those who opposed to the death sentence too. It is like a counter check balance mechanism like in any countries that uphold human rights and human freedom.<br><br>As for myself, I changed my opinion and view pertinent to the death sentence after..lets say...I had heard about seven years of young and old people death cries just minutes before they were executed. That really altered my mind and I wish you could hear them too just like I did in the past. Then you will see what I mean and why I changed my stance.<br><br>I was like you thinking that they deserved it and at the end, I realized that I am also a man and I could also make minor or major mistakes in my life. It is a matter of being at the right time, place and last of all, the condition or circumstances which will follow as you think or decide what is best option or action or what is most important to make the problem stopped or to control it completely.<br><br><strong>Quinn</strong> wrote:<br><br><strong>"There are some crimes that demand the person be executed. Consider the Nazi war criminal at the Nuremberg trials."</strong><br><br>Well, Hitler got off easy by committing suicide. And Mussolini was hanged by the partisans.<br><br>In wars, many would like to see those responsible or irresponsible for the devastation and suffering of humankind during the war, be punished and terminated. Justice and the laws...my good man...is the law that can be broken or upheld. It cannot be denied for a fact that those directly involved should be punished and put to death when it is justified or lawful...just to please and satisfied the sufferers, victims, friends and next of kin of those whom had perished in wars or in murder cases for instance.<br><br>I think if they want to see those responsible to suffer for the loss of lives of their loved ones, death sentence is an easy means of escape for the condemned. I would rather have those responsible be sentenced to life imprisonment till death for that would be like hell for them on earth. That is like a formal restitution for them to see what they did is cruel or sadistic; it came out from nowhere or through mandatory orders when they were to obey the instructions or not thinking straight or refused to listen to their conscience. They might even learned something out from there and changed to become a better person instead. That is Mercy; and Life should be cherished and not destroyed.<br><br>I guess you have not seen those who were tortured to death and those who were exterminated from gun fires or hanged till death in your life time. So am I but I have heard the death cries almost every week. I know it is not a pleasant thing to see and it will make you sicked when seeing it itself make you think of yourself whether you are a human being or an untamed animal.<br><br>Soldiers fought in battles will tell you what it is like seeing death coming from everywhere. I guess you have seen some combat actions before like as my uncle did during WW2. Vietnam war is one good example. Was the North Vietnamese cruelty or The Americans cruelty, that put the people of Vietnam to look at their country history as a nightmare world? Where are the war criminals and death sentence for war perpetrators from both countries. None I guess.<br><br><strong>Quinn</strong> wrote:<br><br><strong>"I most certainly agree with you there sir. If we could put an end to war this Earth could become a paradise."</strong><br><br>Yes, it would be but I know that it is only a wishful thinking or an etopian dream for most politicians or world leaders. There is always war when we see ourselves as not one race and one world. Objective of that would make most of us think like many of us who like peace and harmony. That would take a few thousand years more or never at all, depending on what we do now for the future of mankind. Any suggestion from your part perhaps Mr Quinn.<br><br><strong>Quinn</strong> wrote:<br><br><strong>"Unfortunately, war is in our human natures too."</strong><br><br>Like the gladiators' battled in the coloseum during the Roman Empire era. Well, the meaning of self defense and a country defense for survival and protection became a world pandemonium for more control over wealths and mineral resources within its own sovereignty and abroad. Like in the ancient period of many great conquerors throughout the histories of past mankind.<br><br>Thanks again and shall we end this or look forward to make this into a context for word of advise to the world leaders.<br><br>With Love,<br>Joe<br><br><a href="http://quinnp1@aol.com" rel="nofollow">quinnp1@aol.com </a>wrote:<br><br>In a message dated 11/24/2006 12:20:30 AM Mountain Standard Time, writes:<br><br><strong>zulkifli</strong> wrote:<br><br><strong>"...I had heard about seven years of young and old people death cries just minutes before they were executed.

I was in the Artillery Unit and I have never seen any combat action during my military service.<br><br>However, my uncle had been forced to enlist into the Japanese Imperial Army during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore in WW2. He was a junior officer and he was assigned to guard, capture and also maybe oversaw the execution of the captured escapees of the Commonwealth Allied Forces PoW military personnel and the local collaborators with the allied forces.<br><br>In 1945, during the close of the war, his company was sent to Peninsula Malaya perhaps to reinforce the defense lines of the Japanese Army but my father told me that his brother was sent to Burma which, he was also unsure. His family was unsure where my uncle was sent to for his military duty. When the war ended, my uncle did not return home. My father's family waited for his returned and they had enquired for his whereabout. There were no news. Finally, they gave up hope and concluded that he was probably killed in action...or was executed.<br><br>As for myself, I had served a 10 year prison sentence in Changi Prison (an old prison whereby in the past it housed the WW2 PoWs) from 1996 to 2002 for a cheating crime that I had committed in 1991/92.

Were<br>there myriad of souls travelling in space before earth cooled down?<br><br>Joe.<br><br>Extracted from 'Stephen Hawking's Universe' by David Filkin, page 9.<br><br><strong>FOREWARD</strong><br><br>David Filkin approached me in 1994 to suggest a television series along lines similar to my book A Brief History of Time. I was enthusiastic about the idea. There had been a film with the same title as the book but, althought it had been good, it had contained a lot of biographical material and had not had time to go as deeply into the scientific and historical background as a whole series could. I wanted as many people as possible to share my feelings of<br>wonder and excitement at the discoveries we are making. It is only a few thousand years since the human race ceased to be hunter gatherers and settled down to farm the land. This led to the development of written language and records in which knowledge about the universe around us could be acumulated and handed down to successive generations. Our rate of progress has been uneven. Although the foundations were laid by the ancient Greeks, there was little advance and indeed considerable back-sliding until the end of the fifteenth century. But since then, we have been moving forward in our understanding at an ever-increasing rate, particularly in the present century. We have discovered new forces and the laws which govern them. We have also found that the universe itself is not just a passive background in which events take place but that it has a dynamic and evolution of its own. One of our greatest discoveries has been that the universe has not existed forever but that it has a definite beginning in the Big Bang, about 15 billion years ago. We don't yet know whether the universe will come to an end in a Big Crunch, but we can be sure that it woun't be for at least another 15 billion years. To understand the beginning and the possible end of the universe, we will have to unify Einstein's General Theory of Relativity with the Uncertainty Principle of quantum mechanics. We are making remarkable progress in this endeavour but Nature is subtle and continues to surprise us. The ultimate goal of a complete unified theory could be just around the corner, but it could also be just beyond our grasp.<br><br>Stephen Hawking, Cambridge, 1997<br><br>Extracted from 'Stephen Hawking's Universe' by David Filkin, page 250.<br><br><strong>Knowing the mind of God</strong><br><br>It might seem all too easy to make the same mistakes as earlier generations, and assume that our present view of the universe has to be the ultimate explanation. After all, in their day, the Ptolemaic and Newtonian models of the universe also looked unquestionable right. Compared with them, the Big Bang model of the universe is still in its infancy. But these earlier models of the universe were proved wrong by dramatic steps forward in what we could learn from observation. Ptolemy and the cosmologists of his time used incredible ingenuity to construct a working model of the universe from observations with the naked eye alone. Galileo's telescope showed us more details of the solar system and proved Ptolemy's model wrong. Newton developed a theory of gravity which made sense of the observed solar system 300 years ago; then Hubble's observations, we have put telescopes in space and observed as far back in the history of the universe as we know it is possible to look. It is not as if there is much scope for improved observation to show us anything more; it seems that we have now seen almost all of the visible universe.<br><br>With so much knowledge of our universe, it may not seem too immodest to say that we are close to understanding what it is and how it works. Even though perhaps 90 per cent of the universe remains undetected, since we have yet to discover all the dark matter, we can deduce enough about it to understand its role. Until we do detect it and know what its total mass is, the ultimate fate of the universe must remain a mystery. But, even here, we have a clear idea of the possible alternative endings.<br><br>But this is far from saying that we understand almost everything about the universe. Knowing its dynamic history does not even begin to address some of the eternal philosophical questions, such as why is the universe here? Or, what is it all for? The principles of science alone may not be able to answer these questions. But Stephen Hawking is confident that progress in cosmology can only improve the chances of us finding good answers to such questions. Knowing how the universe works must help inform our thinking on why it exists, whether or not it was created, and whether or not it has a<br>purpose. At the end of A Brief History of Time Stephen concludes that, if we<br>do discover a complete theory of everything, its basic principles and<br>implications should in time be understandable by everyone. And, once we all understand the true nature of the universe, we can all take part in the discussion about why it exists. Should we ever resolve that question, he suggests, it will be 'the ultimate triumph of human reason - for then we will know the mind of God'.<br><br>Perhaps, for many of us, that challenge will seem a step too far. There are millions of us who have never before got close to discovering the nature of the universe. We may just not have tried; more likely we were convinced that it was beyond our limited capacity to understand. Simply to know the nature of the universe, as Stephen Hawking and cosmologists throughout history have been able to understand it, may give us as complete and as satisfying a context for our lives as we need.<br><br>From: Saitia<br>To: masteryofself@yahoogroups.com<br>Sent: Monday, February 02, 2004 2:45 AM<br>Subject: Re:[Mastery of Self] Our Home of Origin and Intelligence<br><br>Hey Joe,<br><br>On Sunday, February 1, 2004, at 09:54 AM, Zulkifli Mahmood wrote:<br><br><strong>"Maybe we need to see more about the universe to understand the meaning of our existence and along the way, we must always be open to ideas and must be open to others who wish to see mankind as one race.

I believe humans can become one race when there is no more ethnics for them to see themselves a human of that race. I believe that humans can beome one race when there is no more religions for them to see themselves a believer belonging to a superior god. I believe humans can become one race when there is no more greed within them, only love of life within all of us. Mankind is the greatest enemy to life and natures on earth. When you read the history of mankind that are recorded, its the manner humans put themselves above other humans that caused billions of humans to suffer and perish. The knowledge of man and god that our ancestors bequeath to us is not enough for human race to become one race, in fact it caused more humans to asunder themselves after that knowledge were known to them.<br><br>Most world leaders do not mixed religions with politics because it will only caused more insecurities than security for their people. Many past ancient prophets tried to do that but many too were prosecuted and killed for trying to do that for god.<br><br>When will humans become one race then? No one can answer that question. We can only hope that it will happen but those humans that hold high positions will say to those who believe in the united nation of one human race, "That is wishful thinking".<br><br>Yes Saitia, we will survive the physical body death. Those who feel its time for them to leave earth life will go to other mansions for new adventures and new worlds in space. They have conquer time and space.<br><br>Thank you Saitia for allowing me to speak to your group. god bless.<br><br>Love,<br>Joe</div>

It was getting late in the day, and he knew that he needed to stop to rest. However, he was thirsty and needed to find water before he slept.<br><br>He met a white haired old man sitting on a rock by the side of the road. The young man asked him if he knew of a place where he could find water to drink. The old man said that if the young man stayed on the path he would come to a small stream. However, it would be after dark before he would reach the stream. The old man told the traveler that he could safely drink there. The old man further said that if he would pick up a handful of pebbles from the stream bed, the young man would be both glad and sad. The young man thanked the old man and continued on his journey.<br><br>Sure enough, even though it was quite dark, the young traveler found the stream. He took a drink. The young man thought it silly to pick up pebbles, but just for curiosity he picked up a handful and put them in his pocket. He then found a place to sleep a short distance away from the stream.<br><br>When he woke up, the young man remembered the pebbles. He shoved his hand into his pocket and brought them out. As he looked at them in amazement, the young man simultaneously felt great sorrow and great happiness for there in his hand lay beautiful, sparkling jewels. Quickly he rushed back to the stream to get more. He frantically searched through many hands full of ordinary pebbles, but the opportunity was gone. As he looked at the beautiful jewels, the young traveler felt so sad that he did not pick up many more At the same time he was happy that he had at least picked up those that he had.<br><br>So it is with us. If we are wise, we will listen to and follow wisecounsel. In life, we can't go back. We need to find joy in good choices and experience sorrow for opportunities lost.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="large"><strong>A Wise Old Monkey </strong></span></span><br><br>A king used to maintain a group of monkeys for providing entertainment for his sons. The monkeys were very nicely fed with sumptuous delicacies everyday. The leader of the monkeys was well-versed in the scriptures of like wise personalities  and he used to teach the other monkeys these scriptures.There was also a pack of sheep in the king's palace and the little princes used to ride them for fun. One of those sheep was very fond of eating anything from the palace kitchen. The cooks in the kitchen had to beat the sheep quite often to prevent it from causing mischief.<br><br>The monkey leader thought that this kind of behaviour every now and then may result in something disastrous for the monkeys in the long run. "The sheep are extremely gluttonous and the cooks, on the other hand, are very adept in beating the sheep with whatever they find at hand. In case the cooks at any time start hitting the sheep with a burning stick from the fire, then the furry body of the sheep would surely start burning.When such a burning sheep starts running around in frenzy and by chance enters into the nearby horse stable, then the hay inside will catch on fire and the entire stable along with its horses will be ablaze in no time. One ancient  animal husbandry book prescribes that burns on horse flesh can be healed by animal skin obtained from monkeys. Accordingly, the king will have the monkeys killed."<br><br>Apprehending thus, the wise old monkey leader called on all the monkeys confidentially and told them, "In a place like this where the sheep and the cooks are in constant confrontation, we, the monkeys, are sure to meet with our destruction. So, let us take refuge in a forest somewhere before we are destroyed en masse."<br><br>But the arrogant young monkeys did not have anyrespect for the wise old monkey's advice. They simply ridiculed the old monkey, saying, "You must be under some sort of delusion due to your advancing age, and so you are talking like a lunatic. We are not interested in leaving the palace for forest life only to live on distasteful fruits; here we are being fed with nectarean varieties of foodstuffs by the princes themselves."<br><br>Upon hearing the puffed-up monkeys retorting like this, the old monkey told them with tearful eyes, "O fools, you do not know the results of such pleasure. Don't you know this will be ultimately destructive for you! So let me leave for the forest alone - I don't want to see your deaths."<br><br>Saying thus, the monkey-leader started for the forest, leaving behind all the other monkeys.Following this, one day that greedy sheep entered into the kitchen.The cook struck the beast with burning firewood. Immediately the sheep started crying and ran straight into the nearby horse stable. As the sheep, with the fire all over its body, started rolling desperately over the hay-stack kept in the stable, the entire pavilion caught fire and many of the horses were burnt to death while the others just ran amok, resulting in a great consternation all over.<br><br>The king immediately summoned his veterinary surgeon for the treatment of the horses. The surgeon quoted Salihotra's prescription that monkey's tallow was essential for the quick healing of the burns suffered by the horses. So the king ordered that treatment should immediately be undertaken to save the horses, and accordingly he also issued his instructions to kill the monkeys to collect their tallow. The monkey leader got the news and was very much depressed.<br><br>Those who contemplate that the ageing advisor  might be under delusion and may not know more than a common person knows, and instead of following him follow evil companions, will certainly meet with a disastrous end.</div>

It may seem<br>like remaining withdrawn will keep us protected from the world, but<br>during these times it is important to reach out to those trusted and<br>precious people who care about us the most. Even with our best<br>information and reasoning, we never know when someone else's<br>experience or perspective can give us additional information that we<br>need. The universe speaks to us through many channels, and when we<br>open ourselves up to receive its messages, we also receive nurturing<br>care from a loving partner in life's journey.<br><br>Grief is part of the human experience, and sharing our vulnerability<br>is what creates truly close bonds in our relationships. Opening<br>ourselves up in this way gets to the core of our being, past all of<br>our defenses and prejudices. When life seems to crack the outer<br>shell of our world, we are both raw and fresh at the same time. It<br>is then that we discover who is truly willing to walk with us<br>through life. We also see that some of those sent to us may not be<br>the ones we expected to see. Regardless, we learn to trust in the<br>universe, in others, in our own strength and resilience, and in the<br>wisdom of life itself.<br><br>Sharing grief allows us to ease our burden by letting someone else<br>help carry it. This helps us process our own inner thoughts and<br>feelings through the filter of a trusted and beloved someone. We may<br>feel guilty or selfish, as if we are unloading on someone who has<br>their own challenges. Although, if we think about it, we know we<br>would do the same for them, and their protests would seem pointless.<br>Remember that not sharing feelings with others denies them the<br>opportunity to feel. We may be the messenger sent by the universe<br>for their benefit, and it is on this mission that we have been sent.<br>By sharing our hopes and fears, joys and pains with another person,<br>we accept the universe's gifts of wisdom and loving care.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>What are the odds?</strong></span><br><br>The only time probability matters is when you have no influence or control over the situation, such as in the random roll of dice or the spin of a roulette wheel. For everything else, it's not the odds that make the real difference; it's what you actually do.<br><br>What are the odds of succeeding in a particular profession given your background? What are the odds contracting a particular disease?<br><br>Actually, for things like these the odds are really meaningless. Any specific outcome depends on your individual situation and on what you choose to do about it.<br><br>Those who make the commitment to succeed, and do whatever is necessary, will reach success regardless of what the odds might say. Those who depend solely on the odds to keep them in good health, and don't do anything about it themselves, will not have very good health.<br><br>Instead of pursuing things that will merely improve your chances of success, go directly toward the success itself. Keep in mind that the specific results you get are based on your own thoughts and actions, not on the statistical averages.<br><br>Rather than letting the odds give you a false sense of confidence or a wall of unwarranted fear, focus on the things you can actually control. Take full responsibility for your own outcomes, and you'll end up going precisely where you choose to go.<br><br>-- Ralph Marston</div>

Its appended below.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>Joe<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Pay It Foward</strong></span><br>Author: Joshua Goodling<br><br>I don't know if you've seen the movie entitled "Pay it Forward". It<br>was produced in 1998, and told the story of a boy who when challenged<br>by his history teacher to come up with an idea that would "change the<br>world", came up with the thought that everyone should pass on to<br>others the kindness and help that others have given to them. It is<br>one of my favorite movies. We too often think about ourselves instead<br>of thinking about others.<br><br>Those who bring sunshine into the lives of others, cannot keep it<br>from themselves. Kindness and compassion for others is quickly<br>becoming a lost art in today's fast-paced world. It seems everyone is<br>so busy thinking about themselves, and their own wants and desires<br>that they forget about anyone else.<br><br>(Above excerpt is from a previous thread, see entire thread)<br><br>I came across this YouTube video I wanted to share with members.<br>(Duration 8:35)<br><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qjj2uFxz60" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Qjj2uFxz60</a><br></div>

When experiencing a broken heart, our ethereal selves are<br>saturated with grief, and the overflow is channeled into the<br>physical body. Loss becomes a physical emptiness, and longing is<br>transmuted into a feeling that often cannot be put into words.<br>Mending a broken heart can seem a task so monumental that we dare<br>not attempt it for fear of damaging ourselves further. But<br>heartbreak, like all emotions, falls under the spell of our<br>conscious influence.<br><br>Often the pain that wounds us most deeply also leaves the most<br>enduring mark upon us. The shock that becomes the tender, throbbing<br>ache of the heart eventually leads us down the path of<br>enlightenment, blessing our lives with a new depth and richness.<br><br>Acknowledging heartbreak's impermanence by no means dulls its sting<br>for it is the sting itself that stimulates healing. The pain is<br>letting us know that we need to pay attention to our emotional<br>selves, to sit with our feelings and be in them fully before we can<br>begin to heal.<br><br>It is said that time heals all wounds. Time may dull the pain of a<br>broken heart, but it is fully feeling your pain and acknowledging it<br>that will truly help you heal. Dealing with your heartache in a<br>healthy way rather than putting it off for tomorrow is the key to<br>repair.<br><br>Gentleness more than anything else is called for. Most important,<br>open yourself to the possibility of loving, trusting, and believing<br>again. When, someday soon, you emerge from the cushion of your<br>grief, you will see that the universe did not cease to be as you<br>nursed your broken heart. You emerge on the other side of the<br>mending, stronger for all you have experienced.<br><br><a href="http://www.dailyom.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailyom.com</a></div>
