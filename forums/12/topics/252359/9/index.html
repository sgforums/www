            <div class='col-md body'>The three wishes of Alexander, the Great . . .<br><br>There is a very instructive annecdote involving the life of Alexander, the great Greek king.<br><br>Alexander, after conquering many kingdoms, was returning home. On the way, he fell ill and it took him to his death bed. With death staring him in his face, Alexander realised how his conquests, his great army, his sharp sword and all his wealth were of no consequence. He now longed to reach home to see his mother's face and bid her his last adieu.<br><br>But, he had to accept the fact that his sinking health would not permit him to<br>reach his distant homeland. So, the mighty conqueror lay prostrate and pale,<br>helplessly waiting to breathe his last. He called his generals and said, "I will<br>depart from this world soon, I have three wishes, please carry them out without fail."<br><br>With tears flowing down their cheeks, the generals agreed to abide by their king's last wishes.<br><br>"My first desire is that," said Alexander, "My physicians alone must carry my coffin." After a pause, he continued................,<br><br>"Secondly, I desire that when my coffin is being carried to the grave, the path leading to the graveyard be strewn with gold, silver and precious stones which I have collected in my treasury."<br><br>The king felt exhausted after saying this. He took a minute's rest and continued, "My third and last wish is that both my hands be kept dangling out<br>of my coffin."<br><br>The people who had gathered there wondered at the king's strange wishes. But no one dared bring the question to their lips. Alexander's favorite general kissed his hand and pressed them to his heart. "O king, we assure you that your wishes will all be fulfilled. But tell us why do you make such strange wishes?"<br><br>At this, Alexander took a deep breath and said: "I would like the world to know of the three lessons I have just learnt. I want my physicians to carry my coffin because people should realise that no doctor can really cure any body. They are powerless and cannot save a person from the clutches of death. So let not people take life for granted.<br><br>The second wish of strewing gold, silver and other riches on the way to the graveyard is to tell people that not even a fraction of gold will come with me. I spent all my life earning riches but cannot take anything with me. Let people realise that it is a sheer waste of time to chase wealth.<br><br>And about my third wish of having my hands dangling out of the coffin, I wish people to know that I came empty handed into this world and empty handed I go out of this world."<br><br>With these words, the king closed his eyes. Soon he let death conquer him and breathed his last. . . . . . . . . . . .</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>KIND WORDS<br>Making Peace<br><br>"Fresh Cut Flowers "<br>The author wishes to remain anonymous<br>Edited by Shmuel Greenbaum<br>Printed with Permission of<a href="http://%20http://www.PartnersInKindness.org" rel="nofollow"> http://www.PartnersInKindness.org</a><br><br>The Yarden family lived in Savyon and had a gardener named Naji who came to work from an Arab village in the Shomron. He worked for them for years, and loved their son Oron. When Naji worked in their garden, Oron would watch him all the time; Oron would speak to him, joke with him and the two became good friends...<br><br>When Oron was kidnapped on June 8, 1980, Naji did not show up to work anymore. He disappeared. No one knew where he was or what had happened to him. He just vanished.<br><br>One morning, weeks later, Oron's mother, Pnina Yarden was sitting in her home when she saw Naji approach the driveway, walking slowly towards the house, somewhat hesitatingly, afraid to make the next step. Pnina was glad to see him and called him inside.<br><br>"What happened to you Naji? We needed you here!"<br><br>"Madam Pnina, is it true what they are saying"?<br><br>"What's true?" asked Pnina.<br><br>"Is it true my friend is GONE?" asked Naji.<br><br>"Yes it is," replied Pnina. "You know it...."<br><br>"I was hoping it was not true," said Naji. All of my family in our village were praying to Allah, hoping he will come back...."<br><br>"When I saw you, Madam Pnina, on the television every night begging for help to find your child, I told my father, Â‘Father, this is the good lady from Savyon that makes me coffee every time I go to her house....Â’".<br><br>"So Naji, why did you not come all this time?" asked Pnina<br><br>"I cannot work here any more Madam Pnina, I cannot come to you any more knowing my friend is not here. It hurts too much. I will ask my cousin to come instead, from now on."<br><br>One day when Pnina went to visit her sonÂ’s grave she saw that there were fresh cut flowers on the gravestone She came back home saying to Amos her husband, "You know darling, its strange but there were cut flowers on the grave."<br><br>Every time Pnina would visit the grave, she found fresh cut flowers on the grave, but did not know who they were from. One thing she did notice was that they were fresh cut flowers from a garden. They were not bought flowers.<br><br>One day on her visit to the cemetery, all of a sudden as she walked up the path, from a distance she saw a shadow running, hiding trying to escape the cemetery.<br><br>Pnina knew well who's shadow it was. She came closer to Naji. They both stood there silently when finally Naji said, "Madam Pnina every day when I finish working at some family's house, I take a few fresh flowers and on my way home. I visit my friend."<br><br>This story is printed with permission from Pnina Yarden and from the author, Sariel Beckenstein (<a href="http://sarielbeckenstein@hotmail.com" rel="nofollow">sarielbeckenstein@hotmail.com</a>), who is Pnina's nephew.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>"Making Peace"<br>From: Kindness: Making a Difference in People's Lives: Formulas, stories, and insights<br>By Zelig Pliskin<br>Printed with Permission of Shaar Press<br><br>When there is peace, there is harmony. There is cooperation and people do things to benefit others. Peace eliminates the harm and damage caused by its opposite: quarrels, fighting, anger, resentment, hatred, revenge, grudge-bearing. Creating peace adds to peopleÂ’s lives and saves everyone involved from the pain and destruction of feuds and quarrels.<br><br>Being a peace-maker is an art. And it is fraught with danger, so one must be very careful how one goes about the whole process. Many years ago, there was a great leader who had a special method for making peace. When he heard that two people were quarreling, he would approach one and tell him that the other person was saying positive things about him. He would then approach the second person and tell him that the first person was saying positive things about him. The next time they met, their body language said, "I like this person." This created a positive loop and the two people would once again become friendly with each other.<br><br>We like people who like us and speak well of us. When you want to make peace between people, skillfully have each one say something positive about the other. "What has this person done for you that you have been grateful for?" "What positive qualities do you see in this person?" "If you werenÂ’t angry at this person, what positive statements do you think you could make?"<br><br>Describe how they both will benefit by getting along well with each other. Past grievances often have to be worked out. But not always. At times, two people will be willing to begin their relationship all over again. They can be shown that itÂ’s best to begin again right now. When there is a need to speak about the past, caution everyone to avoid speaking in a tone of voice and with content that will be inflammatory. They should speak to be understood, not to attack. Have each one listen quietly to the other. This can be extremely difficult. But by not counterattacking and by not being defensive, the speaker has the relief of being heard and understood, even if they donÂ’t agree.<br><br>By speaking about the situation peacefully, both parties might recognize that they misunderstood the actual positions of the other. They might not have realized the pain the other one experienced. They might have thought that the other person is purposely trying to say and do things to cause them pain. Now they will each see that the other person was just trying to do what he thought was best for himself, and didnÂ’t really want to cause harm and damage.<br><br>Whenever possible find an agreement frame. That is, find points on which they agree and have common interests. "What do you both agree on?" "If possible, you both would gain from getting along well with each other, wouldnÂ’t you?" "If you worked together instead of against each other, that would make life easier for you, wouldnÂ’t it?"<br><br>If you are serving as a mediator, be careful not to take sides. Often, each party will want you to agree that they are right and the other side is wrong. If you are an authority and a judge, this could be appropriate. But when you are serving as a mediator, be careful not to become a party to the dispute. Instead of finding a peaceful settlement, you will then expand the quarrel. The side that feels you are against them will now need to look for other people to bolster their position. The quarrel will grow instead of resolving itself peacefully.<br><br>You will be most successful when you can perceive both people in a positive light. When you can create a positive atmosphere in the room by radiating good will to everyone involved, both parties will be able to express themselves in a peaceful setting. Your presence will enable them to understand and be understood in ways that they would not have been able to do if you werenÂ’t there.<br><br>But be very careful not to make the situation worse. You might be close friends to both parties and they both want to win you over. You might say something that one can use as ammunition against the other. They might be better off finding someone with much experience in serving as a peace mediator who is an objective outsider.<br><br>If you do everything you can and tempers still flare, realize there might be deep emotional issues that have been around for many years. The resentment has added up and now it explodes. You might have to speak to each one separately to enable them to calm down before they can speak to each other. There might be hidden issues that one or both are not telling you. You think that you know the entire picture, but important pieces of data that you arenÂ’t aware of would change the way that you are looking at the situation.<br><br>Know your limits. Know when you should step out of a situation. Know when your involvement will cause havoc with your emotions and drag you into a situation with which you didnÂ’t need to be involved. At times the only way someone will know these limits is to have been involved in trying to help out in a quarrel that blew up in their face. When you know what you canÂ’t do, you will have more time and energy to be involved in what you can do.<br><br>One of my students told me the following:<br><br>I was once involved in a complex situation where a professional lawyer with many years experience was brought in as a consultant to the case. He sat back and listened carefully to get as comprehensive a picture as possible<br><br>In the middle of the presentation he was repeatedly getting asked, "What do you think so far?"<br><br>He replied, "Thus far IÂ’m still trying to get a more complete picture. I donÂ’t have any comments yet."<br><br>Only when the picture became very clear did he make his comments and state his opinion. Because of his extensive experience he knew that things are not always as they seem. Two sides in a quarrel each will have a different picture and it takes patience to get the entire picture.</div>
