            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>A Barefoot Boy's Incredible Journey </strong></span><br><br>Excerpted from Unstoppable, by Cynthia Kersey<br><br>He possessed a five-day supply of food, a Bible and Pilgrim's Progress, a small axe for protection, and a blanket. With these, Legson Kayira eagerly set out on the journey of his life. He was going to walk from his tribal village in Nyasaland [Malawi], north across the wilderness of East Africa to Cairo, where he would board a ship to America to get a college education.<br><br>It was October 1958. Legson was sixteen or seventeen, his mother wasn't sure. His parents were illiterate and didn't know exactly where America was or how far. But they reluctantly gave their blessing to his journey. Legson wanted to serve mankind, to make a difference in the world. To realize his goal, he needed education. He knew the best place to get it was in America.<br><br>Forget that Legson didn't have a penny to his name or a way to pay for his ship fare. Forget that he had no idea what college he would attend or if he would<br>even be accepted. Forget that Cairo was 3,000 miles away, and in between were hundreds of tribes that spoke more than fifty strange languages, none of which Legson knew. Forget all that. Legson did. He put everything out of his mind except his dream.<br><br>He hadn't always been so determined. Like many of his friends in the village, it was easy for Legson to believe that studying was a waste of time for a poor boy from the town of Karonga in Nyasaland. Then, in books provided by missionaries, he discovered Abraham Lincoln and Booker T. Washington. Their stories inspired him to envision more for his life. So he conceived the idea for his walk.<br><br>After five full days of trekking across the rugged African terrain, Legson had covered only 25 miles. He was already out of food, his water was running out, and he had no money. To travel the distance of 2,975 additional miles seemed impossible. Yet to turn back was to give up, to resign himself to a life of poverty and ignorance. I will not stop until I reach America, he promised himself. Or until I die trying.<br><br>Sometimes he walked with strangers. Most of the time he walked alone. He entered each new village cautiously, not knowing whether the natives were hostile or friendly. Sometimes he found work and shelter. Many nights he slept under the stars. He foraged for wild fruits and berries and other edible plants. He became thin and weak. A fever struck him and he fell gravely ill. Kind strangers treated him with herbal medicines and offered him a place to rest and convalesce. Weary and demoralized, Legson considered turning back. Instead, Legson turned to his two books, reading the familiar words that renewed his faith in himself and in his goal. He continued on.<br><br>On January 19, 1960, fifteen months after he began his perilous journey, he had crossed nearly a thousand miles to Kampala, the capital of Uganda. He remained in Kampala for six months, working at odd jobs and spending every spare moment in the library. In that library he came across an illustrated directory of American colleges. One illustration in particular caught his eye. It was of a stately, yet friendly looking institution, surrounded by majestic mountains that reminded him of the magnificent peaks back home in Nyasaland.<br><br>Skagit Valley College in Mount Vernon, Washington, became the first concrete image in Legson's seemingly impossible quest. He wrote immediately to the school's dean explaining his situation and asking for a scholarship. Fearing he might not be accepted at Skagit, Legson decided to write to as many colleges as his meager budget would allow. It wasn't necessary. The dean at Skagit was so impressed with Legson's determination he not only granted him admission but also offered him a scholarship and a job that would pay his room and board.<br><br>Another piece of Legson's dream had fallen into placeÂ—yet still more obstacles blocked his path. Legson needed a passport and a visa, but to get a passport, he had to provide the government with a verified birth date. Worse yet, to get a visa he needed round-trip fare to the United States. Again, he picked up pen and paper and wrote to the missionaries who had taught him since childhood. They helped to push the passport through government channels. However, Legson still lacked the airfare required for a visa. Undeterred, Legson continued his journey to Cairo believing he would somehow get the money he needed. He was so confident he spent the last of his savings on a pair of shoes so he wouldn't have to walk through the door of Skagit Valley College barefoot.<br><br>Months passed, and word of his courageous journey began to spread. By the time he reached Khartoum, penniless and exhausted, the story of Legson Kayira had spanned the ocean between the African continent and Mount Vernon, Washington. The students of Skagit Valley College, with the help of local citizens, sent $650 to cover Legson's fare to America.<br><br>In December 1960, more than two years after his journey began, Legson Kayira arrived at Skagit Valley College, carrying his two treasured books. But Legson Kayira didn't stop once he graduated. He became a professor of political science at Cambridge University in England and a widely respected author. He rose above his humble beginnings and forged his own destiny. He made a difference in the world. "I learned I was not, as most Africans believed, the victim of my circumstances but the master of them."Â—Legson Kayira.<br><br>(Personal note: )<br><br>You cannot stop the man of faith! You cannot dissuade him! You cannot divert him! He'll go on, with or without you, or right over you, if necessary!<br><br>How determined are you to make a difference in the world? How hard will you work to reach your goals? How far are you willing to go for the Lord? This man, motivated by his dream and the little Word he had, gave his all to reach his goal. Will you be motivated by the much greater Word you have and your dreams to reach yours? Will you work toward a goal that will truly change the world by changing the hearts of men?  If you willÂ—if you have the faith, vision, initiative and courage to go all the way for GodÂ—then the world will hear about it, and Heaven itself will resound with the praises of the heavenly host and the hallelujahs of those whose souls are saved and whose lives are changed by your efforts! It'll have eternal impact!  Go for it, my friends! Little is much if God is in it! He can help you overcome your circumstances, whatever they may be, and rise above any obstacles in your path. With God, nothing is impossible!<br></div>

              Hello Everyone,
              
              This article was extracted out from a 2005 Calendar that I had received as a gift.
              
              Two Japanese men were exchanging their views pertaining to Life on Earth.
              
              Joe (Zulkifli Mahmood)
              
              
              THE WAY WE AS ADULTS LIVE SENDS AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE TO CHILDREN
              
              A: I heard that, when you saw the Earth from outer space for the first time in your first mission, you felt that the Earth was a solitary beacon of life in an ocean of complete darkness.
              
              B: When you look at the Earth while orbiting at an altitude of 300 kilometres (186 miles), making one round in 90 minutes, you know that there are pandas, whales, and your friends down there. You know it but you can't see it. On the other hand, if you step out of the spacecraft, it's a world of death. You keenly realize that science and technology are keeping you alive up there. You asked yourself if people's belief that the atmosphere protects the Earth is true. There happens to be air, vegetation, and ocean now, and you happen to be here. And you rarely become conscious of death as long as you are there. But there is no assurance. Maybe there is assurance until tomorrow or 100 years from now. When I was in outer space, I felt that everything is uncertain. In that sense, the existence of animals and plants is something you have to appreciate.
              
              A: I found lion tracks on the African savanna where you can look out over horizons 360 degrees around you. When I saw those tracks, I started shaking so badly I had to hold my knees. It was not fear of lions. It was rather from my inner self, feeling the uncertainty of my own existence just like you said. Most people who live on the Earth now barely have a chance to experience fear that makes them hold their knees. If they all felt it, the world would never have wars.
              
              B: There is an incomparably greater existence, so you feel the pettiness of your own existence.
              
              A: Yes, I was convinced there must be something. That's why I included "Natural Order" in the title of the book of the photographs I shot in the African savanna.
              
              B: Now we often hear people say humans are violating and destroying the environment and that the Earth will be ruined by humans. But when I went around the Earth on the Space Shuttle, the existence of humans is totally invisible. Of course, large cities like Tokyo and New York look gray. But when you compare them to the whole, the gray areas are still much smaller. Rather, the sense of existence of forests and deserts is much greater. However, when I saw scratches in the Amazon's jungles that were otherwise all covered in green, I realized that they were traces of slash-and-burn farming. I actually went to the Amazon after I returned to the Earth. Farmers slash and burn the jungles to a width of about 300 metres (980 feet), and there are enormous oil pipelines cutting across the jungles. So I experienced two points of view. The destruction is still small when you look at it from outer space, but it is immense when you look at it on the ground.
              
              A: It is difficult to look at things from such different points of view.
              
              B: It's not logic. What we need is experience to realize the fragility of our existence - something that makes you tremble, like you said.
              
              A: For example, you go out of town with your family, and your kids find a bug and get interested in it. If you tell them not to touch the bug and drag them away from the bug, your kid's sensitivity will be ruined. I think that sort of thing happens a lot now.
              
              B: To show children how we adults live - that's an important message to children.
              
              A: When my daughter was still a little kid, I took her on extended shooting sessions in Africa and Australia. She said she felt that a place where she could see the faces of her family was home to her no matter where she was, regardless of what culture she was in and what national borders she was surrounded by.
              
              B: When you stay in outer space on the Space Shuttle, it's a totally artificial world. The air you breathe is made of liquid oxygen. The water you drink is made by mixing hydrogen and oxygen. Everything is artificial, and nothing is natural. You lead such a life. Then you return to the ground, and, as soon as the hatch is open, air flows in gently. And that air is somehow wet. You smell earth in it. You feel there is life here. You've come back to the Earth. It's your home. You feel relieved.
              
              A: Wherever you open the hatch after landing, that's your home.
              
              B: Then you are handed a glass of water, and that's so delicious. It's completely different from the artificial water you were drinking in outer space. As soon as you taste it, you feel the Earth is our common home in the end. I think that only on Earth can one feel at ease and at home.
              
              A: That's indeed true. We owe our existence to this wonderful planet.

              Ok..its time for me to go home and before I share the last movie link for today...I like to tell you something about myself.
              
              I'm a Singaporean but I'm living in Malaysia, Johor State, Skudai District. I've been living there since September 2005. I'm 43 years old now but going to be 44 years old on 21st June 2007. I live in Malaysia but work in Singapore because at the end of the day...its about dollars and cents. The standard of living there is lower and I'm happy there.
              
              I've lived once upon a time in Bali, Indonesia, from 20th August 1992 to 29th December 1995 and I was also happy there...its like my own home too...even until now. However, I had to return to Singapore because I had to settle a few things in my life and make it right...and I had paid a high price for it. It was a great lesson to me and I've learned to accept that without any regrets...and forgive myself and move forward. Take a long time for me to make myself happy again.
              
              So...here it is...what time is for you and I know what TIME really meant to me after I fell from a big world of materialism and power.
              
              Take a look people......

              Hi! All.
              
              Good Morning.
              
              As usual, I have a movie link to share with you. Take a look at it.
              
              Have you ever had a bad day? The type that just sits with you, no matter how hard you try to change it?
              
              http://www.TheTroubleTreeMovie.com is a wonderful short movie story about a man who has found a way to change that.
              
              Thanks.

              I just want to share an excerpt from my manuscript of 'Mind Of A Mankind' that I had written in 2003. The text is appended below.
              
              I hope it would help you.
              
              Joe
              
               
              "The mind of yours is where your life is. Many Theologians called it the Soul or the Consciousness. The Psychologists called it Conscious and Sub-Conscious Mind or Rational and Irrational thought forms within the mind. Most of us have seen a Brain but nobody has ever seen a mind because it is intangible and invisible. You can only Â‘seeÂ’ and Â‘touchÂ’ the mind of yours and other people on paper through writings and paintings. You can utilise and appreciate the power of the mind through inventions. You can observe the mind through body motions and actions. You can hear and listen to the mind through the vocal spoken words of yours and other people too. It is the place where you think, see, listen, speak, feel and control all the actions of your body. It is the place where all the commands of yours and God are intermingled and communicated.
              
              The ideas and principles of life are ignited from your mind. Then you show to the others what are your ideas and the principles you believe you should uphold. Whether it is right or wrong has nothing to do with life, it is you who decide and judge the consequences that will materialised in the choices you make for yourself and sometimes for others who adored you, loved you and followed you.
              
              Life means growth and development. No one remain stagnant. It is the main principle and essence of Life. No one becomes a mankind until it is born into the world of mankind as a human baby. As a baby you grow into a teenager and later become an adult mankind. The process of growing up gives you the experiences for learning, to develop your intelligence and from that intelligence you gain wisdom. If you do not grow and develop, it is like being isolated and incarcerated in a windowless cell alone for many years without any exposure under the sun and exercise yard for you to keep yourself healthy in body and mind. You have no books to read, no television to watch, and no radio to listen and without any family or friends for you to communicate with for companionships. Your world is the world within your mind, which you created it for yourself to see and treasure it. It is a world where you fantasized for relief from being trapped within the four walls around you. Your physical body is present in the prison cell but your mind is somewhere else. It is a world where you imagine and wish you could be there. It is the only perfect world you know and it is the only world to escape for you to feel free. There are so many things you wish to do in that world of illusions but each time you return to the real world you become so deluded and miserable until you feel so critical with your own life conditions. No country in the world can develop and make progress if they closed their doors to the outside world. Nobody can stand alone without any support from friends and families.
              
              The warders will only unlock the cellÂ’s door to provide food for you to eat for survival and water for you to drink and clean your body. The warders are normally uninterested with your miseries or problems and you feel nobody care about you. You feel abandon by mankind and your conscience began to torment you with questions about yourself and your life. It will turn you into a person who has no freedom and no life to feel alive. It is only loneliness and emptiness that you see and feel. You feel that life is a misery and life is unfair. You did not ask for yourself to be born and why was it in the first place you were born to the world? This is the usual way people think when they are suffering and when they think that way, majority of them becomes so unhappy with their lives. That kind of life and thoughts will eventually destroy you within regardless whether you are conscious or unconscious about it. When you see yourself in that kind of situation and condition, you must do something about it before it is too late.
              
              The story represents changed. You changed your ways and you have a more meaningful life and if you refuse to change yourself, nobody can help you. Nobody is perfect and everybody needs something to change within oneself in time. If you think you are always perfect and right all the time, then you will be alone in your own world and in your life. The world always evolved because if mankind did not change through time, we would be in the age of the early mankind still. Maybe you will know what I meant by changed because our daily life too always required changes to life circumstances, environments, relationships and time. In the event of growing-up; acquiring for education; seeking for careers; commitment in marriage; in the period of pregnancy; in the moment of birth; being a mother or father; going through the tribulations of divorce; in the state of good or ill health; in the process of ageing; death in the family and later in the world of Hereafter as a soul after your own death, there are bound to be changes in you and in your life. Just like a leave changing from a tiny bud to a small green leave, then from a green leave turning to yellow then brown and becomes dry and later withers away. Just like the moon changing forms from a crescent moon to become a half moon and then a full moon. Just like day turned into night. Nobody remains the same forever. Nobody stays in one place forever. And nobody wishes to make themselves sad forever after their sojourn on earth ended. Nobody stays in Â‘HellÂ’ forever. This is not true for billions of you but it is true for God. Many became happy after they discovered the truth about Eternal Life and not finite Death.
              
              The happiness and commotion in your life will definitely altered your conscience as you go along in your life. When the time comes for you to change, do not be afraid to change. Do not immured yourself within your own-circled barriers. Nobody can live alone and nobody can be alone forever. My own experiences as a sequestered soul for a long time have made me into a consciousness without much exposure. I could not take myself to breathe the outside air of living again until I realised that I was actually being imprisonment within my own world of illusions. I decided to break the chain that bonded me to my own world of illusions and I began to see clearly and feel the joyfulness of being alive without any barriers now.
              
              The Theologians termed blissfulness and liberation as Nirvana, The Self-Realisation of The Soul, In the Presence and Love of God, or Seeing and Living in Heaven. I called it as Just Being Alive and Loving Life. It means that I see Life as Eternal and Life is Good. How I feel when I am in this state now? Well, it is just like being in Space for the first time and forever. I must give you some ideas how I feel right now. It is like you are bounded to the earth surface then suddenly realising that you could fly into Space. Then while you are in Space you can see the difference between being alive on earth and being alive in Space. The feelings that you experience will be totally and enormously different because while in Space you can see the whole world in front of you as one blue marble and while living on earth you thought that the earth is not one but divided. Then you realised that all of us are actually one Life living in the same world and many of us do not realised this until they are outside their own circled world. This experience will definitely make you see things clearly about who we really are and I hope most of you can see the world from outside your own circle than within your own circle.
              
              I like you to ponder on this word of mine. When the astronauts from U.S.A. and U.S.S.R. went into Space, what do you think they were thinking and feeling? John F Kennedy was so inspired with Space explorations until he asked the American people this question, Â‘ Do not ask your country what it can do for you but ask yourself what you can do for your country.Â’ Well, I think he was a very intelligent and compassionate man because only a person who has this thought will be willing to become a mankind of compassion and love. What can you do for the world instead of what the world can do for you? Most of you should do likewise because in order to change to become better and better in your life, you must let go of the ways of yours in the past and learn to control your own future and destiny. That is not correct you think but if I say you did change with time, I am not wrong. You have to adapt and cope with the changes in your life because if you do not, it will be your own sole mistakes in your own life and nobody is to be blame for your mistakes but yourself. Just like the caterpillars, if they do not change and build the pupa for themselves, they will never ever become beautiful butterflies. Their similitude of metamorphosis is just like we human beings, transforming ourselves in our lives. Then upon your own death on earth, the process of metempsychosis would be your change from a human being into a soul or consciousness, just like the butterflies' transformation."
