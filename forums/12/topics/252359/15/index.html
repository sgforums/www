            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Everyone,<br><br>I received this email from a group I belong at <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Simply_Whatever/" rel="nofollow">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Simply_Whatever/</a><br><br>Thought I share it with you.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>With Love,<br>Joe<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Parent-thesis</strong></span><br><br>We take a look at the most common mistakes parents make and how to put an end to it<br><br>Parents want the best for their children. Whether it's keeping them busy or giving them choices, we feel it's our job to keep them happy. But being an indulgent parent who's afraid of upsetting their kids at all costs actually does more harm than good. Here, we reveal the top five mistakes our loving parents make - and how to avoid them.<br><br><strong>NEGOTIATING TOO MUCH</strong><br><br>Many parents think they're only being fair and democratic when they ask kids their opinions on everything from what they want to wear to what they would like for dinner.<br><br>It's a habit especially hard to break for working parents, who feel guilty for not being around. But it may surprise many mums and dads to learn that kids actually want to be told what to do most of the time and can be frightened when they feel in control. Children, especially when they are young, need structure.<br><br>When parents have come to a decision, many then make the mistake of trying to reason with their kids. Instead, children will take it as an opportunity to try to wear parents down.<br><br>Don't enter into a debate. Once you have made your mind up, keep your explanation brief. Make eye contact and state clearly, in 30 words or less, why that's the rule. The other mistake is when parents make requests sound optional.<br><br>If you want your child to have a bath but it comes across like a question, your child may well take advantage by saying "no" and you will have a row on your hands. "Don't feel guilty about asserting yourself. That's your job."<br><br><strong>NEVER LETTING KIDS GET BORED</strong><br><br>How often has your child whined: "I'm bored," as if it's your fault? Many mums and dads feel that unless they are constantly stimulating their children they are failing.<br><br>These days, parents often feel the need to manage their children's lives in every respect. Because we no longer let them out to play in the street or even out of our sights, parents have come to feel that keeping youngsters busy is their responsibility.<br><br>But a little boredom can be good for them. It can teach them to be creative with their time and to learn life isn't always exciting. By all means, ask them what kind of activities they might be interested in doing. But, beyond that, leave it to them.<br><br>Also bear in mind that "I'm bored" can sometimes mean something else. Often a teenager who says they're bored is using it as a weapon to annoy parents or as a way to be dismissive.<br><br><strong>BUYING THEM EVERYTHING THEY ASK FOR</strong><br><br>Many kids will come home with tales of how they are the only one of their friends not to have the latest trainers or computer game. Many parents shower their children with so many gifts, the kids don't learn the value of money. It's a real danger for working parents who use presents as a substitute for not spending more time with their children. Kids play the guilt card really well.<br><br>They will tell you that so and so's parent has given them the thing that they want. But it's a manoeuvre. Just say, 'That's very generous of them' and move on'.<br><br>If they want something really badly, let them earn it. The lesson is that if you struggle to get something, you value it more. So if a child really wants something, suggest they do some jobs around the house to earn the pocket money to buy it.<br><br><strong>PUSHING KIDS TOO HARD</strong><br><br>These days, there's far more pressure, and from an early age, on kids to succeed.<br><br>Parents are constantly told that however well a child does at school is down to the parenting they received.<br><br>The result is that parents who think they are doing the best for their kids actually do them more harm. Many parents feel their child's success is a reflection on them. But you have to ask yourself whose needs are being met - yours or your child's?<br><br>If encouragement turns to pressure, children can become anxious and actually start underperforming. They can also end up with symptoms of stress, such as unexplained tummy aches, constipation, sleeplessness and nightmares.<br><br>In sensitive kids, artificially high expectations can also batter their confidence.<br><br>Even if children do better in the short term, they may well rebel and go the other way during their teenage years. Instead, let your child play freely, without any pressure to achieve. Make opportunities - such as books - available but otherwise let your kids develop at their own pace.<br><br><strong>NEVER SAYING Â‘NOÂ’</strong><br><br>Many parents fall into the trap of thinking that saying yes to their kids all the time makes them happy. The problem can often occur among those parents who were brought up in a very strict way and want to do the opposite with their own kids.<br><br>If you don't say no, you are not doing your job properly. Once you say no, the really important thing is not to change your mind, he adds. Otherwise, kids will keep pressing the buttons on the off-chance they might hit the jackpot.<br><br>Welcome To dimpill's gang!

That is like being like our own SMM Mr Lee Kuan Yew. I admire him alot and I see clearly his vision. After living in Indonesia in the past and in Malaysia now, I could clearly see that we are very fortunate to have a country leader like SMM Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Everyone,<br><br>I have received an email from the Philippines today. Her name is Marife, a special lady, and I thought I share this email with you since Chinese New Year is coming...just around the corner. Hope you guys have done your Chinese New Year shopping, after the New Year shopping and after the Christmas shopping...(lols).<br><br>Thanks Marife.<br><br>With Love,<br>Joe<br><br><strong><a href="http://Chinese%20Astrology%202008" rel="nofollow">Chinese Astrology 2008 </a></strong><br><br>The Rat<br>Rats are charming, elegant and clever. They can be a bit gossipy and prone to being distracted. TheyÂ’re also thrifty and very good with handling money. Family and close friends are exceptionally important to them. The Rat is charming beyond words and throughout his undoubtedly long life he will always be popular and will have many friends.<br>Forecast for 2008 In their own year, Rats need to make future plans, remain persistant, vigilant and above all, enjoy a brightening of prospects all around. In their work situation, excellent opportunities should arrive with an accompanying rise in salary. If, however, the Rat feels stuck, bored and unable to progress, he needs to follow through his ideas in order to move onwards and upwards Â– action will be a keyword this year for all Rats Â– itÂ’s no time to sit idly by, waiting for good things to happen. There will be celebrations, social events and travel to also look forward to in 2008. Also, hobbies or interests that may have been put to one side, should be looked at with fresh eyes as they could prove both beneficial and lucrative to the Rat this year. All in all, this will be an enjoyable and prosperous year for those Rats who pursue their dreams. May and August will be particularly auspicious times for making new and close friends and alliances.<br><br>How the Rat fares:<br>The Rat may not be as good to you as the kindly Pig, especially since it is an Earth year, and Earth drains your Rat luck. Making favorable deals, for example, will be more challenging. It still should be a good year for you, as you have eight good months ahead of you. If you avoid risk and rely on hard work to get ahead, you most likely will. You may, however, get off to a slow start because the latter part of the year will present more and better opportunities, so be patient.<br><br>The Ox<br>Sturdy, earthy, no-nonsense Â– thatÂ’s the Ox. Affectionate and easy-going, the Ox can show a fierce temper when agitated. He is neat, tidy, quiet and studious, with a great love of his home. Music can be a great love. Family life and a loving partner are high on the OxÂ’s priorities. A wonderful loyal friend.<br>Forecast for 2008 The Ox could be quite tired after a hectic last couple of months in 2007. During 2008 the focus on work continues, with excellent prospects for promotion, moving to a better position and also taking up new skills. It will be important for the Ox to take time out for recreational and social pursuits in order to relax and remember to enjoy himself. 2008 will also be a lucky year for OxÂ’s with possible monetary gain or unexpected gifts arriving during the year. Friends will also play an important role in the year, providing support, camaraderie and fun times. The Ox is not the most social animal in the Zodiac and itÂ’s important for him not to neglect his existing circle of friends this year. His well-considered and honest advice will be sought a few times over 2008. March to August will be a terrific time for work advancements.<br><br>How the Ox fares:<br>Fifty-two per cent favorable may not look that great, but it does represent an improvement over last year. You should have as many opportunities as disappointments. Take care to exercise good judgment, and you will do fine. Unfortunately it is an Earth year, and Earth drains Ox luck. This is not the time to take risks, especially those that are unnecessary or can be avoided. Hard work is more your style any way. The first six months are likely to be the most challenging, so be patient.<br><br>The Tiger<br>Magnetic, passionate and grand! When the Tiger does anything, itÂ’s noticed! Indecisiveness and stubbornness can mar the sparkle of the Tiger personality. On the one hand generous, on the other hand a little mean, itÂ’s sometimes hard to know where one stands with the Tiger. Flexible, honest and truly entertaining, one has a friend for life with a Tiger.<br>Forecast for 2008 The final months of 2007 could prove frustrating to the Tiger if he has taken on too many projects or ideas. ItÂ’s important for him to tread carefully and purposefully at the start of the Year of the Rat in order to set a firm, strong foundation for the year. Otherwise, disappointment and frustration may follow. Many Tigers are extremely creative and imaginative and this is the year to use their talents. For those Tigers who are unfulfilled in their career, they may find it difficult to move. However, an unexpected and lucky opportunity will arise during the year for all Tigers Â– but beware Â– blink and youÂ’ll miss it! The TigerÂ’s impulsiveness needs to reined in quite a bit during 2008 and if this is done, the year could prove highly enjoyable, lucky and satisfying. July to October will be the best time for new and exciting romantic opportunities.<br><br>How the Tiger fares:<br>The Rat is likely to present more challenges than the Pig. Do not be surprised if you occasionally find you cannot get your way this year. In fact there are likely to be plenty of clashes of wills. The better you can keep your emotions under control the more likely you are to achieve your goals. The Rat is comfortable with logic, not passion. You will have to carefully pick your spots, as you probably will not be blessed with many, good opportunities.<br><br>The Rabbit<br>Cuddly, warm and affectionate are the attributes of the Rabbit. Mysterious and a great party-giver and host, the Rabbit enjoys being the centre of attention once in a while. The Rabbit is occasionally over cautious and can be a bit boring. He is also one of the luckiest signs in the Chinese Astrology chart.<br>Forecast for 2008 During the final couple of months of 2007, the Rabbit will need to keep a close eye on his finances in order to avoid hardship during the Year of the Rat. 2008 will prove to be a very social and fun year, with a highlight on romance and special get-togethers with friends. For the unattached Rabbit, this could well be the year to meet their soul mate. It will be important for Rabbits to be careful and avoid risk-taking during the Year of the Rat. Also, he needs to be aware that gossip and rumours may abound during the middle months of the year and that joining in with the whispers should be avoided Â– it could ultimately damage the RabbitÂ’s reputation. Home and hearth will be especially important this year Â– providing a safe and cosy sanctuary from a busy and eventful year. April and October will provide particular opportunities to travel and socialise.<br><br>How the Rabbit fares:<br>The scratchy Rat often takes the Rabbit out of its comfort zone. This year is thus likely to be a lot more challenging than last year, especially since the Fire Pig year is one of your most favorable. The middle months are likely to be the toughest. Although you want to avoid risk throughout the year, it is especially important at that time. You will best be able to take advantage of the good times if you can keep your emotions under control, especially when things don't go your way.<br><br>The Dragon<br>Assertive, energetic and talented are all words to describe the Dragon personality. On the other hand, the Dragon has a tendency to be condescending and tactless without realising it. They generally enjoy robust health and tend to be very successful in anything they turn their hand to.<br>Highlights for 2008 This is the year for all Dragons to follow their dreams and carpe diem! It will be a happy and busy year for most Dragons with their bubbly and ebullient personality in great demand. Travel is well aspected but comes with a small warning - check that all travel documents are in order and that every detail is as it should be. Forward planning is a key phrase for the Year of the Rat! Career-wise, the Dragon who is seeking to change jobs will have an interesting proposition presented to them, making them feel valued and confident. On the home front, the Dragon loves his domesticity and this year it will be particularly important to him. Family activities and time spent at home will re-energise and relax the Dragon immensely. Carefully budgeting with money and wise investments will make the Year of the Rat extremely satisfying and happy. March to May will be well starred for promotion and career changes.<br><br>How the Dragon fares:<br>Hopefully the Pig showered blessings on you last year. If not, not to worry. This year promises to be even better with your good friend the Rat in charge. You can enjoy a lot of success, but this is still not the best of years as Earth does not favor your luck. It is thus a time to avoid risk. As a Dragon, you could be something of a dreamer. If so, this is the perfect year for you since Earth promotes practicality. You are thus likely to have a good chance to realize one of your big dreams.<br><br>The Snake<br>Intelligent and highly intuitive are two of the SnakeÂ’s many fine qualities. He makes an amusing and romantic friend with a definite flirtatious streak. When challenged or criticised he can be a sore loser. The Snake is very lucky with money and is fond of the odd bet or two. He is quick-witted and enjoys reading, music and occasionally the paranormal side of life.<br>Forecast for 2008 The last couple of months of 2007 could have seen a real upswing in social activities for the Snake, leaving him feeling drained and just a little out of sorts. But all Snakes should take heart for the Year of the Rat will prove a very rewarding and creative year for them Â– providing they think things through and take note of all possible opportunities that come along. In 2008 the Snake should take extra care in financial matters. Although very prudent and careful with money normally, this year the Snake needs to be extra vigilant. Regarding their career, a degree of flexibility will need to be shown, if looking to advance their career or change direction. This will come to the notice of those in a position to help. Many happy times will happen at home this year for Snakes, with both family and friend providing much joy. July to November will be fantastic for socialising.<br><br>How the Snake fares:<br>This year promises to be a vast improvement over the last one. You are likely, for example, to experience exciting mental stimulation. If you use your brains you can produce some very good results in most areas of your life. Almost every month will provide opportunities; although, you might want to take it easy right after Chinese New Year. Next year should be even better, so you want to take some time to make good plans and begin projects to be completed then.<br><br>The Horse<br>Fun, charming and attractive sums up the HorseÂ’s traits perfectly. They love parties and crowds and being the centre of attention. They can also be egotistical, hotheaded and impatient. The Horse is a considerate and protective friend and partner and when in his company, there will always be excitement around the next corner.<br>Forecast for 2008 2007 will have ended on a happy and social note for the Horse and he can look forward to more of the same for the Year of the Rat. However, this will be a hectic and demanding year overall for the Horse, which could make him feel unnerved and anxious. It is important for all Horses to remember this year that all challenges are learning experiences and his tenacity and inner strength will see him through all situations. Planning and thinking about the year ahead will prove extremely beneficial to the Horse, providing him with a sense of control and direction. It is also important to make a concerted effort to listen to and get along with work colleagues and friends as ultimately they will be may be able to smooth out any rough patches for the Horse in 2008. March and August are super times for travelling and exciting adventures.<br><br>How the Horse fares:<br>Alas, the Horse is the sign that fares least well in the year of the Rat. Still, the year will not be without its opportunities. The trick will be to force yourself to rely more on your head than your heart. That is contrary to the Horse nature, so it won't be easy. The first month of the year could be your best one. It is thus important for you to move out smartly as soon as the New Year's partying is over. A quick start is especially important, as the last three months could be very challenging.<br><br>The Goat<br>Graceful and optimistic, kind and easy going, would describe a Goat personality. They can also be petulant and discontented, likely to throw the towel in at the beginning of a problem. They can be charming without revealing their true feelings. The Goat is very talented and imaginative and can turn his hand to most creative pursuits.<br>Forecast for 2008 The Year of the Rat will be a year of great accomplishments for the Goat, if he can go about things in an orderly, organised and detail manner. For the creative Goat, and there are many of these, wonderful ideas and exciting projects are sure to emerge in 2008. There will be quite a few wonderful social opportunities in this year with single Goats finding themselves in great demand! For those Goats seeking work or looking to change careers, having an implicit belief in themselves and showing enthusiasm will bring many interesting offers. Home life is also well starred with pregnancy and happy family events particularly highlighted. Financially, this is a good year, with a lump sum for a creative endeavour or a bequest coming to some Goats. Valued new friendships will made during July and August of 2008.<br><br>How the Goat fares:<br>After what was probably a very favorable, Pig year, this year might seem like a disaster. It is important, however, for you to understand that you are still looking at five, favorable months. There will thus be plenty of opportunities if you do not get down and let negative emotions get the best of you. Your natural inclination is most likely to follow your heart, but you will do much better this year if you can let your head dictate your actions.<br><br>The Monkey<br>The Monkey is playful, lively, fun and a quick thinker. They get bored very easily and find it hard to settle down to doing any one thing. The Monkey can also be vain and offhand. They are ambitious and usually very good with investing money. With their quick wit and wonderful sense of humour, they are a great party guest. The MonkeyÂ’s life will never be dull and predictable!<br>Forecast for 2008 The Year of the Rat should be an excellent year for the Monkey with a renewed enthusiasm and determination showing itself early on. Many fine opportunities will present themselves to the Monkey during 2008 and provided he spots them, it can turn into a highly successful and lucrative year. Any inspired ideas or thoughts should be noted as they could garner the Monkey highly prized recognition at work, with financial benefits. It will be very important for him to discuss any concerns or worries he might have throughout the year regarding any matter, as keeping them to himself could result in anxiousness and bad choices. Any opportunities for studying or gaining new skills should be seized. By following cherished hopes and dreams in the Year of the Rat, this could be one of the most memorable years ever, with great good fortune and advancement. August, November and December will provide memorable social opportunities.<br><br>How the Monkey fares:<br>The Monkey, of the 12 signs, is the one most likely to have the best year. Fortune smiles upon you with your big friend the Rat in charge. If you are a typical, mentally quick and multi-talented Monkey, opportunities there will be aplenty. There is only one, major concern. The Achilles heal of both the Monkey and Rat is overconfidence. This could make you forget that the Tiger rules the first month and won't do you any favors. As good as the year is, therefore, a slow start is advisable.<br><br>The Rooster<br>The Rooster is always popular, extravagant and creative. They can be brutally honest and generally like being showered with attention. They are wonderfully loyal friends and also give advice freely Â– whether they are asked for it or not! Family means the world to the Rooster and they are fiercely loyal to those they care about.<br>Forecast for 2008 The Year of the Rat will be a varied one for the Rooster, but if he sticks to what he knows and what heÂ’s best at, it will go a lot more smoothly. This is not a year for any financial gambles and sensible spending and careful budgeting will avoid hardships. Keeping focussed and determined will help all Roosters who feel unfulfilled and unhappy in their jobs. While it wonÂ’t be easy to change jobs, there is a strong possibility they may come to the attention of someone influential who may be able to help. Socially, it will be a busy and entertaining year, although there is a note of caution. Gossiping and indiscretions need to be avoided at all costs, as they could be extremely damaging to the Rooster. With all of this going on in his life, home will provide a safe haven and every opportunity should be taken to spend quality time with loved ones and dear friends. April to August will prove particularly lucky, with a little effort from the Rooster.<br><br>How the Rooster fares:<br>In general none of the Rooster's favorite appeal to or are well tolerated by the Rat. After the Horse the Rooster is the sign most likely to have a challenging year. There will, nevertheless, be a few opportunities. A cooperative attitude and winning allies are likely to be keys to your success. On the other hand if you succumb to the Rooster propensity for arguing and quarrels, you could have a very difficult time. It is up to you to minimize the damage by displaying the right attitude.<br><br>The Dog<br>The Dog is wonderfully hard worker, a perfectionist and someone who loves the small details. He is also a bit anti-social, pessimistic and stubborn. They are one of the most honest and loyal signs of the Chinese zodiac and will always go to bat for a worthy cause. The Dog is a fantastic listener and his advice is usually very intuitive.<br>Forecast for 2008 The focus for 2008 will be on career advancement and positive financial aspects for the Dog. An unexpected job offer or change in direction will most certainly come up during the Year of the Rat and will greatly delight the Dog. With careful planning, their financial situation could greatly improve this year, providing security and a chance to make improvements or investments on the home front. Many Dogs will decide to get married or have a child this year, with love being wonderfully highlighted. As with some other Zodiac animals, fascinating opportunities need to be seized before they are gone Â– the Dog needs to remain alert and enthusiastic at all times in 2008. Friendship is important for the Dog this year and it may be in their best interest to get out and about to meet new friends Â– such as joining a club or association that would interest them. Only their efforts will make 2008 the memorable year it can be. June and October will be very happy times romantically.<br><br>How the Dog fares:<br>This year may be a bit more challenging than the last, but it still has the potential to be very favorable. The thing is the Dog is more comfortable with the Pig, which symbolizes endings rather than the Rat, which is associated with new beginnings. If you are willing to leave your comfort zone, you can make significant progress towards your objectives and also achieve one or more notable successes. As with much in life your attitude is likely to determine just how well you do.<br><br>The Pig<br>The Pig is an innocent, sweet and lovable personality. They can also be quite melancholy and over-sensitive. The Pig loves the company of others, and adores parties, gossip and chit chat. They are highly intelligent, but prefer to keep this side of their nature under wraps. The Pig does not care that much for money, but is one of the zodiac signs that is very lucky.<br>Forecast for 2008 At the end of 2007, the end of his own Pig year, there will be much fun and happiness with increased social contact and romance. On the other hand, the Year of the Rat signifies a new cycle for the whole Zodiac, which the Pig may find highly unsettling Â– they are not partial to change. However, by taking a deep breath and going with the flow, 2008 can be a successful and interesting year for all Pigs. Much attention needs to be paid to legal matters, financial details and any paperwork Â– be vigilant and careful in all dealings to avoid upset. Also, the Pig needs to be extremely selective in who he confides in. A lot of personal soul searching and decisions will also be made this year, with support of family and friends proving valuable and helpful. May and August will be important months for career advancement.<br><br>How the Pig fares:<br>Major improvement is likely to be in store for you this year. It's ironic that the environment is likely to be more unsettling while simultaneously providing more opportunities for success. A mental adjustment is thus required to maximize your potential. Although the Pig tends to look to the future, even to retirement, your focus should be squarely on the present. The future is now. Be alert for favorable situations and make the most of them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Friends,<br><br>Thought I share this article published in The Straits Times. I admire this guy who narrated his story and I guess I quite agree with him. Take a look at it. I have appended the article below just after my signature.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>With Love,<br>Joe<br><br>EXTRACTED FROM THE STRAITS TIMES IN 'YOUTHINK' SECTION UNDER THE "SOAP BOX" COLUMN, PUBLISHED ON MONDAY, JANUARY 21 2008.<br><br><strong>FORGOING THE RAT RACE FOR THE 'LILIES OF THE FIELD'</strong><br>Story by Yen Feng<br><br>The season for announcing promotiions and bonuses is, for many rookies, the annual measure of success.<br><br>But it does no account for work we put into out personal relationships, which is harder to quantify - you do not exactly get cash for how good a son, brother, friend or spouse you have been.<br><br>That part belongs to another race: the silent marathon to show we are more than the sum of our bank accounts. It is a race we seldom talk about over drinks. It is a race that is easy to forget because we are our own arbiters.<br><br>But it exists.<br><br>So I consider myself fortunate to have had a reminder of it at the start of my career.<br><br>A year agp. I turned in my press pass to take care of a dying loved one.<br><br>In that time, my peers whizzed ahead, bagging awards I knew would give them an edge over me in the company. At first, I was envious. Then I thought: How much of it really matters?<br><br>A recent e-mail from a senior executive in the newsroom last week brought the point home.<br><br>It cited a speech by Pulitzer Prize-winning American journalist Anna Quindlen. In it, she tells a class of graduating students that life's measure isn't about "the next promotion, the bigger  paycheck, the larger house", but about cultivating one's soul.<br><br>"Consider the lilies of the field," she said.<br><br>As Singaporeans, we have been trained from a young age to covet success in its most admired form: cash.<br><br>We compute our worth in dollars and cents. We work hard - the result of being ranked and banded in school from the age of nine.<br><br>And, if you take literally what Minister Mentor Lee Kuan Yew said last week - "Retirement is death" - we will be working not only harder, but longer than ever.<br><br>But it is precisely because we push ourselves so hard that Ms Quindlen's words are all the more relevant.<br><br>The Challenge is to expand our definition of the words "success" and "reward", beyond promotion and bonuses.<br><br>In the end, we are judged in our lives for all our work - not just the work we are paid to do.<br><br>Since my loved one died, I have adjusted certain priorities in my life.<br><br>After a year away from the office, I am ready to buckle down and earn my keep. But I am also working on that other, "lilies" race.<br><br>I know how much it means to listen, to show up, to make time for the people who mean something in our lives.<br><br>After all, time, unlike money, is finite. At the end of one's life, no one has been known to say: "I wish I spent more time in the office."<br><br>So me, I am looking up an old friend. Or lighting a candle at dinner.<br><br>That's the part I'm leaving for the lilies.<br><br><a href="http://zengyan@sph.com.sg" rel="nofollow">zengyan@sph.com.sg</a></div>
