              Today is 7th September 2007, and I think I just like to remind everyone to be aware and be alert at all times in accordance to our Total Defence campaign.

              My elder sister, brother-in-law and my niece were living in Arizona when this 911 occurred. The mosque in their area was pleted with missiles of stones by angry crowds when the World Trade Centre in N.Y. were attacked. My family in Singapore were so worried for their safety. They are still living in Arizona now.
              
              My ex-Indonesian wife in Bali was near the vicinity of Sari Club at Jalan Legian in Kuta. When the bomb blast occurred, she was so shaken. The Moslems in Bali were nearly attacked by the angry Balinese after the incident but the Indonesian authority managed to take control of the situation.
              
              By the way, my flat is near to Yishun MRT Station. JI had planned to bomb the Yishun MRT Station too and it was a blessing that our Singapore Authority managed to uncover the JI's Plan and apprehended them before they kill many innocent people.
              
              I lived in Bali from 1992 to 1995. Bali is like my home. It is a paradize to me. When it was attacked by the terrorists I was so angry.
              
              On 16th April 2004, my wife and I went to Bali for a short holiday. We visited the site where the Bali Bombing took place, whereby many innocent lives were perished. We saw a banner was being displayed on the site. I noted down the website address for my own reference and for others.
              
              I thought I send this to all of you.

I'm sorry Yihao and thanks Short Ninja for being there and translating it more clearly for me..LOLs.<br><br>[b]Yihao</strong> wrote:<br><br><strong>"eh.. wad can u dish up if i say i wan a article if i wan 2 get a special sum1 bak? perferable short and sweet.... thx  eh.."</strong><br><br>Ok Yihao, I have something for you to get someone special back. Actually, within this group achives itself, there are so many articles and movies you could use to woo someone special back Yihao ok.<br><br>Hmmm...Yihao...I'm just guessing here ok. You wanted this person to make you feel happy but because you have a hard time trying to make her understand you clearly in ways of character and maybe your attitude..she thought you were just jestering around with her and you were not serious with her. Is that it?<br><br>Alright, I have something appended below for you to try and use it for that special someone.<br><br><strong>I Promised That I Will Love You</strong><br><br>I cannot promise you that<br>I will not change<br>I cannot promise you that<br>I will not have many different moods<br>I cannot promise you that<br>I will not hurt your feelings sometimes<br>I cannot promise you that<br>I will not be erratic<br>I cannot promise you that<br>I will alwyas be strong<br>I cannot promise you that<br>my faults will not show<br>But..I Promised That I will Love You<br><br>Hope that will help you to win someone special to you with open arms ok. Good Luck Yihao. I cross my fingers for you.<br><br><strong>Yihao</strong> wrote:<br><br><strong>"and 1 more get my fren away from sum bad frens?&lt;- thats a diff one  "</strong><br><br>Yihao, I don't know whether this would help but I would suggest that you play the music video of "Beat It" by Michael Jackson and view it together with him or her. Usually, for someone to get away from someone who maybe a bit influential on a negative side takes alittle understanding and guidance from a person whom he or she can confided with and trusted. True friends will not hurt one another..but sometimes they made mistakes and one has to remind another to be prudence ok.<br><br>You take care now and thanks for asking ok. Come back here anytime when you need some advise. By the way, I almost forgot to mention....about love and relationship problems..Short Ninja is an expert..He is well known as "Dr Love" in Thailand's Forums.<br><br>Thanks Brother Short Ninja for being here for me while I am unavailable.<br><br>With Love,<br>Joe<br>[/b]</blockquote>thx LOLs Dr Love  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>10 SURE Ways to Fight Discouragement</strong></span><br><br>By Herve da Costa<br><br>Sometimes your actions do not yield the results you want and<br>discouragement kicks in. Getting out of it is about shifting your state of mind and not staying stuck in it. Here are 10 sure ways of eliminating discouragement quickly:<br><br><strong>TIP #1: Don't resist being discouraged.</strong><br>Don't resist being discouraged. On the contrary, feel it, be self-honest and acknowledge that you are. Spend 5 minutes writing down all the reasons why you are discouraged. This will be valuable data for updating and refining your personal action plan later.<br><br><strong>TIP #2: Remember </strong><br>Remember that you have made it so far and take 5-10 minutes to<br>list your accomplishments in the past 6 months.<br><br><strong>TIP #3: List</strong><br>Take 5 minutes to list all the things you are grateful for in<br>your life. I love doing that one!<br><br><strong>TIP #4: Get Healthy </strong><br>Make sure that you are not tired physically or sick. If you are,<br>go to bed early and take care of yourself. Get healthy and catch<br>up on sleep<br><br><strong>TIP #5: Congratulate </strong><br>First thing in the morning, call and congratulate 5 people on something that you like about them. Make it short and sweet. This technique can be amazingly effective. And, you will make friends.<br><br><strong>TIP #6: Get Busy</strong><br>In the storm, the real fighters like you keep paddling. Get busy: do 5 small quick things. The goal here is to remain active. Do 5 simple things that are related to your project: clean up your desk quick, confirm an appointment, and look up a web site of a potential employer or client. Each action should take 2-3 minutes. Stay simple and concise.<br><br><strong>TIP #7: Learn Something</strong><br>Learn something: read an article, a chapter in a personal growth book, take an evening class; not only will you learn new tools but you will also meet fighters like you. Team up with them.<br><br><strong>TIP #8: Simplify </strong><br>Simplify and cut down your to-do-list. You do not have one?<br>Well create one!<br><br><strong>TIP #9: Call a supportive friend </strong><br>Call a supportive friend and have breakfast together to share<br>and evaluate your strategies. Give each other supportive and<br>constructive feedback.<br><br><strong>TIP #10: Share </strong><br>Share with your partner: "I am feeling discouraged right now. I am trying to get out of that state of mind." It brings things out consciously. This is often good enough to shift.<br><br>Crawling under a blanket is fine too. Let people around you know that you need space and will be back. Once you are back on your feet again. Congratulate yourself for shifting out that mode.<br><br>You have just learned how to deal with one of our most challenging obstacles.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Recent research reveals 8 stealth strategies to keep the killer at bay.<br>It's time to raise your carcinogen shields -- and your overall health -- using these smart anti-C moves</strong><br><br>By: <strong>Steve Mazzucchi</strong>,<br>Illustrations by: <strong>David Arky </strong><br><br>The average mouse doesn't care much about <a href="http://skin%20cancer" rel="nofollow">skin cancer</a>. Outside of Disney cartoons, you won't see one slathering on sunscreen before heading out to dodge cats and search for cheese. But Gary Stoner, Ph.D., a professor emeritus of hematology and oncology at the Ohio State University medical center, does care about cancer. That's why he spends his days in a lab, feeding rodents polyphenols from seaweed and learning how to shrink skin cancerÂ–like tumors. He's a mouse's best friend. Maybe yours, too.<br><br>Stoner is just one of many researchers working to bring new weapons to the <a href="http://cancer" rel="nofollow">cancer</a> battle. Some study humans to take a fresh look at existing theories. Others, like Stoner, are testing tactics so bold that, so far, their only subjects have tails and whiskers.<br><br>But all these approaches (seaweed included) have one very positive thing in common: They're just plain good for you and bad for cancer cells. Here are eight strategies that just may turn the Big C into the Big See-Ya-Later. (Or, better yet, See-Ya-Never.)<br><br><strong>(1) Drink Pomegranate Juice</strong><br><br>Some say this luscious, lusty red fruit is Eve's original apple, but what the <a href="http://pomegranate" rel="nofollow">pomegranate</a> truly banishes is cancer risk. The fruit's deep red juice contains polyphenols, isoflavones, and ellagic acid, elements researchers believe make up a potent anticancer combo. It's been shown to delay the growth of prostate cancer in mice, and it stabilizes PSA levels in men who've been treated for prostate cancer. And now University of Wisconsin at Madison researchers have learned that pomegranate may also inhibit lung-cancer growth. If you currently smoke, have smoked in the past, or hang around in smoky places (Cleveland, for instance), the juice of the fruit could bolster your defenses.<br><br><strong>Use it:</strong> The mice in the Wisconsin study received the human equivalent of 16 ounces of juice per day, so quaff accordingly.<br><br><strong>(2) Eat Blueberries</strong><br><br>Got pterostilbene? Rutgers University researchers say this compound -- found in blueberries -- has <a href="http://colon%20cancer" rel="nofollow">colon cancer</a>-fighting properties. When rats with colon cancer were fed a diet supplemented with pterostilbene, they had 57 percent fewer precancerous lesions after 8 weeks than rats not given the compound did. Eat blueberries and you'll also benefit from a big dose of vitamin C (14 milligrams per cup). In a study of 42,340 men, New England Research Institute scientists discovered that men with the highest dietary vitamin C intake (as opposed to supplements) were 50 percent less likely to develop premalignant oral lesions than men with the lowest intake were.<br><br><strong>Use it:</strong> "About two servings daily is the human equivalent of what we fed the rats," says Bandaru Reddy, M.D., Ph.D., a chemical-biology professor at Rutgers. Load up at breakfast: A cup and a half of blueberries over cereal, plus 8 ounces of juice and half a grapefruit (for extra vitamin C), will do the trick. If that's too much to stomach at dawn, spread it out over the course of the day.<br><br><strong>(3) Relax a Little</strong><br><br><a href="http://Anxiety" rel="nofollow">Anxiety</a> won't only make you soil your shorts. Purdue University researchers tracked 1,600 men over 12 years and found that half of those with increasing levels of worry died during the study period. Talk about flunking the exam. Only 20 percent of the optimists died before the 12-year study was completed. More anxiety-producing news: Thirty-four percent of the neurotic men died of some type of cancer. How neurotic are we talking? "Think of the biggest worrier you know -- someone who stresses out over everything," says psychologist Daniel Mroczek, Ph.D., who conducted the study. "That man is probably above the 95th percentile in neuroticism. Then think of the most cool, calm, collected man you know. He's probably below the fifth percentile."<br><br><strong>Use it:</strong> To develop that critical, casual Jeff Spicoli vibe, learn to slow down your fast times: "The more time you spend in the present moment, the more relaxed you'll be, because most mental anguish occurs over stuff that's already happened or that may or may not happen in the future," says Claire Wheeler, M.D., Ph.D., the author of 10 Simple Solutions to Stress. "For the most part, right now is pretty damn good. If you practice being present while shaving, for example, eventually you'll also be more present when eating, making love, and working."<br><br><strong>(4) Pop Selenium</strong><br><br>Selenium has long been thought of as a cancer fighter, but you can have too much of a good thing, says David J. Waters, Ph.D., D.V.M., director of the Gerald P. Murphy Cancer Foundation, in West Lafayette, Indiana. A study of almost 1,000 men, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, found that when those with the lowest initial levels of selenium in their bodies received a daily supplement over a 4 1/2- year period, they cut their <a href="http://prostate-cancer" rel="nofollow">prostate-cancer </a>risk by an impressive 92 percent. But men who started out with high selenium were rewarded with an 88 percent increase in total cancer risk when they took the supplements. Moral: It pays to get your selenium level right.<br><br><strong>Use it:</strong> Selenium in the body is measured through toenail clippings. Send yours to the Murphy Foundation, and for less than $100 (price varies by state), they'll ship them to a lab and then inform you of your level 2 weeks later. If yours is out of range, the foundation will explain how to adjust your intake of Brazil nuts, tuna, meats, grains, and selenium supplements.

When he fed the polyphenols from brown seaweed to mice that had been bombarded with UV rays, their incidence of skin tumors dropped 60 percent. And the polyphenols shrank existing tumors by 43 percent. Better still, the doses that produced these effects were the equivalent of only 1 or 2 tablespoons in a human being. "Seaweed is low in calories and fat, yet it provides heart-helping fiber, bone-building calcium, and iron," says nutrition consultant Molly Morgan, R.D., C.D.N., owner of Creative Nutrition Solutions, in Vestal, New York. "Dried, roasted seaweed sheets used in making sushi also provide vitamins A and C.<br><br><strong>Use it:</strong> "Eat more <a href="http://sushi" rel="nofollow">sushi</a> rolls," says Stoner. "It's not quite the same seaweed, but it has some of the same compounds." As a bonus, sushi itself is a great muscle food. A typical spicy tuna roll has only 290 calories but packs 24 grams of protein. Also, look for a Korean-made, seaweed-fortified drink called EntroPower (<a href="http://entropower.com" rel="nofollow">entropower.com</a>), which should be hitting U.S. health-food stores soon.<br><br><strong>(6) Spend More Time Outside</strong><br><br>Scientists have viewed <a href="http://vitamin%20D" rel="nofollow">vitamin D</a> as a potent cancer fighter for decades, but there's never been a gold-standard trial -- until now. A Creighton University study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that women who supplemented their diets with 1,000 international units of vitamin D every day had a 60 percent to 77 percent lower incidence of cancer over a 4-year period than did women taking a placebo. "I don't think the effect is limited to women," says Joan Lappe, Ph.D., the lead study author. "Vitamin D is necessary for the best functioning of the immune system -- it causes early death of cancer cells."<br><br><strong>Use it:</strong> Nature intended us to make vitamin D from the sun, but depending on where you live, the time of year, and how much of an agoraphobe you are, you may not reach the optimal level of 80 nanomoles per liter of blood that way. A blood test can give you a baseline. From there, Lappe recommends supplementing with 1,100 to 2,000 IU of vitamin D in a stand-alone pill every day. Vitamin D is also in sardines, salmon, shiitake mushrooms, and reindeer meat -- which may explain Santa's longevity, despite the odd hours and jelly belly.<br><br><strong>(7) Clear Your Air</strong><br><br>Secondhand smoke may be even worse for you than we thought. A recent American Journal of Public Health study reveals that nonsmokers working in smoky places had three times the amount of NNK, a carcinogen, in their urine than nonsmoking workers in smoke-free joints had. And their levels of NNK rose 6 percent for every hour worked. "There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke, and the greater the exposure, the higher the risk," says the study's lead author, Michael Stark, Ph.D., principal investigator for the Multnomah County Health Department, in Portland, Oregon.<br><br><strong>Use it:</strong> Nine states have banned <a href="http://smoking" rel="nofollow">smoking</a> in all workplaces, bars, and restaurants: Arizona, Delaware, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Rhode Island, and Washington. So change locations, change professions, or change the laws. As you sip your pomegranate juice, sign up with Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights at <a href="http://no-smoke.org." rel="nofollow">no-smoke.org.</a><br><br><strong>8 Invest a Little Sweat Equity</strong><br><br>Study after study has pointed to the cancer-beating power of exercise. Now research from Norway has found that even a tiny dose of exercise has big benefits. A study of 29,110 men published last year in the International Journal of Cancer shows that men who exercised just once a week had a 30 percent lower risk of metastatic <strong>prostate cancer </strong>than did men who didn't work out at all. Increasing the frequency, duration, and intensity of the exercise correlated with a further, gradual reduction in risk.<br><br><strong>Use it:</strong> Just one bout of weekend warriorism -- a company softball game, pickup basketball, racquetball with your crusty uncle -- might qualify you for inclusion in the cancer-free 30 percent.</div>

The helplessness in the  mother's eyes, the scream of pain from the innocent 4-year-old child  haunted him until today.<br><br>You may ask why did the mother do so; had the child been naughty, had the child's hand been infected?? No, it was done for two simple words- - -TO BEG!<br><br>The desperate mother deliberately caused the child to be handicapped so that the child could go out to the streets to beg.<br><br>Taken aback by the scene, he dropped a piece of bread he was eating half-way. And almost instantly, flock 5 or 6 children swamped towards this small piece of bread which was covered with sand, robbing bits from one another. The natural reaction of hunger.<br><br>Stricken by the happenings, he instructed his guide to drive him to the nearest bakery. He arrived at two bakeries and bought every single loaf of bread he found in the bakeries. The owner was dumbfounded but willingly sold everything. He spent less than $100 to obtain about 400 loaves of bread (this is less than $0.25 per loaf) and spent another $100 to get daily necessities.<br><br>Off he went in the truck full of bread into the streets. As he distributed the bread and necessities to the children (mostly handicapped) and a few adults, he received cheers and bows from these unfortunate. For the first time in his life he wondered how people can give up their dignity for a loaf of bread which cost less than $0.25.<br><br>He began to tell himself how fortunate he is. How fortunate he is to be able to have a complete body, have a job! , have a family, have the chance to complain what food is nice and what isn't nice, have the chance to be clothed, have the many things that these people in front of him are deprived of...<br><br>Now I begin to think and feel it, too! Was my life really that bad?<br>Perhaps... no, I should not feel bad at all... What about you? Maybe the next time you think you are, think about the child who lost one hand to beg on the streets.<br><br>"Contentment is not the fulfillment of what you want; it is the realization of how much you already have."<br><br>When the door of happiness closes, another opens, but often times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has been opened for us.<br><br>It's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives.<br><br>The happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes along their way.<br><br>The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past, you can't go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches.<br><br>Please send this message to those people who mean something to you, to those who have touched your life in one way or another, to those who make you smile when you really need it, to those that make you see the brighter side of things when you are really down, to those who you want to let them know that you appreciate their friendship.<br><br>And if you don't, don't worry, nothing bad will happen to you, you will just miss out on the opportunity to brighten someone's day with this message.<br></div>

Let them think and discuss in a zero gravity would actually make them zero within themselves. That would actually help them to think accurately about their mission on earth. That would actually help them to make themselves see the whole blue marble and think about their mission to preach about God as a Whole. What we actually need now is not a new religion but a race of humans that unite the world in peace and harmony. That make humans more humane, compassionate and loving in their quest for Peace.<br><br>I would gather all the world leaders from all over the world to go to space and discuss the nation as a world leader.<br><br>Then I would think like this,<br><br><strong>"Now we are up here, what do you see from here? Take a look and see for yourselves how many people with us on that Blue Marble. Take your time to think for I have all the time to see your actions and reactions for waging wars among ourselves." </strong><br><br>That would actually make those cleric leaders and democratic leaders and<br>authoritative leaders to speak out their mind and let them split their mind like those countries that they can see from above. Maybe then they would see how to live together in peace and harmony without waging wars among mankind. Then they would not wish to linger in space forever and ever without any Home in space.<br><br>Its just a thought.
