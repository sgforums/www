            <div class='col-md body'>I like this story that my brother emailed to me. If I can share with others my knowledge, experience and story, I will. How about You??<br><br>Joe<br><br>$20.00 story, fee for the seminar $2000.00 comes with free drinks but...nice to read do pass it around.<br><br>A well-known speaker started off his seminar by holding up a $20.00 bill. In the room of 200, he asked, "Who would like this $20 bill?" Hands started going up.<br><br>He said, "I am going to give this $20 to one of you but first, let me do this. He proceeded to crumple up the $20 dollar bill. He then asked, "Who still wants it?" Still the hands were up in the air.<br><br>Well, he replied, "What if I do this?" And he dropped it on the ground and started to grind it into the floor with his shoe. He picked it up, now crumpled and dirty. "Now, who still wants it?" Still the hands went into the air.<br><br>My friends, we have all learned a very valuable lesson. No matter what I did to the money, you still wanted it because it did not decrease in value. It was still worth $20.<br><br>Many times in our lives, we are dropped, crumpled, and ground into the dirt by the decisions we make and the circumstances that come our way. We feel as though we are worthless. But no matter what has happened or what will happen, you will never lose your value.<br><br>Dirty or clean, crumpled or finely creased, you are still priceless to those who DO LOVE you. The worth of our lives comes not in what we do or who we know, but by WHO WE ARE. You are special- Don't EVER forget it."<br><br>If You do not pass this on, you may never know the lives it touches, the hurting hearts it speaks to, or the hope that it can bring. Count your blessings, not your problems. And remember: amateurs built the ark ...<br>professionals built the Titanic...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Subject: Short Story of the Day</strong></span></span><br><br>A boat docked in a tiny Mexican village. An American tourist complimented the Mexican fisherman on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took him to catch them.<br><br>"Not very long," answered the Mexican.<br><br>"But then, why didn't you stay out longer and catch more?" asked the American.<br><br>The Mexican explained that his small catch was sufficient to meet his needs and those of his family.<br><br>The American asked, "But what do you do with the rest of your time?"<br><br>"I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, and take a siesta with my wife. In the evenings, I go into the village to see my friends, have a few drinks, play the guitar, and sing a few songs . I have a full life."<br><br>The American interrupted, "I have an MBA from Harvard and I can help you! You should start by fishing longer every day. You can then sell the extra fish you catch. With the extra revenue, you can buy a bigger boat."<br><br>"And after that?" asked the Mexican.<br><br>"With the extra money the larger boat will bring, you can buy a second one and a third one and so on until you have an entire fleet of trawlers. Instead of selling your fish to a middle man, you can then negotiate directly with the processing plants and maybe even open your own plant. You can then leave this little village and move to Mexico City, Los Angeles, or even New York City! From there you can direct your huge new enterprise."<br><br>"How long would that take?" asked the Mexican.<br><br>"Twenty, perhaps twenty-five years," replied the American.<br><br>"And! after that?"<br><br>"Afterwards? Well my Friend, That's when it gets really interesting,"<br>answered the American, laughing. "When your business gets really big, you can start selling stocks and make millions!"<br><br>"Millions? Really? And after that?" said the Mexican.<br><br>"After that you'll be able to retire, live in a tiny village near the coast, sleep late, play with your children, catch a few fish, take a siesta with your wife and spend your evenings drinking and enjoying your friends."<br><br><strong>The moral of the story is:</strong><br><br>Know where you're going in life... you may already be there.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I like to share some of the sms that I had received from someone in the Philippines. Her name is Marife. I love most of her frequent sms that she has send to me. We have known each other since 2004.<br><br>1.   No one in this world can dictate to you where you can be happy. If you know where, and what it is, go for it. Just remember that HAPPINESS is not a destiny. It is a CHOICE!<br><br>2.   In your life, you will make note of a lot of people. Ones with whom you shared something special. Who will always mean something. There is the one you first kissed, the one you first loved, the one you will put on a pedestal, the one you are with right now, and the one that got away. That person with whom everything was perfect, but the timing was just wrong. No fault in the person, no flaw in the chemistry, but the cards just did not fall the right way.<br><br>3.   Life holds no promises to what will come our way. It makes no guarantees as to what we will have. It just gives us time to make choices and to take chances.<br><br>4.   Everything in life has a purpose. Just believe in yourself and take time to enjoy life's pleasures. Remember to follow your HEART and never surrender  your dreams.<br><br>5.   May God cradle you on His lap tonight and take all your tiredness brought by your busy day. May you feel the peace of His embrace so you will sleep tight under His care.<br><br>Thanks Marife.<br><br>With Love,<br>Joe</div>

They still apply today.<br><br>Make up your mind to be happy. Learn to find pleasure in simple things.<br><br>Make the best of your circumstances. No one has everything, and everyone has something of sorrow intermingled with gladness of life. The trick is to make the laughter outweigh the tears.<br><br>Don't take yourself too seriously. Don't think that somehow you should be protected from misfortune that befalls other people.<br><br>You can't please everybody. Don't let criticism worry you.<br><br>Don't let your neighbor set your standards. Be yourself.<br><br>Do the things you enjoy doing but stay out of debt.<br><br>Never borrow trouble. Imaginary things are harder to bear than real ones.<br><br>Since hate poisons the soul, do not cherish jealousy, enmity, grudges. Avoid people who make you unhappy.<br><br>Have many interests. If you can't travel, read about new places.<br><br>Don't hold postmortems. Don't spend your time brooding over sorrows or mistakes. Don't be one who never gets over things.<br><br>Do what you can for those less fortunate than yourself.<br><br>Keep busy at something. A busy person never has time to be unhappy.<br><br></div>

Think of the people who are living in the streets.<br><br>Before whining about the distance you drive, think of someone who walks the same distance with their feet.<br><br>And when you are tired and complain about your job, think of the unemployed, the disabled and those who wished they had your job. But before you think of pointing the finger or condemning another, remember that not one of us are without sin and we all answer to one maker.

            <div class='col-md body'>Thought I share an excerpt extracted from my manuscript 'Mind Of A Mankind'.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>Joe<br><br><span class="large"><strong>What is a Mind and body?</strong></span><br><br>The mind is like the computer software and hard wares. I have heard numerous occasions, from many people quasi-explanation of the mind like this; Â‘The computer is the hardware which resembles the brain and the software of the computer is the mind.Â’ It is a good similitude, cleverly described and expounded.<br><br>The physicians have catalogue the brain of yours like a place of many compartments for different body functions. The brain is the nerveÂ’s centre for your body and many messages send from different parts of your body are connected by the nervous systems which are meant for your body to experience external and internal sensation. All these sensations that your body feels would then relay all the information that the brain needs to know so that you could identify the information and execute the orders for your body reactions to the internal and external sensation experiences. The signals that the brain received from the body senses react to the external and internal conditions of the body and control the body movements. Thus, when you feel chill breeze, your skin hairs straighten-up causing goose pimples effect and your arms would automatically wrap around your body to generate body heats for warmth. In wars, when the soldiers are under extreme stress or fear, the body would generally feel instinctive about the ambience surrounding them. These instinct sensations are normally generated for body control and intuitions and when they hear any slight movements or gunshots from somewhere, they would automatically dogged for cover.<br><br>The instinct to take cover, to control the mind and body is for survival. The body reacts to instinct and intuition feelings. The body is the measuring instrument for the mind to gauge circumstances around it. Hence, sometimes you wonder whether your instinct and intuition effects are like the animalsÂ’ instinct and intuition of your mind and body reactionary behaviours.<br><br>The brain surgeons operated and dissected the brain myriad of times but still they could not extract the mind from the greyish tissues. The brain itself is so complex and when they tried to learn more about the functions of the brain, they could vaguely tell you where the storage of the memories and information are stored. The information and memories are not seen inside the brain but inside the unseen mind. They have conceded that the mind is the memory bank and the microchip of the brain.<br><br>The Mind of yours receives interaction information from the brain pertinent to the body external and internal experiences. It synchronizes your mind and body reactions. It also callisthenically choreographs your idiosyncrasy characters and behaviours, talents, intelligence and emotion as a human being. Intelligence of yours develop and augmented from learning and experiencing to the circumstances and milieu that you see, hear, taste, feel and breathe. Without the physical body to experience and learn about the world around you would render you as being ignorant to your own self-consciousness as living beings. When you take for granted that you were born to the world for the purpose of just being alive and to die later, you could say that you are making yourself like a life form without any physical body. Mind and Body are always about learning and experiencing the world around you and also about the world within you. That is the price you gain not lose, when you realised that your body is good and your mind is god.<br><br>The mind is intangible. It has no matters or shapes, yet it is there for you to look at and understand vaguely. The mind of human beings is still a puzzling configuration for many psychologists or doctors because the cerebration of the human race and animals are very complex. None of them could actually point out for sure how the brain and the mind really works.<br><br>The mind is not outside or far away from you but near you, We are nearer than your jugular veins. The mind is really inside your brain if you must know. Without a brain, you would have no consciousness of the body and without a body, We are unable to learn, develop and gain knowledge through life experiences on earth or multiplying human bodies.<br><br><strong>The mind is the consciousness</strong><br><br>This consciousness is what they are really interested in and enthusiastically willing to delve and explore with profundity. The definition of a mind is very complex, just like you are trying to define and differentiate between the essence of Faith and Superstition, or Your Consciousness and Your Soul. Like the empirical question of a man and a woman or a chicken and an egg, which one of them came first?<br><br>If you ask any psychologists for the definition word of "I", they would say that it is actually the psyche, which comprises of many levels of thoughts and actions. These levels of thoughts and actions are multi-level process chain reaction. They pictured the analogy of the psyche of an individual like decks that contemporaneously concatenated with many chest players align above one another in multi-level complex sequence. When one player from a level moves, the rest of the chest players in other levels will subsequently move simultaneously. Like soldiers marching in precision during the parade manoeuvres. The analogy denotes the mind ability to function as a whole that represents the psyche or "I" of an individual that makes his or her existence and identity, unique and different from those around them.<br><br>The idea of Solipsism, Existentialism, Archetype and Collective thought forms, taught by many modern philosophers like Kierkegaard, Sartre, Heidegger, Sigmund Frued, Carl Jung and others, were some of the knowledge that admit the self as something existing or knowable.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>A Cup of Coffee</strong></span><br><br>A group of alumni, highly established in their careers, got together to visit their old university professor. The conversation soon turned into complaints about stress in work and life.<br><br>Offering his guests coffee, the professor went to the kitchen and returned with a large pot of coffee and an assortment of cups -porcelin,plastic, glass, crystal, some plain-looking, some expensive and some exquisite - telling them to help themselves to the coffee.<br><br>After all the students had a cup of coffee in hand, the professor said: "If you noticed, all the nice looking expensive cups were taken up,leaving behind the plain and cheap ones. While it is but normal for you to want only the best for yourselves, that is the source of your problems and stress."<br><br>"Be assured that the cup itself adds no quality to the coffee. In most cases, it's just more expensive and in some cases even hides what we drink. What all of you really wanted was coffee, not the cup, but you consciously went for the best cups...and then began eyeing each other's cups."<br><br>"Now consider this: Life is the coffee, and the jobs, houses, cars,things, money and position in society are the cups. They are just tools to hold and contain life, and the type of cup we have does not define nor change the quality of life we live. Sometimes, by concentrating only on the cup, we fail to enjoy the coffee God has provided us."<br><br>God brews the coffee, not the cups...enjoy your coffee. "Being happy doesn't mean everything's perfect, it means you've decided to see beyond the imperfections". So, always live in peace and peace will live in you.<br></div>
