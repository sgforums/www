Leaving your hometown after twenty five years is very difficult and can leave a deep longing in your heart. My trips back to Chicago have to be very short because I have multiple sclerosis and being away from home adds to the already painful symptoms. My last visit was for just one day.<br><br>Making my way to O'Hare Airport and through the security to the gate was like climbing Everest. Usually every step I take is a struggle, like a rusty old Gremlin trying to drive up a mountain road, and this trip in the summer heat particularly made it hard. Since I have not been able to work for over a year and a half and my budget is very, very thin, I took public transportation. Of course I could have gotten a wheel chair, but at age 47 and feeling young in my mind, this was not a comfortable thing for me to do.<br><br>I finally got through security and made it to a food court where I had to sit down and get some relief. I was using my cane at that point. There was a Starbucks nearby and I wanted a cup of coffee. I looked at the long line and sadly knew that I could not stand in line. I wondered how many years I would have to live with the pain and struggle, before a cure was found.<br><br>Out of nowhere, a woman came up to me and asked if she could get me a cup of coffee; it was like she read my mind. She said her sister had M.S. and she knew what it was like.<br><br>I was in tears, not because I could get the coffee, but someone in the middle of what can be a soulless place, came out of nowhere. As I started to cry, I told her that it wasn't the coffee, it was the fact that she went out of her way to check on another person who may have needed something.<br><br>Not only did she help me with my physical need by offering me the coffee, she helped me with my emotional need, when she told me that researchers at the Oregon Health Science University say they are coming close to finding something to restore the myelin sheath, nerve coating, that is destroyed in people with M.S..<br><br>Earlier on my trip to Chicago, I was at a festival on a hot sunny street, with no shade in sight. I was so tired and thirsty and the vendors were so far away (for me). I didn't know how hard it would be for me to get a bottle of water. I shouted from a distance to two different people who had coolers filled with bottles of water and I offered to pay them if they could bring it to me; both looked at me with mistrust and did not take me up on the offer.<br><br>The woman at the airport restored my faith in humanity that weekend. Not only that, but she gave me something to look forward to about my health, which I so badly need. (After ten years, it doesn't feel like there has been rapid progress in the treatment of M.S.)<br><br>It may seem like a minor thing to ask someone what they need, but you never know how important it may be to someone else. If you see someone with a cane or someone who just looks tired or stressed, just ask them if you can buy them a coke or get them some water, it could mean everything to them.<br><br>-----------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>TodayÂ’s e-mail was sponsored<br>by Shmuel Greenbaum<br><br>The author of todayÂ’s story is an expert at website design and graphics.

            <div class='col-md body'>How caring and loving are you towards your loved ones, children, husband and wife, when you still have them and alive.<br><br>There were photographs with the texts but unfortunately the photographs did not appeared within this posting. The incidence was photographed and narrated by a photographer.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>With Love,<br>Joe<br><br><strong><span class="large">They are birds after all...... </span></strong><br><br>It was a gloomy Saturday afternoon. A flock of birds was spending great time searching for food and playing on the main road. Out of the sudden, a big truck sped through... sad thing had happened again.<br><br>Birds can feel too. Although this bird had already died, another bird flew over to her immediately, just like a family member, unable to accept the truth.<br><br>Not long after that, another car stormed in causing the dead bird's body to whirl with the wind. The spouse noticed the movement. As if she was still alive, he quickly flew beside her again.<br><br>He stayed beside her and yelled ... "WHY ARE YOU NOT GETTING UP!?"<br><br>Unfortunately, she's no longer able to hear him. In the meantime, he's trying to lift her  up.<br><br>He, of course, was unable to bear the burden. Another car soon passed by. He quickly flew off. Once the car had gone, he came down again.<br><br>Although other birds told him its useles, he never gave up. He was trying his best to lift her up to see her flying again. Another car passed by, her dead body whirled again as if still alive and trying to fly.<br><br>He had used all of his energy, however...<br><br>The photographer said he couldn't shoot any longer. The photographer was so worried that the living bird was going to get hurt by passing cars. So he picked up the dead bird and left it at the roadside. The live one still lingered at a nearby tree as if crying with his singing and refused to leave.<br><br><strong>Do humans have the same feelings nowadays? </strong>I wonder.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Pink ribbon...Really something &amp; how touching!...it's a passer &amp; keeper all in One</strong></span><br><br>Please keep this going......<br><br>A handsome, middle-aged man walked quietly into the cafe and sat down.<br><br>Before he ordered, he couldn't help noticing a group of younger men at the table next to him. It was obvious they were making fun of something about him, and it wasn't until he remembered he was wearing a small pink ribbon on the lapel of his suit that he became aware of what the joke was all about.<br><br>The man brushed off the reaction as ignorance, but the smirks began to get to him. He looked one of the rude men square in the eye, placed his hand beneath the ribbon and asked, quizzically, "this?"<br><br>With that the men all began to laugh out loud. The man he addressed said, as he fought back laughter, "Hey, sorry man, but we were just commenting on how pretty your pink ribbon looks against your blue jacket!"<br><br>The middle aged man calmly motioned for the joker to come over to his table and invited him to sit down. As uncomfortable as he was, the guy obliged, not really sure why.<br><br>In a soft voice, the middle aged man said, "I wear this ribbon to bring awareness about breast cancer. I wear it in my mother's honour."<br><br>"Oh, sorry dude. She died of breast cancer?"<br><br>"No, she didn't. She's alive and well. But her breasts nourished me as an infant, and were a soft resting place for my head when I was scared or lonely as a little boy. I'm very grateful for my mother's breasts, and her health."<br><br>"Umm," the stranger replied, "Yeah."<br><br>"And I wear this ribbon to honour my wife", the middle-aged man went on.<br><br>"And she's okay, too?" the other guy asked.<br><br>"Oh, yes. She's fine. Her breasts have been a great source of loving pleasure for both of us, and with them she nurtured and nourished our beautiful daughter 23 years ago. I am grateful for my wife's breasts, and for her health.<br><br>"Uh huh. And I guess you wear it to honour your daughter, also?"<br><br>"No. It's too late to honour my daughter by wearing it now. My daughter died of breast cancer one month ago. She thought she was too young to have breast cancer, so when she accidentally noticed a small lump, she ignored it.<br><br>She thought that since it wasn't painful, it mustn't be anything to worry about."<br><br>Shaken and ashamed, the now sober stranger said, "Oh, man, I'm so sorry, mister."<br><br>"So, in my daughter's memory, too, I proudly wear this little ribbon, which allows me the opportunity to enlighten others. Now, go home and talk to your wife and your daughters, your mother and your friends."<br><br>"And here," the middle-aged man reached in his pocket and handed the other man a little pink ribbon.<br><br>The guy looked at it, slowly raised his head and asked, "Can you help me put it on?"<br><br>This is breast cancer awareness month. Do regular breast self-exams and if you are a woman over the age of 40, have annual mammogram tests.<br><br>And encourage those women you love to do the same.<br><br>Please send this on to anyone you would like to remind of the importance of breast cancer awareness.<br><br><strong>A CANDLE LOSES NOTHING BY LIGHTING ANOTHER CANDLE.</strong><br><br>PLEASE KEEP THIS CANDLE GOING!</div>
