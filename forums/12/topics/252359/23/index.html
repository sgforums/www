              <p>Hi Brother.....hahaha...if I'm still a millionaire now...I will not be driving the old Nissan March 83....but I would be driving a Jaguar or a Mercedez Benz...and I will donate alot of money to all the Ophanage Institutions in Singapore and overseas...</p>
              <p>Sorry I did not update you about my occupation brother...I'm working in the Operating Theatre as an Operating Theatre Technical Assistant (OTTA). I've not been able to write in the internet for quite awhile due to workload and busy schedules...however whenever I have the time I would visit the groups or forums that I belong to and read my email too.</p>
              <p>Hmmm...8th of August and 9th of August I may be spending 2 days in Malacca but do email me or call me prior your arrival to Singapore and when you are in Singapore brother. Maybe we could meet up after my return from Malacca. Send my best regards to Rosi.</p>
              <p>Take care.</p>
              <p>With Love,</p>

              <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thought I share this movie link with you.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><strong>From the desk of ... Mary Robinson Reynolds</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>On this beautiful summer day, I'm pleased to send you our newest movie: </strong><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.SpeakToUsOfChildren.com"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>www.SpeakToUsOfChildren.com</strong></span></span></a></p>
              <p><strong> </strong></p>
              <p><strong>It is based on the works of Lebanese-American Author, Poet and Philosopher Kahlil Gibran.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>I first read this most complete explanation of what being a parent really means, early in my teaching career.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>Then I had children of my own, and as I felt the gut wrenching grip of parental fear come over me time and time again ... the words from this beautiful prose poem would bring me back to the basics, and I would "know" what to do ... or not do! The most meaningful phrases for me were:</strong></p>
              <blockquote>
              <p><strong><em>Your children are not your children.<br>They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.<br>They come through you but not from you, <br>though they are with you, yet they belong not to you.</em></strong></p>
              </blockquote>
              <p><strong>And as soon as I'd revisit this concept, I'd immediately begin to feel better... It is my hope that you will enjoy this movie and find peace, solace and direction through it's message. Please feel free to pass this along to those who will appreciate receiving it from you.</strong></p>

              <p>I watched the movie titled "The First Sight" on Mediacorps Channel 5 a few days ago and I felt for this person had an eye surgery to restore his sight again after being blind since he was a toddler and then after a month of eye surgery and regaining his sight for only a month or two, his eyes began to fail on him again and the eye specialist could not do anything to help him again...he became Blind Man again...but he managed to accept his destiny being a Blind Man again.</p>

              <p>From: Big Bear &lt;beary1956@yahoo.com&gt;<br>Subject: [Simply Whatever] Prayer: 4,257,105<br>Date: Sunday, 3 August, 2008, 6:26 PM<br><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Prayer: 4,257,105</strong> <br><br> This is one of the best prayers I think I have ever read.<br> <br> PRAY THIS EVEN IF YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE IT!! <br> IT WILL ONLY TAKE A MINUTE.<br><br> I started not to do this, but as I read it.... I understood God to<br> say, "You need a miracle tomorrow.... so here goes ... <br><br>"Fearing people is a dangerous trap,<br>but trusting the Lord means safety."<br>Proverbs 29:25 (New Living Translation)<br>New Living Translation (NLT)<br>Holy Bible. New Living Translation copyright © 1996, 2004 <br>by Tyndale Charitable Trust. <br>Used by permission of Tyndale House Publishers<br><br>Fearing people is a dangerous trap,<br>but trusting the Lord means safety.<br><br> You never know when God is going to bless you!!<br> Good things happen<br> when you least expect them to!!!!!!!!<br> Change the number in the subject box <br> when you forward it by adding one!!!<br><br> Dear Lord, I thank You for this day,<br> I thank You for my being able<br> to see and to hear this morning. <br> I'm blessed because You are a<br> forgiving God and an understanding God.<br><br> You have done so much for me<br> and You keep on blessing me.<br> Forgive me this day for everything<br> I have done, said or thought <br> that was not pleasing to you.<br> I ask now for Your forgiveness. <br><br>Please keep me safe from all danger and harm.<br>Help me to start this day with a new attitude <br>and plenty of gratitude. Let me make the best <br>of each and every day to clear my mind<br>so that I can hear from You.<br><br>Please broaden my mind that I can accept all things.<br>Let me not whine and whimper over things I<br> have no control over. <br>And give the best response when I'm pushed<br> beyond my limits.<br><br> I know that when I can't pray, You listen to my heart. <br>Continue to use me to do Your will. <br>Continue to bless me that I may be a<br> blessing to others. Keep me strong<br>that I may help the weak... <br>Keep me uplifted that I may have<br>words of encouragement. <br><br>I pray for those that are lost <br>and can't find their way.<br>I pray for those that<br>are misjudged and misunderstood.<br><br> I pray for those who don't know<br> You intimately. I pray for those <br>that will delete this without<br> sharing it with others I pray for those that don't believe.<br><br> But I thank you that I believe that God changes people <br> and God changes things. <br><br>I pray for all my sisters and brothers. <br>For each and every family member in their households. <br><br>I pray for peace, love and joy in their homes <br>That they are out of debt and all their needs are met.<br><br> I pray that every eye that reads this knows there is<br> no problem, circumstance, or situation greater than God.<br><br> Every battle is in Your hands for You to fight.<br><br> I pray that these words be received into the hearts<br> of every eye that sees it. Amen.<br><br> If you prayed this prayer, <br>change the number in the subject box<br> before forwarding the message so people can<br> See how many people<br> have done so. <br><br>God Bless!!!!!!!!!!! <br><br>Just repeat this phrase and see<br> how God moves!!<br><br> God I love you and I need you!!<br><br> Pass this message to 10 people except you and me. <br><br><br>You will receive<br> a blessing tomorrow.<br><br> Know that you are already blessed<br> by the person who sent this to you!</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>The teacher asked her class what each wanted to become when they grew up. A chorus of responses came from all over the room.</p>
              <p> <br>"A football player," "A doctor," "An astronaut," "The president," "A fireman," "A teacher," "A race car driver."</p>
              <p>Everyone that is, except Tommy.</p>
              <p> <br>The teacher noticed he was sitting there quiet and still.</p>
              <p>So she said to him, "Tommy, what do you want to be when you grow up?"</p>
              <p> <br>"Possible" Tommy replied.</p>
              <p> <br>"Possible?" asked the teacher.</p>
              <p> <br>"Yes," Tommy said. "My mom is always telling me I'm impossible. So when I get to be big, I want to be possible."</p>
              <p><br><strong>Parent's Thought For The Day:</strong></p>
              <p> </p>

              </strong></span></strong></strong></p><div><strong><strong><strong>"Once You Give It Away…"<br></strong></strong></strong></div><strong><strong><strong>
              </strong></strong><span style="font-size: medium; color: #00007f;"><br>It has been said with regard to sharing what you have and know with others: Once you give it away, then it’s really yours, for you have the eternal merit of the kind act. The money you give to others is no longer material; it has been transformed into spirituality. The ancient alchemists wanted to turn simple metal into gold. That is what you are doing when you share your money with someone in need.<br><br>The vital knowledge you share with others truly belongs to you when you pass it on from the data bank in your brain to the brain of another human being. This knowledge will live on and on. He will transfer it to the brains of others and they will utilize that knowledge themselves and keep passing it on. Your merit keeps growing with the positive effects that mushroom endlessly. <br><br>A miser tries to hoard his money. But he is failing to utilize what he owns. If he were to realize how he is limiting his true wealth, he would hasten to find some worthy person, institution, or cause that would benefit from a portion of his fortune. The part that he gives away might seem to diminish the size of that fortune. In reality what he gives away remains his eternal possession and the true size of his fortune is calculated by what he gives and not by what he keeps. Some people use the expression, "He is worth ‘X’ amount of money." They usually refer to the money, investments, and property that someone has not yet given away. The expression would be more accurate if the calculations only included what one has donated to others.<br><br>It has been said that a person has more pleasure from one share of his own than from nine shares that come from someone else. The money you give, the possessions you lend, and the knowledge you share are what belong to you. This has infinitely more value than what you don’t give, lend, and share.<br><br>A person may overcome a phobia, a limitation, or a bad habit. That is a praiseworthy achievement. But a greater achievement is when that person shares his knowledge and experiences with others who have similar phobias, limitations, and habits. They are helped with his knowledge. They too can pass this on to others and more and more benefit from the original sharing. The value of the information that was given away expands and expands. If it were to have just remained in the first person’s brain cells it would have eventually disappeared without accomplishing a fraction of what it accomplished by being passed along.<br><br>When you have a dilemma: Should I share what I have with others or should I keep it for and to myself. Make the wise decision. Focus on the future outcome of each choice. Give, lend, and share with those who could benefit. And then what is truly yours is increased.<br></span><span style="font-size: medium; color: #00007f; font-family: Times New Roman;"><br></span><span style="font-size: medium; color: #00007f;">One of my students related the following story:<br><br>
              <div><em>When I was a young child, I resented the idea of sharing my belongings with others. "My toys are mine," I would say. "If I let others use them, than I am losing out. If I share the candies that are mine with others, then I have less."<br><br>I retained this attitude as I grew older. I was often too embarrassed to refuse to give and share when I was asked to do so. But I would never volunteer, and I looked for ways and means to hold on to what was mine.<br><br>I read somewhere, "Only what you give to others is really yours." This struck a true chord within me. When I kept things, I didn’t feel a sense of loss, but I didn’t feel expansively wealthy either. I started enjoying giving to others. It was unbelievable how my sense of personal wealth grew as I gave.<br></em></div>

She came to live at the nursing home after a match that she thought was out resulted in a fire that burned down her apartment. She lost everything that was in her home.<br><br>After she settled in to the nursing home she spoke of her loss. "All I have left," she said, "is what I gave away."<br><br>She was philosophical about it, for as a young child her father taught her a saying she used and shared with us: "What is, is and what isn't, isn't." That helped her move on in life. <br><br>As her friends heard of what happened, they brought pieces of her artwork that she had give them before the fire back to her, to decorate her new room. It became her new home until she passed away a few years later.<br></span><span style="color: #00007f; font-family: Times New Roman;"><br>

              <p><strong>I LOVE YOU</strong></p>
              <p>A story is told of an eight-year-old girl in an orphanage many years ago. She was so painfully unattractive that she was shunned by other children and ignored or disliked by her teachers. Two institutions managed to get rid of her and the officials of her current home were seeking some pretext for freeing themselves of her unwelcomed presence. One day they thought their opportunity had arrived. An ironclad rule, that before any communication from a child could be mailed or distributed it must first be approved by the director, had been broken. The girl had been observed stealing down to the gate and carefully placing an envelope in the branches of a tree overhanging the fence. The director and his assistant eagerly rushed down to the tree to intercept the letter. The director tore open the envelope. He read it, then bowed his head silently as he passed the note to his assistant. It said: "To anybody who finds this. I love you."</p>
