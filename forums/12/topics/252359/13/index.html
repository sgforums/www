            <div class='col-md body'>Motivation for Change<br>By Peter Farley<br><br>It's easy for Guidance to say we should change, and this is how we<br>should be, and this is how we should act and how we should feel etc.,<br>but for most of us change is the hardest thing we'll ever do. And as<br>Mark Twain said, "Mankind is a bunch of cowards . . . ", so most<br>often it is the fear of change that makes most of us cowards. This is<br>the game our minds like to play with us to stop us from making a<br>choice, "But what if . . . ?" Or, if we do make a choice, it then<br>plays that other nefarious game, "Shoulda, woulda, coulda . . ."<br><br>Some of us are lucky enough to have a spouse, 2 1/2 kids, and a white<br>picket fence -- the so-called American dream, so to say there is<br>something we should change about this is crazy is it not? It doesn't<br>really matter that our spouse is a handler/controller sent into this<br>lifetime simply to shut down our spiritual mission. It doesn't matter<br>that our kids are dysfunctional because they see the lovelessness of<br>the situation they are living in. It doesn't matter that paying off<br>the mortgage for the white picket fence saps all our strength,<br>spiritually and otherwise. Does it?<br><br>The old spiritual adage is that if you like what you're getting, then<br>keep on doing what you're doing. If you don't like what you're<br>getting, then something needs to change about what it is you are<br>doing. That something in each of us that we like to term 'the seeker'<br>knows there's something better out there than what we currently have,<br>and so we go out looking for it.<br><br>Unfortunately, sometimes in that seeking we get lost and need to find<br>who it is we truly are when we just stop all the seeking and be. Then<br>it is we hear the still small voice within us much louder than when<br>our mind is leading us down every labyrinthine pathway in search of a<br>teacher or knowledge of how to be more of who we already are. And so<br>it goes on lifetime after lifetime after lifetime, when as Paul<br>Twitchell rightly knew, the key to all of this lies in just two<br>words "Just be".<br><br>But that means giving up all the seeking, all the feeding of the mind<br>so that it goes into quandaries thinking it's going to starve without<br>further input, all the learning, all the what if's, all the playing<br>the games the Matrix has placed before us simply to keep us too busy<br>to just be. For in that moment we let go of all that nonsense and<br>could 'just be', their elaborate chaos and disorder would all fall<br>away and we would see clearly for the first time; and nothing would<br>ever be able to have power over us again.<br><br>The Biblical saying of the how hard it is for a rich person to enter<br>heaven (being more difficult than a camel passing through the eye of<br>the needle) simply relates to our over involvement with things<br>instead of what should be our primary goal (and is if we only<br>realized it) spiritual growth and awareness of the perfection which<br>already lies within us. We can have anything we want in life, if<br>we're not attached to it. That is the true secret not taught in `The<br>Secret', for if we're attached to something then it means we have a<br>fear of losing it and that fear will bring to itself that which we<br>fear the most. There is only one way of creating in this<br>SuperUniverse. We create a mold with our mind and fill it with the<br>strongest emotion we have for it and the allowance of Spirit to<br>manifest that thing in our life --and voila! it suddenly appears. The<br>two strongest emotions to use in manifesting things in our life are<br>FEAR And LOVE. That which we fear we attract into our lives. Those<br>things we love we attract into our lives. Unfortunately since we are<br>pretty much all programmed by the New World Order to live in a<br>constant state of fear it is the former that most often manifests for<br>us -- those things which we fear.<br><br>Watch anyone who knows that money is just energy and needs to keep<br>flowing; the money keeps coming and going for them without being held<br>onto. They give and they get. Same is true of people who give from<br>the heart, they give and they get. Unless of course that other major<br>problem of being human is supreme in their lives -- that is that they<br>feel unworthy of receiving all that is good.<br><br>Attachment is anti-change and so will always bring one to a downfall.<br>Feeling ourselves unworthy of having anything we need is the wrong<br>attitude to create with, so once again we come down to what Paul<br>Twitchell said were the two major factors in<br>spiritual 'enlightenment' -- attitude and attention. What is your<br>attitude? And where does your attention lie?<br><br>The biggest problem I see with so many people coming to me for<br>assistance is that they are either in two great a fear state to<br>change, or they have no motivation to change Â– living in denial that<br>things are always going to be this way and that somehow God or Big<br>Brother will save their scrawny necks from bank failures, or real<br>estate market busts, or grocery stores running out of food in some<br>type of emergency. Well, good luck.<br><br>As Guidance one said to me the worse things get the more people will<br>be looking for assistance and a way out of their conditions. But as<br>I've written about before, so many people were lined up on the shore<br>taking pictures of the approaching tsunami and only started to run<br>when the first wave was breaking over them. Well, some will run with<br>the first wave, but right now many are still standing on the beach<br>waiting for the second and third waves before they will get off their<br>fences and make a beeline for whatever spiritual protection and<br>Guidance they need under such circumstances.<br><br>Motivation is the impetus that makes us act, and all of us need to be<br>finding that motivation right now or if we're quite content with what<br>we've already got and don't believe that will change Â–then sit down<br>and relax and let go of any `airy fairy' notion of ascension or<br>spiritual changes coming.<br><br>If we're not happy with what we've got and do believe `something's<br>going on', then we need to find the strongest motivation we can and<br>get moving. Once upon a time (like in a fairytale) I would have<br>thought for most people this would have been the notion of saving<br>their families. After a dozen years, however, I know that family is a<br>bigger excuse NOT to change than it is to get up and really do<br>something meaningful.<br><br>Therefore the biggest motivation we might have to change is that<br>we're not happy with what we've got and where we are and what we're<br>not doing in our lives, and hopefully, for Creation's sake, this will<br>be enough to make us get up and act and do something worthwhile<br>before all our past lives of training for this moment go down the<br>drain, along with any hope of us ever fulfilling what it is we once<br>upon a time agreed to come here to do.<br><br>Wishing you strength in this moment and those to come.<br><br>In service, Peter<br><br><a href="http://www.4truthseekers.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.4truthseekers.org </a></div>

Both of us went different direction in our lives but we ended up knowing that both of us are going into the same direction of finding the meaning of our lives now or before...that is rather strange don't you think...being in the same boat again and watching what is and what was and what is going to be and where we are now would be in the mind of ours until our last breath on this planet earth. Probably after we die too we would meet again and start to wonder together what would be the next thing we are going to do from there on.....your own direct diving experience of near death brought to mind why it had happened to you...and I was actually thinking about it why you changed so much too....was it before or after that experience brother.<br><br><strong>Short Ninja </strong>wrote:<br><br><strong>"I might go to Singapore and Indonesia this January"</strong><br><br>Ok I'm looking forward to it but I may not be in Singapore or Skudai...I may ended up in Kuala Lumpur for work but I think I can come down to Singapore or at Skudai, Johor Baru, to meet up with you.<br><br><strong>Short Ninja </strong>wrote:<br><br><strong>"Hey you need to create and give me a new e-mail address because my mails usually get lost in your mail box."</strong><br><br>I'm really sorry about it Brother and I have about three thousand over mails that I haven't read in my yahoo inbox mail...Nah, I would like to keep that email address and I just need a computer at home or a laptop to trace your mails....I would like to track that mails and reply you....I need to delete those spam mails too.

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>Unhappy? Depressed?</strong></span><br><br>Well, obviously if you're really bad off you should really talk to a professional, but as long as you're not contemplating any ugly irreversible acts, here's something that might help.<br><br>Think of someone you know that seems pretty happy about life. How would you describe their attitude? Are they kidding themselves? Are they ignoring the ugly truth about life that's right in front of their eyes and pretending that some happy fantasy world that exists only in their heads is real? Well, guess what. That is exactly how every happy person in the world acts. And the really strange thing is that it's OK. Because the reason that you are unhappy is that you have constructed a fantasy world just as complete and just as removed from the "facts" as the Pollyanna imaginings that you so despise in those happy people.<br><br>Reality is in fact neither good nor bad, it is a very plastic inkblot sort of thing that can be bent and twisted in many directions depending on your beliefs. WHAT! you say? What about THE TRUTH? Well, that's a complicated question and it gets into the meaning of life bit that we haven't gotten to yet, but suffice it to say that what is REALLY going on is so strange, so complex, and so far beyond our everyday understanding, that it bears no relationship to what you think of as "reality", "truth", or "reason". Good and bad, happy and sad, these are notions that you are imposing on the world around you. But, more on that in part II of the Meaning of Life Page.<br><br>The answer to unhappiness is both liberating and infuriating, but here it is. Happiness doesn't depend on anything that has or has not happened in the past, nor does it depend on your future prospects (thank God, eh?). The simple fact is, in order to be happy:<br><br><strong>You Must Decide to be Happy.</strong><br><br>Yep. Isn't that aggravating? You can't blame it on anyone else, and no one else can do a thing for you. You've just got to decide to be happy, whether or not your logical mind thinks it is rational to be happy and whether or not your moral sense thinks you deserve to be happy. You absolutely will not be happy for any length of time until you decide to, and if you decide to, you can be happy in the face of the most miserable circumstances.<br>Happy deciding.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">Armistice Day</span></strong><br>From "Armistice Day 1918", the Prologue to Savage Peace: Hope and Fear in America, 1919 by Ann Hagedorn:<br><br>Somewhere beyond the mist and the misery on that November morning, six men met in a railcar to end a war. News of the truce moved through the trenches on the trembling lips of soldiers waiting for the screams of flying shells to cease before they believed what they were told. Some heard it first from their captains who distributed strips of paper that read: "Cease firing on all fronts. 11/11/11. Gen. John J. Pershing." Others would never know. They were the unlucky ones killed in the fragile hours before 11 A.M., before the fighting abruptly stopped. The silence, so unfamiliar, was almost as unsettling as the sounds, as if a giant hand suddenly lay across this land of rotting flesh to hush the din of battle. Silence. Prayers. Tears. Then came the roar of cheering and the popping of bonfires piled high with captured ammunition and anything that could burn. The madness was ending, or so it seemed. And fear was giving way to hope.<br><br>"One minute we was killing people," a soldier later said, "and then the world was at peace for the first time in four years. It seemed like five minutes of silence and then one of us said, 'Why don't we go home?'"<br><br>"I shall never forget the sensation," wrote an officer who climbed out of the trenches when he saw rockets signaling the cease-fire. Onto the open, unprotected ground, he walked toward the front lines of battle. The sun shining on his vulnerability, he moved tentatively, as if the earth beneath each foot might cave in. First he saw German helmets and caps vaulting into a distant haze and then beyond a ridge he saw German soldiers dancing a universal jig of joy. "We stood in a dazed silence unable to believe that at last the fighting was over."<br><br>Thank you to all veterans out there, living and dead. May you one day see the time when at last the fighting is over.<br><br>Extracted from:<br><a href="http://hummingwolf.livejournal.com/448004.html" rel="nofollow">http://hummingwolf.livejournal.com/448004.html</a></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>The Map</strong></span><br><br>One day, a man traveling<br>on an old dirt road surrounded<br>by colorful flowers<br>and beautiful scenery came<br>upon a rather ordinary<br>looking cafe. It was a<br>strange site to see on such a<br>road as he was traveling.<br><br>And in fact it seemed as though it didn't even belong.<br>The man stopped at the cafe's entrance, which was<br>little more than an old wooden door. And after a<br>moment's thought, and some hesitation, he decided<br>to go in.<br><br>Inside, the cafe looked rather ordinary as well. It<br>was filled with ordinary people, and in fact seemed<br>rather dull and mundane. The man was already<br>missing the many wonders outside the cafe, but he was<br>feeling a little thirsty so he ordered something and sat<br>down at a worn out looking table in the corner. The<br>light above shined down upon the man showing his<br>features in greater detail. He was an old man, well<br>dressed, yet rugged in appearance. Upon closer<br>observation it seemed as though life itself had etched<br>the collective struggles of humanity upon his physical<br>frame, beyond even what one might expect from<br>someone as old as he. It was not easy to tell if the scars<br>on his face were from some unsavory employment,<br>general hardships, or some internal struggles that<br>could no longer be kept at bay.<br><br>Upon shifting one's perspective just a little<br>beyond these tell tale signs of hardship and struggle,<br>something else could also be seen. Subtly hidden<br>within the hard callouses that surrounded his eyes,<br>like the sparkle of a diamond in the midst of crumbling<br>rocks, one could see a hint of youthful and<br>excited energy that was slowly growing brighter and<br>brighter.<br><br>After several minutes of sitting quietly without<br>touching his drink, other than to move it around the<br>table, the man began to look around nervously at the<br>other people in the cafe. He noticed that they all<br>looked rather ordinary as well, and seemed to be<br>quietly engaged in the cafe's general peacefulness.<br>While observing this, he was somewhat surprised to<br>see a dragonfly buzzing quit freely around the cafe.<br>No one else seemed to notice or at least pay it much<br>attention.<br><br>After the moment had passed and the old man<br>had moved his drink back and forth a few more times<br>without taking a sip, it became quite obvious that he<br>could no longer contain the youthful and excited<br>energy, which had now built up to such an extent that<br>it seemed to fill his entire body. A decision was<br>formed, and he stood up moving with unbridled<br>purpose towards the center of the cafe.Â”<br>Â“The cafe itself seemed to absorb the man's now<br>overflowing mixture of excitement and nervousness,<br>as if the subtle silence and peacefulness had its<br>own energy beyond what the old man could muster.<br>But slowly the cafe seemed to change by some will<br>of it's own, and all eyes turned to look upon the old<br>man.<br><br>"Do you people know what I have discovered?!"<br>he said. "It is the greatest discovery in human<br>history! And I have decided to share this with you<br>here today, because others must know of this<br>wonder." He then reached into one of the pockets in<br>the expensive looking coat he was wearing, and<br>slowly, with the reverence of a priest who had in his<br>possession the holy grail, he pulled out what seemed to<br>be a map.<br><br>Again he spoke "Here in my hand is a map of<br>Reality! Not an ordinary map, oh no, but one which<br>allows me to go anywhere and do anything in Reality<br>that I want, anything I can imagine!" The man's<br>excitement itself now seemed to take him into another<br>reality, one in which his youthfulness turned to<br>longing. "This world can no longer hinder me from<br>doing whatever I want. I will no longer be looked<br>down upon as a poor old man. I can be richer than<br>Kings! I can have all the beautiful women I want! I can<br>travel to other dimensions! I can even rule the world,<br>the universe!" While he continued talking about all the<br>things he could do, and how much power he now had,<br>another man, who had been sitting silently with his<br>drink at another table across the cafe stood up and<br>walked over to the old man.<br><br>As as this strange, but rather ordinary looking man,<br>came before him, the old man suddenly stopped<br>talking. Then, for reasons he couldn't seem to fathom,<br>he was drawn to look into the strange man's eyes. For<br>nearly a minute they just stared at each other. Then,<br>without warning, the strange man grabbed the map<br>from the old man's hand, and tore it into several pieces.<br>After a moment, the old man, realizing what had<br>happened, began to scream. "What have you done!<br>You fool! Why would you do such a thing? You<br>ignorant fool, do you know what you have done!"<br>The strange man remained silent, as the peacefulness<br>of the cafe again seemed to absorb the angry cries<br>of the old man.<br><br>When the strange man finally spoke, it was in a<br>voice that seemed to echo the same silent peacefulness<br>of the cafe.<br><br>Â“I have given you a new map, one which does not<br>require paper. It starts here, in this very moment, and<br>you will create it as you travel. You will discover<br>places which were not even printed on your old map,<br>and journey to worlds yet unexplored and uncreated.<br>All you need to do is open your eyes and your heart<br>to see the wonders before you, and go where you<br>will" said the strange man.<br><br>After hearing this, the old man said "I think your<br>all crazy! And want nothing to do but sit here and<br>waste your lives away. So I will leave you here to<br>your quite boring lives, and hope to never see you<br>again!" On saying this, he walked out of the cafe in<br>great despair, and back onto the road.<br><br>Though he hadn't been in the cafe for very long,<br>as he stepped out onto the road he noticed that it<br>seemed darker than before, and colder. The sun no<br>longer brightened the colors of the plants and<br>flowers, and the wind seemed to blow with a subtle<br>harshness. "Fools...I could have changed the world"<br>said the man to himself, as he continued his journey<br>down the old road, now lost in thoughts of dreams<br>deferred.<br><br>After he had walked for awhile muttering to<br>himself and to anyone else within hearing distance<br>who might sympathize with his great loss, he began<br>to notice that the old road he was walking on was<br>beginning to lose its distinction and was fading into<br>the landscape. "What's this?! Ack! If I only had my<br>map... Now I'm just an old man who has reached the<br>end of the road." said the old man in a tired voice<br>filled with exhaustion and despair.<br><br>He sat down barely able to stand anymore, and<br>decided to sleep, not caring what manner of beasts or<br>man might be about. He decided that this might as<br>well be the end of his life too if God or anyone else<br>wanted it more than he. Dreams came to him filled<br>with wondrous exotic places and mighty oceans that<br>echoed the voices of creation, the most marvelous<br>dreams he had ever had that filled his heart with<br>longing.<br><br>When he awoke, he found himself lying in the<br>middle of a grassy field surrounded by flowers of such<br>vibrant colors and sweet scents that he almost cried at<br>the beauty of it. "How did I get here? This can't be the<br>same place where I went to sleep last night... How<br>could I have not seen such beauty as this?" said the old<br>man now feeling a youthful and excited energy rising<br>into him once more. As he looked in wonder at the<br>sights around him, feeling the warm breeze blowing<br>softly through his thin hair, he noticed something that<br>looked like a path just beyond the other side of the<br>field.<br><br>He slowly walked over to the path across the field,<br>enjoying the beauty that surrounded him, and began to<br>travel once again. As he walked he began to hear<br>sounds that he hadn't heard before...sounds of moving<br>water rushing back and forth.<br><br>He noticed the path had turned to sand, and all sorts<br>of exotic trees and plants now surrounded him on<br>either side, but what really caught his attention was the<br>wondrous ocean that lay before him that seemed so<br>vast he couldn't even imagine an end to it. As he took<br>in the scenery before him he began to realize something.<br>The man in the cafe had been right after all. He<br>really didn't need a map of Reality, because Reality<br>was all around him, and inside him, and nothing was<br>really ordinary. He only needed to open himself to the<br>wonders before him.<br><br>He smiled as he walked along the beach knowing<br>there was much to learn and discover.<br><br>Â© , all rights reserved. Alex N.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>An atheist was walking through the woods.</strong><br><br>'What majestic trees'!  'What powerful rivers'!  'What beautiful animals'! He said to himself.<br><br>As he was walking alongside the river, he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him. He turned to look. He saw a 7-foot grizzly bear charge towards him.<br><br>He ran as fast as he could up the path. He looked over his shoulder &amp; saw that the bear was closing in on him.<br><br>He looked over his shoulder again, &amp; the bear was even closer. He tripped &amp; fell on the ground. He rolled over to pick himself up but saw that the bear was right on top of him, reaching for him with his left paw &amp; raising his right paw to strike him.<br><br>At that instant the Atheist cried out, 'Oh my God!'<br><br>Time Stopped.<br>The bear froze.<br>The forest was silent.<br><br>As a bright light shone upon the man, a voice came out of the sky. 'You deny my existence for all these years, teach others I don ' t exist and even credit creation to cosmic accident.' 'Do you expect me to help you out of this predicament? Am I to count you as a believer'?<br>The atheist looked directly into the light, 'It would be hypocritical of me to suddenly ask you to treat me as a Christian now, but perhaps you could make the BEAR a Christian'?<br><br>'Very Well,' said the voice.<br><br>The light went out. The sounds of the forest resumed. And the bear dropped his right paw, brought both paws together, bowed his head &amp; spoke:<br><br>'Lord bless this food, which I am about to receive from thy bounty through Christ our Lord, Amen.'</div>
