            <div class='col-md body'><p>A SOUL EAGLE... T.E. ^i^ <br>Date: 3/15/2008<br> <br>AN AWESOME STORY OF FAITH ^i^<br>Freedom and Jeff <br> <br>Freedom and I have been together 10 years this summer. She came in as a<br> baby in 1998 with two broken wings. Her left wing doesn't open all the<br> way even after surgery, it was broken in 4 places. She's my baby. Jeff<br> <br> When Freedom came in, she could not stand. Both wings were broken, her<br> left wing in 4 places. She was emaciated and covered in lice. We made<br> the decision to give her a chance at life, so I took her to the vets<br> office. From then on, I was always around her. <br> <br>We had her in a huge dog carrier with the top off, and it was loaded up<br> with shredded newspaper for her to lay in. I used to sit and talk to<br> her, urging her to live, to fight; and she would lay there looking at me<br> with those big brown eyes. We also had to tube feed her for weeks. <br> <br>This went on for 4-6 weeks, and by then she still couldn’t stand. It<br> got to the point where the decision was made to euthanize her if she<br> couldn’t stand in a week. You know you don’t want to cross that line<br> between torture and rehab, and it looked like death was winning. She was<br> going to be put down that Friday, and I was supposed to come in on that<br> Thursday afternoon. <br> <br>I didn’t want to go to the center that Thursday, because I couldn’t<br> bear the thought of her being euthanized; but I went anyway, and when I<br> walked in everyone was grinning from ear to ear. I went immediately back<br> to her dowl cage; and there she was, standing on her own, a big<br> beautiful eagle. She was ready to live. I was just about in tears by then.<br> That was a very good day. <br> <br>We knew she could never fly, so the director asked me to glove train<br> her. I got her used to the glove, and then to jesses, and we started<br> doing education programs for schools in western Washington. We wound up in<br> the newspapers, radio (believe it or not) and some TV. <br> <br>Miracle Pets even did a show about us. <br> <br>In the spring of 2000, I was diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma. I<br> had stage 3, which is not good (one major organ plus everywhere), so I<br> wound up doing 8 months of chemo. Lost the hair - the whole bit. I missed<br> a lot of work. When I felt good enough, I would go to Sarvey and take<br> Freedom out for walks. Freedom would also come to me in my dreams and<br> help me fight the cancer. This happened time and time again. <br> <br>Fast forward to November 2000, the day after Thanksgiving, I went in<br> for my last checkup. I was told that if the cancer was not all gone after<br> 8 rounds of chemo, then my last option was a stem cell transplant.<br> Anyway, they did the tests; and I had to come back Monday for the results.<br> I went in Monday, and I was told that all the cancer was gone. Yahoo! <br> <br>So the first thing I did was get up to Sarvey and take the big girl out<br> for a walk. It was misty and cold. I went to her flight and jessed her<br> up, and we went out front to the top of the hill. I hadn’t said a word<br> to Freedom, but somehow she knew. <br> <br>She looked at me and wrapped both her wings around me to where I could<br> feel them pressing in on my back (I was engulfed in eagle wings), and<br> she touched my nose with her beak and stared into my eyes, and we just<br> stood there like that for I don’t know how long. That was a magic<br> moment. We have been soul mates ever since she came in. This is a very<br> special bird. <br> <br>On a side note: I have had people who were sick come up to us when we<br> are out, and Freedom has some kind of hold on them. I once had a guy who<br> was terminal come up to us and I let him hold her. His knees just<br> about buckled and he swore he could feel her power coarse through his body.<br> I have so many stories like that. <br> <br>I never forget the honor I have of being so close to such a magnificent<br> spirit as Freedom's. <br> <br>Hope you enjoy this. <br> <br>Jeff <br>Jeff Guidry and Freedom are at Sarvey Wildlife Center<br> <a href="http://www.sarveywildlife.org/"><span style="color: #003399;">http://www.sarveywildlife.org/</span></a> "jeff" &lt;<a href="http://www.sgforums.com/ym/Compose?To=jeff@sarveywildlife.org&amp;YY=715&amp;y5beta=yes&amp;y5beta=yes&amp;order=down&amp;sort=date&amp;pos=1&amp;view=a&amp;head=b"><span style="color: #003399;">jeff@sarveywildlife.org</span></a>&gt;<br> <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/ym/Compose?To=eaglewalker@comcast.netblessings&amp;YY=715&amp;y5beta=yes&amp;y5beta=yes&amp;order=down&amp;sort=date&amp;pos=1&amp;view=a&amp;head=b"><span style="color: #003399;">eaglewalker@comcast.netblessings</span></a>, mike true eagle^I^</p></div>

              <p>I heard from the Mediacorps Channel 5 news last night that researchers' in Singapore statistics indicated that 9 out of 10 Singaporeans are stressful due to work and lack of spending quality time with their family and friends. In conjuction with and in search of The Most Happiest Person In Singapore, I have two links to share with you. Are you the most happiest person in Singapore?

              <p>Yesterday morning, Vennetta Lopez from Class 95 FM said that a natural smile can be produce every morning. You take a scissor, look yourself in the mirror and smile because when you smile, you can see your nose hair that are coming out from your nose and then you use the scissor to trim it....hahaha that is quite right...Well Vennetta Lopez...I do not use a scissor to trim my nose hair....I just use my thumb and forefinger to pull it....hahaha. So.....Smile people :-)</p>

You take a scissor, look yourself in the mirror and smile because when you smile, you can see your nose hair that are coming out from your nose and then you use the scissor to trim it....hahaha that is quite right...Well Vennetta Lopez...I do not use a scissor to trim my nose hair....I just use my thumb and forefinger to pull it....hahaha.

              <p>Hi There,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks for that additional information. Yes, I didn't write about the name of the organiser, Mr Philip Merry, because I couldn't remember his name after I heard from the Mediacorps Channel 5 news that night...yes....its good to have a teacher to make the pupils write down all those points about being happy and yes I agree...by writing those points down it would probably do the job on them of being happy because writing is a form therapuetic exercise for the mind, body, heart and soul...just like when you go to karaoke...you can sing all those favourite songs of yours and its a form of letting yourself go from stress and be merry....and if your voice sound "Karat" it oke.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks for the highlight and contribution.</p>

In his mind's eye as the gentleman by the window portrayed it with descriptive words. Days and weeks passed.<br><br>One morning, the day nurse arrived to bring water for their baths only to find the lifeless body of the man by the window, who had died peacefully in his sleep. She was saddened and called the hospital attendants to take the body away.<br><br>As soon as it seemed appropriate, the other man asked if he could be moved next to the window.<br><br>The nurse was happy to make the switch, and after making sure he was comfortable, she left him alone.<br><br>Slowly, painfully, he propped himself up on one elbow to take his first look at the real world outside.<br><br>He strained to slowly turn to look out the window beside the bed.<br><br>It faced a blank wall. The man asked the nurse what could have compelled his deceased roommate who had described such wonderful things outside this window.<br><br>The nurse responded that the man was blind and could not even see the wall.<br><br>She said, "Perhaps he just wanted to encourage you."<br><br></span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: small; font-family: arial narrow;"><strong><strong>Epilogue:<br></strong><br></strong></span></span><span style="font-size: small; color: #ff0000; font-family: arial narrow;">"There is tremendous happiness in making others happy, despite our own situations"<br><br></span><span style="font-size: small; color: #0000ff; font-family: arial narrow;">"Shared grief is half the sorrow, but happiness when shared, is doubled"<br><br></span><span style="font-size: small; color: #bf00bf; font-family: arial narrow;">"If you want to feel rich, just count all the things you have that money can't buy"<br><br></span><span style="font-family: arial narrow;">"Today is a gift, that's why it is called the present."<br><br>The origin of this letter is unknown, but it is for everyone to pass it on.<br><br></span><span style="font-size: small; color: #007f7f; font-family: arial narrow;"><strong>Be honest thyself.

            <div class='col-md body'><p><span style="color: #000080;"><strong>"Help People Set Goals And Reach Them"<br></strong>From<em> Kindness: Making a Difference in People's Lives: Formulas, stories, and insights</em><br>By Zelig Pliskin <br>Printed with Permission of Shaar Press <br><br></span><span style="font-size: medium;">One of the major keys to success in life is to make and reach goals. You canæŠ° reach a goal if you donæŠ° have one. So the act of making a goal or many goals is the first step to making things happen in your life. And if a person sets tremendous goals but doesnæŠ° do anything to reach them, he wonæŠ° get very far. This is like sitting down and planning a world tour, but never buying a ticket to start the trip. Wishful thinking can be exciting, but you are still exactly where you were before. You never even started.<br><br>When you make and reach goals yourself, you realize the vital importance and value of doing this. People who havenæŠ° made it a practice to keep setting goals can realize its importance by thinking about how much more they could have done by setting goals and how goal-setting has enabled others to achieve and produce.<br><br>Use your awareness of the value of goal-setting to inspire other people to do likewise. This one factor can help transform a personæŠ¯ life. I remember receiving a small pamphlet from my friend Kalman Packouz on goal setting. It didnæŠ° say anything especially new, but since he went out of his way to send it to me, I was motivated to delineate some major goals for myself. That was twenty years ago and reaching those goals made a major difference in my life. Kalman, I am grateful and I thank you. You, the reader, will be the recipient of similar gratitude as you motivate and influence others to make and reach goals.<br><br>Keep asking, "Have you put your goals into writing?" Some will be open and share their goals with you. Others would prefer keeping them private. If a person tells you that he doesnæŠ° have specific goals encourage him. Highly motivated people wonæŠ° necessarily need to write down their goals. They can visualize them inscribed in their mind. For most people, however, itæŠ¯ preferable to write them down and frequently review them.<br><br>It helps to share oneæŠ¯ goals with an encouraging friend or coach. Make it your goal to be there for others. You might be able to help others by encouraging them to make broader and more far-reaching goals. When someone is starting out on the process of making and reaching goals, build up his belief in his ability to do this. Smaller goals lead to larger goals.<br><br>If a person seems hesitant about making goals, discover his blocks and help him overcome them. You can ask, "What stops you from setting goals?" By probing and finding the obstacles, you might be able to help this person overcome them. Some people fear setting goals because they feel that they might not reach them. You might say, "Setting a goal that you were previously afraid to strive for is progress in itself. Every goal you try for gives you greater knowledge about how to improve in the future. Your not succeeding is part of your life education on how to have greater success in the future."<br><br>What are your goals for helping others set and reach goals? How about putting them into writing so they will empower you and help many others!<em>.</em></span></p></div>

              <p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">A Sign Of Imbalance - </span></strong></p>
              <p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Overachieving and Overreaching</span></strong> <br><br><br>Overachievers are people who have achieved but still feel the need <br>to do more, creating an imbalance in their lives. People who exhibit <br>this behavior may be trying to compensate for feelings of insecurity <br>and doubts about their worth. They may be chasing unresolved issues <br>from their past into the present, or they might not be looking at <br>their lives as a whole, but judging themselves based only on one <br>aspect of their being. If this is a word that we've heard used with <br>respect to our choices and lifestyle, it is worth examining in order <br>to balance our lives for a more rewarding experience. <br><br>If we find that we cannot allow ourselves to experience and enjoy <br>the present moment, putting pleasure off into some distant future, <br>it may be a sign that we are being driven to achieve more than is <br>truly necessary. Pushing ourselves beyond the point of exhaustion, <br>or to the exclusion of important people in our lives, robs us of <br>true and meaningful joy. Once we make the connection to the eternal <br>part of us, it can nourish us and allow our priorities to shift from <br>chasing after an elusive feeling to being fully present in the <br>moment so that we can live our lives in the now. <br><br>Sometimes we need to look to those we love and admire in order to <br>realize what we value about life. We can take time to note what we <br>like about others, and then turn the mirror to reflect the light of <br>those same words and feelings toward ourselves. It can be quite a <br>revelation to see ourselves in this nourishing light. When we can <br>put the energy that we've been devoting to a phantom sense of <br>achievement into the truly satisfying aspects of our lives, we can <br>restore the balance between our inner and outer worlds and <br>experience true joyful peace. <br><br><br><a href="http://www.dailyom.com/"><span style="color: #003399;">http://www.dailyom.com/</span></a> </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong><span style="font-size: large;">Cleansing Nature - Rain</span></strong> <br><br><br>There are times when we might feel the need to wash away all of our <br>troubles and call forth freshness into our lives. Since the most <br>cleansing substance on this earth is probably water, we can think of <br>the joy rain brings as an energetic bath, rejuvenating our minds, <br>bodies, and souls. Just being able to spend a few moments every time <br>it rains to become aware of the healing powers water brings to us <br>can renew us in so many ways. As we do this we will find that the <br>more we appreciate the universe's gift to us in the form of rain, <br>the more we can see that a gentle rain shower is a strong reflective <br>tool that has the ability to cleanse our entire being. <br><br>The next time it rains might be a good chance to experience the rain <br>through all of your senses, allowing you to truly understand the <br>importance of each and every drop of water. First, take a few <br>minutes to look outside and notice how each individual raindrop <br>seems to come down in a continual stream. By noticing this you can <br>contemplate how it takes many small accomplishments to create the <br>whole of your existence for nothing exists in isolation. Then you <br>might wish to focus your attention on the sound of the rainfall, <br>letting the sounds of drops penetrate into the innermost recesses of <br>your self. Listening in this way may bring you a greater sense of <br>connection with nature and the world around you, knowing that the <br>sounds you hear are an integral part of not just the physical <br>sustenance you require but that they also nourish your spirit. <br><br>Consciously using our senses to feel nature's healing energy as it <br>comes to us in the form of rain is an act of internal cleansing. <br>Just as the rain physically washes over the earth and rinses out any <br>impurities and imperfections, it also bathes our spirit in the joy <br>that comes from knowing that we are one with the world around us.<br><br><br><a href="http://www.dailyom.com/"><span style="color: #003399;">http://www.dailyom.com</span></a></p></div>

              <p>Defence Minister Teo Chee Hean said the personnel, from the navy and armed forces, will accompany one Singapore Landing Ship Tank (LST) and a C-130 transport aircraft that will depart in the next few weeks.</p>
              <p>"Singapore's contribution is part of the ongoing multinational effort to help rebuild Iraq, involving some 30 countries," Teo said in a ceremony to announce the imminent deployment.</p>
              <p>"This mission will see the deployment of the RSN's (Republic of Singapore Navy) Landing Ship Tank RSS Endurance and an RSAF (Republic of Singapore Armed Forces) C-130 detachment to provide logistics support to Iraq's rebuilding efforts."</p>
              <p>The RSS Endurance LST will undertake logistical tasks, providing replenishments and supplies for other naval vessels operating in the Arabian Gulf, Teo said.</p>
              <p>Manned by 161 onboard crew members, the LST will also be a platform for helicopter missions and maritime boarding missions by teams from other countries who are part of the US-led effort to rebuild the country.</p>
              <p>The C-130, with 31 crew, will be carrying out airlift, transportation and supply missions.</p>
              <p>It will also assist coalition forces in carrying supplies and personnel, humanitarian material as well as conduct medical evacuation operations.</p>
              <p>Singapore, one of Washington's strongest Asian allies in the war against terror, sent 32 police personnel to Iraq in July to train the local police force. The police team returned to Singapore in August.</p>
              <p>Monday's announcement came as the Iraqi capital of Baghdad came under coordinated attack by guerrilla forces that increased concerns about the United States' ability to enforce security in Iraq.</p>
              <p>At least 15 people were killed as car bombs exploded outside the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) offices and four police stations.</p>
              <p>The news of Singapore's assistance has been met with little public opposition in Singapore, where the People's Action Party has ruled since the country's independence 38 years ago.</p>
              <p>One of the few dissenters in Singapore, former MP J. B. Jeyaretnam, issued a press release last week questioning why the government did not seek approval from parliament before agreeing to send the military forces. <br><strong>                                                      <a href="http://www.singapore-window.org/"><span style="color: #800080;">Home</span></a></strong></p>
