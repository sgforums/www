              This is a reminder of my childhood life. I too had worn my socks with two rubber bands.
              
              Thanks.

              I Love Rubber Bands
              By Bo Sanchez
              
              Let me tell you a crazy story I heard recently.
              
              There's this husband Who out of sheer love for his wife decided to prove it to her. So he swam the widest oceans, crossed the deepest rivers, and climbed the highest mountains to show his deep devotion to her.
              
              But in the end, she divorced him.
              
              Why?
              
              Because he was never home. (Get it?)
              
              Let me tell you an experience I had as a kid. One day, I asked Mom, "Why do my shoes keep eating my socks?" As a young boy, that was always a mystery for me. All my other classmates never had that problem. Their socks remained tight and high up their legs the entire day.
              
              Mom didn't answer my question but simply gave me two rubber bands, which I dutifully placed around the top of my socks. To this day, fifteen years later, I still have permanent circle marks around my legs. But aside from giving me this slight defect, the two bands worked like magic.
              
              It never occurred to me that Dad and Mom didn't have the money to buy a new pair of socks for me. So I wore five-year-old socks, all soggy, grayish, and garter less. And yet amazingly, I never complained. I believe it was because Dad was always home when I needed him.
              
              Every night, after coming from work, we'd jog together, sit around, and talk about Tarzan, Farrah Fawcett Majors, God, and what I wanted to be when I grew up (a stockholder). On Saturdays, we'd walk to Cubao, eat a hotdog-on-a-stick, and buy new rubber bands before going home.
              
              I've learned that in truth, we don't want our loved ones to show their love for us in big ways. Swimming the widest oceans, crossing the deepest rivers, and climbing the highest mountains seem spectacular - but that's not what we really want. Deep in our hearts, we just want them home. With us.
              
              Sometimes, God will operate that way. Suddenly, He decides not to answer our prayers, or fill our need, or heal our sickness, or give us the miracle we're asking for. (He's got reasons why He won't, and believe me - they're pretty good ones.) So He'll just be there beside you, holding you in a hug. Sharing your pain. Weeping as you weep.
              
              Oh, He might give you some rubber bands. And that small comfort from Him will be more than enough to sustain you.
              
              Because the most essential truth you already know.
              
              ...HOME.

              THE ART OF GIVING 
              
              The true Art in Giving is to give from the heart without any expectation of a return.
              
              True giving comes from the same place inside you as your deepest happiness. They are inexplicably intertwined.
              
              A gift is something that is enjoyed twice. First by the giver who revels in the pleasure of giving something special and then also enjoyed by the person who receives the gift.
              
              A very special form of giving takes the form of small, personal acts of kindness. Very often it is not money or belongings that people need, it's the things that can't be seen, such as advice reassurance, a kind word, compliments or a smile.
              
              The act of giving doesnâ€™t have to be limited to an exchange of presents at Christmas time or Birthdays. You can treat every person you come into contact with as someone who you can give a gift to.
              
              You may be a bit sceptical, wondering what exactly do you have to give? Everybody has something of value for another person. It could be a kind word, a simple smile, some appreciation, the sharing of some special knowledge, even a helping hand or a bit of support during a difficult emotional time. 
              
              You have something to give everyone.
              
              The act of true giving is something wonderful and amazing. With most things in this world, there is only a limited amount of what you can give away. Fortunately, generosity and kindness are not bound to these same material limitations.
              
              One of lifeâ€™s most basic laws is "every single act of love, kindness and generosity will multiply and return to you many times over ". The more you give the happier you will feel.
              
              Many thousands of years ago a great sage in Babylon said "The reward of charity depends entirely upon the extent of the kindness in it."
              
              It is one of life's wonderful paradoxes that you limit the power of your giving by having an expectation of getting something in return. When you give without any thought or desire for something back, your returns will be truly limitless.
              
              Your life is like a river of energy, continually flowing. What happens when a river stops moving? It get very muddy, and stagnant. A fast flowing river is full of life and clear water. Where would you rather drink?
              
              The acts of giving and receiving are a continuos process of circulation that continues the flow of your lifeâ€™s energies. For one person to receive someone else has to give. Itâ€™s a cycle of energy that flows continually onwards.
              
              Pause for as moment as you read this, and take a big, deep breath. Hold it for as long as you possibly can. As you hold it inside, notice how uncomfortable you begin to feel when you are holding on to something that is meant to be released.
              
              Now, breath out, completely and hold your breath with your lungs fully emptied. Feel how uncomfortable you feel when you are resisting taking in something that you need.
              
              True giving, without expectation of anything in return is as effortless as breathing.
              
              How often do you expect back from the person you gave something to a gift of a similar or greater value? Is this true giving or merely an unvoiced expectation of an exchange of similar goods?
              
              Have you ever heard anyone saying " I just give and give and give until I have nothing left "? 
              
              This behaviour has many other names. Self denial, self pity, martyrdom, self righteousness to name just a few.
              
              This is an ego based form of giving. It is giving with an expectation of something in return. In reality, this is not giving at all but an unvocalised form of barter. If, through the act of giving, you feel that you have â€œlost something or are somehow lessenedâ€� then the gift was not truly given from your heart.
              
              Truly giving something from the heart is an action which will fill your life with joy. This is where the expression to â€œgive whole heartedlyâ€� comes from.
              
              The intention behind your giving is the most important thing. The intention should always be to create happiness for both the giver and the receiver 
              
              If you experience resentment and a feeling of â€œI donâ€™t really want to give this to this person, but I feel that I have toâ€� or â€œI really should give them something,â€� this is probably what ultimately will come back to you. Perhaps in this case, you need to consider not giving the gift at all !
              
              What you give out is what comes back in direct proportions to the feelings you have in the act of giving.
              
              Itâ€™s very simple. If you want to experience more joy, give joy to others, if you want more love, learn to give love, if you want attention and appreciation, learn to give appreciation to others. These are some of lifeâ€™s most precious gifts and they donâ€™t cost you anything.
              
              When you meet someone, you can silently send them a blessing, wishing them happiness, joy and laughter. This kind of silent giving is very powerful. Do this, (with no thought of return) and you will suddenly find people around you opening to you in joy and happiness.
              
              Make a descision that wherever you go, to whoever you meet, to give. As long as you are giving, you will also be receiving. The more you give, the more will flow back to you and be returned many times over. Giving creates a pattern of happiness, joy and love in your life beyond your wildest expectations.
              
              In ancient China, Lao Tsu wrote "Kindness in words creates confidence. Kindness in thinking creates profoundness. Kindness in Giving Creates Love.â€�
              
              May your life be filled with love, happiness and inspiration

            <div class='col-md body'>We have a choice to make everyday in our lives and you must also remember that whatever choice we decide and whatever action we have taken after making that choice is going to be the chain reaction for the future from your  intitial thoughts within your mind, choices in your conscience and action for it to materialize in the physical world. Whether it is good or bad, is not the answer to your choice because you would actually learn from it. In life we are supposed to learn, grow and develop our soul, and the end result you would actually gain wisdom.<br><br>Joe<br><br><span class="large"><strong>YOU MAKE THE CHOICE</strong></span><br><br>What would you do?<br><br>You make the choice. Don't look for a punch line. There isn't one. Read it anyway.<br><br>My question to all of you is: Would you have made the same choice?<br><br>At a fundraising dinner for a school that serves learning disabled children, the father of one of the students delivered a speech that would never be forgotten by all who attended.<br><br>After extolling the school and its dedicated staff, he offered a question.<br><br>"When not interfered with by outside influences, everything nature does is done with perfection. Yet my son, Shay, cannot learn things as other children do. He cannot understand things as other children do. Where is the natural order of things in my son?"<br><br>The audience was stilled by the query.<br><br>The father continued. "I believe, that when a child like Shay comes i! nto the world, an opportunity to realize true human nature presents itself, and it comes, in the way other people treat that child."<br><br>Then he told the following story: Shay and his father had walked past a park where some boys Shay knew were playing baseball.<br><br>Shay asked, "Do you think they'll let me play?"<br><br>Shay's father knew that most of the boys would not want someone like Shay on their team, but the father also understood that if his son were allowed to play, it would give him a much-needed sense of belonging. Shay's father approached one of the boys on the field and asked if Shay could play.<br><br>The boy looked around for guidance and, getting none, he took matters into his own hands and said, "We're losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning. I guess he can be on our team and we'll try to put him in to bat in the ninth inning."<br><br>In the bottom of the eighth inning, Shay's team scored a few runs but was still behind by three.<br><br>In the! top of the ninth inning, Shay put on a glove and played in the outfield.<br><br>Even though no hits came his way, he was obviously ecstatic just to be in the game and on the field, grinning from ear to ear as his father waved to him from the stands.<br><br>In the bottom of the ninth inning, Shay's team scored again. Now, with two outs and the bases loaded, the potential winning run was on base and Shay was scheduled to be next at bat.<br><br>At this juncture, let Shay bat and give away their chance to win the game?<br><br>Surprisingly, Shay was given the bat. Everyone knew that a hit was all but impossible 'cause Shay didn't even know how to hold the bat properly, much less connect with the ball.<br><br>However, as Shay stepped up to the plate, the pitcher moved in a few steps to lob the ball in softly so Shay could at least be able to make contact.<br><br>The first pitch came and Shay swung clumsily and missed. The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the ball softly to! wards Shay.<br><br>As the pitch came in, Shay swung at the ball and hit a slow ground ball right back to the pitcher.<br><br>The pitcher picked up the soft grounder and could have easily thrown the ball to the first baseman. Shay would have been out and that would have been the end of the game.<br><br>Instead, the pitcher took the ball and turned and threw the ball on a high arc to right field, far beyond the reach of the first baseman.<br><br>Everyone started yelling, "Shay, run to first! Run to first!"<br><br>Never in his life had Shay ever made it to first base. He scampered down the baseline, wide-eyed and startled.<br><br>Everyone yelled, "Run to second, run to second!"<br><br>By the time Shay rounded first base, the right fielder had the ball.<br><br>He could have thrown the ball to the second-baseman for the tag, but he understood the pitcher's intentions and intentionally threw the ball high and far over the third-baseman's head.<br><br>Shay ran toward second base as the ! runners ahead of him deliriously circled the bases toward home.<br><br>Shay reached second base, the opposing shortstop ran to him, turned him in the direction of third base, and shouted, "Run to third!"<br><br>As Shay rounded third, the boys from both teams were screaming, "Shay, run home!"<br><br>Shay ran to home, stepped on the plate, and was cheered as the hero who hit the "grand slam" and won the game for his team.<br><br>"That day," said the father softly with tears now rolling down his face, "the boys from both teams helped bring a piece of true love and humanity into this world."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmm...this is one reason many of us become stressed out, sometimes to the extend of being depressed and demoralized. Many too just give up hope and commit suicide. So do take care of yourself and please talk to someone if you need to talk about your problems and worries.<br><br>Joe<br><br><span class="large"><strong>LIVE ONE DAY AT A TIME</strong></span><br><br>There are two days in every week that we should not worry about. Two days that should be kept free from fear and apprehension.<br><br>One is YESTERDAY, with its mistakes and cares, its faults and blunders, its aches and pains. Yesterday has passed, forever beyond our control. All the money in the world cannot bring back yesterday. We cannot undo a single act we performed nor can we erase a single word we've said. Yesterday is gone!<br><br>The other day we shouldn't worry about is TOMORROW with its impossible adversaries, its burden, its hopeful promise and poor performance. Tomorrow is beyond our control. Tomorrow's sun will rise either in splendor or behind a bank of clouds - but it will rise. And until it does, we have no stake in tomorrow, for it is yet unborn.<br><br>This leaves only one day - TODAY. Any person can fight the battles of just one day. It is only when we add the burdens of yesterday and tomorrow that we break down. It is not the experience of today that drives people mad, it is the remorse for something that happened yesterday, and the dread of what tomorrow may bring. Let us therefore, LIVE ONE DAY AT A TIME.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>The Awakening</strong></span><br><br>A time comes in your life when you finally get it ... when, in the midst of all your fears and insanity, you stop dead in your tracks &amp; somewhere the voice inside your head cries out "ENOUGH!" Enough fighting and crying or struggling to hold on.<br><br>And like a child quieting down after a blind tantrum, your sobs begin to subside, you shudder once or twice, you blink back your tears and begin to look at the world through new eyes. This is your awakening.<br><br>You realize it's time to stop hoping and waiting for something to change or for happiness, safety, and security to come galloping over the next horizon.<br><br>You come to terms with the fact that you are neither Prince Charming nor Cinderella. And that, in the real world, there aren't always fairy-tale endings (or beginnings, for that matter).<br><br>And that any guarantee of "happily ever after" must begin with you ... and in the process, a sense of serenity is born of acceptance.<br><br>You awaken to the fact that you are not perfect and that not everyone will always love, appreciate, or approve of who or what you are ... and that's OK. They are entitled to their own views and opinions.<br><br>And you learn the importance of loving and championing yourself ... and in the process, a sense of new-found confidence is born of self-approval.<br><br>You stop complaining and blaming other people for the things they did to you (or didn't do for you) and you learn that the only thing you can really count on is the unexpected.<br><br>You learn that people don't always say what they mean or mean what they say, and that not everyone will always be there for you, and that it's not always about you.<br><br>So you learn to stand on your own and to take care of yourself ... and in the process, a sense of safety and security is born of self-reliance.<br><br>You stop judging and pointing fingers and you begin to accept people as they are and overlook their shortcomings and human frailties ... and in the process, a sense of peace and contentment is born of forgiveness.<br><br>You realize that much of the way you view yourself and the world around you is as a result of all the messages and opinions that have been ingrained into your psyche.<br><br>And you begin to sift through all the junk you've been fed about how you should behave, how you should look, how much you should weigh, what you should wear, what you should do for a living, how much money you should make, what you should drive, how and where you should live, who you should marry, the importance of having and raising children, and what you owe your parents, family, and friends.<br><br>You learn to open up to new worlds and different points of view. And you begin reassessing and redefining who you are and what you really stand for.<br><br>You learn the differences between wanting and needing and you begin to discard the doctrines and values you've outgrown, or should never have bought into to begin with ... and in the process, you learn to go with your instincts.<br><br>You learn that it is truly in giving that we receive. And that there is<br>power and glory in creating and contributing and you stop maneuvering through life merely as a "consumer" looking for your next fix.<br><br>You learn that principles such as honesty and integrity are not outdated ideals of a bygone era but the mortar that holds together the foundation upon which you must build a life.<br><br>You learn that you don't know everything, it's not your job to save the world and that you can't teach a pig to sing.<br><br>You learn to distinguish between guilt and responsibility and the importance of setting boundaries and learning to say NO.<br><br>You learn that the only cross to bear is the one you choose to carry and that martyrs get burned at the stake.<br><br>Then you learn about love. How to love, how much to give in love, when to stop giving and when to walk away.<br><br>You learn to look at relationships as they really are and not as you would have them be. You stop trying to control people, situation, and outcomes.<br><br>And you learn that alone does not mean lonely.<br><br>You also stop working so hard at putting your feelings aside, smoothing things over and ignoring your needs.<br><br>You learn that feelings of entitlement are perfectly OK, and that it is your right to want things and to ask for the things you want ... and that sometimes it is necessary to make demands.<br><br>You come to the realization that you deserve to be treated with love, kindness, sensitivity, and respect ... and you won't settle for less.<br><br>And you learn that your body really is your temple. And you begin to care for it and treat it with respect.<br><br>You begin to eat a balanced diet, drink more water, and take more time to exercise.<br><br>You learn that being tired fuels doubt, fear, and uncertainty and so you take more time to rest.<br><br>And, just as food fuels the body, laughter fuels our soul. So you take more time to laugh and to play.<br><br>You learn that, for the most part, you get in life what you believe you<br>deserve ... and that much of life truly is a self-fulfilling prophecy.<br><br>You learn anything worth achieving is worth working for and that wishing for something to happen is different from working towards making it happen.<br><br>More importantly, you learn that in order to achieve success you need direction, discipline, and perseverance.<br><br>You also learn that no one can do it all alone ... and that it's OK to risk asking for help.<br><br>You learn the only thing you must truly fear is the greatest robber baron of all: FEAR itself.<br><br>You learn to step right into and through your fears because you know that whatever happens you can handle it and to give in to fear is to give away the right to live life on your own terms.<br><br>And you learn to fight for your life and not to squander it living under a cloud of impending doom.<br><br>You learn that life isn't always fair, you don't always get what you think you deserve, and that bad things sometimes happen to unsuspecting, good people.<br><br>On these occasions you learn not to personalize things. You learn that God isn't punishing you or failing to answer your prayers. It's just life happening.<br><br>And you learn to deal with evil in its most primal state ... the ego.<br><br>You learn that negative feelings such as anger, envy, and resentment must be understood and redirected or they will suffocate the life out of you and poison the universe that surrounds you.<br><br>You learn to admit when you are wrong and to build bridges instead of walls.<br><br>You learn to be thankful and to take comfort in many of the simple things we take for granted, things that millions of people upon the earth can only dream about: a full refrigerator, clean running water, a soft warm bed, a long hot shower.<br><br>Slowly you begin to take responsibility for yourself by yourself and you make yourself a promise to never betray yourself and to never, ever settle for less than your heart's desire.<br><br>Hang a wind chime outside your window so you can listen to the wind.<br><br>Keep smiling, keep trusting, and stay open to every wonderful possibility.<br><br>Finally, with courage in your heart , take a stand, a deep breath, and begin to design as best you can the life you want to live.<br><br>CHOICE BY CHOICE.<br><br>~By Virginia Marie Swift</div>

              Hello Everyone,
              
              I would like to share this true incidence of mine that I had encountered.
              
               
              GIVE A SMILE
              
              One afternoon, in May 2006, I boarded the mrt train from Kranji mrt station. I had just returned from Johor Baru and I was going back to my flat at Yishun. Immediately, after I had boarded the train, I was looking around for a seat. When I glanced to my left, I saw a couple of empty seats and I also saw a few commuters were standing nearby the seats. I went directly to those seats available and immediately I sat down. While I was sitting down, I looked at those passengers standing at the train entrance/exit to the left front of me and I was wondering why they did not grab the empty seats that were still available to them on my left and on my right. If I could recall, to my left, there was an empty seat and to my right there were two or three seats still vacant. I also noticed that they did look at the direction that I was sitting and those passengers that were sitting down oppositely in front of me, some were staring straight, some were looking down and some were closing their eyes. Well, the passengers behaviour did not really bothered me until suddenly my nostril picked up a strong pungent aroma near me. It was like uric acid. Of course I was puzzled, so I tried to detect whether the foul smell was from my armpits. It was very hot on that particular day. I secretly bended my head to my left and to my right to smell. Well, it seemed like it was from there but I was not so sure and I remembered that I had applied some deodorant. I remained silent and just ignored the pungent smell. Without thinking anything, I glanced to my left and then I saw her.
              
              Just one seat away from me, there was a female wearing purple clothing. She was sitting in the same row of seats at the corner end next to the glass safety panel that was separating the seats from the train entrance/exit door. What I saw really shocked me. From side view, I saw a normal short and neat cut hair style but her face was nearly flat except for her protruding eyelids and mouth. Forgive me for saying this but at that moment when I saw her face from that angle, in my mind I was telling myself, "She look like a frog." And I also realized that the pungent smell was strongly coming from her too and the slight air-conditioning breeze was wafting within the train as it moved.
              
              While looking at her for that few seconds, she suddenly glanced at me and I was caught off guard. It was ugly and frightening to look at her. She has a small nose, mouth and a protruding eyelids with sad eyes. Her face was deformed. I could not determine her age but by looking at her hands, it was a young woman, maybe in her twenties.
              
              To avoid her and myself feeling embarrassed, I just gave a smile. She quickly looked away and she scratched her head with her right hand. I too glanced away and I also realized why the other commuters were not looking at that direction or at her, especially the females passengers. A couple of times she glanced at me and I gave a smile. Just before she alighted at Woodlands mrt station, she took a glanced at me and again I gave a smile. Then the train stopped at Woodlands mrt station, she got up and exited from the train.
              
              There were no pungent smell anymore after the train left Woodlands mrt station but those same standing passengers did not dare sit on the two vacant seats on my left.
              
              I think, my former occupation as an Operating Theatre Technical Assistant had taught me to handle that kind of situation well.
