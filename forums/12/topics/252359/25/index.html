              <div>Hello Everyone,</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I like to share an article that was presented to me by a male nurse on the day he left the medical centre to upgrade his nursing skill. I have appended below the article for your reading. I hope you like it.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Thanks.</div>

              <div><strong><span style="font-size: large;">THE HANDS OF A NURSE</span></strong></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Let us take a moment ot remember our hands.</div>
              <div>For these are no ordinary hands.</div>
              <div>These are the hands that help us to our work.</div>
              <div>These are the hands that carry out the skills that make nursing possible.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Let us remember our hands and be grateful for what they do.</div>
              <div>For the eyes may see, the mouth may speak but it is the hands that hold,</div>
              <div>the hands that heal, the hands that give the caring touch.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>These are the hands that feel the first breath of a new born child.</div>
              <div>These are the hands that feel the last breath of a dying one.</div>
              <div>These are the hands that hold a family, who has just lost a loved one.</div>
              <div>These are the hands that clap for joy at the healing of a disease.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>These are the hands that insert tubes that being healing to the body</div>
              <div>These are the hands that touch a forehead and tell, within a degree, normal or febrile.</div>
              <div>These are the hands that feel a pulse and know fast or slow, weak or strong, effective or for naught.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>These are the hands that restrain the angry from selfharm.</div>
              <div>These are the hands that compress the sternum to being life</div>
              <div>These are the hands that clean unspeakable places on another person's body</div>
              <div>but do so with dignity and respect which allow that person to feel like a human being.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>These are also the hands of different people</div>
              <div>not just black or white, brown or yellow but all</div>
              <div>These are not the hands of male or female but both.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Other hands may build buildings or write books</div>
              <div>Some hands may even pull the trigger or plunge the knife</div>
              <div>but these are the hands of life.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>These are the hands that take up the task passed down from so long ago</div>
              <div>to being healing to the sick, comfort to the afflicted, hope to the hopeless.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>But these are not the hands of timid maidens who look for direction outside themselves.</div>
              <div>These are the hands that can be clenched because sometimes something has got to change.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>These are the hands of a nurse</div>
              <div>These are the hands that have the privilege of being at the bedside</div>
              <div>for these are the hands of a nurse,</div>
              <div>the hands of a person that does a job that not everyone can do.</div>
              <div>These are the hands of a nurse, the hands of strength compassion and love</div>
              <div>These are the hands of a nurse.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>These are my hands.</div>

              <p>Hello CasperV,</p>
              <p>Welcome to the group. Thanks for responding....I agree with Short Ninja. Love does not only mean loving someone alone...it also means compassion, humility and lastly forgiveness. Hope you have a good heart to forgive and perhaps love someone when he or she had betrayed you or had hurt you CasperV.</p>
              <p>Take care always.</p>
              <p>With Love,</p>

Soon it was every five minutes, every three, every minute. But serious complications arose during delivery and Karen found herself in hours of labor.<br><br>Would a C-section be required? Finally, after a long struggle, Michael's little sister was born. But she was in very serious condition.<br><br>With a siren howling in the night, the ambulance rushed the infant to the neonatal intensive care unit at St. Mary's Hospital, Knoxville, Tennessee. The days inched by. The little girl got worse. The pediatrician had to tell the parents there is very little hope. Be prepared for the worst.<br><br>Karen and her husband contacted a local cemetery about a burial plot.<br><br>They had fixed up a special room in their house for their new baby but now they found themselves having to plan for a funeral. Michael, however, kept begging his parents to let him see his sister. I want to sing to her, he kept saying.<br><br>Week two in intensive care looked as if a funeral would come before the week was over.<br><br>Michael kept nagging about singing to his sister, but kids are never allowed in Intensive Care. Karen decided to take Michael whether they liked it or not.<br><br>If he didn't see his sister right then, he may never see her alive. She dressed him in an oversized scrub suit and marched him into ICU. </span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: blue; font-family: 'Arial', 'sans-serif';"> </span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; color: red; font-family: 'Arial', 'sans-serif';">He</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: blue; font-family: 'Arial', 'sans-serif';"> </span></strong><span class="ecapple-converted-space"><strong><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; color: #ff8100; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';"> </span></strong></span><strong><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; color: #ff8100; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">looked like a walking laundry basket.<br><br>The head nurse recognized him as a child and bellowed, 'Get that kid out of here now. No children are allowed.' The mother rose up strong in Karen, and the usually mild-mannered lady glared steel-eyed right into the head nurse's face, her lips a firm line. 'He is not leaving until he sings to his sister' she stated.<br><br>Then Karen towed Michael to his sister's bedside.<br><br>He gazed at the tiny infant losing the battle to live.<br><br>After a moment, he began to sing.<br><br>In the pure-hearted voice of a 3-year-old, Michael sang:<br><br>'You are my sunshine, my only sunshine, you make me happy when skies are gray.' Instantly the baby girl seemed to respond. The pulse rate began to calm down and become steady.<span class="ecapple-converted-space"> </span><br><br>'Keep on singing, Michael,' encouraged Karen with tears in her eyes.<br><br>'You never know, dear, how much I love you, please don't take my sunshine away.'</span></strong><span class="ecapple-converted-space"><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Tahoma', 'sans-serif';"> </span></span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Tahoma', 'sans-serif';"><br></span><br><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Tahoma', 'sans-serif';"><br></span><strong><span style="font-size: 13.5pt; color: #ff8100; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">As Michael sang to his sister, the baby's ragged, strained breathing became as smooth as a kitten's purr 'Keep on singing, sweetheart.'<br><br>'The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping, I dreamed I held you in my arms'. Michael's little sister began to relax as rest, healing rest, seemed to sweep over her.<br><br>'Keep on singing, Michael.' Tears had now conquered the face of the bossy head nurse. Karen glowed.<br><br>'You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. Please don't take my sunshine away...'<br><br>The next day...the very next day. the little girl was well enough to go home<br><br>Woman's Day Magazine called it The Miracle of a Brother's Song.<br><br>The medical staff just called it a miracle.<br><br>Karen called it a miracle of God's love.<br><br>NEVER GIVE UP ON THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE.<br><br>LOVE IS SO INCREDIBLY POWERFUL.<br><br>Life is good.<br><br>Have a Wonderful Day!  Just send this to (4) people and see what happens on the fourth day.<br><br>Do not break this, please.

Maybe you've forgotten<br>that I wasn't actually born during this time of the year and<br>that it was some of your predecessors who decided to celebrate<br>My birthday on what was actually a time of pagan festival.<br>Although I do appreciate being remembered anytime.<br><br>How I personally feel about this celebration can probably be<br>most easily understood by those of you who have been blessed<br>with children of your own.<br><br>I don't care what you call the day. If you want to celebrate<br>My birth, just GET ALONG AND LOVE ONE ANOTHER.<br><br>Now, having said that let Me go on. If it bothers you that the<br>town in which you live doesn't allow a scene depicting My<br>birth, then just get rid of a couple of Santa's and snowmen<br>and put in a small Nativity scene on your own front lawn. If<br>all My followers did that there wouldn't be any need for such<br>a scene on the town square because there would be many of them<br>all around town.<br><br>Stop worrying about the fact that people are calling the tree<br>a holiday tree, instead of a Christmas tree. It was I who made<br>all trees. You can remember Me anytime you see any tree.<br>Decorate a grape vine if you wish: I actually spoke of that<br>one in a teaching, explaining who I am in relation to you and<br>what each of our tasks were. If you have forgotten that one,<br>look up John 15: 1 - 8.<br><br>If you want to give Me a present in remembrance of My birth<br>here is my wish list. Choose something from it:<br><br>1. Instead of writing protest letters objecting to the way My<br>birthday is being celebrated, write letters of love and hope<br>to soldiers away from home.  They are terribly afraid and<br>lonely this time of year.  I know, they tell Me all the time.<br><br>2. Visit someone in a nursing home. You don't have to know<br>them personally.  They just need to know that someone cares<br>about them.<br><br>3. Instead of writing George complaining about the wording on<br>the cards his staff sent out this year, why don't you write<br>and tell him that you'll be praying for him and his family<br>this year.  Then follow up.  It will be nice hearing from you<br>again.<br><br>4. Instead of giving your children a lot of gifts you can't<br>afford and they don't need, spend time with them.  Tell them<br>the story of My birth, and why I came to live with you down<br>here.  Hold them in your arms and remind them that I love<br>them.<br><br>5. Pick someone that has hurt you in the past and forgive him<br>or her.<br><br>6. Did you know that someone in your town will attempt to take<br>their own life this season because they feel so alone and<br>hopeless?  Since you don't know who that person is, try giving<br>everyone you meet a warm smile; it could make the difference.<br><br>7. Instead of nit picking about what the retailer in your town<br>calls the holiday, be patient with the people who work there.<br>Give them a warm smile and a kind word.  Even if they aren't<br>allowed to wish you a "Merry Christmas" that doesn't keep you<br>from wishing them one.  Then stop shopping there on Sunday.<br>If the store didn't make so much money on that day they'd<br>close and let their employees spend the day at home with their<br>families.<br><br>8. If you really want to make a difference, support a<br>missionary - especially one who takes My love and Good News to<br>those who have never heard My name.<br><br>9. Here's a good one.  There are individuals and whole<br>families in your town who not only will have no "Christmas"<br>tree, but neither will they have any presents to give or<br>receive.  If you don't know them, buy some food and a few<br>gifts and give them to the Salvation Army or some other<br>charity which believes in Me and they will make the delivery<br>for you.<br><br>10. Finally, if you want to make a statement about your belief<br>in and loyalty to Me, then behave like a Christian.  Don't do<br>things in secret that you wouldn't do in My presence.  Let<br>people know by your actions that you are one of mine.<br><br>Don't forget; I am God and can take care of Myself. Just love<br>Me and do what I have told you to do. I'll take care of all<br>the rest.<br><br>Check out the list above and get to work; time is short. I'll<br>help you, but the ball is now in  your court. And do have a<br>most blessed Christmas with all those whom you love and<br>remember:<br>I LOVE YOU, JESUS<br><br>~Earthly Author Unknown~</span></span></div>

              <p>Hey guys, got catch the movie called, "Facing the Giants". I bought the DVD just 2 days back. And so far, I have already watched the show twice! It's absolutely fantastic! 6 popcorns or the movie! I cried even after watching it the 2nd time! What an amazing story of God's love and teaching us what faith truly means.</p>

              <p>I was happy. My girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year, and so we decided to get married.<br><br>My parents helped us in every way, my friends encouraged me, and my girlfriend? She was a dream!<br><br>There was only one thing bothering me, very much indeed, and that one thing was her younger sister.<br><br>My prospective sister-in-law was twenty years of age, wore tight mini skirts and low cut blouses. She would regularly bend down when quite near me and I got many a pleasant view of her underwear. It had to be deliberate. She never did it when she was near anyone else.<br><br>One day little sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. She was alone when I arrived. She whispered to me that soon I was to be married, and she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome and didn't really want to overcome. <br><br>She told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister. I was in total shock and couldn't say a word.<br><br>She said, "I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want to go ahead with it just come up and get me." I was stunned. I was frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs. When she reached the top she pulled down her panties and threw them down the stairs at me. <br><br>I stood there for a moment, then turned and went straight to the front door. I opened the door and stepped out of the house. I walked straight towards my car.<br><br>My future father-in-law was standing outside. With tears in his eyes he hugged me and said, "We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family."<br></p>

              over to the telephone. He climbed onto the carton so that he could reach the

              <br> <br> <br> <br> "Lady, I will cut your lawn for half the price of the person who cuts your
              lawn now." replied boy. The woman responded that she was very satisfied
              with the person who was presently cutting her lawn. <br> <br> <br> <br> The little boy found more perseverance and offered, "Lady, I'll even sweep
              your curb and your sidewalk, so on Sunday you will have the prettiest lawn in
              all of Palm beach, Florida." Again the woman answered in the negative.
              <br> <br> <br> <br> With a smile on his face, the little boy replaced the receiver. The
              store-owner, who was listening to all, walked over to the boy and said,
              "Son... I like your attitude; I like that positive spirit and would like
              to offer you a job." <br> <br> <br> <br> The little boy replied, "No thanks, I was just checking my performance

              <p>Hello Destiny, (Hope you wouldn't mind me calling you by that name)</p>
              <p>Yes, I have many inspirational stories about looking from different perspectives.</p>
              <p>In the past I used to write oftenly in the internet and shared with people in the internet world how or what I felt, what I saw, what I thought and what I knew; and also I used to post enormous quantities of emails with short stories written by other writers too to many emailing groups that I was or I am a member of that group or groups and to many friends of mine in the internet world too. I did that when I had the computer with internet service at home and while I was jobless and looking for a job in the past.</p>
              <p>Guess what, I am jobless again now. The medical centre that I had worked with had to close their business and under liquidation now due to economic global crisis. I probably could contribute many stories in the internet again, but, I have my limitation here. I do not have a computer that is connected to the internet service and if I wish to write, I have to go to the cybercafe near the vicinity of my Skudai home in Johor Baru.</p>
              <p>I think, and I feel like sharing with you and others within this forum about my writing and stories. I had thought about it in the past of doing that but then I had decided to hold on and wait, to see how I feel about it should I share it within this forum. Well, I have decided it is time and I feel it is appropriate to share it here because I see that many of us here are quite open minded and eager to learn and share stories within this forum. I will do that later. In the meantime I need to reply my good childhood bestfriend email in my Sg Forum inbox that I had just received a few days ago. </p>
              <p>So Destiny, if you have time, just read the past postings within this thread and you can read all the inspirational stories and movies from different perspectives. I hope you will enjoy reading them. My friend, you do not know what I feel like doing now but I have my thoughts to digest and put them into words which sometimes may takes a few minutes, a few days, a few weeks, a few months, a few years and maybe forever, until such times when I have that correct knowledge or mind to allow or to make you understand or to make you see or to make you learn or to make you move or to make you mind, your own mind.</p>
              <p>Destiny, thank you for asking and thank you for your interest and thank you for your response to make me move many many worlds within my mind.</p>
              <p>Take care and God Bless.</p>
              <p>With Love,</p>
              <p>Joe</p>
