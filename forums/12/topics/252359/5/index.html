            <div class='col-md body'>Thought I share an excerpt from my manuscript of 'Mind Of A Mankind.'<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>With Love,<br>Joe<br><br>The creation of life on earth is still a mystery for many researchers of truth. The truth about the creation of life is still inexplicable for them and they are still searching for the atoms or the God that created life on earth. Many of them whether they are scientists or religious preachers usually make a conclusion that the creation of life must have started when mother earth was formed. The conclusion came about through Science knowledge or by Faith alone. Their conclusions are normally based upon the idea of probabilities, theories, logic and faiths, which have been compiled as their thesis and then converted it into facts or truths. They are not wrong but on the right tracks. That kind of work takes a lot of time since mankind acquired more knowledge throughout the ages. Just like a child playing with his Lego blocks, if ever they managed to break the seal that locked the secrets of creations of life and creates life or personally meet the Creator Himself, they can be considered as gods or viceroys of God. If not, they are just mankind and believers of God. Just like a sculptorÂ’s wishful thoughts of giving Life to their statues if they could and a man eloquently preached GodÂ’s words that healed the hearts and minds of billions. How, where, when and then Life begins is the most extensive mystery that human race is trying to know and learn but many too just believed that God is God and Mankind is Mankind.<br><br>Since mankind was able to think about the earth, the moon, the sun and the stars, they began to wonder and ponder about the beginning of Life, the meaning of Life, and the ambience around them. These were the causes and effects for them to search the beginning and the meaning of their existence. The early period of mankind life was very different from modern mankind. Most of the early mankind saw their lives full of miseries because it was a very hard life for them. During the primitive period of mankind, they transversed throughout the distant lands for their quest of better and for safer living habitations. They needed to search, hunt and store for food with methods and tools of their own inventions. The climates and living environments were so treacherous at the expense of their own lives being terminated by many untoward incidences that caused many of them to perish. They needed foods and shelters to survive. When they found where they could hunt for more foods, they would settle there until the foods for their survival ran away from them, withered away due to cataclysm and catastrophes caused by Mother EarthÂ’s natural causes and effects or in theological term "Will of God". That kind of life was not an easy life for them but yet they managed to survive until they proliferated into many tribes on earth. In that kind of living environments they probably did not have the time or idea about who they were and where they came from or who created them? Their thoughts were normally survival to remain alive. They were communal tribes and they became stronger and mightier regardless of the circumstances and calamities they had encountered as time moved forward.<br><br>Their mind was a wonderland for them when they began to look for answers about the world and the constellations. They began to understand more about themselves and the world they lived in. The thoughts of their own wondering manifested into actions, then the cause and effect plans manifested into their lives. Then they progressed through time throughout the ages as mankind after myriad of ideas in their thoughts manifested and materialised into existence in the world of mankind. Images and sounds began to form in their mind, then words and languages manifested. They saw pictures in their mind and started to draw and invent things. That was the way they started to improve their living standards, maintained the securities within their communities and defended themselves from outside threats.<br><br><strong>"In the beginning there was nothing only emptiness. The nothingness and emptiness began to form into pictures, sounds and words. Then the pictures, sounds and words were inspired into meaningful things and it became flesh. The pictures, sounds and words became languages and new things for mankind to utilise." </strong><br><br>The inspirations received by mankind throughout the ages, accounted for all the knowledge and inventions we see now and some are not seen yet because it is not the right time for mankind to know and see. When you understand how your mind works it will teach you many new knowledge and new things. This is the way mankind ameliorated to become mankind of today.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">5 Good Lessons.. </span></strong><br><br>Have we ever thought how we treat people. Have we treat them the way we should..<br><br>Share this with you.<br><br>Five (5) lessons to make you think about the way we treat people that leads to 5 Good Reasons..<br><br><strong>1 - First Important Lesson - Cleaning Lady.</strong><br><br>During my second month of college, our professor gave us a pop quiz. I was a conscientious student and had breezed through the questions until I read<br>the last one:<br><br>"What is the first name of the woman who cleans the school?"<br><br>Surely this was some kind of joke. I had seen the cleaning woman several times. She was tall, dark-haired and in her 50s, but how would I know her name?<br><br>I handed in my paper, leaving the last question blank. Just before class ended, one student asked if the last question would count toward our quiz grade.<br><br>"Absolutely," said the professor. "In your careers, you will meet many people. All are significant. They deserve your attention and care, even if all you do<br>is smile and say "hello."<br><br>I've never forgot then that lesson. I also learned her name was Dorothy.<br><br><strong>2. - Second Important Lesson - Pickup in the Rain</strong><br><br>One night, at 11:30 p.m., an older African American woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway trying to endure a lashing rainstorm. Her car had broken down and she desperately needed a ride. Soaking wet, she decided to flag down the next car. A young white man stopped to help her, generally unheard of in those conflict-filled 60s. The man took her to safety, helped her get assistance and put her into a taxicab.<br><br>She seemed to be in a big hurry, but wrote down his address and thanked him. Seven days went by and a knock came on the man's door. To his surprise, a giant console color TV was delivered to his home. A special note was attached..It read:<br><br>"Thank you so much for assisting me on the highway the other night. The rain drenched not only my clothes, but also my spirits. Then you came along. Because of you, I was able to make it to my dying husband's bedside just before he passed away... God bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others."<br><br>Sincerely,<br>Mrs. Nat King Cole.<br><br><strong>3 - Third Important Lesson - Always remember those who serve.</strong><br><br>In the days when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10-year-old boy entered a hotel coffee shop and sat at a table. A waitress put a glass of water in front of him.<br><br>"How much is an ice cream sundae?" he asked.<br><br>"Fifty cents," replied the waitress.<br><br>The little boy pulled is hand out of his pocket and studied the coins in it.<br><br>"Well, how much is a plain dish of ice cream?" he inquired.<br><br>By now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing impatient.<br><br>"Thirty-five cents," she brusquely replied.<br><br>The little boy again counted his coins.<br><br>"I'll have the plain ice cream," he said.<br><br>The waitress brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked away. The boy finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and left. When the waitress came back, she began to cry as she wiped down the table. There, placed neatly beside the empty dish, were two nickels and five pennies..<br><br>You see, he couldn't have the sundae, because he had to have enough left to leave her a tip.<br><br><strong>4 - Fourth Important Lesson - The obstacle in Our Path.</strong><br><br>In ancient times, a King had a boulder placed on a roadway. Then he hid himself and watched to see if anyone would remove the huge rock. Some of the king's wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it. Many loudly blamed the King for not keeping the roads clear, but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way.<br><br>Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables. Upon approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road. After much pushing and straining, he finally succeeded. After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The purse contained many gold coins and a note from the King indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway. The peasant learned what many of us never understand!<br><br>Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition.<br><br><strong>5 - Fifth Important Lesson - Giving When it Counts...</strong><br><br>Many years ago, when I worked as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a little girl named Liz who was suffering from a rare &amp;serious disease. Her only<br>chance of recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her 5-year old brother, who had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies needed to combat the illness. The doctor explained the situation to her little brother, and asked the little boy if he would be willing to give his blood to his sister.<br><br>I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a deep breath and saying, "Yes I'll do it if it will save her." As the transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled, as we all did, seeing the color returning to her cheek. Then his face grew pale and his smile faded.<br><br>He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling voice, "Will I start to die right away".<br><br>Being young, the little boy had misunderstood the doctor; he thought he was going to have to give his sister all of his blood in order to save her.<br><br><strong>"Work like you don't need the money, love like you've never been hurt, and dance like you do when nobody's watching."</strong><br><br></div>

That's why you are not happy.<br><br>BB: But how can we not worry when there is so much uncertainty?<br><br>God: Uncertainty is inevitable, but worrying is optional.<br><br>BB: But then, there is so much pain due to uncertainty...<br><br>God: Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional.<br><br>BB: If suffering is optional, why do good people always suffer?<br><br>God: Diamond cannot be polished without friction. Gold cannot be purified without fire. Good people go through trials, but don't suffer. With that experience their life becomes better, not bitter.<br><br>BB: You mean to say such experience is useful?<br><br>God: Yes, always. Experience is a hard teacher. She gives the test first and the lessons afterwards.<br><br>BB: But still, why should we go through such tests? Why can't we be free from problems?<br><br>God: Problems are: Purposeful Roadblocks Offering Beneficial Lessons to Enhance Mental Strength. Inner strength comes from struggle and endurance, not when you are free from problems.<br><br>BB: Frankly in the midst of so many problems, we don't know where we are heading...<br><br>God: If you look outside you will not know where you are heading. Look inside. Looking outside, you dream. Looking inside, you awaken. Eyes provide sight. Heart provides insight.<br><br>BB: Sometimes not succeeding fast seems to hurt more than moving in the right direction. What should I do?<br><br>God: Success is a measure as decided by others. Satisfaction is a measure as decided by you. Knowing the road ahead is more satisfying than knowing you rode ahead. You work with the compass. Let others work with the clock.<br><br>BB: In tough times, how do you stay motivated?<br><br>God: Always look at how far you have come rather than how far you have to go. Always count your blessing, not what you are missing.<br><br>BB: What surprises you about people?<br><br>God: When they suffer they ask, "why me?" When they prosper, they never ask "Why me?" Everyone wishes to have truth on their side, but few want to be on the side of the truth.<br><br>BB: How can I get the best out of life?<br><br>God: Face your past without regret. Handle your present with confidence. Prepare for the future without fear.<br><br>BB: One last question. Sometimes I feel my prayers are not answered.<br><br>God: There are no unanswered prayers. At times the answer is NO.<br><br>BB: Thank you for this wonderful chat. I am so happy to start the New Day with a new sense of inspiration.<br><br>God: Well. Keep the faith and drop the fear. Don't believe your doubts and doubt your beliefs. Life is a mystery to solve, not a problem to resolve. Trust me. Life is wonderful if you know how to live.<br><br>Thank you God.<br><br>With Love,<br>Joe<br>(Zulkifli Mahmood)<br><a href="http://www.er.com.sg" rel="nofollow">http://www.er.com.sg</a><br><br>[/b]</blockquote>Its time for me to go home now.

And this should not surprise us, because<br>we all know how difficult it is to hide "Love".<br><br>"Madness": "...ninety five, ninety six, ninety<br>seven..." Just when "Madness" got to one<br>hundred.........<br><br>"Love" jumped into a rose bush where he hid.<br><br>And Madness turned around and shouted: "I'm coming,<br>I'm coming!"<br><br>As Madness turned around, "Laziness" was the first<br>to be found, because "Laziness" was too lazy to hide.<br>"Madness" searched madly and found "Lie" at the bottom<br>of the lake.<br><br>One by one, Madness found them all except Love.<br>Madness was getting desperate, unable to find Love.<br><br>Envious of Love, "Envy" whispered to "Madness" "You<br>only need to find Love, and Love is hiding in the rose<br>bush."<br><br>"Madness" Jumped on the rose bush and he heard loud<br>cry. The thorns in the bush had pierced "Loves" eyes.<br><br>Hearing the commotion God came into the room and saw<br>what had happened.

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span class="large">An oldie but what a goodie!</span></strong></span><br><br>To all my "coffee" friends. This is just too great not to pass on.<br><br>Carrot, Egg and Coffee...You will never look at a cup of coffee the same way<br>again...<br><br>A young woman went to her mother and told her about her life and how things<br>were so hard for her. She did not know how she was going to make it and wanted to give up. She was tired of fighting and struggling. It seemed as one problem was solved, a new one arose.<br><br>Her mother took her to the kitchen. She filled three pots with water and placed each on a high fire. Soon the pots came to boil. In the first she placed carrots, in the second she placed eggs, and in the last she placed ground coffee beans. She let them sit and boil, without saying a word.<br><br>In about twenty minutes she turned off the burners. She fished the carrots out and placed them in a bowl. She pulled the eggs out and placed them in a bowl. Then she ladled the coffee out and placed it in a bowl.<br><br>Turning to her daughter, she asked, "Tell me what you see."<br><br>"Carrots, eggs, and coffee," she replied.<br><br>Her mother brought her closer and asked her to feel the carrots. She did and<br>noted that they were soft. The mother then asked the daughter to take an egg<br>and break it! . After pulling off the shell, she observed the hard boiled egg.<br>Finally, the mother asked the daughter to sip the coffee. The daughter smiled<br>as she tasted its rich aroma.<br><br>The daughter then asked, "What does it mean, mother?"<br><br>Her mother explained that each of these objects had faced the same adversity<br>- boiling water. Each reacted differently.<br><br>The carrot went in strong, hard, and unrelenting. However, after being subjected to the boiling water, it softened and became weak.<br><br>The egg had been fragile. Its thin outer shell had protected its liquid interior, but after sitting through the boiling water, its inside became hardened.<br><br>The ground coffee beans were unique, however. After they were in the boiling<br>water, they had changed the water.<br><br>"Which are you?" she asked her daughter. "When adversity knocks on your door, how do you respond? Are you a carrot, an egg or a coffee bean?"<br><br>Think of this: Which am I? Am I the carrot that seems strong, but with pain<br>and adversity do I wilt and become soft and lose my strength?<br><br>Am I the egg that starts with a malleable heart, but changes with the heat?<br>Did I have a fluid spirit, but after a death, a breakup, a financial hardship or some other trial, have I become hardened and stiff? Does my shell look the same, but on the inside am I bitter and tough with a stiff spirit and hardened heart?<br><br>Or am I like the coffee bean? The bean actually changes the hot water, the very circumstance that brings the pain. When the water gets hot, it releases the<br>fragrance and flavor. If you are like! the bea n, when things are at their worst, you get better and change the situation around you.<br><br>When the hour is the darkest and trials are their greatest, do you elevate yourself to another level? How do you handle adversity? Are you a carrot, an<br>egg or a coffee bean?<br><br>May you have enough happiness to make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you human and enough hope to make you happy.<br><br>The happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes along their way. The brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past; you can't go forward in life until you let go of your past failures and heart aches. When you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was smiling.<br><br>Live your life so at the end, you're the one who is smiling and everyone<br>around you is crying.<br><br>You might want to send this message to those people who mean something to you (I JUST DID); to those who have touched your life in one way or another; to<br>those who make you smile when you really need it; to those who make you see the brighter side of things when you are really down; to those whose friendship you appreciate; to those who are so meaningful in your life. If you don't send it, you will just miss out on the opportunity to brighten someone's day with this message!<br><br>It's easier to build a child than repair an adult.</div>

There is a<br>mousetrap in the house!" The chicken clucked and<br>scratched, raised her head and said "Mr. Mouse, I can<br>tell this is a grave concern to you, but it is of no<br>consequence to me. I cannot be bothered by it."<br><br>The mouse turned to the pig and told him, "There is a<br>mousetrap in the house." The pig sympathized but said,<br>"I am so very sorry Mr. Mouse, But there is nothing I<br>can do about it but pray Be assured that you are in my<br>prayers."<br><br>The mouse turned to the cow. She said, "Wow, Mr.<br>Mouse. I'm sorry for you. But it's no skin off my<br>nose."<br><br>So the mouse returned to the house, head down and<br>dejected, to face the farmer's mousetrap alone. That<br>very night a sound was heard throughout the house like<br>the sound of a mousetrap catching its prey.<br><br>The farmer's wife rushed to see what was caught. In<br>the darkness she did not see that it was a venomous<br>snake whose tail the trap had caught.<br><br>The snake bit the farmer's wife.<br><br>The farmer rushed her to the hospital and she returned<br>home with a fever.<br><br>Now everyone knows you treat a fever with fresh<br>chicken soup, so the farmer took his hatchet to the<br>farmyard for the soup's main ingredient. The Chicken<br><br>But his wife's sickness continued, so friends and<br>neighbors came to sit with her around the clock<br><br>To feed them, the farmer butchered the pig.<br><br>The farmer's wife did not get well. She died;<br><br>And so many attended her funeral the farmer had the<br>cow slaughtered to provide enough meat for all of<br>them.<br><br>So next time you hear that someone is facing a problem<br>and think that it doesn't concern you, remember that<br>when one of us is threatened, we are all at risk.<br><br>We are all involved in this journey called life.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">A PAINTING BY MICHAEL</span></strong><br><br>It happened a long time ago (December 1995) and he was the only guy that showed many doors to me.<br><br>In December 1995, I was detained in Kalideras Immigration Detention Centre, in Jakarta. There while I was waiting for my travel document to be processed by Singapore embassy in Jakarta, I met an American man who was also detained for overstaying.<br><br>He called himself Michael. He told me that he had served in Vietnam with an<br>Airborne Unit. He told me that the first thing that came to his mind when he hit the ground was his uniform; how dirty and untidy it was going to be. He<br>told me that he was from Florida and in fact he had an Indonesian wife in Indonesia. He was a Muslim not because he married an Indonesian Muslim lady but because he had a heart attack.<br><br>He narrated to me that while he was having that heart attack, initially he felt<br>painful but after awhile he felt peaceful and he saw Him. He said to himself, "I pointed my forefinger upward and said 'Allah.'"<br><br>Once he showed me one of his paintings. And he asked me, "What is<br>the meaning of this painting. Can you tell me?"<br><br>In his painting, the first object that he painted was a vase of flowers with many colours. Then, just behind that flower vase, there was a picture of a beautiful seductive woman. Just next and behind of that woman, there were pictures hanging on the walls with evil eyes and impished grins hiding behind a forage. Then next to the wall of that frightening picture hanging behind that woman, there was a corridor passageway with four or five door entrances on the right<br>hand side. On the floor of that passageway, there were arrows pointing straight ahead towards the end of the last door entrance. On the wall at the end of that passageway just next to the last door entrance, there was a large picture with the word 'Allah' written on it.<br><br>So I answered him. The flowers represented Life itself. He answered 'Yes'. The beautiful seductive woman, represented temptation. He answered 'Yes'. The pictures of evil eyes and grins hiding behind the bush represented evil doers. He answered 'Yes'. There were good and bad people. He answered 'Good' and 'Yes'. The arrows on the floor of that passageway meant direction. He answered 'Yes'. The doors... (I did not know what it meant, back then). He smiled. The word 'Allah' in that frame picture, means God but .....(I did not know what it meant). He smiled.<br><br>Well, he did not tell me what the whole picture meant to him but he asked me, "How old are you Zul? I replied, "Thirty-two." Then he said, "You know<br>Zul, I want you to know this, when you know what this picture meant, I will thank you and I assure you that you will fall in love everyday. Then you will remember me." Then he said, "I fall in love wonderfully everyday." Then I argued with him, "You mean you fall in love everyday with women." He replied, "Yes, I fall in love with every woman I met on the street everyday." Then I asked him again, "You are married, right Michael?" He replied, "Yes, I'm<br>married and I love my wife very much and I also fall in love with every woman I met on the street everyday."<br><br>I found it hard to believe him back then because he seemed much like a man who had too much to drink when he talked but he had clear ideas of what he was talking about. He said to me once, "You know Zul, this detention centre is like a drama. People have their own problems but when they listen to other people problems, they forget about their own problems. Its a stage and sometimes we are the actors."<br><br>That Michael was correct to say to me this, "You will remember me."<br><br>Joe</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This was shared with me, and I thought I would share it with others...Hope you too enjoy as I did.<br><br>With Love,<br>Joe<br><a href="http://www.er.com.sg" rel="nofollow">http://www.er.com.sg</a><br><br><strong><span class="large">Subject: Installing Love Directory</span></strong><br><br>CUSTOMER: I can do that. I'm not very technical, but I think I am ready<br>to install now. What do I do first?<br><br>CS REP: The first step is to open your HEART. Have you located your<br>HEART ma'am?<br><br>CUSTOMER : Yes I have, but there are several programs running right now. Is<br>it okay to install while they are running?<br><br>CS REP : What programs are running ma'am?<br><br>CUSTOMER : Let me see....I have PASTHURT.EXE, LOWESTEEM.EXE,<br>GRUDGE.EXE, and RESENTMENT.COM running right now.<br><br>CS REP : No problem. LOVE will automatically erase PASTHURT.EXE from<br>your current operating system. It may remain in your permanent<br>memory, but it will no longer disrupt other programs. LOVE will<br>eventually, overwrite LOWESTEEM.EXE with a module of it's own<br>called HIGHESTEEM.EXE. However, you have to completely turn<br>off GRUDGE.EXE and RESENTMENT.COM. Those programs<br>prevent LOVE from being properly installed. Can you turn those off<br>ma'am?<br><br>CUSTOMER : I don't know how to turn them off. Can you tell me how?<br><br>CS REP : My pleasure. Go to your Start menu and invoke<br>FORGIVENESS.EXE. Do this as many times as necessary until<br>GRUDGE.EXE and RESENTMENT.COM have been completely<br>erased.<br><br>CUSTOMER : Okay, I'm done. LOVE has started installing itself<br>automatically. Is that normal?<br><br>CS REP : Yes it is. You should receive a message that says it will reinstall<br>for the life of your HEART. Do you see that message?<br><br>CUSTOMER : Yes I do. Is it completely installed?<br><br>CS REP : Yes, but remember that you have only the base program. You need<br>to begin connecting to other HEARTS in order to get the upgrades.<br><br>CUSTOMER : Oops...I have an error message already. What should I do?<br><br>CS REP : What does the message say?<br><br>CUSTOMER : It says "ERROR 412 - PROGRAM NOT RUN ON INTERNAL<br>COMPONENTS". What does that mean?<br><br>CS REP : Don't worry ma'am, that's a common problem. It means that the<br>LOVE program is set up to run on external HEARTS but has not<br>yet been run on your HEART. It is one of those complicated<br>programming things, but in non-technical terms it means you have<br>to "LOVE" your own machine before it can "LOVE" others.<br><br>CUSTOMER : So what should I do?<br><br>CS REP : Can you find the directory called "SELF-ACCEPTANCE"?<br><br>CUSTOMER : Yes, I have it.<br><br>CS REP : Excellent, you are getting good at this.<br><br>CUSTOMER : Thank you.<br><br>CS REP : You're welcome. Click on the following files and then copy them to<br>the "MYHEART" directory: FORGIVESELF.DOC,<br>SELFESTEEM.TXT, REALIZEWORTH.TXT, and GOODNESS.DOC.<br>The system will overwrite any conflicting files and begin patching<br>any faulty programming. Also, you need to delete SELFCRITIC.EXE<br>from all directories, and then empty your recycle bin afterwards to<br>make sure it is completely gone and never comes back.<br><br>CUSTOMER : Got it. Hey! My HEART is filling up with really neat files.<br>SMILE.MPG is playing on my monitor right now and it shows<br>that WARMTH.COM, PEACE.EXE, and CONTENTMENT.COM<br>are copying themselves all over my HEART!<br><br>CS Rep: Then LOVE is installed and running. You should be able to handle it<br>from here. One more thing before I go....<br><br>CUSTOMER : Yes?<br><br>CS REP : LOVE is freeware. Be sure to give it and its various modules to<br>everybody you meet. They will in turn share it with other people and<br>they will return some really neat modules back to you.<br><br>CUSTOMER : I will. Thank you for your help!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">MEETING AN OLD FRIEND</span></strong><br><br>This incidence had happened in the year 2005, while I was still working in one of the hospital in Singapore.<br><br>Thought I share it with you.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>With Love,<br>Joe<br><br>I really don't understand why is it that this few days I have encountered two emotional incidences.<br><br>Today, towards the end of my day of work, I met an old friend whom I haven't seen for nearly 13 years. She was the first client that gave me the apportunity to run an advertising campaign for her business in the mass media. She was a very courteous, kind and loving lady.<br><br>Today, she was the last patient that my medical team attended. I didn't recognised her until I had pushed the bed inside the OR (Operating Room of Endoscopy Centre); and after I had set up the equipment and all the necessary medical attachments to her body. Then I immediately looked and read her wrist name tag again and took a looked at her closely this time. Her hair was crew cut and uneven. Just slightly above her forehead, on the right hand side, there was a sunken contraction. She could not speak clearly and she mumbled that she felt pain and cold. Then I realised she was my most important client before in the past.<br><br>I don't know what happened, and suddenly I asked her, "Kak (Sister) Rose! You are Kak Rose right! This is Zul! Do you remember me!" I took off my mask and let her see my face fully. She looked at me and tried to recall my face and name. And then she remembered and mumbled, "Zul! Zul! Yes, I remember." One of the elderly doctor was amazed that she could understand what I was saying to her. Immediately, without second thoughts, I spoke in front of two doctors and two senior staff nurses that this lady patient was a close friend and client of mine in the past. They all were surprised that I knew her and enquired about her. In a few seconds, I told them a short and brief history of Kak Rose. She was quite well known among the Malay business people. The doctors were so shocked to hear from Kak Rose herself, "He was an important man to me."<br><br>After the examination, I pushed her bed to the recovery ward. She told me that she had a stroke last year and she was bed ridden since then. She tried to talk to me more but I told her to rest. She was already been given some sedation in the OR. Tomorrow I will visit her and we will talk some more.<br><br>While walking to the train station, there were slight tears within my eyes. It automatically flow. My heart felt something inside and I could not really express it. I was thinking about Kak Rose and why this has to happen to her.<br><br>I was wondering too, "WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WANT AND WISH ME TO DO!"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span class="large">CLOSED DOOR </span></strong></span><br><br>Once upon a time, a man and a woman were given a big house.<br><br>Actually, it wasn't just a big house that they were given Â– it was an enormous house. There seemed to be no end to it. After counting several hundred rooms, they gave up trying to figure out how large it was.<br><br>The man and the woman were delighted by their new home. They spent weeks enjoying it. Then, one day, they had a conversation.<br><br>"You know," said the man, "this is a gigantic house. We have all this room."<br><br>"So much room," said the woman.<br><br>"And I have to tell you," said the man, "I'm getting a little tired of taking the garbage out. It's such a long walk to the trash bins."<br><br>"A very long walk," agreed the woman.<br><br>"So I have an idea. Why don't we choose one of these rooms that we don't use, and put our trash in there? No one will ever notice."<br><br>The woman thought about it. "I suppose that would be OK," she said.<br><br>And so they began to store their trash in a distant bedroom. It seemed like a fine plan Â– no one ever visited that section of the house, much less the trash room.<br><br>After a few months, the room became full with trash. But the system seemed like a good one, so they simply closed the door of the trash room, locked it, and began putting their trash in a second room.<br><br>This went on for years. The man and the woman filled up one room after another with garbage, never worrying too much about the consequences. After all, their house was enormous.<br>However, there came a day when they realized that they had a problem.<br><br>"I think we have a problem," said the woman. "I've noticed that there are rats running through the house."<br><br>"You're right," said the man. "And we've run out of bedrooms to store the trash. At least, all the nearby ones are full."<br><br>"You know," said the woman, "I didn't realize it, but we never go out of these couple of rooms. The odor is just too strong."<br><br>"And the rats," said the man. "I confess that I'm afraid of running into them in the hall."<br><br>So the couple sat for a few moments, pondering their situation.<br><br>"We better start taking out our trash from now on," said the man.<br><br>"That's not going to be enough," said the woman. "Though I hate to admit it, we're going to have to unlock the doors and start clearing the old garbage out."<br><br>Now, this was a horrifying prospect. After all, some of the trash had been stored away for years. There were probably rats and bugs and other such things living in the piles of garbage. But the house needed to be cleansed of the old trash. The couple was overwhelmed at the task before them.<br><br>Thankfully, at that moment, a wonderful thing happened. A neighbor walked up to the house and rang the couple's doorbell.<br><br>The neighbor said to them, "I see that you have a problem with your trash. I'm here to help you. I have no fear of garbage or rats or bugs. In fact, my mission on earth is to help people clean their houses up. But I need your cooperation. I need you to walk with me to every trash-filled room, and unlock the doors. You have the keys. I'll do the clean-up work, but I need you to open the doors with me Â– and keep them open."<br><br>The couple was certainly glad to have help. But they were still horrified at the job in front of them.<br><br>"The smell is so bad," said the woman. "I don't know if we can unlock these doors."<br><br>"And the rats," said the man. "Don't forget the rats Â– they may bite us. I think we should just keep things locked."<br><br>"I need your help," said the neighbor. "I can do the clean-up work, but only if you'll open the doors with me. When you're ready, I'm here to help."<br><br>And that is where many of us find ourselves today.<br><br>OPENING THE DOORS<br><br>We are the men and women who live in the big house. The house, as you may have guessed, is the mind. The piles of trash are the unloving thoughts that we've generated over the years.<br><br>Many of us, like the couple, have come to a point where we're tired of tiptoeing around our piles of garbage. The system of storing away our unloving thoughts hasn't worked. We've come to feel trapped and squashed. Though our home is enormous, we've reduced it to a meager few rooms.<br><br>Thankfully, we have help. The neighbor in the story is the Spirit of God, the Inner Healer. It is this Spirit's job to clean out our trash. Our part of the process is very small by comparison. We are asked to walk with the Spirit to each closed-off room, unlock the doors, and allow the cleaning process to begin.<br><br>There can be some trepidation in this work; after all, approaching our locked doors and taking a look at our piles of trash may feel disconcerting. But thankfully, it is the Spirit's job to do the clean-up work. Our job is simply to unlock the doors.<br><br>A COMMON FORM<br><br>Let me give an example of what I mean by our trash. One common form of garbage is grievances, or resentments. You could also call them "thoughts of separation."<br><br>Many of us generate a significant amount of this type of trash every day. A common tendency is to fill up a room with this type of garbage, and then Â– when the room becomes full Â– lock it away and decide never to go back inside.<br><br>A Course in Miracles asks us to open all these locked doors, face our unloving thoughts, and immediately allow the Divine Transformer to clean them up. We're asked to open up all our rooms, including those called, "My thoughts about my ex-girlfriend," "My thoughts about my former boss," and, "My thoughts about this person who criticized me." It's essential to stop hiding this garbage away.<br><br>One important teaching from the Course (and many other spiritual and psychological systems) is that we can't release what we're unwilling to admit. If we say, "Oh, no Â– I don't have any unloving thoughts toward so-and-so," then the Spirit can't clean them up. We need to honestly acknowledge our blocks, so that they can immediately be replaced with new, loving thoughts. This process can't begin until we unlock the doors.<br><br>Does this mean that we have to spend years and years delving into our thoughts about every past relationship? I don't think so. By beginning with the immediate ones, we form a pattern. As this pattern continues, we'll become more able (or willing) to unlock whole floors of doors at a time. The key is to simply admit that we need Help, and express our willingness to let that Help in.<br><br>A SIMPLE WAY TO START<br><br>One easy way to begin this clean-up process is to choose a relationship that seems neutral. Even in "neutral" human relationships, there is often a significant amount of separation, wariness, and distance that we place between each other. We can allow the Spirit to clean out our "neutral" rooms first, and move on from there in a state of greater peace.<br><br>As an example of this, the next time you walk into a store, you can allow the Spirit to clean up any separation thoughts between you and the person behind the counter. You may not be aware of any separation thoughts, but the Course promises that when our thoughts of separation have been divinely replaced, we'll know it. We'll be stunned by the love we feel and the beauty we perceive in the person before us.<br><br>I invite you to try this, the next time you interact with a clerk in a clothing store or a coffee shop or supermarket. If you wish, you can say a little prayer before you walk in:<br><br>Spirit of God, I open the door of this relationship to you.<br>Please clean out any separation thoughts from my mind.<br>Redecorate this room with your lovely, loving thoughts.<br>I am willing to have my view of this person transformed.<br><br>This can produce touching results, and inspire us in our efforts to continue the room-opening process. Again, it's the Spirit's job to effect the healing. Our job is simply to unlock our blocked-up rooms, and keep the doors open as the inner transformation takes place.</div>
