Interesting article Steve. Thank you.<br><br>Joe.<br><br>----- Original Message -----<br><br>From: "Steve"<br>To:<br>Sent: Sunday, December 14, 2003 5:11 AM<br>Subject: Story of Civilization discussion LESSONS OF HISTORY - Race and History<br><br>"History is color-blind, and can develop a civilization (in any favorable environment) under almost any skin."<br><br>There seems to be such an environmental variable in the equation of  cultural greatness that it seems futile to assign overall ability on the basis of race. With the little I have studied on the capacity of the brain and how it can develop given a chance, skin color seems absolutely minor in how far a person can go except in terms of tanning. Having been a high-school substitute teacher for two years I got to see children from three different school districts in everything from remedial math to advanced placement physics. My limited observation is that race is only limiting in the degree to which its mores and values keep the brain and heart from accomplishing what they are capable of. A study recently came out entitled "No Excuses: Closing the Racial Gap in Learning"  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-%20/0743204468/qid=1071348299//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i0_xgl14/102-0528554-&lt;br%20/&gt;3551362?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/- /0743204468/qid=1071348299//ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i0_xgl14/102-0528554-<br>3551362?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846 </a>where the authors found that  differences between races in the school system were more a result of  the home environment (66%) than the school (33%). In other words give<br>children new books and a small class size and it won't have half the  effect that a home where television doesn't dominate and parents know  exactly where the child is in their class work.<br><br>It is hard to ignore simple generalizations such as the Japanese make  good hardware people and Americans good software developers when  their respective dominance seems to indicate that this is the case. The Italians for their flair for art and style going back to the Renaissance and earlier, the Chinese in poetry, Indians in the meditative arts. No doubt about it flavors of Howard Gardeners seven intelligences shine brighter in some races more than others but to claim one as being superior overall than another is too unfounded and superficial.<br><br>Can someone help me with the following quote from Mr. Durant? I am a  little lost with the flow of logic and who is to blame for what.<br><br>"The role of race in history is rather preliminary than creative. Varied stocks entering some locality from diverse directions at divers times, mingle their blood, traditions, and ways with one another or with the existing population, like two diverse pools of genes coming together in sexual reproduction. Such an ethnic mixture may in the course of centuries produce a new type, even a new people; so Celts, Romans, Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Danes, and Normans fused to produce Englishmen. When the new type takes form its cultural expressions are unique, and constitute a new civilization-a new physiognomy, character, language, literature, religion, morality, and art. It is not the race that makes the civilization, it is the civilization that makes the people: circumstances geographical, economic, and political create a culture, and the culture creates the human type."<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Everyone,<br><br>I love children and I learned many things from them. I love to observe other people and I love to listen to other people direct experiences too. I love to read autobiography books because I see and feel what the authors had done and gone through during periods of difficulties. I learned from all these through my five senses and sometimes through my sixth sense indirectly without my knowledge. I have my own direct experiences to share with others too and I even wrote a manuscript about my life in Singapore and while I was living in Bali from 1992 to 1995. Anyway, to make the story short I have a movie link here which will show you that you can learn new knowledge from animals or from your own pet or pets. Take a look at them ok.<br><br><a href="http://www.thedogmovie.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thedogmovie.com/</a><br><br>Hope you love your pet or other animals more this time with a thought in mind that your dog or cat love you unconditionally.

Thanks for the comment about Mount Fuji being like an individual person. I agree for you have been on Mount Fuji summit for various occasions and for various personal reasons I guess..which thus made you think of Mount Fuji and its beauty. Hence I would make that statement to my friends..lovely statement there man or boy...hahaha..hope you do not mind me calling you boy because I was just kidding.<br><br><strong>Short Ninja </strong>wrote:<br><br><strong>"Every morning for years I would take pictures of Mount Fuji not with a camera but with my mind.Snow,Rain or shine any season of the year its appearance is never the same.Sometimes bluish,reddish,grey or snow capped.It is said that Fuji san is most beautiful and perfect in shape if you view it from Yamanashi State (from where I live) but the majestic volcano at 3776 metres could also be seen from 18 other states and so if you ask 18 other people they might not share the same view...hahaha did i say view?"</strong><br><br>Gunung Agung in Bali has the same kind of spiritual elements. I too admire Gunung Agung while I was living in Bali. The fact that Gunung Agung is so prominent from all directions in Bali or from East Java, it stood majestically like a King looking upon its people from high above. The Balinese would make sure that their front doors will be facing the direction of Gunung Agung for spiritual belief reasons...I do not know why but I was informed by the Balinese that the North represent good fortune and luck. On the summit of Gunung Agung, there lies the Besakth Temple or 'Pura' for all Hindus in Bali and world wide visitors to worship or admire the architecture of that great temple from the ancient period.<br><br><strong>Short Ninja </strong>wrote:<br><br><strong>"Well  my point is that every person is like Mt Fuji no two people are 100% alike not even twins or clones and others would look at you in a thousand different ways."</strong><br><br>Yes..just like Mount Everest, Mount Kinabalu, Mount Bromo...etc..though they are all mountains or a volcano. If there are two people that think almost alike probably I guess you and I have match Sir!<br><br>Thanks for coming down from Mount Fuji and giving us the commandment.<br><br>With Love,<br>Joe<br><br><a href="http://www.er.com.sg" rel="nofollow">http://www.er.com.sg</a></div>

The first time when I went to the top of Gunung Agung in December 1992, I felt solace and I sat for along time just looking at the sceneries that surround it at the foot of the mountain. I saw acres and acres of green padi fields and vast vegetation on the mountain.

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">DUTY</span></strong><br><br>By Samuel Smiles<br><br><span class="large">CHAPTER FOUR</span><br><br><span class="large"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MEN WHO CANNOT BE BOUGHT</strong></span></span><br><br>FIRST, there are men who can be bought. There are rogues innumerable, who are ready to sell their bodies and souls for money and for drink. Who has not heard of the elections which have been made void through bribery and corruptions? This is not the way to enjoy liberty or to keep it. The men who sell themselves are slaves; their buyers are dishonest and unprincipled. Freedom has its humbugs. "I'm standing on the soil of liberty," said an orator. "You ain't," replied a bookmaker in the audience. "You're standing in a pair of boots you never paid me for."<br><br>The tendency of men is ever to go with the majority - to go with huzzas. "Majority," said Schiller, "what does that mean? Sense has ever centred in the few. Votes should be weighed, not counted. That state must sooner or later go to ruin where numbers sway and ignorance decides."<br><br>When the secession from the Scotch Church took place, Norman Macleod said it was a great trial to the flesh to keep by the unpopular side, and to act out what conscience dictated as the line of duty. Scorn and hissing greeted him at every turn. "I saw a tomb to-day," he says in one of his letter,"in the chapel of Holyrood, with this inscription, 'Here lies an honest man!' I only wish to live in such a way as to entitle me to the same eloge."<br><br>The ignorant and careless are at the mercy of the unprinciples; and the ignorant are as yet greatly in the majority. When a French quack was taken before the Correctional Tribunal at Paris for obstructing the Pont Neuf, the magistrate said to him, "Sirrah! how is it you draw such crowds about you, and extract so much money from them in selling your 'infallible' rubbish?" "My lord," replied the quack, "how many people do you think cross the Pont Neuf in the hour?" "I don't know," said the judge. "Then I can tell you - about ten thousand; and how many of these do you think are wise?" "Oh, perhaps a hundred!" "It is too many," said the quack; "but I leave the hundred persons to you, and take the nine thousand and nine hundred for my customers!"<br><br>Men are bribed in all directions. They have no spirit of probity, self-respect, or manly dignity. If they had, they would spurn bribes in every form. Government servants are bribed to pass goods, fit or unfit for use. Hence soldier's half-tanned shoes give way on a march; their shoddy coats become ragged; their tinned provisions are found rotten. Captain Nares had a sad account to give of the feeding of his sailors while in the Artic regions. All this is accomplished by bribery and corruption in the lower quarters of the civil service.<br><br>Much is done in the way of illicit commissions. A cheque finds its way to a certain official, and he passes the account. Thus many a man becomes rich upon a moderate salary. After a great act of corruption had been practised by the servant of a public company, a notice was placed over the office door to this effect: "The servants of the company are not allowed to take bribes." The cook gets a commission from the tradesman; the butler has a secret understanding with the wine merchant.<br><br>"These illicit commissions," says the Times, "do much to poison business relations. But if the vice were ever to mount from the servants' hall or the market and invade any public office, there would be an end to efficiency or confidence in public men. It is all-important that the public service should be pure, and that no suspicion should rest on the name of any official in a post of confidence. It would be an evil day if it were generally suspected that civil servants took backsheesh or pots de vin."<br><br>An inventor suggested a method for registering the number of persons entering an omnibus, but the Secretary was unable to entertain it. "It is of no use to us," he said; "the machine which we want is one that will make our men honest, and that, I am afraid, we are not likely to meet with." We want honest men! is the cry everywhere. The police courts too often reveal the stealing and swindling of men in whom confidence has been placed; and the result is that they are dragged down from confidence to ruin. It is trustworthy character that is most wanted. Character is reliableness; convincing other men by your acts that you can be trusted.<br><br>Abroad it is the same. Russia, Egypt, and Spain are the worst. In Russia the corruption of public servants, even of the highest grade, is most gross. You must buy your way by gold. Bribery in every conceivable form is practised - from arrangements between furnishers and the officials who should control them, to the direct handing over of the goods - is undeniably prevalent. The excuse is that the public servants are so badly paid. The Moscow and Petersburg Railway was constructed at great expense. Vast sums were paid to engineers and workmen, and stolen by overseers and directors. Prince Mentchikoff accompanied his Imperial Master in a jaunt through the capital, undertaken for the benefit of the Persian Ambassador who was making a visit to the country. The Persian surveyed golden domes, granite pillars, glittering miles of shops, with true Oriental indifference. The Emperor at last bent towards his favourite and whispered with an air of vexation, "Can't we find anything that will astonish this fellow?" "Yes, yours Majesty," replied the Prince: "show him the accounts of the Moscow and Petersburg Railway!" At Alexandria, in Egypt, the "leakage," as it is called, is enormous, unless bought off by gold. In Spain, every ship has to work its way into port after bribing the customs officers. The excuse is the same as in Russia; the civil servants of Spain cannot live except by taking bribes.<br><br>Even in republics men are apt and willing to be bribed. Money gets over many difficulties; it solves many problems. In America, the cream of republics, bribery is conducted in a wholesale way. The simple salary of an official is not sufficient. Even the highest in office is bribed by presents of carriages and horses, and even by hard cash. The most far-seeing and honest of American statemen see that jobbery and corruption are fast undermining the efficiency of the administration, and debasing the standard of public virtue.*<br><br>( * See North American Review for January 1871. Mr. Jacob D. Cox says that the degrading hunt for public place and public money extends all over the States. There is no backwoods hamlet so obscure that its moral atmosphere has escaped the contagion. When one of the conflicting parties in the State has overcome the other, there is almost a sweep of the places of pay and power, down to the pettiest clerkship. The war-cry is "To the victors belong the spoils!" "We have to confess with shame," says Mr. Cox, "that its effect on our politics is the same as the cry of 'Beauty and booty' upon an army entering a captured city. We have become so familiarized with a disgraceful scramble to such an extent that we now wonder at our own apathy, and begin to realize that fact that the public conscience has become partially seared" (p. 89). During Mr. Johnson's administration "a condition of things existed which revalled the most corrupt era that can be found in the history of any nation." Sycophancy, adulation, bribery, and all the rest of the loathsome catalogue of political vices, thicken as we descend, till we reach the "rough" doing the ballot-stuffing or the curbstone fighting for his party, and making his gains by stealing the money he has received from some candidate to "treat the independent voters, who may be bought with a dram of whisky" (p.92).)<br><br>It has been the same all over the world. It does not matter what the form of government is called - whether a monarchy, an aristocracy, or a republic. It is not the form of government, but the men who administer it. Selfishly used, political power is a curse; intelligently and impartially used, it may be one of the greatest blessings to a community. If selfishness begins with the governing classes, woe to the country that is governed. The evil spreads downwards, and includes all classes, even the poorest. The race of life becomes one for mere pelf and self. Principle is abandoned. Honesty is a forgetten virtue. Faith dies out; and society becomes a scramble for place and money.<br><br>Yet there are men who have refused to be bought, in all times and ages. Even the poorest, inspired by duty, have refused to sell themselves for money. Among the North American Indians a wish for wealth is considered unworthy of a brave man - so that the chief is often the poorest of his tribe. The best benefactors of the race have been poor men, amonth the Israelites, among the Greeks, and among the Romans. Elisha was at the plough when called to be a prophet, and Cincinnatus was in his fields when called to lead the armies of Rome. Socrates and Epaminondas were amongst the poorest men in Greece. Such, too, were the Galilean fishermen, the inspired founders of our faith.<br><br>Aristides was called "The Just" from his unbending integrity. His sense of justice was spotless, and his self-denial unimpeachable. He fought at Marathon, at Salamis, and commanded at the battle of Plataea. Though he had borne the highest offices in the state, he died poor. Nothing could buy him; nothing could induce him to swerve from his duty. It is said that the Athenians became more virtuous from contemplating his bright example. In the representation of one of the tragedies of AEschylus, a sentence was uttered in favour of moral goodness, on which the eyes of the audience turned involuntarily from the actor to Aristides.<br><br>Phocion, the Athenian general, a man of great bravery and foresight, was surnamed "The Good." Alexander the Great, when overrunning Greece, endeavoured to win him from his loyalty. He offered him riches, and the choice of four cities in Asia. The answer of Phocion bespoke the spotless character of the man. "If Alexander really esteems me," he said, "let him leave me my honesty."<br><br>Yet Demosthenes, the eloquent, could be bought. When Harpalus, one of Alexander's chiefs, came to Athens, the orators had an eye upon his gold. Demosthenes was one of them. What is eloquence without honesty? On his visit to Harpalus, the chief perceived that Demosthenes was much pleased with one of the king's beautifully engraved cups. He desired him to take it in his hand that he might feel its weight. "How much might it bring?" asked Demosthenes. "It will bring you twenty talents," replied Harpalus. That night the cup was sent to Demosthenes, with twenty talents in it. The present was not refused. The circumstance led to the disgrace of the orator, and he soon after poisoned himself.<br><br>Cicero, on the other hand, refused all presents from friends, as well as from the enemies of his country. Some time after his assassination, Caesar Augustus found his grandson with a book of Cicero's in his hands. The boy endeavoured to hide it, but Caesar took it from him. After having run over it, he returned it to the boy, saying, "My dear child, this was an eloquent man, and a lover of his country."<br><br>Bias, when asked why he did not, like others of his countrymen, load himself with part of his property when all were obliged to fly, said, "Your wonder is without reason; I am carrying all my treasures with me."<br><br>When Diocletian had quitted the imperial purple for some time, Maximilian invited him to reassume government. Diocletian replied, "If I could show you the cabbages that I have planted with my own hands at Salona, and the fine melons that I have been ripening, and the delightful plantations I have made about my villa, I should no longer be urged to relinquish the enjoyment of happiness for the pursuit of power."<br><br>What he had worked fro was his own, the fruit of his own labour and pains. He had imbibed the spirit of industry, which gives perseverance to the worker, enterprise to the warrior, and firmness to the statesman. Labour shuts up the first avenues to dishonesty; it opens a broader field for the display of every talent, and inspires with a new vigour the performance of every social and religious duty. Hence the Romans desired to call Diocletian back to his political duties.<br><br>Contentment is also better than luxury or power; indeed, it is natural wealth. Mary, sister of Elizabeth, often wished that she had been born a milkmaid instead of a queen. She would have been saved the torture of unrequited love, and the degradation of power through the hands of her ministers. Many martyrs would have been saved from burning.<br><br>Brave and honest men do not work for gold. They work for love, for honour, for character. When Socrates suffered death rather than abandon his views of right morality - when Las Casas endeavoured to mitigate the tortures of the poor Indians - they had no thought of money or country. They worked for the elevation of all that thought, and for the relief of all that suffered.<br><br>When Michael Angelo was commanded by the Pope to undertake the direction of the works of St. Peter's, he consented only upon condition that he should receive no salary, but that he should labour "for the love of God alone." "Keep your money," said Wiertz of Brussels, to a gentleman who wished to buy one of his pictures; "gold gives the death-blow to art." At the same time it must be confessed that Wiertz was a man of outre character.<br><br>In political life, place and money are too much in request. The gift of office, when not fairly earned by public service, proves often the corruption of morals. It is the substitution of an inferior motive for a patriotic one; and wherever it prevails from considerations of personal favouritism, it degrades politics and debases character.<br><br>Andrew Marvell was a patriot of the old Roman build. He lived in troublous times. He was born at Hull at the beginning of the reign of Charles I. When a young man, he spend four years at Trinity College, Cambridge. He afterwards travelled through Europe. In Italy he met Milton, and continued his friend through life. On his returns to England the Civil War was raging. It does not appear that he took any part in the struggle, though he was always a defender and promoter of liberty. In 1660 he was elected member of Parliament for his native town, and during his membership he wrote to the mayor and his constituents by almost every post, telling them of the course of affairs in Parliament.<br><br>Marvell did not sympathize with Milton's anti-monarchical tendencies. His biographer styles him "the friend of England, Liberty, and Magna Charta." He had no objections to a properly restricted monarchy, and therefore favoured the Restoration. The people longed for it, believing that the return of Charles II. would prove the restoration of peace and loyalty. They were much mistaken. Marvell was appointed to accompany Lord Carlisle on an embassy to Russia, showing that he was not reckoned an enemy to the Court. During his absence much evil had been done. The restored king was constantly in want of money. He took every method, by selling places and instituting monopolies, to supply his perpetual need. In one of Marvell's letters to his constituents, he said, "The Court is at the highest pitch of want and luxury, and the people are full of discontent." In a trial of two Quakers, Penn and Mead, at the Old Bailey, the recorder, among the rest, commended the Spanish Inquisition, saying, "it would never be well till we had something like it."<br><br>The king continued to raise money unscrupulously, by means of his courtiers and apostate patriots. He bought them up by bribes of thousands of pounds. But Marvell was not to be bought. His satires upon the Court and its parasites were published. They were read by all classes, from the king to the tradesman. The king determined to win him over. He was threatened, he was flattered, he was thwarted, he was caressed, he ws beset with spies, he was waylaid by ruffians, and courted by beauties. But no Delilah could discover the secret of his strength. His integrity was proof alike against danger and against corruption. Against threats and bribes, pride is the ally of principle. In a Court which held no man to be honest, and no woman chaste, this soft sorcery was cultivated to perfection; but Marvell, revering and respecting himself, was proof against its charms.<br><br>It has been said that Lord Treasurer Danby, thinking to buy over his old school-fellow, called upon Marvell in his garret. At parting, the Lord Treasurer slipped into his hand an order on the Treasurer for 1,000 pounds, and then went to his chariot. Marvell, looking at the paper, calls after the Treasurer, "My lord, I request another moment." They went up again to the garret, and Jack, the servant boy, was called. "Jack, child, what had I for dinner yesterday?" "Don't you remember, sir? you had a little shoulder of mutton that you ordered me to bring from a woman in the market." "Very right, child. What have I for dinner to-day?" "Don't you know, sir, that you bid me lay by the blade-bone to broil?" "Tis so: very right, child; go away." "My lord," said Marvell, turning to the Treasurer, "do you hear that? Andrew Marvell's dinner is provided; there's your piece of paper. I want it not. I knew the sort of kindness you intended. I live here to serve my constituents; the Ministry may seek men for their purpose; I am not one."<br><br>Marvell conducted himself nobly to the end. He remained unimpeachable in his character. He was the true representative of his constituents. Though not poor, his mode of living was simple and frugal. In July 1678 he visited his constituents for the last time. Shortly after his return to London, without any previous illness or visible decay, he expired. Some say he died from poison. That may not be true. But certainly he died an honest man. He always preserved his purity. He ever defended the right. He was "beloved by good men; feared by bad; imitated by few; and scarce paralleled by any." These are the words on his tombstone at Hull.<br><br>Ben Johnson, like Marvell, was sturdy and plain-spoken. When Charles I. sent that brave poet a tardy and slight gratuity during his poverty and sickness, Ben sent back the money, with the message - "I suppose he sends me this because I live in an alley: tell him his soul lives in an alley."<br><br>Goldsmith also was a man who would not be bought. He had known the depths of poverty. He had wandered over Europe, paying his way with his flute. He had slept in barns and under the open sky. He tried acting, ushering, doctoring. He starved amidst them all. Then he tried authorship, and became a gentleman. But he never quite escaped from the clutches of poverty. He described himself as "in a garret writing for bread, and expecting to be dunned for a milk score." One day Johnson received a message from Goldsmith, stating that he was in great distress. The Doctor went to see him, and found that his landlady had arrested him for his rent. The only thing he had to dispose of was a packet of manuscript. Johnson took it up, and found it to be the ' Vicar of Wakefield.' Having ascertained its merit, Johnson took it to a bookseller, and sold it for sixty ponds.*<br><br>( * Goethe records what a blessing this book had been to him. When at the age of eighty-one, standing on the brink of the grave, he told a friend that in the decisive moment of mental development, the ' Vicar of Wakefield ' had formed his education, and that he had recently read, with unabated delight, the charming book again from beginning to end, not a little affected by the lively recollection of how much he had been indebted to the author seventy years before. - Forster.)<br><br>Poor though he was then, and poor though he was at the end of his life - for he died in debt - Goldsmith could not be bought. He refused to do dirty political work. About 50,000 pounds annually was then expended by Sir Robert Walpole in secret service money. Daily scribblers were suborned to write up the acts of the administration, and to write down those of their opponents. The country was deluged and disgraced by scurrilous libels. It was resolved to hire Goldsmith to take part in the fray. Dr. Scott, chaplain to Lord Sandwich, was deputed to negotiate with him. "I found him," says Dr. Scott, "in a miserable suite of chambers in the Temple. I told him my authority. I told how I was empowered to pay for his exertions; and, would you believe it? - he was so absurd as to say, ' I can earn as much as will supply my wants without writing for any party; the assistance you offer is therefore unnecessary to me' ; and so I left him in his garret!"<br><br>Thus did poor and noble Goldsmith spurn the wages of unrighteousness! He preferred using his pen to write the famous tale of ' Goody Two Shoes ' for the amusement of children, rather than become the hack pamphleteer of political prostitutes.<br><br>Pulteney, the leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons, having in one of his speeches made a Latin quotation, was corrected by Sir Robert Walpole, who offered a wager of a guinea on the inaccuracy of the lines. The bet was accepted, the classic was referred to, and Pulteney was found to be right. The minister threw a guinea across the table, and Pulteney, on taking it up, called the House to witness that this was the first guinea of the public money he had ever put into his pocket! The very coin thus lost and won is preserved in the British Museum, as "The Pulteney Guinea."<br><br>When Pitt, Earl of Chatham, was appointed Paymaster to the Forces, he refused to take one farthing beyond the salary which the law had annexed to his office. In times of peace, the pay-master was allowed to keep a large sum to his credit, amounting perhaps to several hundred thousand pounds; and he might appropriate the interest upon this sum to his own use. But Chatham refused all this advantage. He also declined the Vails or bribes offered to him by foreign princes in the pay of England, and which amounted to a large sum annually. His character was as honourable and disinterested as were his pecuniary transactions.<br><br>William Pitt, the great Commoner, was equally true. He considered money as dirt beneath his feet, compared with the public interest and public esteem. His hands were clean. While the contest between himself and the Opposition under Fox was raging, the Clerkship of the Rolls fell vacant. It was a sinecure place for life, with three thousand a year. Everybody knew that Pitt was poor, and it was thought that he would appoint himself. Nobody would have blamed him. It was unsual to do so at that time. But he gave the appointment to Colonel Barre, a poor blind friend; and thus saved the pension which a previous administration had conferred upon him.<br><br>Everybody comprehended Pitt's disinterestedness. He was libelled, maligned, and abused. Though millions were passing through his hands, his bitterest enemies did not dare to accuse him of touching unlawful gain. When the richest people in the land were soliciting him for dukedoms, marquisates, and garters, he himself spurned them out of his way. He had almost a supreme contempt for money, and the consideration that money gives. Pitt was the magnanimous man so finely described by Aristotle in the ' Ethics,' who thought himself worthy of great things, being in truth worthy. Nothing did more to raise his character than his noble poverty.<br><br>It is related of Chamillard, the great French advocate, that he pleaded a case unsuccessfully, and all because an important document had not been produced. The judge's decision was reported to parliament, and was confirmed. There was now no appeal. The suitor called upon Chamillard, and deplored the loss of his fortune. He averred that it had occurred through Chamillard not having referred to an important document, the foundation of his case. Chamillard protested that he had not seen the document. The client insisted that it had been handed to him with the other papers. At length Chamillard opened his bag, searched, and found the document. He found that the case would have been won, had it been produced and read; but there was no appeal. The advocate took his course on the instant. He told the suitor to call upon him next morning. He gathered together all the money that he could find, and on his client calling next day, he handed the whole over to him, although it involved the loss of his fortune. In this way did he maintain his respect for himself. He did his strict duty, though it cost him so much. He not only did this; he called upon the president of the court; and begged him not to charge him again in any report to parliament. For he held himself a suspect after this great fault, although he had so nobly repaired it.<br><br>Sir Arthur Wellesley (afterwards Duke of Wellington) was offered a large sum of money by the prime minister of the Court of Hyderabad, for the purpose of ascertaining what advantages had been reserved for his prince after the battle of Assaye. Sir Arthur looked at him quietly for a few seconds, and said, "It appears, then, that you are capable of keeping a secret?" "Yes, certainly." "Then so am I," said the English General. He refused the offer, and bowed the minister out. The Rajah of Kittoor afterwards offered him, through his minister, a bribe of 10,000 pagodas for certain advantages. The bribe was indignantly refused, and the General said, "Inform the Rajah that I and all the British officers consider such offers as insults, by whomsoever they are made."<br><br>His noble relative, the Marquis of Wellesley, in like manner, refused a present of 100,000 pounds offered to him by the directors of the East India Company. Nothing could prevail upon him to accept it. "It is not necessary," he said, "for me to allude to the independence of my character, and the proper dignity attaching to my office....I think of nothing but our army. I should be much distressed to curtail the share of those brave soldiers." Sir Charles Napier exhibited the same self-denial while in India. "Certainly," he said, "I could have got 30,000 pounds since my coming to Scinde, but my hands do not want washing yet. Our dear father's sword is unstained."<br><br>Sir James Outram was generous and unselfish to a degree. While a junior captain in India he was offered the command of the troops about to be assembled against the insurgents of Mahi Kanta. He declined the honour in favour of a friend very much his senior. He felt it his duty to point out that the appointment of so junior an officer might give umbrage in quarters where unanimity was necessary. The senior officer on the spot was almost the senior captain in the army. He said, "The qualifications of the officer are far superior to mine. I willingly stake my humble reputation on his conduct. Associated with him, as I presume I shall be, in the duty, while his will be the honour of success, mine will be the blame of defeat, in measures of which I am the proposer. But the commander-in-chief could not accept his suggestion. The offer was renewed and at last accepted.<br><br>When the Scinde prize-money was distributed amongst the officers and soldiers, Outram refused to accept for his own purposes the 3000 pounds to which he was entitled as a major. He refused, he said, to accept a rupee of the booty resulting from the policy which he opposed. He distributed the whole amount in charitable objects. Among the other recipients were Dr. Duff's Indian missionary schools. He also gave 800 pounds to the Hill School Asylum at Kussowlee. Lady Lawrence afterwards wrote to him, "Your benefaction is not the less acceptable, because it comes in the form of allegiance to what we believe to be a righteous cause."<br><br>Advantage to himself was what Sir James Outram never thought of, and money was literally nothing to him, except when he could make it helpful to others. There never was a man more entirely simple and free from all self-consciousness. The more his life is studied in its details, the more it will be found how habitually he made a practice of esteeming others better than himself, of looking less at his own things and more at the things of others. His compassion, indeed, was boundless. It was this compassion, this faculty of seeing with other men's eyes, of thinking with other men's hearts - a faculty, the absence of which in our chief rulers brought us to our sorest straits in India - which made Outram so strenuous an opponent of injustice in all its forms.*<br><br>( * See ' Life of Outram,' by Sir F. J. Goldsmid.)<br><br>It is related of the great Lord Lawrence, that during the conduct of some important case for a young Indian Rajah, the prince endeavoured to place in his hands, under the table, a bag of rupees. "Young man," said Lawrence, "you have offered to an Englishman the greatest insult which he could possibly receive. This time, in consideration of your youth, I excuse it. Let me warn you by this experience, never again to commit so gross an offence against an English gentleman."<br><br>It is by the valour and honesty of such men that the Empire of India has been maintained. They have toiled at their duty, often at the risk of their lives. At the time of the Indian Mutiny, many men, until then comparatively unknown, came rapidly to the front - such men as Havelock, Neil, Nicholson, Outram, Clyde, Inglis, Edwardes, and Lawrence. The very name of Lawrence represented power in the North-West Provinces. The standard of duty of both brothers was of the highest. The first, John - Iron John, as he was called - and the second Henry, innspired a loving and attached spirit to those who were about them. It was declared of the former that his character alone was worth an army. Colonel Edwards said of both brothers - "They sketched a faith, and begot a school, which are both living things at this day."<br><br>At the time at which the Indian Mutiny broke out, Sir John was Chief Commissioner of the Punjaub. The country which he governed had just been conquered by the English. He governed his new province well and wisely. He trusted the people about him, and made them his friends. And then he did what is perhaps unexampled in history. He sent away the whole of the Punjaub native troops, to assist the English army at Delhi, leaving himself without any force to protect him. The result proved that he was right. The Sikhs and Punjaubees proved faithful. Delhi was taken, and India was saved. All this depended on the personal character of John Lawrence. The words which his brother, Sir Henry, desired to be put upon his tomb, modestly describe his life and character - "Here lies Henry Lawrence, who tried to do his Duty!"<br><br>Men of science have displayed the same self-sacrifice. When Sir Humphry Davy, after great labour, invented his safety lamp for the purpose of mitigating the danger to colliers working in inflammable gas, he would not take out a patent for it, but made it over to the public. A friend said to him, "You might as well have securd this invention by a patent, and received your five or ten thousand a year for it." "No, my good friend," said Davy; "I never thought of such a thing: my sole object was to serve the cause of humanity. I have enough for all my views and purposes. More wealth might distract my attention from my favourite pursuits. More wealth could not increase either my fame or my happiness. It might undoubtedly enable me to put four horses to my carriage; but what would it avail me to have it said that Sir Humphry drives his carriage and four?"<br><br>It was the same with his follower Faraday. He worked for science alone. He was as imaginative as he was scientific. Every new fact won by his intelligence resolved itself into a centre of greater mysteries. He was no materialist. His philosophy was at once a protest against scientific dogmatism and religious sectarianism. He was humble in his knowledge, and worked in the spirit of a child - wondering at the revelations of truth which dawned upon him. "That ozone, that oxygen," he said, "which makes up more than half the weight of the world, what a wonderful thing it is; and yet I think we only at the beginning of a knowledge of its wonders."<br><br>Faraday was satisfied to be a comparatively poor man. He did not work for money. Had he done so he would have made a large fortune. He patented nothing, but made all his discoveries over to the public. He nobly resisted the temptation of money-making - though in his case it was no temptation - but preferred to follow the path of pure science. He was emphatically a finder-out of facts; and often they startled him. "These things," he said, "are unaccountable at present; they show us that, with all our knowledge, we know little as yet of that which may afterwards become known." The words remind us of one of the last sayings of Isaac Newton.<br><br>At a meeting of the Royal Institution, when Professor Tyndall presented Dr. Hoffman with the Faraday medal - the highest token of recognition which the Society had it in its power to bestow - he mentioned a touching example of Faraday's kindness. A young student at Edinburgh (in fact, Samuel Brown, afterwards M.D.), who was engaged in a bewildering study about matter and atoms, submitted his conjectures to the greatest chemist of the day. Overwhelmed as Faraday then was with work, he answered not with neglect or with cheap flattery. He wrote to the unknown youth as follows: - "I have no hesitation in advising you to experiment in support of your views, because, whether you confirm or confute them, good must come out of your experiments. With regard to the views themselves, I can say nothing of them except that they are useful in exciting the mind to inquiry. A very brief consideration of the progress of experimental philosophy will show you that it is a great disturber of preconceived theories. I have thought long and closely on the theories of attraction and of particles and atoms of matter, and the more I think, in association with experiments, the less distinct does my idea of an atom or a particle of matter become."<br><br>To turn to another subject - that of money-making. The fortunes of the house of Rothschild were based upon the honesty of their founder - Meyer Amschel or Anselm. He was born at Frankfort-on-the-Maine in 1743. His parents were Jews. What a frightful history might be written of the persecutions, tortures, and martyrdoms of the Jews in the Middle Ages, and even down to our own times. At Frankfort, as well as in other towns and cities in Germany, the Jews were compelled to resort to their quarters at a certain hour in the evening, under penalty of death. The Judengasse at Frankfort was shut in by gates, which were locked at night. Napoleon blew them down with cannon, one of the best things he ever did; yet the persecution of the Jews continued.<br><br>Young Anselm lost his parents at eleven, and had to fight his way through life alone. After a slight modicum of education - for Jews are always kind to each other - the boy had good fortune to find a place as clerk to a small banker and money-changer at Hanover. He returned to Frankfort in 1772, and established himself as a broker and money-lender. Over his shop he hung the sign of the Red Shield - in German, Rothschild. He collected ancient and rare coins, and among the amateurs who frequented his shop, was the Landgrave William, afterwards Elector of Hesse.<br><br>When Napoleon overran Europe, William of Hesse was driven from his States, and left all the money he could gather together in the hands of Anselm, his hot-agent. It amounted to 250,000 pounds. How to take care of this money and make it grow in his hands, was Anselm's greatest object. Money in those days was very dear; it returned twelve or even twenty per cent. on good security. The war went on. Russia was invaded by Napoleon. His army was all but lost in the snow. The battle of Leipsic was fought, and Napoleon and his army were hurled across the Rhine. The Landgrave of Hesse then returned to his States. A few days after, the eldest son of Meyer Anselm presented himself at court, and handed over to the Landgrave the three millions of florins which his father had taken care of. The Landgrave was almost beside himself with joy. He looked upon the restored money as a windfall. In his exultation, he knighted the young Rothschild at once. "Such honesty," his highness exclaimed, "had never been known in the world." At the Congress of Vienna, where he went shortly after, he could talk of nothing else than the honesty of the Rothschilds. Anselm had a large family. They followed his example, and thus the Rothschilds became the largest money-lenders in the world.*<br><br>( * The story is told at length by Frederick Martin in his ' Stories of Banks and Bankers.' )<br><br>Of the famous Lord Macaulay it may be said that he was a thoroughly incorruptible man. Among the men with whom he was brought up - Wilberforce, Henry Thornton, and Zachary Macaulay - he could hardly fail to become a patriotic and disinterested man. When he was only earning two hundred a year by his pen, the Rev. Sydney Smith, not given to overpraise, said of him, "I believe that Macaulay is incorruptible. You might lay ribbons, stars, garters, wealth, titles, before him in vain. He has an honest, genuine love of his country, and the world could not bribe him to neglect her interests."*<br><br>( * Sydney Smith once said that he was never afraid to open his letter bag. He was uprightly conscientious. He had robbed nobody. If he had lost money, as he did by the Pennsylvanian repudiation, the crime did not lie at his door, but at that of his creditors.)<br><br>Macaulay so arranged his affairs that their management was to him a pastime, instead of being a source of annoyance and anxiety. His economical maxims were the simplest; to treat official and literary gains as capital, and to pay all debts within the twenty-four hours. "I think," he said, "that prompt payment is a moral duty; knowing, as I do, how painful it is to be deferred." "There is nothing," he said, "truer than Poor Richard's saw: ' We are taxed twice as heavily by our pride, as by the State.' " He early accustomed himself to a strict appropriation of his income, as the only sure ground on which to build a reputation for public and private integrity, and to maintain a dignified independence.<br><br>And yet he possessed but a slight competence. To Lord Lansdowne, who offered him a seat in the Council of India, he wrote as follows: - "Every day that I live, I become less and less desirous of great wealth. But every day makes me more sensible of the importance of a competence. Without a competence, it is not very easy for a public man to be honest; it is almost impossible for him to be thought so. I am so situated that I can subsist only in two ways: by being in office, and by my pen....The thought of becoming a bookseller's hack: of writing to relieve, not the fulness of the mind, but the emptiness of the pocket; of spurring a jaded fancy to reluctant exertion; of filling sheets with trash, merely that the sheets may be filled; of bearing from publishers and editors what Dryden bore from Thomson, and what, to my knowledge, Mackintosh bore from Lardner, is horrible to me. Yet thus it must be if I should quit office. Yet to hold office merely for the sake of emolument would be more horrible still."<br><br>The result was that Macaulay obtained and filled an honourable office in India, and returned with a sufficient competence to be enabled to write his famous ' History of England.'<span class="small"></span><span class="small"></span></div>

Hope you will enjoy your stay here.<br><br><strong>Kiseki</strong> wrote:<br><br><strong>"this thread made me want to log in to my account and post (: so here i am !"</strong><br><br>I'm glad to hear that Kiseki. The motivational and inspirational thread is for you and the others within Singapore Forums.<br><br><strong>Kiseki</strong> wrote:<br><br><strong>"sometimes i feel people are so busy with their own lives, they take too quick steps, and end up forgetting to just stop for a moment and take in the beautiful things around them . we forget how lucky we are, we forget the people that we care for, we forget the people who care about us, we dont see there are so many others out there who are living it far worse off than us . we only see our own problems, our own miseries, and wallow in these unhappy thoughts."</strong><br><br>I agree with you. I didn't stop to look at those people who loved and cared for me until the day I left Singapore on 20th August 1992. When the plane took off from Changi International Airport, I felt a man without any past and I didn't know when I was coming back to Singapore.<br><br>While in Indonesia from August 1992 to 29th December 1995, when I was travelling throughout Java, Eastern Sumatera and finally settled down in Bali in December 1992, I began to review my life and my heart was in pain seeing what I had done to those who had looked up at me, loved and cared for me. I can say my life in Indonesia was to really do some soul searching to understand about myself and my life.<br><br>Then from January 1996 to December 2002, I had a continuation of my life review again and I was really stopped this time and I had to listen to my heart again. Like a man without any more world to look at but his past life and mistakes, I had to review my life over and over again, until I learned and changed like a man who has to be reborn again into the world and with motive to do something good for a change for himself and others.<br><br><strong>Kiseki </strong>wrote:<br><br><strong>"sometimes i wish time would stop for a while, and give us this chance to look around and appreciate what we have, and to let the people you care and who care about you know you love them."</strong><br><br>Thus one really changed when he or she is stopped to listen their heart and see his or her past actions; and the people in their lives and those around them? The answer to that question is Yes! I know because I've been there.<br><br><strong>Kiseki </strong>quoted:<br><br><strong>"life is all about love . love is all about communication . communication is all about listening . and listening is all about being there ."</strong><br><br>Yes, its about love and caring and compassion that makes many people wish to have a better life and also to help others who wish to be loved. That is a maxim you cannot deny is really true.<br><br>Thanks again Kiseki.<br><br>With Love,<br>Joe</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thought I share this article that I've received in my Yahoo email address.<br><br>Joe<br><br><strong>"When you're down to nothing, God is up to something."<br><br>This is beautiful! Try not to cry.<br><br>She jumped up as soon as she saw the surgeon come out of the operating room. She said: "How is my little boy ? Is he going to be all right ? When can I see him ?"<br><br>The surgeon said, "I'm sorry. We did all we could, but your boy didn't make it."<br><br>Sally said, "Why do little children get cancer ? Doesn't God care any more ? Where were you, God, when my son needed you ?"<br><br>The surgeon asked, "Would you like some time alone with your son ? One of the nurses will be out in a few minutes, before he's transported to the university."<br><br>Sally asked the nurse to stay with her while she said good bye to her son. She ran her fingers lovingly through his thick red curly hair. "Would you like a lock of his hair ?" the nurse asked.<br><br>Sally nodded yes. The nurse cut a lock of the boy's hair, put it in a plastic bag and handed it to Sally.<br><br>The mother said, "It was Jimmy's idea to donate his body to the University for Study. He said it might help somebody else. "I said no at first, but Jimmy said, 'Mom, I won't be using it after I die. Maybe it will help some other little boy spend one more day with his Mom." She went on, "My Jimmy had a heart of gold. Always thinking of someone else. Always wanting to help others if he could."<br><br>Sally walked out of Children's Mercy Hospital for the last time, after spending most of the last six months there. She put the bag with Jimmy's belongings on the seat beside her in the car.<br><br>The drive home was difficult. It was even harder to enter the empty house. She carried Jimmy's belongings, and the plastic bag with the lock of his hair to her son's room.<br><br>She started placing the model cars and other personal things back in his room exactly where he had always kept them. She laid down across his bed and, hugging his pillow, cried herself to sleep.<br><br>It was around midnight when Sally awoke. Laying beside her on the bed was a folded letter. The letter said :<br><br>"Dear Mom, I know you're going to miss me; but don't think that I will ever forget you, or stop loving you, just 'cause I'm not around to say "I Love You" . I will always love you, Mom, even more with each day. Someday we will see each other again. Until then, if you want to adopt a little boy so you won't be so lonely, that's okay with me. He can have my room and old stuff to play with. But, if you decide to get a girl instead, she probably wouldn't like the same things us boys do. You'll have to buy her dolls and stuff girls like, you know. Don't be sad thinking about me. This really is a neat place. Grandma and Grandpa met me as soon as I got here and showed me around some, but it will take a long time to see everything. The angels are so cool. I love to watch them fly. And, you know what? Jesus doesn't look like any of his pictures. Yet, when I saw Him, I knew it was Him. Jesus himself took me to see GOD ! And guess what, Mom ? I got to sit on God's knee and talk to Him, like I was somebody important. That's when I told Him that I wanted to write you a letter, to tell you good bye and everything. But I already knew that wasn't allowed. Well, you know what Mom ? God handed me some paper and His own personal pen to write you this letter. I think Gabriel is the name of the angel who is going to drop this letter off to you. God said for me to give you the answer to one of the questions you asked Him 'Where was He when I needed him ?' "God said He was in the same place with me, as when His son Jesus was on the cross. He was right there, as He always is with all His children. Oh, by the way, Mom, no one else can see what I've written except you. To everyone else this is just a blank piece of paper. Isn't that cool ? I have to give God His pen back now. He needs it to write some more names in the Book of Life. Tonight I get to sit at the table with Jesus for supper. I'm sure the food will be great.<br><br>Oh, I almost forgot to tell you. I don't hurt anymore. The cancer is all gone. I'm glad because I couldn't stand that pain anymore and God couldn't stand to see me hurt so much, either. That's when He sent The Angel of Mercy to come get me. The Angel said I was a Special Delivery ! How about that ? </strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span class="large">DUTY</span></strong><br><br>By Samuel Smiles<br><br><span class="large">CHAPTER THREE</span><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><span class="large">HONESTY - TRUTH</span></strong></span><br><br>Honesty and truthfulness go well together. Honesty is truth, and truth is honesty. Truth alone may not constitute a great man, but it is the most important element of a great character. It gives security to those who employ him, and confidence to those who serve under him. Truth is the essence of principle, integrity, and independence. It is the primary need of every man. Absolute veracity is more needed now than at any former period in our history.<br><br>Lying, common though it be, is denounced even by the liar himself. He protests that he is speaking the truth, for he knows that truth is universally respected, whilst lying is universally condemned. Lying is not only dishonest, but cowardly. "Dare to be true," said George Herbert; "nothing can ever need a lie." The most mischievous liars are those who keep on the verge of truth. They have not the courage to speak out the fact, but go round about it, and tell what is really untrue. A lie which is half the truth is the worst of lies.<br><br>There is a duplicity of life which is quite as bad as verbal falsehood. Actions have as plain a voice as words. The mean man is false to his profession. He evades the truth that he professes to believe. He plays at double dealing. He wants sincerity and veracity. The sincere man speaks as he thinks, believes as he pretends to believe, acts as he professes to act, and performs as he promises.<br><br>"Other forms of practical contradiction are common," says Mr. Spurgeon; "some are intolerantly liberal; others are ferocious advocates for peace, or intemperate on intemperance. We have known pleaders for generosity who were themselves miserably stingy. We have heard of persons who have been wonderful sticklers for 'the truth' - meaning thereby a certain form of doctrine - and yet they have not regarded the truth in matters of buying and selling or with regard to the reputations of their neighbours, or the incidents of domestic life."*<br><br>(* ' The Bible and the Newspaper,' 1878 )<br><br>Lying is one of the most common and conventional of vices. It prevails in what is called "society." Not at home is the fashionable mode of reply to a visitor. Lying is supposed to be so necessary to carry on human affairs that it is tacitly agreed to. One lie may be considered harmless, another slight, another unintended. Little lies are common. However tolerated, lying is more or less loathsome to every pure-minded man or woman. "Lies," says Ruskin, "may be light and accidental, but they are an ugly soot from the smoke of the pit, and it is better that our hearts should be swept clean of them, without our care as to which is largest or blackset."<br><br>"Lying abroad for the benefit of one's country" used to be the maxim of the diplomatist. Yet a man should care more for his word than for his life. When Regulus was sent by the Carthaginians, whose prisoner he was, to Rome, with a convoy of ambassadors to sue for peace, it was under the condition that he should return to his prison if peace were not effected. He took the oath, and swore that he would come back.<br><br>When he appeared at Rome he urged the senators to persevere in the war, and not to agree to the exchange of prisoners. That involved his return to captivity at Carthage. The senators, and even the chief priest, held that as his oath had been wrested from him by force, he was not bound to go. "Have you resolved to dishonour me?" asked Regulus. "I am not ignorant that death and tortures are preparing for me; but what are these to the shame of an infamous action, or the wounds of a guilty mind? Slave as I am to Carthage, I have still the spirit of a Roman. I have sworn to return. It is my duty to go. Let the gods take care of the rest." Regulus returned to Carthage, and died under torture.<br><br>"Let him that would live well," said Plato, "attain to truth, and then, and not before, he will cease from sorrow." Let us also cite a passage from the Emperor Marcus Aurelius: "He who acts unjustly acts impiously; for since the universal nature has made rational animals for the sake of one another, to help one another according to their deserts, but in no way to injure one another, he who transgresses his will is clearly guilty of impiety towards the highest divinity. And he, too, that lies is guilty of impiety to the same divinity, from the universal nature of all things that are; and all things that are have a relation to all things that come into existence. And further, this universal nature is named Truth, and is the prime cause of all things that are true. He, then, who lies intentionally is guilty of impiety, inasmuch as he acts unjustly by deceiving; and he also who lies unintentionally, inasmuch as he is at variance with the universal nature, and inasmuch as he disturbs the order by fighting against the nature of the world; for he fights against it, who is moved of himself to that which is contrary to truth, for he has received powers from nature, through the neglect of which he is not able now to distinguish falsehood from truth. And, indeed, he who pursues pleasure as good, and avoids pain as evil, is guilty of impiety."*<br><br>(* 'Thoughts of Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.' Translated by George Long, M.A.' pp.144-5.)<br><br>Truth and honesty show themselves in various ways. They characterize the men of just dealing, the faithful men of business, the men who do not deceive you to their own advantage. Honesty is the plainest and humblest manifestation of the principle of truth. Full measures, just weights, true samples, full service, strict fulfilment of engagements, are all indispensable to men of character.<br><br>Take a common case. Sam Foote had reason to complain of the shortness of the beer served to him at dinner. He called the landlord, and said to him: "Pray, sir, how many butts of beer do you draw in a month?" "Ten, sir," replied the publican "And would you like to draw eleven if your could?" "Certainly, sir." "Then I will tell you how," said Foote: " fill your measure! "<br><br>But the case goes farther than this. We complain of short weights and adulteration of goods. We buy one thing and get another. But goods must sell; if with a profit, so much the better. If the dealer is found out, the customer goes elsewhere. M. Le Play, when he visited England many years ago, observed with great pleasure the commercial probity of English manufacturers. "They display," he said, "a scrupulous exactitude in the quantity and quality of their foreign consignments."<br><br>Could he say the same now? Have we not heard in public courts of the depreciation of our manufactures - of cotton loaded with china clay, starch, magnesium, and zinc? We have seen the loading, and therefore know what it is. The cotton becomes mildewed, discoloured, and therefore unsaleable. The mildew is a fungus which, when developed by moisture, lives and grows upon the starch. China was one of the many marts for English-made cotton. But when the mildew appeared, the trade vanished.<br><br>There is a Chinese proverb to the effect that, "the conjuror does not deceive the man who beats the gong for him." The Chinaman is as great a deceiver as we are. He puts iron filings into his tea, and water into his silk. He is therefore quite awake to the deceptions of others. "The consequence is," says the British Consul at Cheefoo, "that our textiles have got a bad name, and their place is being supplied by American manufacturers. American drills, though forty per cent, dearer, are driving English drills out of the market." We are no longer trusted. The English brand used to be a guarantee of honesty. It is so no longer.<br><br>It is the same in India. The English cotton won't wash. When the clay and starch are rinsed out, it becomes a rag. The Indians grow cotton. The Indians are clever workmen, with ingenious, subtle fingers. They can spin an even thread as well as the workwomen of Manchester. Capital has accumulated in India; mills have been built; and the Indians now manufacture for themselves.<br><br>All this is well known in the manufacturing districts. It is spoken of at public meetings. Sizing, and starching, and loading cotton cloth with China clay, is known everywhere. Mr. Mellor, M.P., denounced the deception of the adulterating manufacturers. They seem to believe that the consuming inhabitants of the globe are all fools excepting themselves. He mentioned the case of an engineer, who, in crossing the Indian Ocean, was decorating his turban with muslin. "Is that English?" he was asked. "No; it is from Switzerland. The English makes my fingers stick - it is gummy." This is how we are losing our trade. This is how we are encountering bad times.<br><br>American cotton goods sell in London, Manchester, and elsewhere, at a fair profit. Indian cotton goods sell in China and Australia; though Bombay twist sells at a higher price than English yarns. The local cotton manufacture of India is now equal to the whole home and foreign production of Manchester. Is not this a startling fact? We are now giving our artisans technical education. What will technical education do against wholesale cheating and lying? A young woman buys a reel of cotton marked 250 yards. When she works it out with her skin and bone, she finds it to contain only 175 yards. What can she think of the truthfulness of her countrymen?<br><br>The deterioration of the standard of public men, of public morality, and of political principles, is undeniable. When Baron Dupin visited England, about sixty years ago, he observed with admiration the courage, the intelligence, and the activity of our commercial men. "It is not alone the courage, the intelligence, the activity of the manufacturer or merchant which maintain the superiority of the productions and commerce of their country; it is far more their wisdom, their economy, and, above all, their probity. If ever, in the British Islands, the useful citizen should lose these virtues, we may be sure that for England, as well as for any other country, notwithstanding the protection of the most formidable navy, notwithstanding the foresight and activity of diplomacy the most extended, and of political science the most profound, the vessels of a degenerate commerce, repulsed from every shore, would speedily disappear from those seas whose surface they now cover with the treasures of the universe, bartered for the treasures of the industry of the Three Kingdoms."*<br><br>(* ' The Commercial Power of Great Britain,' vol. i., Introduction, p.xi.)<br><br>The employer is not only grievously hindered by the law; he is still more grievously hindered by strikes. When trade seems to improve, the men turn out and strike for more wages. Mills are closed, iron-furnaces are damped out, building ceases, and everything is at a standstill. We throw our means and opportunities away; and the foreigner thrives upon our recklessness. It is more than unfortunate - it is ruinous - that workmen should consider their employers as their born enemies.<br><br>But what of the quality of the work done by the workmen? Time was when men threw their heart and soul into their work - when they took pride in the quality of their work - in doing that which Chaucer describes when he says - work "must be done at leisure, parfaitlie." But what have we now? Work done scampingly - without skill, without conscience, without industry. Because of this, tunnels fall in, iron bridges give way, and buildings tumble down. Houses are left half finished, drains are left untrapped, and disease speads abroad. O careless, thoughtless British workmen! What lives you have taken, what families you have made desolate! So that your work is done, you care not how it is done. You have not put your best into it; you have not put yourself into it. The work is done anyhow, so that it may pass muster. All this dishonest and dishonourable. Poor British workman! It is not altogether your own fault. You have been brought up without knowledge. You have been educated without sympathy. You thought the world was against you, whilst it has often sympathized with you.<br><br>All bad work is lying. It is thoroughly dishonest. You pay for having work done well; it is done badly and dishonestly. It may be varnished over with a fair show of sufficiency, but the sin is not discovered until it is too late. So long as these things continue, it is in vain to talk of the dignity of labour, or of the social value of the so-called working man. There can be no dignity of labour where there is no truthfulness of work. "Dignity does not consist in hollowness and in light-handedness, but in substantiality and in strength. If there be flimsiness and superficiality of all kinds apparent in the work of the present day more than in the work of our forefathers, whence comes it? From eagerness and competition, and the haste to be rich."*<br><br>(* F.R. Conder. C.E..in 'Good Words.' )<br><br>Even the Polynesians have found us out. When Bishop Patteson was voyaging among the South Sea Islands on his mission of mercy, he found that the natives refused to by our goods. "A mere Brummagem article," he said, "that won't stand wear, is quite valueless in their eyes. Whatever is given to them, be it cheap or dear, though it cost but a shilling, must be good of its kind. For example, a rough-handles, single-blade knife, bought for a shilling, they fully appreciate; but a knife with half-a-dozen blades they would almost throw away." So Dr. Livingstone found that the natives of Africa refused to buy English iron, because it was "rotten."<br><br>Socrates explained how useful and excellent a thing it was that a man should resolve on perfection in his own line, so that, if he be a carpenter, he will be the best possible carpenter; or if a statesman, that he will be the best possible statesman. It is by such means that true success is achieved. Such a carpenter, Socrates said, would win the wreath of carpentering, though it was only a shavings.<br><br>Take the case of Wedgwood, who had the spirit of the true worker. Though risen from the ranks, he was never satisfied until he had done his best. He looked especially to the quality of his work, to the purposes it would serve, and to the appreciation of it by others. This was the source of his power and success. He would tolerate no inferior work. If it did not come up to his idea of what it should be, he would take up his stick, break the vessel, and throw it away, saying, "This won't do for Josiah Wedgwood."<br><br>Of course he took the greatest care to ensure perfection, as regarded geometrical proportions, glaze, form, and ornament. He pulled down kiln after kiln to effect some necessary improvement. He learnt perfection through repeated failures. He invented and improved almost every tool used in his works. He passed much of his time at the bench beside his workmen, instructing them individually. How he succeeded, his works will show.<br><br>Another instance of true honesty and courage may be mentioned in the case of a great contractor. We mean Thomas Brassey. Even when scamping was common, he was always true to his word and work. The Barentin viaduct of twenty-seven arches was nearly completed, when, loaded with wet after a heavy fall of rain, the whole building tumbled down. The casualty involved a loss of 30,000 pounds. The contractor was neither morally nor legally responsible. He had repeated protested against the material used in the structure, and the French lawyers maintained that his protest freed him from liability. But Mr. Brassey was of a different opinion. He had contracted, he said, to make and maintain the road, and no law should prevent him from being as good as his word. The viaduct was rebuilt at Mr. Brassey's cost. His life is one of the hightest examples we can offer to this generation.<br><br>We have had good times and bad times; but the result is always the same. We take little thought for the future. We only economize when we have no more money to spend upon selfish gratifications. An employer at Bradford recently said: - Some five or six years ago, we were in a state of great commercial prosperity. It almost carried the trading classes off their heads. People were becoming rapidly rich, and so bent were they on amassing money, that they seemed to think there would be no end to it. The working classes joined in the prosperity, and they lost their heads as well as those above them. They struck for higher wages, and for a time they got what they desired. They limited production, and urged that the fewer hours they worked, the more money they would get for their labour, and the better they would be off. But then came the period of depression, and no efforts of strikes or unions could stave it off. He urged upon the workmen that if they wished to see a return to better times, they must honestly and faithfully do their duty, and alter their present manner of doing slippery work, and doing as little as possible for their money.<br><br>At a conference of working men in Edinburgh, one of the speakers upheld the advantages of strikes. "My theory is," he said, "work as little as you possibly can, and get as high a wage as you possibly can." This theory, if worked out, would produce the entire demoralization of labour; it would make it idle, inefficient, and disloyal. Another speaker took an opposite view. He said: "The existence of unions for the purpose of striking was immoral in the extreme. The other day, he was going along a street in Edinburgh, when he met a man walking very slowly and easily along. A boy passing, said to him, 'You're taking it very easy the day.' 'It's my master's time,' said the man. The man, " he added, "had the idea forced into him that, by the striking system, the master's injury was their benefit; and the effect of the whole system was, that a piece of work well done could not be got."<br><br>It would be well if the working men could be got to see the position in which they actually stand. They are now competing with the working men all over the Continent and in America. It used to be supposed that the superiority of English labour would overcome all foreign competition. Whatever it may have once been, this is now an utter fallacy. The foreigners have all the advantages of our best machinery, with the latest improvements. They now manufacture machines for themselves. They have learned to work as fast and as well as English operatives. They work on Sunday and Saturday alike. In France they work 72 hours a week, while in this country they work only 56 hours a week. And the wages of the foreign artisans are about 25 per cent. less than those in England. The English work turned out is not so good and honest as that of France. How can we maintain competition in the face of these facts? The French and German cotton manufactures come into England free, while ours cannot get into French and German ports without high prohibitive duties. We have lost the monopoly of the trade, which we once possessed, and it is not likely that we can ever regain it. Our cotton trade will soon be confined to home supply; and if the articles are not made good and cheap, they will be driven out of use by the French and American fabrics. It will be the same with every other product.<br><br>Mr. Holyoake spoke in the right spirit when he rebuked the mistakes of unionism, and expressed his opinion - no doubt that of the elite of the working classes - as to the duty of sympathy and sincerity between master and man. "Recalling to my recollection," he said, "fourteen years' experience as a workman, I say now that were I secured wages for eight hours' daily labour, which would supply a moderate competence before the strength of life was spent, and were I left at liberty to produce the best work I could, so that my pride and taste and character should be in my handicraft, and I had a reasonable assurance of continuing in my situation while I discharged my duties in good faith, I should now prefer that state to any other. I should be the friend of the master; his fame would be my pride, his interests mine. He would have the care and the profit which is the honest due of care, and I should have content and leisure for learning and study."<br><br>This nation, no doubt, possesses the best material in the world. We have men who are willing to work, and able to work. But we want good work, not scamped work. We have strikers against receiving low wages; but we have no strikers against doing bad work. It is better work, not longer hours, that is wanted. It is dishonest and insincere labour that is discrediting English articles in all of the great markets of the world. "Work," again says Mr. Holyoake, "has small pleasure, because it has little pride. It ought to be impossible for employers to find men who will execute shabby work. It is a sort of crime against the hounour of industry, a fraud by connivance upon the purchaser. Nothing shows more plainly the state of honour in artisanship than the fact that we have all sorts of trade unions to come to the support of a man who refuses low wages, but not one union professedly to succour a man who refuses to do dishonest work." Let such a system continue, and all the science and art schools in the world could not maintain England as a great commercial country.<br><br>The same cry comes to us from America. The truth of the proverbial saying, "There is no God west of the Missouri," is everywhere manifest. The almighty dollar is the true divinity, and its worship is universal. A Sacramento paper says that "American are a money-loving and money-making people. They have no Queen or aristocracy to rule them; their aristocracy is money. The lust of wealth overrides every other consideration. Fraud in trade is the rule instead of the exception. We poison our provisions with adulteration. We even poison our drugs with cheaper materials. We sell shoddy for wool. We sell veneering for solid wood. We build wretched sheds of bad brick and bad mortar and green wood, and call them houses. We rob and cheat each other all round, in every trade and business, and we are all so bent on making money that we have not time to protest against the more palpable frauds, but console ourselves by going forth and swindling somebody else. We pay a very heavy price for our national idiosyncrasy. We are rapidly destroying our national sense of honesty and integrity. In those benighted and slavish countries which are ruled by monarchs, they contrive to live a great deal cheaper and a good deal better than we can. There, fraud is regarded as criminal, and the impostor, when detected is punished severely. But those are old fogey countries, who know nothing about liberty. They have no Fourth of July, no Wall Street, no codfish or shoddy aristocracies. They do not recognize the fact that the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness (which means money), entitles every man to cheat his neighbours, and bars redress."<br><br>Strange to say, the Americans are beginning to think that the badness of work, and the unwillingness to do good work, is, to a certain extent, the outcome of the common school system. Everybody is so well educated that he is above doing manual labour. There are no American apprentices, and no American servants. We do not speak without authority. A writer in Scribner's Monthly says that "the Americans make a god of their common school system. It is treason to speak a word against it. A man is regarded as a foe to education who expresses any doubt of the value of it. But we may as well open our eyes to the fact that in preparing men for the work of life, especially for that work depending on manual skill, it is a hindrance and a failure. It is mere smatter, veneering and cram."<br><br>The writer of the article says that the old system of apprenticeship has grown almost entirely into disuse. The boys are at school, and cannot be apprenticed to a trade. Hence most mechanical work is done by foreigners. The lad who has made a successful beginning of the cultivation of his intellect does not like the idea of getting a living by the skilful use of his hands in the common employments of life. He has no taste for bodily labour. He gets some light employment, or tries to live upon his wits.*<br><br>(* " If it is asked why there is not a universal effort made for the restoration of the apprentice system, we reply that there is a very ugly lion in the way. A piano-maker complained that he could not get men enough to do his work, the reason being that his men belonged to a Society that had taken upon itself to regulate the number of apprentices that he could be permitted to instruct in the business. They had limited the number to one, who was utterly insufficient to supply the demand, and the master was powerless. There was no other way open to him but to import his workmen, already instructed, from abroad. In brief, there is a comspiracy amongst Society men all over the country, to keep American boys out of the useful trades, and industrial education is thus under the band of an outrageous system, which ought to be put down by the strong hand of the law. It is thus seen that, while the common school naturally turns the great multitudes of its attendants away from manual employments, those who still feel inclined to enter upon them have no freedom to do so, because a great army of Society men stand firmly in the way, overruling employers and employed alike." - Scribner's Monthly Illustrated Magazine for March 1880. )<br><br>So said Longfellow. The village smithy stands there no longer. When General Armstrong, of the coloured college of Hampton, went to the north in search of blacksmiths, he found no Americans to engage. Every blacksmith was an Irishman. And in the next generation of Irishmen, every boy will be so well educated that he will not put his hands to any bodily labour. A New York clergyman possessing a large family, to correct this spreading influence, recently declared fron his pulpit that he intended that every lad of his family should learn some mechanical employment, by which, on an emergency, he might get a living. Rich and poor should alike be taught to work, skilfully if possible; for it is quite as likely that the rich will become poor, as that some of the poor will become rich; and that is a poor education which fails to prepare a man to take care of himself and his dependants throughout life.<br><br>We have lately been complaining of the badness of trade, but has not much of it happened through our own misdoing? In the arithmetic of the counting-house, two and two do not always make four. How many tricks are resorted to - in which honesty forms no part - for making money faster than others! Instead of working patiently and well for a modest living, many desire to get rich all at once. The spirit of the age is not that of a trader, but of a gambler. The pace is too fast to allow of any one stopping to inquire as to those who have fallen out by the way. They press on; the race for wealth is for the swift. Their faith is in money. It needs no prophet to point out the connexion of our distress with the sin of commercial gambling and fraud, and of social extravagance and vanity, of widespread desolation and misery.<br><br>"My son," said a father, "ye're gawn out into t'warld: ye may be wranged; but if it comes to that, chet rather then be cheted." Another said, "Make money - honestly, if you can; but if not, make it." A third said, "Honesty is better than dishonesty; I've tried both." Of course we quote these phrases as being at utter variance with truth and honesty. But it is to be doubted whether higher principles of conduct prevail in many of the commercial classes of life. A young man begins business. He goes on slowly yet safely. His gains may be small, but they are justly come by. "A faithful man shall abound with blessings; but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent: he hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty may come upon him."<br><br>In large commercial towns, young men are amazed at the splendour of the leaders of trade. They are supposed to be enormously rich. Every door opens to them. They command the highest places in society. They give balls, parties, and dinners. Their houses are full of wine of the choicest vintage. Their conversation is not great; it is mostly about wine, horses, or prices. They seem to sail upon the golden sea of a great accumulated fortune.<br><br>Young business men are often carried away by such examples. If they have not firmness and courage, they are apt to follow in their footsteps. The first speculation may be a gain. The gain may be followed by another and they are carried off their feet by the lust for wealth. They become dishonest and unscrupulous. Their bills are all over the discount market. To keep up their credit they spend more money upon pictures, and even upon charities. Formerly, greedy and unjust men seized the goods of others by violence. To-day, they obtain them by fraudulent bankruptcies. Formerly, every attempt was open; to-day, everything is secret, until at length the last event comes, and everything is exposed. The man fails; the bills are worthless; the pictures are sold; and the recreant flies to avoid the curses of his creditors.<br><br>In one bankruptcy case, over 39,000 pounds were stated in the accounts as expenses for orphanages and charities! "I have the authority of the accountant," said a speaker at a meeting of the creditors, "for stating that for four or five years this firm has been purchasing goods to an enormous extent, and flooding the eastern markets, when they were hopelessly insolvent, carrying on a reckless, I will say a gambling, trade for financial purposes, or, in common parlance, to 'raise the wind.' The munificent charity of an insolvent estate appears to me ghastly. It reminds me of a remark of our bishop, that there are some men amongst us who build churches out of part of their ungodly gains to pave their way to heaven."<br><br>Who has not heard of the failure of banks originating in gambling and fraud, with the result of lost fortunes and family reverses amongst all classes of shareholders? Schiller says, "It is daring to embezzle a million, but it is great beyond measure to steal a crown: the sin seems to lessen as the guilt increases." Yet the embezzlement of millions has not been thought extraordinary of recent years. Money has been taken from bank deposits to buy up railway shares, or to buy land in some remote colony, the speculation for a rise often ending in a ruinous fall. Then "the bank broke" and the downfall came, ending in ruin and desolation to a thousand homes. Men have been driven insane, and women have prayed to be delivered from their lives.<br><br>"Pity us, God! there are five of us here,<br>With threescore years on the youngest head,<br>Five of us sitting in sorrow and fear -<br>Well for our widowed one she is dead.<br><br>Could they not wait a while? we will not keep them long;<br>We could live on so little, too, cheerful and brave,<br>But to leave the old house, where old memories throng,<br>For the Poorhouse! oh, rather the peace of the grave!" *<br><br>(* Dr. Walter C. Smith, the author of these lines, appeared at a meeting at Edinburgh, and said that "he had received a large number of letters on the subject of the bank failure, and one class of correspondents asked him how he could be ' a converted man' seeing that he was making so much ado about filthy lucre. The present calamity unhappily involved a great deal of distress to his fellow-men, and for his own part he had no great sympathy with a religion which had so little sympathy with the sufferings of their brethren. He felt ashamed that such frauds should have been committed among them by men of trust, but he hoped that their dear country would come out of the gloom with its honour unstained, and enter on a career of active industry with an atmosphere purer and healthier than before. He had been asked whether a case of five elderly sisters, about whom many had read, was a real case. It was a real case, and he should never forget the time when he first saw those ladies, nine days after the bank broke. During that time a meal had never been cooked in that house, their clothes had never been taken off their backs, and they had never lain in their beds, they were so bewildered and amazed, vaguely hoping that the good God would come and take them away from the evil that was to follow." )<br><br>Men already rich, but hasting to be richer, throw themselves into wild speculations with the view of making money more rapidly than before. With what result? Only to land them in hopeless bankruptcy. Many instances are at hand to prove this. A rich banker of Tipperary - a radical and a demagogue - got himself returned to Parliament, and in course of time, to quiet him, he was made a Lord of the Treasury. A coronet seemed to gleam before his eyes. But in this he was disappointed. He had launched into Italian, American, and Spanish railways, and lost heavily. Then he began to forge deeds, conveyances, and bills for hundreds of thousands of pounds. His clever but unprincipled schemes failed; his bills were dishonoured, his ruin was imminent. Late at night he entered his study, and took from it a phial of prussic acid. He strayed to Hampstead Heath. drank the poison, and died.<br><br>What scenes there were in the streets of Thurles and Tipperary after his death was announced. Old men weeping and wailing for the loss of everything; widows kneeling on the ground and asking God if it could be true that they were beggared for ever. And yet it was true. The banker and Lord of the Treasury had lost the last shilling of his bank, and plunged from fraud into still deeper fraud to recoup his losses, which only served to spread upon those around him a wilder and more hopeless ruin.<br><br>One of the last letters that he wrote was to his cousin. He said, " To what infamy I have come step by step, heaping crime upon crime I am the cause of ruin, and misery, and disgrace to thousands. Oh, how I feel for those on whom this ruin must fall! I could bear all punishment, but I could not bear to witness their sufferings. It must be better that I should not live. Oh that I had never quitted Ireland! Oh taht I had resisted the first attempts to launch me into speculation! I might then have remained what I was, honest and truthful. I weep and weep now, but what can that avail?"<br><br>Nations and states are dishonest as well as individuals. Their condition is to be measured by the state of their 3 per cents. Spain and Greece and Turkey are dishonoured in the commercial world. Spain was killed by her riches. The gold which came pouring into Spain from her vanquished colonies in South America depraved the people, and rendered them indolent and lazy. Nowadays a Spaniard will blush to work; he will not blush to beg. Greece has repudiated her debts for many years. Like Turkey, she has nothing to pay. All the works of industry in those countries are done by foreigners.<br><br>Much better things might have been hoped from Philadelphia and the other American States which repudiated their debts many years ago. These were rich States, and the money borrowed from abroad made them richer, by opening up roads and constructing canals for the benefit of the people. The Rev. Sydney Smith - who lent his money, "the savings from a life's income made with difficulty and privation" - let the world know of his loss. He addressed a remonstrance to the House of Congress at Washington, which he afterwards published. "The Americans," he said, "who boast to have improved the institutions of the Old World, have at least equalled its crimes. A great nnation, after trampling under foot all earthly tyranny, has been guilty of a fraud as enormous as ever disgraced the worst King of the most degraded nation of Europe."<br><br>The State of Illinois acted nobly, though it was poor. It had borrowed money, like Philadelphia, for the purpose of carrying out internal improvements. When the inhabitants of rich Philadelphia set the example of repudiating their debts, many of the poorer States wished to follow in their footsteps. As every householder had a vote, it was easy, if they were dishonest, to repudiate their debts. A convention met at Springfield, the capital of the State, and the repudiation ordinance was offered to the meeting. It was about to be adopted, when it was stopped by an honest man. Stephen A. Douglas (let his honourable name be mentioned!) was lying sick at his hotel, when he desired to be taken to the convention. He was carried on a mattress, for he was too ill to walk. Lying on his back he wrote the following resolution, which he offered as a substitute for the repudiation ordinance:-<br><br>"Resolved that Illinois will be honest, although she never pays a cent."<br><br>The resolution touched the honest sentiment of every member of the convention. It was adopted with enthusiasm. It dealth a death-blow to the system of repudiation. The canal bonds immediately rose. Capital and immigration flowed into the State; and Illinois is now one of the most prosperous States in America. She has more miles of railway than any of the other States. Her broad prairies are one great grainfield, and are dotted about with hundreds of thousands of peaceful, happy homes. This is wht honesty does.<br><br>The truth is, we have become too selfish. We think of ourselves far more than of others. The more devoted to pleasure, the less we think of our fellow-creatures. Selfish people are impervious to the needs of others. They exist in a sort of mailed armour, and no weapons, either of misery or want, can assail them. Their senses are only open to those who can minister to their gratifications. "They are men," says St. Chrysostom, "who seem to have come into the world only for pleasure, and that they might fatten this perishable body....At sight of their luxurious table the angels retire - God is offended - the demons rejoice - virtuous men are shocked - and even the domestics scorn and laugh....The just men who have gone beofe left sumptuous feasts to tyrants, and to men enriched by crime, who were the scourges of the world."<br><br>We no longer know how to live upon little. A man must have luxury about him. And yet a man's life does not consist in the abundance of things he possesseth; he must live honestly, though poor. Retrenchment of the useless, the want even of the relatively necessary, is the high-road to Christian self-denial, as well as to antique strength of character. That of which our age stands most in need, is a man able to gratify every just desire, and yet to be contented with little. "A great heart in a little house," syas Lacordaire, "is of all things here below, that which has ever touched me most. Happy the man who soweth the good and the true. The harvest will not fail him!"<br><br>Here is a fine specimen of honesty and truthfulness on the part of a poor German peasant. Bernardin de Saint-Pierre has told the story in his ' Etudes de la Nature.' He was serving as an engineer under the Count de Saint-Germain during his campaign in Hesse, in 1760. For the first time he became familiar with the horrors of war. Day by day he passed through sacked villages and devastated fields and farmyards. Men, women and children were flying from their cottages in tears. Armed men were everywhere destroying the fruits of their labour, regarding it as part of their glory. But in the midst of so many acts of cruelty, Saint-Pierre was consoled by a sublime trait of character displayed by a poor man whose cottage and farm lay in the way of the advancing army.<br><br>A captain of dragoons was ordered out with his troop to forage for provisions. They reached a poor cabin and knocked at the door. An old man with a white beard appeared. "Take me to a field," said the officer, "where I can obtain forage for my troops." "Immediately, sir," replied the old man. He put himself at their head, and ascended the valley. After about half an hour's march a fine field of barley appeared. "This will do admirably," said the officer. "No," said the old man; "wait a little , and all will be right." They went on again, until they reached another field of barley. The troops dismounted, mowed down the grain, and trussing it up in bundles, put them on their horses. "Friend," said the officer, "how is it that you have brought us so far? The first field of barley that we saw was quite as good as this." "That is quite true," said the peasant, "but it was not mine!"    <span class="small"></span></div>

I am lucky because we still love eachother but that is what makes the future so uncertain- if we love eachother so much and yet this time apart is necessary for both of us for different reasons (I need him to treat me better, I am tired of the emotional and mental abuse, I need to build my self confidence again, I need to find my individuality and he needs to grow up, work out his own deep seated issues, control his anger, and learn to respect me), but how do I keep my heart open to him and loving him when we are apart? How do I know he won't break my heart? I have to keep living with the same love in my heart and in marriage but live apart from him after living with him for 7 years. I think this would be easier if it were under different circumstances- like one of us had to move for work reasons or something, but he will be in the same city, in the same area, hanging out with our friends as will I.<br><br>We will be in contact with one other quite a bit, and married- but separate...I just don't know how to grasp this situation. What we are doing is quite unconventional- but seems right. We have many issues we need to work on and our limited physical space (we live in a small NYC apartment) doesn't give us room to breathe. I did offer other options- moving to a bigger place, moving out of NYC, implememnting changes, but he just wants to try life on his own-<br>what can I do if he doesn't want to try anything else? I could be angry and destroy any love between us, or I can try to see the positive and love him. I tried to see the positive and suddenly blossomed into a person I never knew I could be- over the past 2 months, my self confidence and self worth has grown. My friendships have become stronger. I am a new person. These changes came because I began to think of myself as an independant woman- such big positive changes and I know I will grow more on my own. In some ways I feel like he was, not purposfully, stifling my growth. These are good things and yet I am scared of the separation. i thought we would be together forever. I love him so much and don't wan tto be with anyone else. How can something that seems so right also seem so wrong? I am just scared and confused. I feel sad- not because i feel unloved or because he doesn't know I love him- but becuase we love so much and yet this separation is still going to happen and is still necessary. I feel sad because I wonder if our love is strong enough to help us work through this. Loosing someone is soo difficult- but I think beginning to realize that being friends with the person you love and trying to build a new life while they are still in it and not being able to move on at the same time is almost harder.<br><br>I know this situation must seem so strange, but the only answers I came come up with for myself is to see the positive, live with the idea of love and growth in my heart, and try to make this transition as easily as possible for both of us so that we can help and not hurt each other- it just doesn't make the saddness, pain, or lonliness any less.<br><br><strong>zulkifli mahmood </strong>wrote:<br><br>Hello,<br><br>Your separation will be a great mistake because you just not willing to confess to him that you love him very much and you do not want him to leave.

I was fine for the last 2 months and now yesterday and today I can't stop crying. I know this is good for both of us, but now I am getting scared and wondering what if we made the wrong decision. It doesn't matter anyway- there is no turning back. I just wish I could stop crying.<br><br><strong>gupta </strong>wrote:<br><br>Hi everyone,<br><br>I posted here a while ago and made some good friends. I appreciate how supportive everyone is to eachother in all of the postings here.<br><br>I am just feeling sad today. I am in the process of separating from my husband of 6 years. He is moving out in Jan. He wanted the separation but even though it was hard, I knew right away that this would be good for both of us. I didn't realize until that moment how much I had been olerating and how unhealthy it was for me. He knows that he doesn't treat me right and that is part of his need to separate. We decided this in Nov and he is moving in Jan. During this time I have grown immensely and have not being putting up with most of his attitude. We do not want to date other people and are going to marriage counseling and will continue to go after our separation. This is part of my problem. I do love him very much and I need this separation but I do want us to ge back together. He wants to do this separation indefinatly and wants to work on things but he doesn't know if we will get back together. And at the same time we are not "breaking up" and thus I can't just get over this with time and move on. I am scared of leaving my heart open to him and being vulnerable. And yet at the same time, I love him too much to just move on. I have been better than Ok during the time since NOv because I know that this is right for me. I have watched myself grow immensely during this time and dvelop some wonderful friendships. This past week I turned 30- and I was very happy. I had a wonderful week and he treated me like a queen on my bday and again at a birthday party with my friends on friday. Today I am very sad about this whole separation. Part of the reason I am sad I think is becuase he did treat me so well. My friends were all busy today and I felt sad and lonely- and the only person I wanted to be with and talk to was the very person I couldn't be with because he can't handle me bieng sad. I broke down and cried for the first time since we had our first dicussion about separating. I know that it is good I cry but I am scared of letting myself feel. I am scared of being vulnerable and leavin gmy heart open but I am also scared of prematurely giving up and letting go only to regret it later. I am just feeling sad and lonely today and wanted to write it out- thanks for listening.</div>

Thats what we were told in my country. You have been cheated by this girl. She used you to fulfill her dreams rather than love.

End that nicely and then walk away from her. You have seen her heart already, why must you make her feel wanted and loved. It happens to many men too and sometimes to women too. Just becareful in the future. You have to learn from this experience so it will not repeat again.<br><br>Take care Mic and good luck to you.<br><br>With Love,<br>Joe<br><br><strong>Micro Sat </strong>wrote:<br><br>Hello all,<br><br>This is my first posting here.<br><br>My life's first love (thought to be last), I lost her forever. My heart broken, suffering beyond imagination.<br><br>My story:<br><br>Over 4 and half years ago, I met a girl in Europe (she is a student from eastern european country) and we became very good friends. We live in two different countries, about 3 hours flight distance. Our friendship grown to mature level, she visted me and I was invited to visit their house. Her parents gave me warmth reception and all was going well. Her mother liked me a lot, and I felt she wanted me to be her future husband.<br><br>We become so intimate, loving, caring, supporting, understanding, respecting each other. We, mostly she, created so much of dreams (dreams of future) around us. We always kept in touch by chat, email, and phone. Mostly, its me who calls on phone to her frequently. I helped, invested so much on her in her study and other things, and this year July she passed her master. Although, we talked about marriage, she always insisted to wait till she finish her study.<br><br>Since last April/May, she made less contacts with me. I never realised anything different as our relationship is so strong (at least for me), and my trust on her was complete. Then suddenly, in last October I was asking her well-being by email. After my three emails, came the reply I got married four days ago and now live in another European country.<br><br>I thought its joke, but she told me its truth. And it is truth, I talked to her mother. It came as a tsunami, earthquake, thurderstrike in my life. In last 4 and half years, I never looked beyond her. I suffered biggest set-back of my life and I am still suffering the pain. I don't find answer to myself why and how she could do that to me. Why she became so cruel and extreme-selfish to cause this irreperable damage to my life?<br><br>Now, she keep saying I am your friend and always will be. Is it worth to keep friendship with this type of person? Now, each of her email or words bring pain to my heart and it will only prolong my pain.<br><br>Please advice and suggest, what is the best course for me to follow now.<br><br>Regards,<br>Mic</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Everyone,<br><br>I have posted some of the emails that I had written and replied to those people who were rather in distressed and heartbroken in a way.<br><br>If you have issues to make known to us here, its okay and if you wish to just read, its okay too. But whatever it is that you are facing please do not give up hope of your life and please to forgive yourself and move forward. Its better to make oneself see that things are just not like you anticipated sometimes or most of the time, but remember this, you learned from those mistakes and try to take it as a lesson rather than regrets.<br><br>If you need to uplift yourself again, please watch the movies within this thread and may your spirit be uplifted again. If you wish to talk within this thread too, its ok and everyone would be there for you if not I myself will be there for you. So keep this in mind and learn to listen and view things from different perspectives and maybe you will be like.......when you first fell in love again or loving life like you never before in your whole life. Take that as a way to know that if it has not happened to you...it will one fine day.<br><br>And with that, I bid everyone Goodnight and Good Morning. May you be blessed wherever you are right now. God Speed. Amen and Amin.<br><br>With Love,<br>Joe</div>
