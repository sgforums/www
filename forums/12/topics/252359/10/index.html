Actually, within this group achives itself, there are so many articles and movies you could use to woo someone special back Yihao ok.<br><br>Hmmm...Yihao...I'm just guessing here ok. You wanted this person to make you feel happy but because you have a hard time trying to make her understand you clearly in ways of character and maybe your attitude..she thought you were just jestering around with her and you were not serious with her. Is that it?<br><br>Alright, I have something appended below for you to try and use it for that special someone.<br><br><strong>I Promised That I Will Love You</strong><br><br>I cannot promise you that<br>I will not change<br>I cannot promise you that<br>I will not have many different moods<br>I cannot promise you that<br>I will not hurt your feelings sometimes<br>I cannot promise you that<br>I will not be erratic<br>I cannot promise you that<br>I will alwyas be strong<br>I cannot promise you that<br>my faults will not show<br>But..I Promised That I will Love You<br><br>Hope that will help you to win someone special to you with open arms ok. Good Luck Yihao. I cross my fingers for you.<br><br><strong>Yihao</strong> wrote:<br><br><strong>"and 1 more get my fren away from sum bad frens?&lt;- thats a diff one  "</strong><br><br>Yihao, I don't know whether this would help but I would suggest that you play the music video of "Beat It" by Michael Jackson and view it together with him or her. Usually, for someone to get away from someone who maybe a bit influential on a negative side takes alittle understanding and guidance from a person whom he or she can confided with and trusted. True friends will not hurt one another..but sometimes they made mistakes and one has to remind another to be prudence ok.<br><br>You take care now and thanks for asking ok. Come back here anytime when you need some advise. By the way, I almost forgot to mention....about love and relationship problems..Short Ninja is an expert..He is well known as "Dr Love" in Thailand's Forums.<br><br>Thanks Brother Short Ninja for being here for me while I am unavailable.<br><br>With Love,<br>Joe<br></div>
