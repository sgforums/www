              <h1><strong>No Regrets</strong></h1>
              <p> </p>
              <p>At the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris, the sport of canoe racing was added to the list of international competitions. The favorite team in the four-man canoe race was the United States team. One member of that team was a young man by the name of Bill Havens.<br><br>As the time for the Olympics neared, it became clear that Bill's wife would give birth to their first child about the time that the U.S. team would be competing in the Paris games. In 1924 there were no jet airliners from Paris to the United States, only slow ocean going ships. And so Bill found himself in a dilemma. Should he go to Paris and risk not being at his wife's side when their baby was born? Or should he withdraw from the team and remain with his family?<br><br>Bill's wife insisted that he go to Paris. After all, competing in the Olympics was the culmination of a life long dream. But Bill felt conflicted and, after much soul searching, decided to withdraw from the competition and remain home, where he could support his wife when the child arrived. He considered being at her side his highest priority, even higher than going to Paris to fulfill his dream.<br><br>As it turned out, the United States four-man canoe team won the gold medal in Paris. And Bill's wife was late in giving birth to their child. She was so late, in fact, that Bill could have competed in the event and returned home in time to be with her when she gave birth.<br><br>People said, "What a shame." But Bill said he had no regrets. For the rest of his life, he believed he had made the better decision. <br><br>Bill Havens knew what was most important to him. Not everybody figures that out. And he acted on what he believed was best. Not everybody has the strength of character to say no to something he or she truly wants in order to say yes to something that truly matters. But for Bill, it was the only way to peace; the only way to no regrets.<br><br>There is an interesting sequel to the story of Bill Havens...<br><br>The child eventually born to Bill and his wife was a boy, whom they named Frank. Twenty eight years later, in 1952, Bill received a cablegram from Frank. It was sent from Helsinki, Finland, where the 1952 Olympics were being held. The cablegram read: "Dad, I won. I'm bringing home the gold medal you lost while waiting for me to be born."<br><br>Frank Havens had just won the gold medal for the United States in the canoe racing event, a medal his father had dreamed of winning but never did. Like I said, no regrets.<br><br>Thomas Kinkade eloquently said, "When we learn to say a deep, passionate yes to the things that really matter, then peace begins to settle onto our lives like golden sunlight sifting to a forest floor."</p>

              <h2 class="post-title"><strong>A Doctor’s View of Medical Mistakes</strong></h2>
              <p class="post-title"> </p>
              <p></p>
              <div class="post-content">
              <p>Two decades ago, an anesthesia catastrophe at a Wisconsin hospital killed a pregnant woman named Joy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The young mother-to-be was undergoing a scheduled C-section, but a series of mistakes by the nurse anesthetist led to a tragic end, leaving the baby brain damaged and the family devastated.</p>
              <p>There was another victim that day. Dr. Gary Brandeland didn’t make the mistake, but Joy was his patient. Her death sent him on his own downward spiral of grief and gave him a first-hand view of how doctors and hospital workers react to medical errors.</p>
              <p>Dr. Brandeland, now an emergency room physician in Minnesota, has chronicled the tragedy in a moving article in a 2006 issue of the journal Medical Economics. What’s so fascinating about Dr. Brandeland’s story is that it explores the emotional toll medical mistakes have on doctors and nurses who witness them, and looks at the economic factors that he says often are ultimately responsible for medical errors.</p>
              <p> <a id="more-297"></a></p>
              <p>After the recent publicity surrounding the medical mistake that almost killed the twin babies of actor Dennis Quaid, I spoke with Dr. Brandeland about how medical mistakes affect the people who care for patients.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thumbnail"><img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/travelqa/question.gif" alt=""></div>
              <p><em>When medical mistakes happen, a lot of people blame the health care worker involved. Is that entirely fair?</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <div class="thumbnail"><em><img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/travelqa/answer.gif" alt=""></em></div>
              <p>The greatest common risk to patients is the understaffing of nurses. A nurse may make a critical mistake, and a patient might die. She has to live with the error, but the real culprit, the root cause often is that she or he was understaffed and overworked and a mistake was made. The hospital doesn’t pay for it on a personal level. They just get a new nurse.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I've seen excellent nurses who make mistakes when things get overwhelming. They are minor, and fortunately I haven't seen a death due to a medical mistake since this tragedy happened. But I think we’re at a critical point right now where health plans and insurance companies are trying to trim costs and are cutting back on quality. Instead of the individual, I think the anger should be at the hospital structure if in fact there is a history of understaffing at that institution.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thumbnail"><img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/travelqa/question.gif" alt=""></div>
              <p><em>This wasn't your mistake and you weren't sued or blamed in any way, yet you write about the enormous personal and professional toll the tragedy took on you. Why did this affect you so much? </em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <div class="thumbnail"><em><img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/travelqa/answer.gif" alt=""></em></div>
              <p>Everyone in the operating room is going to feel somewhat responsible. The patient came to me as someone who was going to safely help her have a baby, and the end result was this disaster. In the end, I was the one who talked to the family. I was closer to them because I’d seen them for nine months.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thumbnail"><img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/travelqa/question.gif" alt=""></div>
              <p><em>Have you ever been the victim of a medical mistake?</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <div class="thumbnail"><em><img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/travelqa/answer.gif" alt=""></em></div>
              <p>I was a patient in 1998 at a world famous medical center. The nurse came in to give me a pill. I had a heart condition and I recognized right away that it was wrong and I would have died. She came back and sort of laughed and said, “Oh, I guess the doctor wrote the orders on the wrong chart.'’ I would have left there with a toe tag if I had taken that pill.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div class="thumbnail"><img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/travelqa/question.gif" alt=""></div>
              <p><em>How did the death of Joy change your view of medicine?</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em></em></p>
              <div class="thumbnail"><em><img src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/travelqa/answer.gif" alt=""></em></div>
              <p>I became overcompulsive and less tolerant of any sort of mistakes at all. I felt more concern about people who were working for me, such as the nursing staff, and the mistakes that could be made. When there is a mistake, you go through almost the stages of grief. You second guess yourself. I also developed a profound sadness. I can’t describe it in words. I think about people who have lost a loved one, I think of families who have lost troops in Iraq and other tragedies where someone is killed in a car accident. It's a sadness that doesn't go away.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I highly recommend that you take the time to read Dr. Brandeland's complete essay, click <a href="http://medicaleconomics.modernmedicine.com/memag/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=379590&amp;pageID=1&amp;sk=&amp;date="><span style="color: #004276;">here</span></a>.</p>

              <p>British researchers gave surveys to about 80 surgical patients asking them how they would feel about asking doctors or nurses various questions. The questions ranged from simple factual questions like, “How long will I be in the hospital?” to more challenging questions such as, “Have you washed your hands?'’ The patients were asked to rate their level of willingness to ask the questions on a scale of 1 to 4, with 4 indicating they would be very willing to pose the question to their doctor or nurse. <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/doctor-did-you-wash-your-hands/#more-309"><span style="color: #004276;">Read more …</span></a></p>

              <p><em>Religion isn't often talked about in medicine, but should it be? I asked New York psychiatrist Dr. Robert Klitzman, author of “When Doctors Become Patients,” to tell us about his experiences with patients, prayer and faith. — Tara Parker-Pope</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>By Robert Klitzman, M.D.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>“I will pray for you,” a senior psychiatrist told my patient.</p>
              <p>His comment surprised me. I was in training, and the patient was a petite Latina woman who had remained despondent despite medication, psychotherapy or anything else I did. Would he really <em>pray</em> for her?</p>

              <p>Occasionally, as a trainee, I would spot a hospital chaplain, but at the medical school where I was trained and others, nothing about religion or spirituality is ever taught. Science is supposed to be logical, rational and objective, while spiritual beliefs are irrational, subjective, elusive and hard to describe. Not surprisingly, research suggests that doctors tend to be less religious than their patients.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But then, a few years ago, I became a patient myself and began to look at these issues differently. My sister died in the Sept. 11 World Trade Center attacks, leaving me stunned and depressed. As I recovered, I began to wonder about other doctors who had become patients. I ended up interviewing more than 50 of them. I soon learned that when doctors get sick with serious disease, they also tend to reconsider their spiritual beliefs. <a href="http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/24/prayer-faith-and-doctors/#more-294"><span style="color: #004276;">Read more …</span></a></p>

              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When your mind hears a question, it has no choice but to accept the premise of that question, and to think of an answer. Otherwise the question would be impossible to Understand.<br><br>When you hear a particular question often enough, you'll naturally seek to answer it. Even if you don't realize that you're doing it, your mind will set about to find an answer.<br><br>The questions to which you're regularly exposed have a powerful<br>influence on the direction of your life. And many of the questions you hear most often come directly from you.<br><br>What questions are you asking yourself? Are the negative questions, such as wondering why you can't ever get anything done, or are they more positive such as asking yourself what's the best thing that happened to you today?<br><br>For the next few days, when you catch yourself asking yourself a<br>question,think about what kind of influence that question will have on your life. Pay conscious attention to what you're asking yourself, and make an effort to make the questions positive and life-affirming.<br><br>The questions you ask yourself will continue to influence your life<br>long after you've forgotten what they were.  Do you understand why it's such a good idea to make those questions as positive as you can?</p>

              <p><strong>WORRY</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Worry is a very big problem in many people's lives. They worry about what clothes to wear, whether they are going to manage to pay rentals, buy food and send kids to school. They worry- what will become of them if they lose their jobs or what would become of their children and wife; and when they pass on.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Worry, worry, worry....WORRY!!<br>Have you ever had a problem and sat down to worry and overcame it?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When you worry you will never find any solutions. However, it is justifiable to worry if you haven't set your goals for the year. We need to plan otherwise worry will be on our mind day and day out.</p>
              <p><br>Worry is a worthless activity that many people indulge in regardless of their education background. Worry has never solved any problem, it can't solve any problem and never will. Worry finds its roots in the mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If your attitude is negative then the end result is a pessimistic view of life and things around you. Most of the things we worry about never even occur.</p>

              <div><span style="font-size: x-small;"> 
              <div>Most of us have the feeling that we are here to accomplish something big in our lives, and if we haven’t done something that fits the bill we may feel as if we are waiting. We may feel incomplete, or empty, as if our lives don’t yet make sense to us, because they don’t line up with our idea of major accomplishment. In some cases, this may be because we really are meant to do something that we haven’t yet done. But in most cases, we can let ourselves off the hook with the realization that just being here, being ourselves, is enough. <br><br>As we live our lives in this world, we share our energy and our spirit with the people around us in numerous ways. Our influence touches their lives and, through them, touches the lives of many more people. When we strive to live our lives to the fullest and to become our true selves, we are doing something big on an inner level, and that is more than enough to make sense of our being here on this planet at this time. There is no need to hold ourselves to an old idea in the back of our minds that we need to make headlines or single-handedly save the world in order to validate our existence. <br><br>We can each look within our hearts to discover what is true for us, what gives our lives meaning, and what excites us. We can release ourselves from any pressure to perform that comes from outside of our inner sense of purpose. Staying in tune with our own values and living our lives in tune with our own vision is all we need in order to fulfill our time here. Our lives are a process of becoming so that we cannot help but cocreate; being who we are, responding to each moment as it comes, we can trust that this is enough.</div>

              <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CARROT CAKE</span></strong></span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If all of the eight desserts listed<span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: navy;"> </span></span>below were sitting in front of you, which would you choose (sorry, you can only pick one)! Trust me...this is very accurate. Pick your dessert, and then look to see what psychiatrists think about you. <br><br>REMEMBER - No Cheating. Make your choice before you check the meaning. <br><br>After taking this dessert personality test, but when you do, be sure of your choice of dessert.  <br><br><br><br>Here are your choices: <br><br><br><br>1. Angel Food Cake <br><br>2. Brownies <br><br>3 . Lemon Meringue Pie <br><br>4. Vanilla Cake With Chocolate Icing <br><br>5. Strawberry Short Cake <br><br>6... Chocolate Cake With Chocolate Icing <br><br>7. Ice Cream <br><br>8. Carrot Cake <br><br>No, you can't change your mind once you scroll down, so think carefully about what your choice will be. <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><strong>OK - Now that you've made your choice, this is what the <br><br>researchers say about you... SCROLL DOWN---No Cheating <br><br></strong><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>1. ANGEL FOOD CAKE -- Sweet, loving, cuddly. You love all <br><br>warm and fuzzy<span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: navy;"> </span></span>items. A little nutty at times. Sometimes you <br><br>need an ice cream cone at the end of the day. Others <br><br>perceive you as being childlike and immature at times. <br><br><br><br>2. BROWNIES -- You are adventurous, love new ideas, and are <br><br>a champion of underdogs and a slayer of dragons . When <br><br>tempers flare up you whip out your saber. You are always the <br><br>oddball with a unique sense of humor and direction. You tend <br><br>to be very loyal. <br><br><br><br>3. LEMON MERINGUE -- Smooth, sexy, &amp; articulate with your <br><br>hands, you are an excellent caregiver and a good teacher. <br><br>But don't try to walk and chew gum at the same time. A bit of <br><br>a diva at times, you set your own style because you do your <br><br>own thing. You shine when it comes to helping others and <br><br>have many friends. <br><br><br><br>4. VANILLA CAKE WITH CHOCOLATE ICING -- Fun-loving, sassy, <br><br>humorous, not very grounded in life; very indecisive and <br><br>lacking motivation. Everyone enjoys being around you, but <br><br>you are a practical joker. Others should be cautious in <br><br>making you mad. However, you are a friend for life. <br><br><br><br>5. STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE -- Romantic, warm, loving. You care <br><br>about other people, can be counted on in a pinch and expect <br><br>the same in return. Intuitively keen. You can be very <br><br>emotional at times but a true person in every way. You like <br><br>to do things for yourself and help others learn about <br><br>themselves. <br><br><br><br>6. CHOCOLATE CAKE WITH CHOCOLATE ICING -- Sexy; always ready <br><br>to give and receive. Very creative, adventurous, ambitious, <br><br>and passionate. You can appear to have a cold exterior but <br><br>are warm on the inside. Not afraid to take chances. Will not <br><br>settle for anything average in life. Love to laugh. <br><br><br><br>7. ICE CREAM -- You like sports, whether it be baseball, <br><br>football, basketball, or soccer. If you could, you would like <br><br>to participate, but you enjoy watching sports. You don't <br><br>like to give up the remote control. You tend to be <br><br>self-centered and high maintenance. <br><br><br><br>8... CARROT CAKE -- You are a very fun loving person, who <br><br>likes to laugh. You are fun to be with. People like to hang <br><br>out with you. You are a very warm hearted person and a <br><br>little quirky at times. You have many loyal friends. You <br><br>were meant to lead and teach others. A wonderful role model. </span></p>

              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm in Pulau Langkawi (Malaysia) now..writing this from a Cybercafe in Cenang Beach. I arrived in Pulau Langkawi on Monday late afternoon yesterday and I will be flying to Subang Airport on Thursday evening and from there I will be spending the weekend in Shah Alam. I'm going home to Skudai on Monday I guess.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>This is the first time I travel to Pulau Langkawi and I actually like this place too, I didn't expect it would be as compatible to Bali (like in the 80s) or Lombok...the ambience and the beaches are beautiful and its wonderful to swim in the sea.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, thought I share the motel information that I'm currently staying....the beach is about 50 metres from the motel...I took the Chalet/Room Rate 1 package.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you love shopping...the things here are quite cheap...you can still bargain for a better price that is if you are good at it....for instance..3 T-Shirts for RM 10.00.</p>
              <p> </p>
