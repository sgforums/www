              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #0000ff;">Ah...What then?</span></span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">(Sorry, from a book I quoted while in imprisonment. I could not remember the title)</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">My name is Joe. Joe is my nickname or a pet name called by my parents, siblings, relatives and close childhood friends. I know you want to see me write because you do not know who or whom is actually writing this book.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">Many psychics behave strangely, talking to themselves silently or openly when they converse with unseen souls in the unseen world. The great paranormal Edger Cayce was in a tranced and unconscious when he prescribed remedies for his patients. The Englishwoman, Doris Stokes, communicated with the souls of loved ones in Hereafter for her audiences to comfort and healed the hearts of those who had lost their loved ones in death. George Anderson wrote and drew pictures on paper while he conducted a seance or discernment or communicating  with the loved ones from Hereafter for his visitors. Ruth Montgomery the former journalist practiced automatic writing to communicate with her former close friend Arthur Fort from Hereafter to write many books about the unseen world. Jane Roberts was in a tranced when she let 'Seth' the unseen spirit to use her body and mind to write many books too and usually Seth would dictate and Jane's husband, Roberts, would write down all the words that Seth spoke. I know many past prophets were branded as crazy men and accused of being possessed by the evil spirits by many unbelievers of God from the various faiths too. The Scientists, Physicians, Theologians and others would need to look at these people closely before they branded these gifted human beings as mad or Schizophreniacs.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">There are many Psychologists and Psychiatrists in United States of America that performed retrogression hypnosis to some of their patients to analyse their patients' psychosomatic behaviours and some began to wonder sbout the different individual psyche that spoke to them. There was a woman with sixteen different multi-split personalities that was going through therapy and her physician wrote a book titled 'SYBIL' for her own researched work. I could not recall the physician's name and perhaps you could enquire the nearest bookshop about her book.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">There was a physician, Dr. Whitton, who found out something about the life of human souls in 'Life Betwen Life' or the 'Bardo' after he stumbled upon a soul who described to him about the life of human souls in Hereafter before their numerous reincarnations into human beings again. The 'Bardo' means an island or a place where the souls return to or a state of consciousness and condition of souls would be like after their death. The Tibetan Buddhists believed in the scripture of 'The Tibetan Book of the Dead' recorded by many Tibetan Buddhist monks for many centuries in their researched works and findings about the soul journey in Hereafter. Dr. Whitton did his researched works and recorded his findings pertinent to this matter for twenty years before he decided to let Joe Fisher wrote 'Life Between Life' based upon his researched works and discoveries. Dr. Whitton's researched works on discoveries corroborated with many other Physicians like Dr. Raymond Moody researched works on patients experiencing 'Near Death Experience and Out of the Body Experience'; and Dr. Elisabeth Kubler Ross own experience in dealing with the terminally ill patients who were dying; and Dr. Ian Stevenson's researched works and studies pertinent to reincarnation of the human souls.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">These were some of the professionals and intelligent people who were willing to look into such phenomena with scientific evaluations and methods. They were not so easily influenced by faith or superstition beliefs and you would be surprise of their commentaries and conclusions. </span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">I mentioned all these for you to find out for yourself and perhaps you could do your own researched works about people who could converse with the unseen beings from the unseen realms; endeavour to know about your own soul within you; read more different religious scriptures plus read scientific researched works by doctors or scientists on matters pertaining to the soul existence after death of the physical human body; and asked questions about the existence of the soul, world of Hereafter and God with people who are well verse in these subjects. I am not asking you to believe all the informations that you have gathered as true but you must know how to filter the logic and facts from the informations you have attained. You will see for yourself whether they are fictitious or truths because as you read their researched works and discoveries, you would question their integrity. Sometimes you need to give them a benefit of doubts because you do not know or understand it until you experience it yourself. All these would actually help you to understand about yourself and other people better. You would be surprise the change within you as you do your own researched works and you would discover many interesting things that you thought never existed or you felt was a fallacy. Your own perceptions about things you do not understand would make you see with some clarity why you are alive, the meaning of your life as human beings and perhaps the cerebration of your own mind. It would help you to grow instead of living as a human being without any purpose. I think I would like to recommend you to read a book written by a man named Ian Curry who wrote 'Immortality'. He too did his own researched works and discovered many answers to his questions.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">In this chapter I am writing it and unlike in other earlier chapters whereby I have applied the technique of Automatic Writing or Cross-Correspondence. I am conscious and I am aware of my presentation in this chapter. It is based on my own experience. Some of the names are fictitious to protect their privacy and identity. This is my story.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was born on Friday the 21st of June 1963 at 5.30 p.m. at the residence of my maternal aunt's at Jalan Buntu, Singapore. The area was called Kampung Pagak at that period of time. Maybe those who remembered this area would recall the kampung, which were mainly Malay inhabitants. My parents' house was at Lorong Ternak, off Kampung Ladang, near the vicinity of Singapore Paya Lebar International Airport, which was about eight kilometres away from my maternal aunt's house at Kampung Pagak. The day I was born, my parents were there for a social visit. Then my mother went into labour and they had no other choice but to let my mother to give birth at her sister's house. A Midwife was called upon to attend for this task to take place.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">My mother Salmah Bte Eusope was only twenty-eight years old and my father Mahmood Bin Hussein was only thirty years old at the time of my birth. I was born into a Malay Muslim family and I have other siblings, two elder brothers and three elder sisters. I was number six in the family. Later I have a younger brother and a younger sister but my younger sister, Zainab, passed away at a very tender age. She was born on Saturday the 14th of May 1966 at 6.35 p.m. and later she passed away at the age of five months and twelve days due to milk poisoning or Gastro Entritis on Wednesday the 26th of October 1966.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">I do not know much about my paternal Grandfather Hussein Bin Hassan (Alias Komeng Bin Omar) and Grandmother Aisha Binte Ismail (Second Wife) who stayed in Singapore and Grandmother Milah (First Wife) who stayed in West Malaysia, at Segamat in Johore State. They passed away before my birth and and my Grandmother Milah in the year 2000.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">About my maternal Foster Grandfather, Eusope Bin Kassim and Foster Grandmother Zainab Binte Midon, they too passed away before my birth.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">I remembered only seeing my maternal biological Chinese Grandmother who was very old and I met her few times before she passed over. I never knew my maternal biological Chinese Grandfather. I do not know what had happened to him because my mother never told me anything about him. I heard from my father that he was a trishaw rider. I saw three of my maternal biological Chinese Aunties and they usually came to visit us when we were living at Kampung Ladang.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">Later, when I was only a teenager of 14 years old, my father told me that he had a half-brother, Osman Bin Komeng borne from the first wife of my paternal Grandfather Hussein (alias Komeng). My uncle Osman was forced to serve in the Army of Imperial Japan during World War Two. Then one day he was send to some place for a military mission that his family did not know where the mission was going to be carried out. They managed to bid Osman farewell and prayed for him to return home to them safely but Osman did not return home to them after the war ended. The family did not know what had happened to him, whether he was alive or dead. They waited for him to return but nobody knew about his fate. My Father told me probably Osman was send to Burma and probably he failed to survive the war. I saw my father's mien was sorrowful and I saw his tears when he told me about Osman. So when my father told me about my uncle Osman, I was so surprised to know about him because I never thought that my own past member was involved on the side of the enemy of mankind during World War Two. The information about my uncle Osman was not a bad news to me or disappointed me because I saw the face of my father and I realised he loves Osman regardless of his involvement with the Japanese Army. It was not important on who won the war but it was important for him to know whether Osman is in Heaven.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have always looked up at the United States of America and British military forces as the Heroes of World War Two. I have always thought highly of the Americans as the saviours of the Asian people during World War Two, especially in the Pacific Ocean region. Without their involvement, Imperial Japan would not have been defeated and the American have sacrificed many young men for the freedom of the Asian people under the Japanese Power during World War Two. That admiration is still present in my heart for those young men of United States of America who had been killed in action in that war.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">My favourite ideal General was General Douglas McArthur. He was a brilliant General and he saved the world from destruction by the Japanese Imperialist and his phrased to the Filipinos, "I Shall Return" was the action he fulfilled to the Filipinos, which I found very noble and a gentleman. He gave a speech to the West Point Academy cadets, "An old soldier never dies but he just fade away' was good for the morale of any soldiers who have served in the Army. He was like the Father for those United States Marines who served under his command and they loved him for his courage, duty, honour and country commitments as a General and a man of goodness. I loved him because of his commitments to fight for the freedom of mankind during World War Two.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I was a little boy, I usually drew pages and pages of battle scenes of U.S. Marines fighting the Japanese Army during World War Two. Most of the times I would draw the Americans winning and annihilating the Japanese Army. I regarded the Japanese soldiers as the worst enemy of mankind. I also drew pages and pages of German soldiers fighting the British soldiers and the American GIs. I drew the German soldiers were slaughtered by the Britishs and Americans. I drew tanks, fighter planes and battleships pounding the enemies of mankind, the Japanese and the German soldiers. I drew and drew with zest until my own parents and siblings were wondering why I drew so much war scenes. I loved watching war movies and my favourite serial films were 'Combat', 'The World At War' and 'Ba Ba Black Sheeps.' I loved the American fire powers especially the marines of U.S.A. fighter planes and battleships. I loved playing war games with my kampung childhood friends and I loved wearing Scout uniform, imagining the Scout uniform as the military fatigue of U.S. Marines with the drinking mug strapped to my waist, which would resembled as the water-bottle. I loved to play with toy soldiers. I loved to make wooden rifles and the rifles would resemble as GI Sergeant Vick Morrow's machine-gun. I loved to draw when I was young and I drew non-stop without realising that I used up many exercise books for my drawings. It is funny though, I seemed to like or got impressed with the Germans uniform because it looked fierce and very smart too. It is like contradicting my own hatred for them in World War Two atrocities that they had committed against the Jews.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">I was very physical and aggressive when I was a little boy of eight years old and I liked to fight with my childhood friends when they provoked me. That usually happened when I could no longer expressed my words and I would lose control of my anger with them. I was the small fighter and I fought those who bullied my sisters too, regardless whether my opponents were bigger or smaller than I was. When I lost control of my temper, I would go into a wild frenzy and I would punch those childhood friends of mine who had angered me. When I was in Secondary Two, there were two occasions whereby I controlled of my temper. I used my hands to punch my third elder sister on her face and my younger brother on his stomach. Once I nearly punched my own mother who was accusing me of something that I did not do. Later my own second elder brother punished me. He grabbed my hair and slapped me really hard on my face. He heard about my anger towards our mother but I did not retaliate because I knew I was guilty and he was stronger than I was. Our mother stopped the fight. That night there was a feeling of dissatisfaction within me, furious with myself for not fighting back and I was actually wishing to have another fight with him. In my mind I was imagining of throwing a few punches at him. That was my anger but I managed to control it and let it go. My last fight was when I was in Secondary Three whereby I fought against three Chinese boys because of roughed tackles in a soccer match. Then after that incident I mellowed down and never fought again. I managed to control my anger and decided that fighting was not the answer to solving my arguments or disagreements.</span></div>

              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">My mother Salmah and her younger sister, Haslinah, were given away to a Malay-Javanese childless couple during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. They were send away by their own biological Chinese mother for their own safety to be secured because the Japanese were very cruel towards the Chinese. My aunty was only an infant and my mother was about seven years old when they were adopted by the Malay-Javanese couple during World War Two. My maternal Foster Grandparents, Eusope and Zainab, adopted them. They were raised as Muslims and they were educated in the 'Madrasah' (Convent) Muslim's School. They were educated in Islamic religion and the Malay's traditions and customs. They were not returned to their own biological Chinese family after the war ended for reasons that I do not really know for sure. I suspected that my mother was so angry with her own biological Chinese mother for sending her away and that caused her to look at her own mother like some else.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">When I was only a little boy, my maternal biological Chinese Grandmother came to visit us and stayed with us for a few days, I remembered my mother told me not get closed to her mother. Later when she passed away, we were not allowed to attend our maternal biological Chinese Grandmother's funeral too. I do not know why but i thought maybe we were Muslims and it was not right for Muslims to be involved in the Chinese funeral rites. I did not question my mother so much about my biological Chinese Grandmother or about my biological Chinese Grandfather. I thought about it sometimes and I regretted for not asking her back then. Maybe I was so young back then to realise that all this information was important for my future generation to know their family roots. My own father is not so sure about my maternal biological Chinese Grandfather and Grandmother backgrounds or histories and my maternal biological Chinese aunties are not in contact with my father anymore after my mother's death on the 23rd June 1994 of a heart attack. She passed away at the age of fifty-nine years old. All I know now is my Chinese Surname is Tan.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">My mother was a very hardworking woman and wife. She worked hard for her family and she also loved to cook various dishes for her family. She was a superb cook. She sold foods at the various food stalls while I was young and she loved to sell foods to her customers at a very low price and that made her customers very happy to eat at her stall not only because it was cheap, but her dishes tasted delicious too. She believed in working hard for money and when she had enough money, she would usually buy somethings for the family and provided cash for her family. She loved her family very much. My father's wage as a conveyancing clerk was not sufficient for nine mouths so my mother had to work too in order to help with the family income. I used to ask my mother for cash and she usually would remind me, 'Money is very difficult to find and do not behave as though we are rich.' Then she would grumble at me but she would still give me whatever money that I needed for myself. I was a pampered son and after her death, I reminiscent her love and commitment to our family. I remembered her saying to me oftenly, 'You will realised the difficulties after I am gone.' That was her usual phrased to me and I know the difficulties I faced after her demised. She was a woman who would try her very best to do things for her family with compassion and love regardless of her own health being deteriorated by long hours of hard worked. She is one mother I wish to have and to love forever and ever. Her loves still remain deep in my heart and I am very sure my other siblings feel this way too.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">My mother was a woman who had the abilities to converse with the 'Djinns' or Spirit People, which most Moslems believed they existed unequivocally because it is stated the Holy Qur'an. She would be in a state of unconsciousness when this happened. Many people came to see her for help when they were ill or when they were being disturbed and tormented by unseen Spirits. This was the time when we were staying at the kampung and those who came to see her were all people who knew about her abilities of spiritual healing for those who were unwell with inexplicable sickness. The mother of mine did not go around telling people about her ability and she would not become involved unless it was necessary. Most of our kampung neighbours knew about her special abilities and she would not disclose to them about her spiritual healings that were rendered to those people who came to see her for that treatment. It was strictly confidential and my father would assist her while she was in a state of different personalities. My mother was not a person who earned a living by practicing spiritual healing that was only her small contribution to help others who really needed her help. Once my father told me that she was able to heal an individual who was suffering from mental illness and that healing was the talked of the kampung people.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">My intention of writing about my mother is to make you understand the ways of many old generations' belief pertinent to spiritual healing because most of them believed in it just like their forefathers did. You must understand that the past generation people did not possessed high education, especially, the western academic knowledge and most of them believed strongly in the old ways of spiritual treatment. Those genuine spiritual healers who possessed this special ability usually do not like to make their gifted ability as a livelihood.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">My father once told me that he had brought my mother to see a doctor pertaining to her sporadic fainting and unconsciously transformed into many different personalities. The physician diagnosed my mother's illness as madness but my father knew it was untrue and we her children knew it was also untrue. Those who knew her would tell you likewise. She had no problems with her social life, she behaved like any ordinary people and she could concentrate on whatever she was doing but those who did not know about her special abilities would think that she was suffering from mental illness or multi-split personalities. Maybe she was suffering from manic depression or mood swing that caused her to behave and perform such abilities would be more logical for physicians to conclude the state of my mother's psychosomatic characteristics. I must write according to what I know about my mother so that you would consider all the elements involved before you conclude your judgement upon her. I must let you know too that once upon a time while my mother was in the roofless bathroom of our kampung house, a large cobra fell on top of her head and probably that would have triggered some shocks and traumas that caused her to be like what she was. Probably after my younger sister's death, she was suffering from depression and guilty conscience for my father had actually blamed her for her ignorance and negligence. That would probably make more sensed for those of you who could not understand my mother's state of mental health and her special gifts to become someone else while she was in altered state of consciousness.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">I knew my mother was unhappy about her marriaged with my father because most of the times they lacked of funds while having many children to feed. My father and mother always quarrelled and in the past my father had bad tempers too. He changed his behaviours after some of his children grew up into young adults. Many times my mother had told me, "I stay married to your father because of my children and it I do not think about all of you, I would have had left your father a long time ago." My father was a very hot-tempered man when he was younger. My second elder brother was tied up to a pole for being too mischievous in his conduct. My second elder brother was very physical and aggressived too in the past but he changed after he got married. In the past when each time my first elder sister came home late at night, my father would beat her up and sometimes he would bring out the 'parang' or hatchet and had threatened to kill her. He felt ashamed of my sister's behaviours for in the eyes of the kampung people at that time, a young who came home late at night was a bad girl. When this happened, the neighbours would drop by to stop the bad incidence from getting worst and they gave advised to my parents and my sister.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">I had witnessed all these incidences throughout my childhood days until my age was around twelve years old. Then my father completely stopped beating my first elder sister when she returned home late. I realised that all the bad incidences that I had witnessed might somehow affected my intellect and behaviours as a grown up man now but I realised it is not good to be angry in front of the children or with the children. Beating them harshly or arguing and quarrelling with other people with violent actions or with abusive languages is not good for anybody. It will not help to solve any problems that I encounter and it will only make the matters worse. Usually when I faced with these kind of incidences I would just remain quiet and think about it quietly and calm myself before I handle the situations. In the olden days, many of us were disciplined with beatings by our own parents because they themselves were disciplined in the same manner by their own parents too. Sometimes it was child abused but many of them regarded their actions as disciplinary punishments and in the past my father had belted me too for being naughty or stupid. Time has changed all that inhumane punishments but when you read the newspapers today you could still see many irresponsible parents who had accidentally killed their children for being too angry with their children. I met many inmates who served their sentence in prison for being unable to control their raged with their children or wives or parents or siblings or colleagues or girlfriends. At the end they were the one whom should be bleached for causing hurts to others.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">My mother had suffered a heart proble at middle age and once a physician had told my father that his wife had approximately about six months to live when she was warded in the intensive care unit at the general hospital. The doctor's prediction did not come true and my father was very happy with my mother's life longevity and will to live. My mother was warded in the intensive care unit at the general hospital many times and each time she when recovered temporarily from her illness, we all felt very happy and very relieved. However, in the late afternoon of 23rd June 1994, she was struck by heart attacked while buying foods for her family at Haig Road Food Centre and she did not survived the heart attacked. Upon arrival at the hospital she was pronounced dead by the doctor. My father and siblings did not know about it until somebody informed them about the unfortunate incident late in the evening. All of them were busy with their work. I was living as a fugitive in Bali when that incident occurred. Later I got to know that somehow another on that same particular day, approximately at the same time when my mother had a heart attacked, I had taken out the photographs of my parents from the drawer and I had pin-pointed to my second wife, Sari, and I had mentioned to her that something bad had happened to my mother. Tears were forming in my eyes but Sari and I took it that I was probably being too emotional for nothing because earlier on that same particular day we had a slight misunderstanding. I did not call my family in Singapore because I thought that maybe I was being ridiculous and I had overeacted with my intuition. When I called my family two days later, I received the bad news and I had missed her funeral. I would not be able to return home too because I was a wanted man and a fugitive on the run. That was the time I started to look at life and I was wondering about the state of my mother's soul in the unseen realm and I began to read the Holy Qur'an to ease my pain and regrets within my heart. That was a long time ago but it still puzzled me so much about the intuitions that I had received pertaining to my mother's passing away.</span></div>

              <div> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div></div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have written about my mother before I write about her followers of 'Djinns' or Spirit People from the unseen world and she was able to perform the spiritual healing partly because of them. My father told me that the first time that he had encountered with the Spirits of my mother's was during on their wedding night. I do not know the details so much maybe because my father felt embarrassed to tell me about it. He told me that night my mother had suddenly became like someone else. The Spirits told my father not to make my mother sad and not to make her feel as though she was not a good wife to him too. Then they went out of my mother's body and my father was so afraid of them after that incident. I saw them when I was a toddler and they kept coming to meet us until we shifted to our new flat. The last time I saw one entity within my mother's mind and body was in 1987 before I got married to my first wife, Noorasmah. In the past before they came to meet my father and us children, my mother would become unconscious and they would go into my mother's unconscious body adn then woke up from the reposed position. They would sit in a crossed leg position, gave my father the Islamic way of greeting and my father would acknowledge to them likewise.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">Their characters and behaviours were not like my mother though the physical body was. They never opened their eyes and sometimes when my father asked thme to look at the television screen, they seemed to be able to see the programmes on with their eyes closed but yet they could actually see it. They spoke to my father in the manner of those olden days Malay language, which my father could understand and sometimes he could not understand. While conversing with my father, they would use their hands to gesture to make their words more comprehensive. They would usually advised my father to becaome a good man and husband. They would advise my father to pray and remember Allah always. They would tell my father about my mother's feelings or worries or health conditions and my father would enquire them whether my mother was angry with him or happy with his behaviours and attitudes. My father would in return explained to them why he behaved such and such manner towards my mother or why he was angry with her. They would then advise my father to be patience and they would advise my mother too about her behaviours and attitudes too.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">When there were visitors to meet my mother and the Spirit People for spiritual healing treatments, they would come to meet the visitors. My father would become the assistant to them because many of the visitors could not understand their language. My father would in return relate their messages to the visitors. They used limes, flowers, incense and a bowl of water and looked at to relate the illness of the visitors. My father would burn some incense onto the burning charcoals in a small clay cup. Then they would mumble some holy verses and they would slice the limes bits by bits into the bowl of water and gazed on it.  Then they would tell the visitors about the illness that they came for the treatments and most of the visitors believed them because they were told about something that my mother or my father did not know about until the visitors themselves heard it from them. They would advise the visitors the things that the visitors needed to do and after they had advised the visitors, they would put in flowers into the bowl of water that already contained the sliced limes. The water were then given to the visitors for bathing or for washing the face of that particular ill individuals. Usually the visitors would bring along with them a bottle to be filled up with the holy water from another bowl that the 'Djinn' had mantra over with the holy verses. The water were meant to be consumed by the particular sick individual. The Spirit would leave my mother's body after the procedures and prescriptions were given to the visitors. After a few minutes, my mother would then be conscious again and she would reiterate some informations about the methods of the spiritual healing the the Spirit had advised to the visitors. Somehow another, the Spirits spoke to my mother while she was unconscious. The visitors would then insisted on giving some cash to my mother or father as a token of their appreciation but usually my parents would reject the offer, but sometimes the visitors really persisted further on their cash offering and my parents would relent to their kindness. Sometimes they brought food stuffs for my parents. The visitors were mainly Malays and Chinese. My parents would usually remind them not to tell others about the spiritual healing that my mother had rendered to them.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">There were seven different Spirit entities that possessed my mother's body. They were brothers and sisters. There were four brothers and three sisters. They told my father that they lived in the sea. They prayed, meditated (Zikir) and praised Allah when they returned to their own world. They were Shah (male), Iskandar (male), Shahadan (male), Siti Aishah (female), Siti Fatimah (female), Siti Aminah (female) and Bisu or Busu (male). These were the entities from the unseen world that came to meet my father and us children. Each of these entities had different personalities and most of them came to talk to my father and us children when my mother wanted to treat spiritual healings to the visitors but sometimes when my mother was in sorrow or in ill health, they would come. My mother seemed to be able to call them at her own will when she had visitors for the spiritual healing sessions but usually when she was sad or in ill health, they would come with or without her own free will.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">They were already present with my mother before my birth. I could only relate five of them because I have seen them took possession of my mother's body but it was quite vague for me to remember their names and personalities because it was a long time ago. I actually had to check with my second elder brother and my father and they too could not really remember clearly or exactly identified the two entities. As I have written earlier on in the previous chapter, the last time I saw one of the entity was back in 1987 before I was married to my first wife Noorasmah. Bisu or Busu came because Noorasmah was possessed by an evil entity that was frightening and disturbing her, her family, my family and I. Shah was the eldest among the rest of the Spirit entities and Bisu or Busu was the youngest among them. I have written their names according to their ranks within their own family in their Spirit's world. The puzzling thing was that they had never mentioned anything to us about their own parents in the Spirit's world. I wonder why? They were seven siblings and it was so coincidence that we too were seven siblings. When Shah camt to meet my father, he ws the most fierce and serious entity. He would talk to my father seriously and proposed to him some of the ways my father could behave towards his wife. He loved to drink black coffee. Iskandar was an entity that was gentle and never scolded my father unlike Shah who would actually scold my father when he did something wrong. Iskandar loved to smoke cigarettes and my father usually would provide him that item when he requested for it. Shahadan, I have no knowledge of his characters. Siti Aishah would always sing Malay folk songs like the ways of the Malays in the olden days. The songs were like poetry form and it rhymes or 'Syair' in Malay language. Siti Fatimah would always cry whenever she camt ot meet my father and my father usually had to comfort her or consoled her not to be sad. She never told my father why she was always in sorrow and each time my father questioned her about it, she would cry even harder. She loved to have perfumes applied to her hands and sensed the fragrance. She would be quiet after that and she would leave my mother's body quietly. Siti Aminah, I have no knowledge of her characters. Bisu or Busu was the most frequent entity that would come to meet us. He was the youngest and his name 'Busu' itself means the youngest in Malay. We called him Bisu too because he was also mute. Whenever the Spirits came to meet us, the male entities would always request for the Malay black headdress or 'Songkok' for them to wear on their head whereas the female entities would request for the Malay scarf or 'Selengdang' for them to cover their head with it.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">I could relate to you more about Busu characters compared to the rest of them because Busu was one of the prominent entity for my father and us children. We remembered him so well mainly because he often came to meet us and he was the funniest and most mischievous Spirit among his Spirit siblings. The other male entities joked too but unlike Busu. When Busu came he would ask for raw chicken eggs and the eggs must be placed in a saucer or else he would whine like a child and all of us would be anxious. He was also ill mannered and after he had consumed the raw chicken eggs from the saucer, he would throw down the saucer roughly and my father always had to stop him from doing so. he loved to converse with us with his funny face expressions liked a clown, gesturing with his hands and his body. He loved to tell incidences about what he saw or did and normally he would inform to my father about us children behaviours when my father was not at home. He mentioned that he loved to follow us children wherever we went and he would sit on our shoulders without our knowledge. He was liked a spy for my mother and my father. He loved to joke with us and he never frightened us away but sometimes he scolded some of us for being naughty. All of us loved him so much because of his funny behaviours and his jokes. When he laughed his mouth was wide opened  with his teeth bared and all of us would actually laughed together with him.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">Once, we asked him to describe to us his appearance. He told us that he had a big head with black hair and there were many lice in it. He had a small body and when he walked, his head would swing side to side. That was his descriptions of himself to us.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sometimes my father would ask Busu for four digit numbers that would supposedly strike as the winning prize and sometimes my father would asked the other Spirits for it too. Sometimes they gave and sometimes they refused. I did not know whether my father struck any of the numbers correctly because my father never told us. Busu was the most popular among us children and it seemed that he loved children so much more than any adults.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">The Spirits would come in sequence, one after another according to their ranking within their family members but sometimes they never appeared to us in sequenced because some ot them were busy doing other things in their world, perhaps praying, meditating and praising Allah, and maybe prying on other human beings too beside our own family. Busu on the other hand always handled the situations when ther others could not come. Usually when my mother was sad or ill in health, he would inform my father about it and it seemed that they too believed in the modern medicines that the doctors provided for my mother. Whenever my mother felt ill they would recommend that my father sent my mother to the hospital for treatments and rest, especially, when it was concerning to her heart illness. They seemed to know that they had their own spiritual healing limitations on matters pertaining to the physical body sickness or impairments. Busu never treated the visitors for spiritual healings and the female entities never did that too. Only Shah and Iskandar but sometimes Hamadan would provide that services to the visitors.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">As we children grew up, they seemed to fade away and remained invisible to us except Busu. I did not know what was the reason that they faded away. I remembered my mother told me that they had actually requested and seek permission for them to become the followers of my first elder sister, but my mother had rejected thier request. My mother told me that she did not want any of her children to have the Spirit People as our followers anymore. My mother disliked the idea of making her children as the spiritual healer for other people. I think she would like to see her all children educated with good education qualifications and not to become like her. She understood and knew that education was very important for her children's future. We children too disliked that idea of having any Spirits as our followers in the unseen realm. We were all educated in English stream schools and as we grew up, we have more modern knowledge and all of us thence to forego and forget about those Spirit entities of our mother. We actually begun to disbelieved in their existence in fact disbelieved totally about their spiritual healings capabilities. We did not wish to see our mother in a trance state again because we felt it was not good for her to become like that and my mother somehow knew about our feelings pertinent to her world of spiritual healing. She stopped doing that after we shifted to our new flat apartment. We shifted from Kampung Ladang in 1973. No more visitors for spiritual healing treatments and we led a normal life just like any other family in Singapore.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">Some of us begaun to think that probably our mother was actually suffering multi-split personalities, especially, my third elder sister who was by then working as a nurse in the hospital and my eldest brother became so afraid of the Spirit people thinking that they were demons or evil spirits. And my siblings wondered whether it was true or false when we became like a nation with Western Ideas.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">It seemed that as we older, the Spirits too became extinct in our lives. Busu too became silence and my mother was busy with her food business. As we grew older, we became like a modern family and we started speaking to one another in English, except to our own mother. We siblings became to distance ourselves from one another and also with Malay traditions and customs as we gained more modern knowledge at schools and in society. The past incidence of our mother's spiritual healings were put at the back of our mind and we buried it as we developed into young men and women. As for me, I was busy with my friends and thinking about my future or hunting for girlfriends.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">Only a few occasions Busu turned up when somebody tried to do Black Magic Charmed or 'Voodoo' to our family. That was the time I was serving my National Service in the Army from 1981 to 1983. He came and inform my father that the Malay lady was our own relative, in fact, his own niece because she was involved in an affair with a married man. She was chased out from her own family and she had temporarily stayed us but she invited that man to our flat when tere were nobody at home. My mother was so angry and she chased her out from the our house and she became very vindictive towards our family. She went to seek services of the Malays and Indians 'Bomohs' or Witchcraft mentors. She threw bloods, oils and some pounded incense in front of our door entrance.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">During that period of disturbances, there was one occasion whereby I was going to the kitchen then as I reached at the entrance of the kitchen, I felt something pushed me aside. I vaguely saw a tall thin light and shadow passing like lightning in front of my eyes. At that same moment, my eldest sister's boyfriend was sitting at the table near the kitchen entrance, he too saw something that went towards my mother as she passed out at the telephone table not far from the kitchen entrance.  He was very frightened  of what he had witnessed and he told my sister about it. It turned out to be an evil entity that was not from my mother's Spirit People. That evil entity possessed my mother's body. It was wild and ferocious like a wild animal. My father tried to chase that entity out from my mother's body but it was so adamant that my father had begun to call for my mother's Spirit People to help him and his wife. Then the evil entity went out and Busu appeared. Busu told my father that someone had sent that evil spirit to disturb my mother and his own niece requested for it. Of course my father did not call up or looked for his niece because it was ridiculous to do that without any solid proof. Busu left my mother's body and a few days later Busu came and told us that he had disturbed and tormented my father's niece at night until she became frightened of him. At the end, she came to seek forgiveness from my father and mother. She admitted ot her evil doing and sins. My father forgave her but not my mother. I had noticed that Busu was not like he used to be in the past and he seemed more serious like as though he too had matured in aged. That was the only occasion Busu came and then disappeared again from our lives.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">I must emphasized to you the readers that what I have written in this chapter are all according to what I saw and I know about. It is a true story and there is no fabrication. I was a Muslim in the past and as a Muslim, we believed in the existence of Spirits or 'Djinns' in the unseen realm because it is stated in the Holy Qur'an and the teaching of Islamic Faith. I had just took it as it was and never questioned about it until much later in my life, especially when I was living in Indonesia and when I was in Changi Prison. That was when I started to do my own researched about the Spirit People or 'Djinns'.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-family: Arial;">The question now is whether Busu is the same entity that wrote together with me in this book? I have to tell you the truth. I am not sure myself because he never did revealed to me that he is Busu, the Spirit follower of my mother. I will write some more in the next chapter about my first wife possession in Singapore and my ex-second wife's (Yani) Spirit people from the unseen world in Indonesia. I hope you could see for yourself where all these Spirits calling from. By the way, my late mother, Salmah Binte Eusope, inherited the Spirit People from her foster mother, my Grandmother, Zainab Binte Midon.</span></div>

              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">I have written about my own mother and now I will tell you more about my own experience in dealing with the spirits from the unseen realm. You must be wondering why I write so much about these spirits. I need you to know all these for you to judge for yourself whether all these bad or good spirits existed because we believed in them due to our religious belief and folklore superstitions or it is just a stage play for the spirits to manipulate our mind. It has to do with our mind in a sense that we are frighten of ghosts, evil spirits and the Devil but we are unafraid of holy spirits and angels of God. Is it true that they would only exist when we believed in them and they would not exist if we do not believed in them? I will say it is true after I had encountered them in Singapore and Indonesia.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">In retrospect when I think about it, I believed it was all about overcoming my own fears of the unknown. And from that inner circle prison, I stepped out, look at it from the outside and found out that I was a prisoner of my own illusion. Then I saw and met those who were outside my cell. They were actually trying to pull me out and breathe the fresh air outside for more life and to cherish life. Then I would wake up and sing halleluja with my life rather than sing-sing in hell forever on planet earth.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">In this chapter I am writing about the life of mine in the past when I was still a believer in good and evil spirits from the unseen world, besides the Devils, Angels and Allah. I was still bounded by my faith in Islamic belief in "Djinns" from the unseen world. I did not question about their existence and their true identity. So I hope you would understand why I behaved such manner in the past.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">I will not use the technique of automatic writing in this chapter. Just to let you know, before I conclude this book, I will write the automatic writing methods for you to understand about it and how it works.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">The story is based upon my own experience and encounter. There is no embellishment to make into a fantastic story. I am writing the occurrences with sincerity and truthfulness. The names may be different to protect the privacy and identities of the people involved. In may strike your mind to wonder why I always encountered these spirits in my life. In the past I was wondering the same thing too but now, I have no more questions about them. They know I am not afraid of them and they know why.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">In 1986, I was working in a stock broking firm in Singapore as a registration clerk. There I met Noorasmah. I was working there for about a month then one day while I was waiting for the lifts at the lobby, she happened to be there at the right time at the right place. I decided to go lunched with her and I asked her permission whether I could join her. She was blushed and then she shyly agreed to my request. We went lunched together and our relationship kicked off from there. From that day onward, we went lunched together everyday then after I knew her better I dated her out. Our relationship flowered to courtship and both of us fell in love with each other. I got to know more about her parents and sisters. Then I became closed to all of them. Within a few months later, Noorasmah and I began to plan for our future life together and marriage came to our mind. We were both twenty-three years old and later we tied the knot the following year.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">Noorasmah was suffering from Asthmatic.  Her appearance looked quite frailed due to frequent asthmatic attacks but she always look beautiful to me. I fell in love with her not just because of her beauty but she also has good characters, kind and loving heart. While we were courting, I found out about her little secret and she concealed that from me until I persisted her to tell me.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">Prior to her employment in a stock broking firm which I later became an employee too, she was working as a pharmacist assistant in a polyclinic at Pago Road in Singapore. She had an argument with one of her Malay male colleague in his forties. She had a bad quarrelled with this man for holding her hand to show that there were some messy pill powders on their desk after packing them into the sachets. What I am going to write now, it seemed very derogating in regards to Malays' mentality. It sounds so ridiculous yet it is true. It is shameful and sinful within the context of Islamic faith, yet it is useful for most of them, especially for those that believed in the arts of witchcraft or voodoo. They utilised it for one's vindictive desires to be fulfilled.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">After a few weeks after her resignation from the clinic, one day while Noorasmah was travelling on board a bus in the evening, she felt something momentarily and distinctively like a finger tip pressure sensation sort of penetrating on her forehead, slightly above her eye browse. That particular night her eyesight became blurred and she always felt sleepy around 7 p.m. which was not wont to her. Normally, she would sleep around 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. So after that day, most of the time she would go to bed early. It was not due to fatigue but she always felt weak. She did not sleep well most of the time as though it was like half asleep and half awake. It was as though there was something that was whispering to her within her heart. This condition went on for few weeks.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">Then one evening, she felt her eyes were painful like there were numerous pinpricked sensations. She felt uncomfortable and painful when she closed her eyes. She could not sleep and inside her head she felt it was like burning hot. She could not get up and walked too. She felt frightened with her condition. Then she screamed and shouted out for her mother. Her mother went into her bedroom to see what was the matter with her daughter. Noorasmah told her mother about her condition. Her mother touched Noorasmah's forehead and body, it felt hot. Thinking that it was high fever, she decided to send her to a private clinic. </span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">Noorasmah's mother and sisters had to carry her because she could not stand-up and walk. They went to the private clinic but the quirked thing was, upon reaching the clinic's premises, Noorasmah could slightly walked and her body temperatures subsided. The doctor examined her and there was no fever. He informed Noorasmah's mother and sisters that there was nothing wrong with Noorasmah. She was well and healthy. They went home then it began again. They already heard the doctor's statement when they met him at the private clinic earlier, so they decided to see a 'Bomoh' or spiritual healer that night about Noorasmah's strange illness.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">Noorasmah is an intelligent person. She has 'A' Level education and she had studied at one of the prestigious school in Singapore. She actually disbelieved in witchcraft until that day when she had experienced it herself. This was her confession to me and she went to see another "Bomoh" at Kampung Bukit Timah for spiritual healing treatment because she was not really recuperated totally from her strange illness though her felt better after some spiritual healing treatment from the previous spiritual healer. </span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">This female spiritual healer told her that a Malay man was the culprit but she did not disclose the identity of that Malay man. Nobody can accused anybody when it comes to witchcraft because we do not know whether the spiritual healer was genuine or faking and whether all this witchcraft is true or false.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">I had accompanied her several times for that spiritual healing sessions. I watched and observed the spiritual healer. She was in a state of trance and there was a male assistance to help with the spiritual healing procedures. It was almost similar to my own mother's method of spiritual healing. Noorasmah was given water with sliced small pieces of limes and flowers in it for bathing. A bottle filled with water mantra over by the healer with Qur'anic holy verses for Noorasmah to consume it. She was given a few raw chicken eggs for her to stroke gently all over her body and then the raw eggs would have to be returned to the healer on the subsequent visits. Noorasmah told me that once when she had returned the raw chicken eggs to the healer, when it were broken by the healer, there were needles inside it. She told me that she had actually witnessed it with her own eyes. There were no tricks and the healer did not change the eggs. My own mother did not use chicken raw eggs for her spiritual healing treatment for her visitors, except that Busu loved to eat raw chicken eggs for his own consumption whenever he turned up. I trusted Noorasmah's word because she is not that kind of person who likes to lie. I did not witness it for myself but I just listened to her story. I just let it be because I did not wish to indulge in the supernatural power of spiritual healing anymore. I had put all that memories of my own mother's spiritual healing abilities at the back of my mind. Actually, Noorasmah was ashamed and afraid to let me know about her little secret. She thought that I had never came across about spiritual healing before and furthermore she thought that I would probably disbelieve about it too. She went for that spiritual healing treatments for a few months until she felt better but not totally healed. She still felt tired and the whispering within her heart was still active on a number of occassions when she tried to go to sleep. All that time I kept quiet about my mother's past life as a spiritual healer from her until one late evening when Busu came to the rescue.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">It was a month before our marriage was to take place on the 7th March 1987. Noorasmah was staying with her youngest sister at Tampines. She had stayed there because her parents were separated after many years of misunderstandings. They were getting divorced.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">The apartment block was quiet and empty with many available flats for sales. Tampines area was not very popular at that time. Rubiah's flat was the only apartment that was occupied on that floor level. We were outside Rubiah's flat chatting at the common corridor about many things and observing the scenery in front of us one late evening. Right next to her flat was an empty apartment then suddenly Rubiah mentioned about the her neighbour's vacant flat. The three of us were talking something about why nobody wanted to stay in her block then she jokingly remarked, "You know I have stayed here for so long and this flat next to mine has been vacant for so long since the day I shifted here. Maybe there is a "Pontianak" (female vampire) living inside it."</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">When Noorasmah and I heard that statement, I knew Noorasmah was frightened and I felt goose-pimples behind my neck. Noorasmah scolded her sister for commenting like that. Later that night, I went back home as usual after spending time with Noorasmah and Rubiah.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">The next day when I met Noorasmah again at her sister's place, she told me she could not sleep all night because she was disturbed and tormented by a large Black Shroud phantom. Each time when she closed her eyes to sleep, she saw a large black shroud was spinning above her body and it was trying to cover her up. The thing could transform itself into may hands too and it kept coming at her. It tried to cover her up numerous times and at one staged it succeeded. She tried to chase away the thing by uttering Qur'anic holy verses but it was not afraid by her prayers. It tormented her until dawn prayer session, then it disappeared and the disturbances stopped completely. After that she could sleep. I told her probably it was only a bad nightmare while she was sleeping. She disagreed with me because she said she was awake and she it with her own eyes. She told Rubiah about it but she just listened without saying anything. That day she was afraid to stay at her sister's flat so I decided to bring her home to stay there with my family for a few days until she felt better. As for Rubiah, she was used to being alone with her two young daughters. Her husband was going through treatment again at the drug rehabilitation centre and he had been there for quite awhile. So I guessed she had no choice and I believed she was not so frightened like Noorasmah. I know she was a strong woman.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">That evening around 9 p.m. at my parents' flat, Noorasmah was folding her clothing in a bedroom. I was present with her and we were sitting on the floor talking. I was watching her folding up the clothes neatly, suddenly she remained silent and she behaved strangely. She was staring at me. Her face feature expression was different. Her head tilted slightly downward with the front hair covering part of her face and her eyes were staring straight at me fiercely as though she was angry. Then she grinned widely at me with her teeth fully bared like an evil demon, making deep ferocious and frightening animal like sounds. Then it suddenly attacked forward and growled at me loudly with her hands brought up clawed like. I fell backward. I was so shocked and frightened too with her unexpected personality changed. My parents heard the noise and came into the room quickly. They saw it and it turned to face them, showing them its ferocious and evil characteristics expression. I was still in a shocked and I felt frightful of whatever it was that took over control the body of Noorasmah.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">My father and mother shouted "Hey!" at it loudly and sternly. All of us were uttering Qur'anic holy verses quietly but nothing seemed to help the situation. They called out Noorasmah's name but it responded fiercely trying to frighten them and stopped them from coming nearer. My mother caught hold of its hands and tried to make it stopped from struggling. Noorasmah's personality came back on for a few seconds, crying for help but it disappeared and then changed to that animal like characteristics again. It tried to free itself from my mother's hands gripped hold and I had recovered from my frightful shocked to catch hold of its hands too. We felt its powerful strength unlike Noorasmah's characteristic. It was very strong and toughed. My mother was shouting at it to get out and at the same time calling for Noorasmah. Noorasmah's personality came back on again crying and pleading loudly for to us to help her from the evil thing but then the evil entity came back on again. Noorasmah could not control her body and we noticed too that she was not unconscious. She was aware of being possessed by an evil spirit but she could do anything to help herself. That was the first time I saw someone being possessed yet fully conscious about it. I had never encountered anything like it before in my life.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">My mother released her gripped on the evil entity's hands and told me to do the same thing. It sat down, it grinned impishly and growled at all of us. Noorasmah's personality came back on again for a few seconds and disappeared again, replaced by that evil thing again. We just looked at it thinking what to do next. At this point by eldest brother, Charles and my eldest sister, Wati, just got back home. They heard came in to the bedroom to investigate the commotion. Charles was a Christian and he saw it. Then he looked at it and commanded, "In the name of Jesus, I command you to leave this body." Nothing happened and it growled just as usual. Wati was afraid to come near it. Then all of them left the room leaving me alone with the evil spirit. Noorasmah's personality came back on again crying for me to help her and vanished again. Then strangely, the light inside the room went off and was totally shocked. Without thinking I asked the evil entity in English whether it caused the light to go off. I was surprised when it nodded to my question with its fierce mien. I felt the goose bumps all over my body. In my mind, I wondered to myself, "How come it could understand English?" I went to the light switch, pressed it on and off then the light came back on again. I guessed maybe the light switch was faulty.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">My parents came into the room again and my mother brought with her the brown coconut leave stems sweeper. My father was nearby and I was sitting next to my mother facing the evil entity. My mother was not unconscious, and then out of a sudden she turned aggressive and grabbed Noorasmah's hands. It was Busu. My father and I knew it was Busu.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">The evil entity cried out loudly trying to get away from Busu and he grabbed the sweeper angrily wanting to hit the evil thing with it but we stopped him from doing so. He grabbed hold of Noorasmah's hands again and it growled loudly at Busu, trying to get away from Busu. We could see Busu was angrily gesturing at it with his own ferocious behaviours too.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">There were no wrestling match and all this happened when both spirit entities were sitting down. Busu would grab the evil spirit's hands and it would try to unlock Busu's gripped. Then at one stage after we stopped Busu from hitting the evil spirit with the sweeper, Busu pulled the evil spirit's hair, used his hands to cover roughly onto the evil spirit face and then scorned at it with his own evil expression. We saw that the evil spirit was totally confused when Busu did that. We could see that the evil thing was afraid of Busu. Then suddenly there was no evil spirit and it seemed to have vanished. It lasted about five to ten minutes, then Noorasmah's personality came back on crying loudly and sobbing. And this time permanently. </span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">Busu turned to face my father, informed him with his angry face expression and hands gesturing that the evil spirit was still hiding inside Noorasmah's body. He grabbed hold of Noorasmah's hands, she cried loudly, frightened by Busu's actions. We understood that Busu was still trying to make sure that the evil spirit had left Noorasmah alone. It did not appear anymore and Busu then turned to my father, gestured to him a few things then left my mother's body. My mother was unconscious.</span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">Noorasmah stopped crying while I tried to comfort her and there was no possession anymore.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">Somehow another my father and I were relieved that Busu had turned up. There was no other way to chase away the evil entity out from Noorasmah's physical body. The scenario that I had witnessed was something I had never seen before except on that particular day. Two different spirits had possessed two human bodies and they were sort of fighting with each other. That was amazing, just like as though good versus evil, something like the angels and devils that were mentioned in most holy scriptures in the world.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">My mother regained her consciousness again and sat up from her reposed position. She told us that the evil spirit was also trying to possess her when she was in a trance and Busu was there to prevent it from happening. She said that the evil spirit that had possessed Noorasmah was like the 'Monkey God" of the Taoism faith. It could transform itself to a large Black Shroud with many hands. It was very evil. We asked her why was it that this spirit possessed Noorasmah. My mother told us that Noorasmah could have offended it and she too did not know what was the main reason it came to Noorasmah. </span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">My eldest sister, Wati, stated that this 'Monkey God' had possessed her colleague at one occasion. She went to the Chinese Temple to offer prayers to it to seek forgiveness. Her colleague became well after that. My parents refused that kind of suggestion because as Muslims, we were not supposed to offer any prayers to idols or to any other deities that Non-Muslims believed.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">I have to let you know that when Noorasmah came to my parent's home that day, we did not even mention anything to them about Noorasmah's experience and encounter with a Black Shroud phantom at Tampines. Noorasmah told them about it after the possession was over.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; font-family: Arial;">The next day, my father told us that he had dreamt of a big black being like a monkey had grabbed him from behind him. He had to go to the window and threw that thing out. I think that was only a nightmare but was it. That day onward, Noorasmah stayed with my parents under my mother's care until a week prior our wedding day. There was no more possession and she only went home to Tampines once in awhile to visit her sister and her nieces.</span></div>

              <div><span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #0000ff;">In our private worlds, God, our Creator, is mostly likely to whisper in the gentle stirrings of conviction, guidance, and the experiences of grace. But also in our private worlds is the grim reality of darker, shadowy forces that we identify with the word evil or sinfulness. If God whispers, evil often shouts, and personal worlds break when that shouting gets our attention.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #0000ff;">The principle of being silent with listening - We wished to be listeners to the deep sources where certain kinds of heavenly truth are tapped only by those who have a heart to be attentive. Soon we became aware that God has much to say that we had not been hearing. We were usually too busy and in places where the noise levels were too high. God will not shout, He whispers in the deep. Only those who stop long enough or who are stopped long enough hear the text of the message from the deep.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #ff0000;">Quoted on 18th April 1999 from the book 'Rebuilding My Broken World'.</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Noorasmah and I got married and two months later we shifted to our very own four rooms flat. We managed to get it quickly for this particular flat was vacant for nearly four years. Nobody seemed to like this particular flat maybe due to distance from their office or the flat was too small for them. This area was unpopular too at that time because there were no good amenities like transportation, market, schools and etc. I found it very nice for the common corridor was facing the Johor State of West Malaysia and I love the sea breeze. Furthermore, I needed to have my own flat fast for we wished to have a 'home sweet home' for ourselves. My parents' flat was already crowded and we needed privacy too.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The first night when my parents were sleeping at our new flat, my dad dreamt of seeing a big black figure. He woke up shouting but we took it as a nightmare. My mother was there to cleanse the flat from evil spirits and I thought everythin would be fine. Well, I guessed things go wrong when we are taking things for granted. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I was working for people from 1987 until early period of 1989. We were happy and there were no serious problems. We got all the items that we needed for our home. There were no possession for a long time until I went into my own business in May 1989. My business was not doing well and most of the time I had to seek helped from my family to generate more paid up capital into the business.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>During that period of 1989 to 1992, most of the time I was very committed to my business and I always returned home very late at night or in the early morning hours. The business of mine needed large funds to maintain the running cost and I disliked the idea of closing down the business because large amount of cash had been contributed. So I had to make sure that the business had to go on until I somehow another succeeded.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Noorasmah felt neglected and she was always alone at home because I was too busy with my business. She was like going into depression because of this and we always had misunderstanding pertaining to cash and my business. Her health was also deteriorating and probably she felt the stressed of haveing a husband who was in business and perhaps even irresponsible. Her asthmatic attacked was frequent and her health was becoming weaker due to her depression about our marriage life and our future together, which at that time seemed so gloomy. It looked as if we were not going to make it together.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>She stopped working completely in 1990 because she felt her health was deteriorating due to the frequent asthmatic attacks, and she was always in the state of mental stress and body fatigue. She was really ill in mind and body. We went to see many doctors and they diagnosed it as stressed and fatigue that caused her to experience frequent asthmatic attacked. One doctor even had advised me that probably my wife needed a chile in her life to make her happy and we should think of having a child. I had no objection to it but I let Allah to determine our lives whether it was time for us to have children at that time. There was no luck and we just went on with our daily lives as usual. She was the housewife and I was the businessman.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Noorasmah's mother in spiritual healing and witchcraft power too much. Whenever she felt ill, she would seek the spiritual healers to see whether anyone had charmed he in any way. They usually postulated that there were and she had to make sure that nobody did any harm to her by wearing talismans or consuming holy water or bathe in water polluted with flowers and small pieces of limes, provided by the spiritual healers. She went to many places for this reason, afraid of being charmed by other people that thought were angry or jealous of her.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>My mother-in-law had influenced my wife. They went to see a Malay female spiritual healer at Tiong Bahru. My father-in-law had influenced my wife too and they went to seek a Malay male spiritual healer at Yishun. They believed that their daughter was unhealthy due to being charmed by other people. They had advised Noorasmah to have faith and try it out or perhaps Noorasmah had prayed to Allah for good health but it was not fulfilled. Maybe she thought to herself that the doctors could not do anything to make her health better and began to believe that spiritual healing was the only option. Probably in the past she was charmed by that Malay man or possessed by the evil spirit were the reasons she felt justified to go for spiritual healing sessions again. Finally, she was hooked by those spiritual healers' exploitations and her prayers to Allah was insufficient or ineffective for her to be well again. Whatever her reasons were, I could not make myself to agree totally with her decision but she insisted strongly partly because she believed in the dark and good forces in the unseen realm could influence her health. Muslims are taught to believe the existence of the good and evil forces in the unseen realm and I know other faiths too taught their followers likewise. So what could I say but just to let it be whatever they believed in their faiths.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Those two spiritual healers that my wife went to seek for spiritual healings had secretly informed her and had accused that my own mother had charmed her. She did not tell me but I had intuitions after she had refused to allow my own mother to treat her again. When I asked her she denied it and I kept quiet about it. I did not inform by mother about it.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>At Yishun, the Malay "Bomoh" told us that there was an old woman from the spirit world, she had lived in our flat long before we shifted in and she had regarded my wife like her own daughter. This female 'Djinn" supposedly had many spirit followers too. She wished to make my wife like her own daughter, to take care and protect her from being harmed or ill by humans from the physical world and spirits from the unseen realm. She did want to see Noorasmah unhappy and unhealthy. However, this Malay male "Bomoh" too supposedly had his own spirit followers in the "Djinn" world. His spirit followers were supposedly warriors specialising in the Malay martial arts and they were trying to chase away the old woman spirit from my wife's life. Whenever the Malay male "Bomoh" came to inspect our flat, he would faint in the guest bedroom because his spirit followers would possess him when the old woman spirit and her spirit followers were present. It seemed that the guest room was her main sleeping area. This Malay "Bomoh" would then sat up in crossed legs and conversed with those unseen spirits before him. His eyes were closed and after they had communicated he would be unconscious again.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Later he told us that he had already ordered the spirit entities to leave us alone because he too had declared that we were like his children. Should they refused, then there would be war in the spirit world between his spirit followers and the old woman spirit followers. We ended up sleeping over at his flat for a few days because my wife was frightened to stay in our own flat. Then again we would go there again whenever my wife felt frightened or when she was alone at home. I hated to yield to her requests but she was really frightened. I needed to work and I had difficulties concentrating on my business. I ended up being depressed and unhappy too because of this reason.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Once while at the Malay male spiritual healer's flat, Noorasmah was possessed by a male spirit entity from the unseen realm and she began to do some "Kung-Fu" movements with her hands. He was a Non-Muslim spirit entity and he was one of the followers of the old woman spirit. He spoke Chinese and my wife was actually ignorant of Chinese language. I heard it and it daunted my mind for I knew that Chinese male spirit entity was very strong when I tried to hold her hands while the Malay healer was mumbling some holy verses to counter the spirit that possessed my wife's body. I could see the face expression of the spirit entity was in vained and he really had difficulties to move his hands too. At the end he left my wife's body. Before he did that, he said "I want to run away" in Chinese. It was in Hokkien dialect.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>At Tiong Bahru, the Malay female spiritual healer claimed she had female Fairy followers claiming to be living in the sky. Once I saw my wife being possessed at her flat and Noorasmah was squatting, jumping up and down like a monkey when the female "Bomoh" blew a whistle. While Noorasmah was still in that trance state, I questioned her in English whether she was able to pray to Allah. She replied "Yes!" in English to me. In my mind I was wondering how come the entity that possessed her could understand English. It seemed that Noorasmah could not remember what had happened and I was not sure whether she was conscious or unconscious but she did not faint. Furthermore, after Noorasmah was herself again, she did not even mentioned anything to me about her strange behaviours. I did not question her about it for I felt she already went through enough with the spiritual healing session. So I just forego my curiosity.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Each time when any spiritual healers failed to make Noorasmah better, my mother-in-law and my wife would seek out for different spiritual healers. They had always mentioned that this healer or that healer uttered Qur'anic holy verses or they were using the healing methods of Islamic teachings. We went to one place at Marsiling whereby the Malay female spiritual healer and her husband claimed to have many spirit followers of Malay martial art warriors from the spirit world. Her husband would write something on the floor with his forefinger while his wife would be unconscious using her finger movements too to communicate with the spirits from the unseen realm. They too told us that there was an old woman spirit living in our flat and she had regarded Noorasmah like her own daughter. She was there long before we had shifted in to our flat. All these information frightened Noorasmah until she was uncomfortable when she stayed at home alone in the day or at night. To be honest with you, I was afraid too but I usually tried to disregard their information and ignored the presence of the old woman entity in the unseen world was living together with us at our flat. Sometimes we stayed over at their flat for spiritual healing treatments.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Soon I became almost like Noorasmah and the spiritual healer at Marsiling gave me talismans to ward off evil spirits. My own mother started to give me talisman for business and for self-protection from being harmed physically or spiritually. She too told me that there was an old woman spirit entity presence in our flat but she did not wish to indulge for she found out that Noorasmah had been treated by other spiritual healers. That really hurt her and I kept mummed about it. Finally she found out and she let the other spiritual healers to ward off the evil demons from our flat and from our lives. I did not really know why she did that but she felt hurt and she only linked her own spirit followers to me alone for my wife already distrusted my mother.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Then one day Noorasmah and I started to go to Benut, Johore State of West Malaysia. She had sorted for new spiritual healer again and somebody informed her about this place. I relented to her request to go there. The same treatment and procedure I saw in Singapore and I had always looked at it doubtfully. Sometimes I just gave them the benefit of doubts.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>During the time when Noorasmah received this treatment from the Malay female "Bomoh" from Malaysia, one night I woke up and I saw Noorasmah was massaging her feet, legs and hands. I asked her what she was doing and she told me that it was not her who was doing the massaging. She seemed conscious and she knew it was not her action. I had seen her while being possessed by evil spirits so I thought maybe this spirit entity was good. She felt safe and I just watched her. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Sometimes while at home, with her face downcast and her front hair coveing part of her face, she would suddenly turned like someone else for a few seconds. She would looked at me directly with a slight impish smile. Then I would call to her sternly to stop that and she would be normal again as though nothing had happened. It seemed she was unaware about it because when I queried her why she did that, she seemed sort of lost about my inquiry.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Those few occasions when she was possessed, I saw she was conscious. She knew about her situation and it frightened her so much. She had already depended so much on the spiritual healers to control her life from the evil spirits that were disturbing her. She had trusted the spiritual healers' opinions more than her own husband and these business of spiritual healing were destroying our marriage lives. I was always busy with my own business and she felt neglected. Probably, she even suffered from mental demanic depression, which I had not realised.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I was so annoyed with all the spiritual healing sessions. So I began to spend more time at the office and we became quite estranged. I regretted for doing that business and I wished I had spent more time with her to make our lives more meaningful. I was very ambitious with my future. I wanted to be rich, famous and powerful.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In November 1991, I needed more funds to maintain my business so I went around to influence people about my ideas of making fast profitable money. I had created a 'get rich quick' scam. I knew it was a very foolish action but I took that risks. I knew it was against the law and should I failed to recover my losses and returned the investment money to the investors, I knew I was going to jailed. I was desperate. I thought I could use the hard cash and pay them back. I failed completely. I was scared of the investors. At the end I fled to Indonesia because I could not pay them back of their capitals plus high profits that I had promised.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>On 20th August 1992, I fled without Noorasmah's knowledge. She did not know my whereabout. We were legally divorced on 25th May 1994 when I was absent from Singapore while I was living as a fugitive and an illegal immigrant in Bali. We were separated over ten years, from August 1992 to December 2002 because of my own foolish action.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>After my released from imprisonment, we reconciled as busband and wife. It was a long journey before I could return home again to her and now I am trying to make her happy as best as I can. We are no longer believers of spiritual healing anymore and Noorasmah is a very good Muslim who believes in the Power of Almighty Allah regardless of her ill or good health now.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I have to digress for awhile here. Writing in Chapter Six and Seven about these possessions and spiritual healings is not something that I enjoyed to write about. It is as though I hailed the spirits or supernatural beliefs, which I now do not really like to indulge in too much. I wrote all these stories from chapter one to the present chapter for you to see for yourself that by believing in such things like these would make you like fools without good intelligence or conscience. It would not help you but it would only destroy your life instead of improving your life. It would deteriorate you in mind and body. It would affect your relationship with your family and society too. This should be avoided and you should have more faith with yourself before you have faith in your religion or God. Follow the laws that are good and those that are not good, probably you have to contemplate for yourself whether to hold on to it or ignore them.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Times changes and we have to change with time too. It is just like when you know A is already false, would you still believe in A or would you move on to B for you to search for better knowledge and probably you would gain new truth in your development as humans.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>My own opinion of good or evil forces presence in the unseen world is that it is only superstitious belief and probably I would never believe in it again till my last breath. I believe they are souls of mankind. They are harmless unless you believed that have mighty powers.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Those of us who have these beliefs about evil and good spirits in the unseen world that could influence humans in their health and in their daily lives should review the fundamental facts that your bad or good actions are yours. Do not blame the evil spirits for your evil actions and do not depend on the good spirits to help you with your good actions. You must learned to blame yourself when you do something bad and give yourself a good pat for doing something good. Perhaps we should just stop talking about the good or bad spirits presence in the unseen world; then we could eradicate the superstitious beliefs of good and evil forces in the unseen world.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I relented to Noorasmah's request for spiritual healing treatments due to the facts that I was unable to help her with her health and partly I was ignorant of the psychological effect upon her. I was not religious or highly educated. I have only Secondary Four education level. It showed how dangerous it is to have lacked of education or no education at all. Probably I did not do much reading on books that would give me more knowledge about the world in general and developed my own intelligence. I only managed to do that when I was in prison.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Supernatural or Spiritual or Faith healing is not in the agenda of Science because it is not reliable. Scientists need to see the process of healing can be repeated continuously before they can say it is true. They need to measure their results and they need to see the facts and data of producing such results.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Whether these stories have any relevancy to you depends on what you see the mind of yours can do. The mind is meant for us to think logically and intelligently for our lives to go forward and never to use it for such things as witchcraft beliefs or maybe some superstitious beliefs of good and evil forces in the unseen world. Those evil and good forces are meant for us humans to use it or control it within our lives as humans and not with the spirits in the unseen world. I regarded myself as a fool for believing such things in the past and I revealed all these stories for you to judge for yourself where you stand in regards to this matter of good and evil knowledge or spirits.</div>

              <div> </div>
              <div>I fled to Jakarta, Indonesia, in the early morning of 20th August 1992. Noorasmah did not know about my intention of fleeing from Singapore after I had sent her to her eldest sister's flat at Ang Mo Kio. In fact that particular day, in my mind, I had no plan to flee but while I was driving along the expressway, I had thought about the money that I was supposed to return to the investors. I knew I had insufficient cash for I had used it for earlier payments to the investors, business, entertainments and oversea trips to Jakarta. I was too tired and exhausted of running around collecting cash and waiting for the others who knew me personally to cash in their investment collected from those people who had entrusted their cash with them. I lacked of sleep and I lost some weights too. I looked like a Zombie.</div>

              <div>Normally, we would arrange to meet at any five stars hotel for this project and later we would go home when payments and collections of cash were completed. That day, I knew I would be in trouble for most of them would prefer to have their capitals and profits paid to them. They would like to see their cash instead of rolling it over to the next investment project that I had scheduled, which I would normally do to entice them with a higher profits margin and to prolong the investment scheme while I source for new investors directly or indirectly. That morning of 20th August 1992, I have had enough worries and troubles with my own creation of bogus investment scam. I decided to end all this for I had feared that my life would be at stake when I failed to pay their money plus profits.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>So while driving, my mind was in chaostic states and within my heart, I could feel a voice was whispering to me to flee from Singapore continuously non-stop. I ended up at the Singapore Long Season Parking complex on the third floor near near Changi International Airport of Terminal One. I stopped the car engine and thought for quite awhile about my intention of fleeing. I called my wife for I felt that I needed to hear her voice for the last time before I left her. She did not have any idea of what was about to happen. That day I was supposed to fetch her from her sister's place after her driving test. I left without any noticed because I knew she would not let me go if I told her the truth. She did not even know about my troubles and the crime I had committed until my own close-colleagues, investors and police had informed her about it. I had fled before they made a police report against me.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I switched off my motorola handphone and placed it inside the car front compartment. I cleared my car and brought along all the investment papers with me, which I had put it in my dunhill briefcase. It was so coincidental that I had a small hand carried luggage with the clothings that my wife had packed the previous night. That evening we were supposed to return to the spiritual healer's flat at Marsiling for the healing session. I closed the car doors and left the Mercedez Benz 280 SE at the carpark. I went to the SIA counter and bought the latest flight out that was available. I left Singapore around 10.00 a.m. and I only had S$8000 my wallet.     </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>When the plane took off from Changi International Airport, I felt like a man without any past. I knew I could not return to Singapore again unless I was willing and prepared to face imprisonment.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I met Yani at Jakarta in April 1992 when I went for a ship cruised to Indonesia and a three days holiday trip in Jakarta. It was my first visit to Indonesia. She was only nineteen years old and I was twenty-nine years old. She was a Javanese from one of the province in East Java. She worked as a dance hostess at Hailai Executive Nightclub to earn good income for her father and four younger siblings at her village. She had only worked there for only about a month when I knew her. That was the first time I had patronised a nightclub with my sales manager and my investor colleagues that invested with me in my bogus investment scam. I paid for all their expenses except for their dance hostess fees and tips.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Yani knew that I was a married man. I told her about my estrangement with my wife. She was formerly a Muslim but later she converted to the Roman Catholic faith while working as a baby sitter or nanny for a well do to family in Jakarta for many years. Her employer and later more like a guardian, was a Christian so Yani had converted to that faith because she felt that since she was like an adopted daughter to her old lady guardian, she felt that it was her duty to please that foster mother of hers. But later she left her because she was so strict and possessive in administering Yani's life. That was her downfall and she rented a room in Tebet district of Jakarta. Her landlords became like her foster family. She was very young and she worked as a salesgirl in retail shop for awhile before she worked as a dance hostess. She wanted to earn more money for her family and for herself. It was insufficient for to sustain a life in Jakarta while looking for a better future for her family back home and for herself.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>So after I knew Yani just for that particular day, whether fate or the Will of God took its effect, she became my mistress. After our acquaintance, I often flew to Jakarta for a rendezvous with Yani. I had lied to Noorasmah that I had a future business plans and meetings in Jakarta. She was unaware of my extramarital affair until the day I fled to Indonesia.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>On the day I fled, I wanted to meet Yani and informed her about my intention of fleeing from Singapore and to elope together with her. I wanted to know whether she was willing to follow me. If she had refused, I would probably return to Singapore again and faced the music. I had told her that if I returned to Singapore she would probably be unable to see me again. I did not tell her exactly what I had committed and what would happen to me should I return to Singapore. I only informed her that my business and life was going down the drain and she trying to calm me down but I refused to let her know more than she should know what really had happened in Singapore. It was my fault for not talking to her sincerely that I was a con man and the money that I had was all a made belief for my own delusionised dream to materialise, to boost my own false ego-eccentricity megalomania image as a successful businessman and a millionaire. She thought that I was really a millionaire for we spend the money like water and I had provided her with some cash to sustain her life in Jakarta while I was away. She had trusted me and she thought that I was a scruplous gentleman. So, that very day of August 20th 1992, she had agreed to my suggestion and we loped together. We left Jakarta because my close colleagues knew the residence of Yani. We left Jakarta and headed for her village in East Java.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>We headed to the small town of Solo in East Java. We reached there in the early morning of 21st August 1992. There we stayed in a small hotel called Sakar Ayu, near the bus terminally in Solo. Our idea was to search for Yani's long lost mother, Suparti. She left her family when Yani was only a little girl of ten years old. The day when her village was struck by a ferocious storm, her house collapsed and her mother left them in destitute without informing her family. Suparti also had some family problems with her younger brother who frequently had always tormented her for family wealth to be under his name, though he was living in a larger family house next to his sister. He was actually trying to make Suparti to sell their small piece of land that Suparti had built a house for her family. Suparti's husband had no right to the land for he was considered an outsider though he was Suparti's husband. He came from a poor family too and that was considered among Javanese villagers as a man without any wealth or future, eventhough he was quite popular in his own village as the actor. He, Kino, Suparti's younger brother, was a drunk and an aggresive gambler too. He was supposedly the "Jago" or champion in his village. It was his idea that male member of the Javanese family had every right to tell his sister to do as he wish. Their parents were old people and they left all their wealth to Kino, the only son in the family.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Suparti had worked hard for her family. She was a small businesswoman who had some commodities of raw white rice and she would go around the neighbourhood in the village to take orders. Yani's father, Pak Sardi was a traditional Javanese Opera actor in their village. His fees was insufficient to support his family and yet he was addicted to gambling. Sometimes Yani would follow her mother in the middle of the night to seek for her father at the gambling den to force him to return home. So all these problems had actually caused Suparti's to leave her family that night quietly when the ferocious storm hit the village. She was like a woman who had lost all hopes to live perhaps and then left her family without any sign.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Since then Yani had long for her mother's love and she felt guilty for being unable to help her mother. And Yani did confessed to me that she was very young that time to understand her mother's love for her when her mother fiercely scolded her for being mischievous. She had never abused Yani physically. Yani had realised that pure love of her mother for her when she became a young beautiful woman. And later she had found out that her father, Pak Sardi, was not her biological father. Her unknown biological father could not marry Suparti because he was a son of a wealthy family. Yani was an illegitimate daughter and Yani's grandparents had persuaded Pak Sardi to marry Suparti in order to concealed the family good name and honour.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>We went to search for Yani's mother, Suparti, at the wet market in Solo and in the past there was a rumour that Suparti was being taken care by an elderly man who was living in Solo. She was supposedly helping him in some small business, a small stall selling some commodities in the wet market in Solo. He supposedly was trying to help Suparti to regain her full health again physically and mentally. The stranger did actually came to meet Suparti's family but left no words of his residence, maybe due to fact that Suparti wanted her whereabouts to be unknown to her own family. Pak Sardi himself had informed Yani that he did really tried all his best to search for her mother but there was no news about her. I suspected that maybe Yani's mother wanted to divorce him too and later when he discovered that, he told his children that their mother had disappeared without a trace. I think Yani did not know about this but I guessed it was his fault too that Suparti left her family in search of a better future.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>So, at the end, after staying at Sakar Ayu Hotel for about a week, we headed for Yani's village at Madiun, East Java. We had failed our attempt in search of Yani's mother. There were a number of small wet markets in Solo and I wanted Yani to look for her mother for one reason, to bring Suparti home to her family. Then Yani and I could love her like a family. During my stay at the hotel, I was like a man reflecting and reflecting of what I had done. Even during the bus journey to Solo, I was very silent because my mind was thinking of Noorasmah. I had left her without any words too just like Suparti left her own family.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>We stayed at Yani's village house for about three days. We knew that Yani's landlords at Jakarta would yield to those people who were looking for us eventhough we had informed them specifically not to reveal Yani's village address to those people no matter what happened. And besides that, the head villager wanted to see my identity certificate to justify my stay in their village. It was a regulation they adhere should any stranger wanted to stay in that village. At the end, they denied me to stay stay there longer because I was not married to Yani yet. That was only an excuse from them to get some fast cash from me and denied them the opportunity to do that on me. So we decided to leave Yani's family at the village and checked into a small hotel in Madiun town, called Merdeka Hotel. True enough, my sales manager managed to locate us with the help of Yani's uncle, Kino. Yani's family did not know about our problems. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Din was accompanied by Yani's supposedly good friend, Kenny. She knew her while working at Hailai Executive Nightclub. Kenny was the mistress of one of my close colleague who had followed me to Jakarta in April 1992. He was infactuated with Kenny. He was also a married man with one son. His wife found out about his extramarital affair after the whole bogus scam had blown apart in the open. He often took a trip to Jakarta for this reason and his wife thought that he had some business dealings in Jakarta too. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Din had queried me that night whether I was willing to return home to Singapore because the investors were looking for me. Din and the others would be in trouble should I failed to return to Singapore to explain about the investment money. And he came in peace to meet me. Din and the others did not know about the bogus scam until I told them about it. They were so shocked to learn about that secret and most of them abandoned me after they had found out about it. They were too terrified  but they did not informed their investors about it for they thought that I had the capacity to pay the investors their money back. And they had trusted me but at the end, I fled from them quietly. So that night, Din had asked me why I should involve Yani and her family with my problem. They did not know anything about the real deep trouble that I was involved. So, why not returned to Singapore and face the music. Din had actually spoken to me like this, "Zul, I cannot stand toether with you anymore if you fail to return with me to Singapore. If you refuse to come with me, then I have to stand together with the investors." I thought about what he had said and my replied to him and to the others was, "Tell the others that I'm not coming back. Its not your fault or their fault. I've plan to stay in Indonesia and never to return to Singapore again. So, I want you and the rest, to make a police report, and point the fingers at me."</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>We left the hotel in the early morning. I told Din and he gave me some cash of S$500 for he knew I had insufficient cash in my pocket. Yani and I bid him farewell and we caught a trishaw to go to the bus terminal. Once there, we took a bus to Surabaya. We went to so many places and stayed in many hotels in Java. We were so uncertain of our future and our destiny. Then in the early part of September 1992, we temporarily stayed with a farmer with his family in Jombang. His wife was a spiritual healer too. </div>

              <div> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Note: The word "Cak" or "Mas" means Brother and "Mbak" means Sister or Miss or Misses in English. "Mbah" means an elderly person or Grandparent.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>They were Muslim family. Cak Pur and Mbak Rani were very kind towards us. They had a son name Iwan. Cak Pur's was in his late forties and Mbak Rani was in her mid-thirties when I met them. Iwan was around three years old. This couple was a close relative to Yani's landlord in Jakarta. So, at the end, we turned to them for their help. They helped us to get married somewhere late September 1992 and at the same time we had changed our identity.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>While staying with them, I learned from Yani that Mbak Rani was a spiritual healer. In "Bahasa Indonesia" or Indonesian language, they are called "Dukun". In layman termed is called "Orang Pintar" or clever person in the art of supernatural healings and sometimes witchcrafts. She also rendered her special gift to people who were in need. I learned that her spirit followers or the "Djinns" were sort of different from what I had witnessed and seen in Singapore. They had identified themselves as Mbah Eton (female), Mas Noh (male), Mbak Seri (female), Mastro (male), Mbak Mary (female) and there was a Baby entity that I was not so sure whether it was a male or female because I did not asked Mbak Rani herself or Cak Pur. It never came to my mind.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Mbah Eton was the decease mother of Mbak Rani. Mas Noh and Mbak Seri were like the children of Mbah Eton. They were very obedient to Mbah Eton. Mastro was a mute entity who was jovial. Mbak Mary was an entity from Surabaya, who supposedly had committed suicide and came to live together with Mbah Eton and her family. And lastly, the Baby entity and the name was unknown to me. They were the souls of decease human beings. In Islamic teachings, there is no such things as a communication with the dead. That was something that I was taught in Islam, which was impossible. In the past when I was still a Muslim, I thought that those mediums who had communicated with the dead were all frauds. So did not pay much attention to it until I met Mbak Rani.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The spirit followers of Mbak Rani from the unseen realm had never asserted that they were the "Djinns", which were mentioned in the Islamic Teaching. They had never claimed that they were the "Djinns" from under the sea or the Fairies from the sky or the Malay "Pendekar" (martial art warriors) like those "Djinns" from Singapore. When we conversed with them, we talked to them as though they were normal human beings. We addressed them by their own 'human' names without the grand epithet titles of "Dewi" (Fairy) or "Pendekar" unlike with the spirit followers of the "Bomohs" in Singapore. Mbah Eton flatly told us who she was and had been to Mbak Rani and Mbak Mary told my wife Yani that she had committed suicide in Surabaya for reason which was unknown to me. Perhaps Yani knew about it but she did not disclose it to me and I did not even bother to query too at that time, which I am now regretting. Mas Noh, Mbak Seri and Mastro did not mention to Yani and I about themselves for reasons they alone could answer. They loved to joke to Yani in Javanese language and I would listen to their conversation. Then later, Yani would translate it to me. Once they came in the evening, then they immediately smelled Mbak Rani's clothing and body. They made unpleasant and funny expressions, complaint that it was very smelly and reminded us to informed Mbak Rani to take a bath first prior their coming to meet us. That day, Mbak Rani had not taken her bath and changed her clothing the whole day. We laughed when we saw their reactions and heard their funny remarks. And they had laughed too, together with us. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I wonder why those spirits or "Djinns" in the unseen realm in Singapore and in fact in Malaysia too, do not disclosed their true identities until they have to lie to us humans?</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Cak Pur had told us that he had a wife before he got married to Mbak Rani. His first wife had died in childbirth at the padi fields alone during his absence. The child was supposed to be his first son but both the mother and child did not survive the ordeal. He and his first wife had lived in the same house that he and Mbak Rani had lived in. He told us that the house brought many memories to him about his decease first wife. Initially after his first wife death, he had thought about selling it but then Mbak Rani came into his life and he decided to stay. That house of his was built with the hands of his first wife too and they had slowly built it for their future life together and children. Both of them, grew up from the same village and they had known each other since they were children. Mbak Rani, his second wife, was from Surabaya and Cak Pur met her when Cak Pur was in Surabaya while shopping for his farming equipments and supplies. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
              <div>Mbak Rani was able to call upon her decease mother at her own will. She would lie down on a bed to close her eyes. I was unsure whether she was unconscious or conscious for when she woke up, she seemed normal as usual but her behaviours and the way she spoke would be entirely different from her normal self. Then Mbah Eton and the rest of them would take control of Mbak Rani's physical body. When they had possessed Mbak Rani's physical body, these spirits could actually get up and walked to the toilet when nature's call for it, just like any ordinary living human beings. Perhaps, they could feel that Mbak Rani's physical body needed to go to the toilet and they were helping her to do just that. We could hear the water being splashed in the bathroom. I did not know exactly know why or how they could do that but that was something I (or maybe you) had never witnessed before because normally I had thought that possessed humans would be unable to do that. I had never seen that kind of action done by a possessed human being or by a spirit in Singapore or in Malaysia. I was really amazed by the spirits action.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>We spoke to them in Javanese or 'Bahasa' Indonesia language and they would usually advised my second wife, Yani, and I to be happy with our new life. Mbah Eton had always advised Yani to be a good wife. Once, Mbah Eton had advised us that it was more important to seek happiness and wealth was not difficult to find because we could look for it. The spirit entity Mbak Mary and the rest had always conversed with Yani too. When the spirit entity of a Baby came, we left it alone. This infant entity acted like any human baby would behave. I had thought that maybe this spirit entity was the child of Mbak Seri. And this Mbak Seri might be the decease soul of Cak Pur's first wife. But I just let it be for I was ignorant of life after death knowledge back then. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Once Mbak Rani wanted to call Mbah Eton because she was sad. Prior to Mbah Eton's visits, Yani had sensed there were flower fragrance emanating within the house, wafting through the air.   </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Once Mbak Seri had demonstrated to us her ability of vanishing a Rp1000 Indonesian currency in front of Yani and I. We watched her every moved that she made very carefully and closely. To Yani and I, it was not a tricked or an illusion. Mastro too did the same thing with a Rp20000 Indonesian currency. I had never witnessed a spiritual healer performed that kind of ability in Singapore or Malaysia. I had only witnessed that kind of trick from the magicians. Mbak Rani was not a magician but an ordinary woman who could be possess by many spirit entities from the unseen realm.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Their method was simple. They had rolled the currencies with two hands, rubbing it until it became like a thin long scroll. The two ends of the currency that jagged out from their right hand would then be folded inside their right hands. Their left hand was over their right hand. Then they would blow it slowly about 3 to 4 inches in front of their mouth and then opened up both hands. They even opened their mouth. The currencies vanished. Probably we got ripped off by those two spirit entities or Mbak Rani herself by this tricked. Perhaps Mbak Rani needed some cash but I doubted it for Mbak Rani was not that kind of lady. Mastro did asked for money from us because he mentioned that he wished to go Irian Jaya Province and he said that usually walked to that far distance province. We did not asked him why he needed that Rp20000 and we had thought that the spirit world needed money too. Hence, he had shown us the similar vanishing money act similar to Mbak Seri.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Cak Pur told Yani and I that each time when his wife had treated someone with spiritual healing, money were offered and usually the money would be given to the spirits personally and they would make the money disappeared. Whenever Cak Pur or Mbak Rani were really in need of money, then the spirits would give them the money. They wanted both of them to work for a living like any ordinary human beings.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Mas Noh once had told Yani and I that he had plenty of cash and among them, Mbah Eton had the most. In fact Mbah Eton's cash had filled up a whole room. When I heard that, I asked him whether he would loan me some cash should I requested for it from him. He said he would. Then I persisted on about my questioned further about the loan, whether he would really loan me some cash. I saw there was anger in his face expression as though I had disbelieved him. He had stared at me and I did not asked him for the cash loan or to proof to me that he could do that. I let him go. We were guests and I did wish to offend our host.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Once I had seek Mas Noh's assistance to inform my own mother in Singapore about my good health and well being. He agreed to it. Upon returning, he told us that he disliked Singapore environment because the spirits in the spiritual world there were snobbish and unfriendly. He disliked the water there too because to him it tasted funny. I think he was so used to well water instead of tap water from the reservoirs. He met a beautiful young spirit woman wearing orange attires at my parent's flat. She was unfriendly and she was a stuck-up. However, he had complimented about the large windows at my parent's flat. He claimed to have travelled there by a ship. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Two days later, I called my own mother in the middle of the night whether she had dreamt anything. She replied to me that she did. She saw a Javanese man wearing a black headdress or 'Songkok' and she woke up. Then she immediately told my father about her dream. Well, each time when Mas Noh came to meet us, he would request for the black headdress to wear on his head.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>My mother had told me that she had consulted and seek the helped from her spirit followers from the unseen world and it was not easy for her to ask for their helped in protecting me in Indonesia. She had to fast for seven days before they relented to her request. She told me that Busu had agreed to help me in Indonesia. Later Busu came through Mbak Rani's physical body to meet Yani and I. He seemed angry at Yani for being involved with me even though she knew I was a married man. He sort of disliked Yani's attitude towards me, especially when she was being stubborn when I had tried to console and comfort her or when she was unhappy with the situations that we were facing together. He came to meet me many times through Mbak Rani. Once he had encouraged me to eat more and told me in his mute gesturings not be unhappy about my life.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Surprisingly, sometimes he spoke and sometimes he made himself like a mute. Maybe Mbak Rani heard Busu's whisperings and she had told me exactly what Busu wanted me to do. Maybe it was Busu himself and maybe it was Mastro. Both of them were mute spirit entities and they both had funny characteristics and behaviours. Which come to the question here. Whether Busu was Busu or Mastro or other spirit entities that could act like Busu's characteristics and behaviours? When my mother had informed me that Busu willingness to help me, I did not mention it to Yani or Mbak Rani or Cak Pur. A few days later when Mbak Rani was in the altered state of consciousness, Mbah Eton told me that my mother's spirit follower, Busu, was with her. Busu wanted to meet and conversed with me. True enough Busu came and met me and he was the usual Busu that I knew in the past with his familiar characters and behaviours. I had followed his mute gesturings and the stories he had told me about my mother in the past and also at that present time. He gestured to me about the things I did that only I had known. Yani was ignorant of my past for I did not tell so much about my past life. That I gathered was to show to me that he was really Busu and not some other spirit entities. I confirmed it and it was Busu. How did Mbak Rani could have known about Busu when I did not even mention to her or Yani or Cak Pur about Busu?    </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Mbak Rani had mentioned to us that some neighbours had thought that she was mad and she knew about it but she had ignored about their gossips. Most psychic practitioners would face this kind of humiliation. I had met her personally and observed her characters and behaviours while I was living with them for two months. She was normal and rational in dealing with her daily routines as a wife and a mother. She communicated with us general things like any normal and sane people would. She did not talk about her spirit followers from the unseen realm until we asked her. And she did not discussed about religion matters to us though she was pious. And she did not complaint to us about her hardship life as a farmer too. Cak Pur and Mbak Rani were very contented couple, who were happy with their life as farmers without so much wealth. They were a happy family.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Mbak Rani's was like my own mother and it was not because of their assistance that they had rendered to Yani and I that I made this assertion. I had observed her and saw her functioning like any woman would and she was a kind hearted woman that was willing to help anybody who genuinely needed her help. We did give them some cash for their assistance but it was not the main reason they were kind to us. The cash offer did not influence their daily lives. They were not 'money-face' human beings that many of you thought was inherent in every Indonesians. They were sincere and honest people.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I knew it was illogical for spirits to have money in their world but to some of us who believe in the unseen world seriously, they would believe it. Chinese with Taoism faith believes in burning hell banknotes for their decease ancestors or loved ones in Hereafter for their lives to be happy in the unseen world. So when Mas Noh told me that Mbah Eton and himself having so much money in their world, I just left that information as it was. As for the Muslims, they believes that in another world where Djinns live, they have all the things we have too in our world of mankind. If you asked me now whether I believed or disbelieved, I would say I disbelieved them now. Why they had lied to me back then? I would say that they used my Islamic Belief and they told me accordingly to what I had been taught in my Islamic Faith back then. And for your information, this included my own late mother's spirit followers from the spirits world. They used that kind of information to make you believed in your belief in them that were mentioned in my former faith or your religion. I believed them back then and I was so convinced with their stories maybe because the Djinns existence is stated in the Holy Qur'an.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>When Mbah Eton told us that she was the decease mother of her own living daughter, Mbak Rani, I did not ponder about it so much but I had just thought about it as a passing statement that maybe acclaimed by a Muslim Djinn or a Spirit. Anyway, back then, I was too ignorant about the higher learning pertaining to the soul existence and the world of spirits.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I would compare it something like when a Christian that experiencing the anointment of the Holy Spirit and he or she begins to speak in tongue, in a state of rapture with God's Grace upon them. Then the Holy Spirit would speak in foreign languages and it would advise to the audiences around them and the listeners would believe the Holy Spirit's words as God's messages to them.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The Taoists believed in their temple mediums who could be possess by their gods or deities and they believed in the predictions or the remedies for illnesses offered by the temple mediums without any doubts. It was something like that for me back then.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Whether we should see those people who spoke in tongue or as a medium or as a messenger of god, as a possession or as in an altered state of consciousness or as a split personality, it is up to each individual of you to find out for yourself. We have to do our own research work on these mysterious matters which I strongly believe that everyone of us wish to know more, like a 'scientist'. It would help us to understand more about the mysterious things about the souls, ghosts, evil spirits, good spirits, devils, angels and God. After you have gathered all your supposedly aspect of facts finding, you probably would be unafraid of them in your life anymore. In many cases too it would help you to have a stronger faith within your religion and God. Probably it would help you to erase the blind faith elements that you have had within yourself in the past. Then that experience would change you into a new person. To become a new person, it require you to challenge your own fear and only after you have surmounted your own fear, then you would be prepare to change your perception about your own life and perhaps on others too. You would change and come out from your own circled-barrier world and see things with a wider scope as though you have seen the world for the first time, just like when you were born to the physical world for the first time.</div>

              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #ff0000;">Zulkifli Mahmood (20th August 1992 to 29th December 1995 - Indonesia)</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I felt uncomfortable living for a long duration in someone elses home and I did not wish to burden Cak Pur's family further with my problems. Furthermore, the villagers seemed to look at Yani and I in askance because to them I looked like a foreign Chinese or Japanese national. Some of them thought that I was from Hong Kong and some of them thought that I was from Japan. I was not working and they were probably wondering that I had so much cash. I did not want to be so conspicuous because that would only attract more crowds to our presence. So, I told Yani that we needed to find a place to settle down and see what we could do for ourselves for a livelihood.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>We left Cak Pur's and Mbak Rani's house, informing them that we would be back again after we toured Java and we would let them know of our address should we decide to settle down somewhere permanently. Our motive was to leave them without any knowledge of our whereabouts because though they were kind and honest people, we could not take that risk, just in case people started to query about us. When we left their house, in my mind, I somehow knew that Busu would be coming along with us, wherever we intended to go. He was supposed to guide and protect us as to what my own mother had said. I believed her and I trusted Busu.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>We went to many places in Sumatra, Batam, Java, Bali and Lombok. As we travelled, we looked for suitable places that we would like to settle down. It was also a good exposure and experience for me to know more about Indonesia, since I was going to be like an Indonesian. In that period of time, when we moved without any fixed destination, I was also contemplating and reviewing about my past mistakes. Looking at it always and I knew I was irresponsible for the things I had done to Noorasmah, my family, my friends and others. I had felt guilty conscience and how I wished I could rectify my life all over again. I told myself probably I needed more time and see where destiny led me.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>We met many local Indonesian who were wondering about us. Some of them thought that I was Yani's elder brother and some even thought that I was Yani's father. Yani on the other hand was also afraid of people who looked at me like a foreigner and she would always make the point that I did not speak too much to strangers. My Indonesian accent was still ineffective to insinuate that I was an Indonesian man for us to travel incognito. She was also afraid of my insincerity of making her my wife and she asked me many times about my reason of marrying her in the first place. I knew she felt insecured and I also knew that she would actually love to have a wedding celebration to be a grander occasion. We were married in a surreptitious manner and there were only a few people present, which we did not know, were witnesses for our solemnisation. Her family and my family were not present. After the wedding ceremony, Cak Pur, Mbak Rani and us, we had lunched in a small restaurant. Then we went back home to their house. Rani was also uncertain about our future because we were like drifters, moving from one place to another, one hotel to another hotel, passing our time together wondering and chit-chatting about our next destination.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Sumatra did not offer the kind of environment that I wish I could have like in Singapore. The Malays there were unlike the Malays in Singapore or Malaysia. They looked at me like a foreigner too. Maybe because of my appearance, which was to them unusual. It was like a misfits for them for in Indonesia, back then perhaps, it was very rare for a Chinese to marry outside their own race. Later after touring Java, I felt Java was also not suitable for our new life because I felt out of place. The East Javanese mainly spoke in Javanese, which I found hard for me to accept and adapt. Furthermore, I felt we were not really being looked like Indonesian domestic travellers too and I felt unsafe. It was at Banyuwangi, a small town located at the east edge of East Java, in a small hotel called Hotel Baru; I told Yani that probably our new life would be in Bali. It was only a hunched but deep inside me something was telling me to go for Bali. Was it Busu? I would not know. The small town of Banyuwangi was located just oppositely facing the island of Bali, about five or seven kilometres away and we needed to cross to Bali by ferry, which would take about thirty minutes. It was just like crossing from Singapore to Johor Baru, West Malaysia.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>We reached Bali in the early hours in late October 1992. We toured Bali and then Lombok. I felt Bali offered a better place to settle down. We felt saved because the Balinese were busy in their business dealings with the numerous foreign tourists that visited their lovely island of paradise and our presence there did not attract their attention so much, unlike in Java or Sumatra. They looked at us and thought that we were from Jakarta or Surabaya. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>We giggled quietly within, when I told them a white-lie that I was from Batam Island in Riau Province of Sumatra. And the best thing about it was, most Balinese and others did not know much about that province for they seldom went out from their beautiful island to tour Bintan or Batam island, which were located quite near to Singapore Island too. My Indonesian accent for the Balinese was stranged too but they accepted my explanation that my local Malay language was similar to Malay ethnic from Singapore or Malaysia. I could tell them about Batam's progressive and advance joint-trade and industrial development (SIJORI) with Singapore, Johor and Indonesia. They believed me because I could narrate to them the life in Batam, Singapore and Malaysia. I lied to them that I had oftenly visited Singapore and Malaysia because it was so near and most people living in Batam were influenced by the Singaporean's and Malaysian-Johorian's attitude of business and money making. The Balinese and those other ethnics that were living in Bali, just loved to listen to my story about those places they had never seen before and wished they had.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>We felt Bali was like another country and not Indonesia. The main tourist's district, Kuta, gave us the impression that we were in Australia or Hawaii. I loved the island ambience, especially, the mountain resorts and the beaches. Finally, we settled down permanently in late December 1992. We leased a house in Kuta and Bali became our Home. Amen. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I would love to write more about the travelling experiences and the places we went in Batam, Sumatra, Java, Lombok and how we felt upon reaching Bali, the places we went to, whom we had met and what we did in Bali; but that would take up many pages in this book. So, I am going to write about two occasions whereby it involved dealing with Busu. We knew somehow another that Busu was with us, the only thing was that we could not see him. We assumed that he was always near us. He was like our unseen guardian angel.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>One late evening, we took a 'Dirman' (The Javanese Traditional Horse Carriage) ride in Kuta. While sitting in that carriage, the horse acted strangely as though something or someone was disturbing it. The Javanese man who had reigned the horse remarked to us that the horse never behaved in that manner before. Yani and I smiled at each other and laughed, assuming that Busu was probably the culprit and perhaps he was riding on the horse's back instead of in the carriage with us.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>After we had decided to settle down in Bali, we went around Kuta, Sanur, Nusa Dua and Denpasar districts in searched of leasing a house for ourselves, but we could not find a suitable place that we really like partly because the house rents were too expensive or the area were not to our desired taste. So, one night, before I went to sleep, I whispered something to Busu like this, "Busu, if you can find a house for us that will be good. Please help me and try to look for that house that we like and maybe you can ask around or ask your friends in your world about it," That night, in my dream, I saw a nice looking white house near the beach, which was to my liking. Then after seeing that house in my dream, I distinctly heard a male voice telling me this, "You must give offering in a small raft and send it out to the open sea." Then I saw a large white horse wildly standing up kicking its front hoofs upon me. I immediately woke up and simultaneously I had actually pushed Yani who was on top of me. She fell down from the bed. She was trying to arouse me, while I was asleep and dreaming. In that dream I had pushed both of my hands forward to protect myself from that ferocious white horse from attacking me. I told Yani about my dream.</div>
              <div>Yani, being superstitious, enquired about the meaning of my dream with the hotel receptionist. She was a Balinese and she told Yani that the spirit wished an offering from me. If I refused, maybe I would face bad luck. So, she quickly asked for a coin from me, went out from the hotel to go to Kuta beach and threw out that coin to the open sea. I did not follow her and I was puzzled with her request for a coin.</div>
              <div>Later, when she had returned to the hotel, she explained to me about her unusual requests for a coin and what she had done with it. She had made an offering to the spirit on my behalf.</div>
              <div>A few days later, we found a small terrace white house and it was quite near the beach. I immediately felt comfortable with that house upon viewing it. The area gave a sense of peacefulness within me. We sealed the deal with the owner right on the spot.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The Balinese worship and present offerings to the evil spirits and the good spirits. It is within their belief that such religious ritual would prevent and protect them from the evil spirits mischievous actions and the good spirits would render them with good fortunes.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In the past, I had believed in superstition too. While I was in Java, I had bought a book on superstitious beliefs of the Javanese. So, after that dream, I had turned to the dream section in that book. It stated that if I dream about a white horse in that wild manner, it meant that I was going to be lifted up from facing difficulties on hand.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Now, this is a post script addition to this book. When I went back to Bali again with Noorasmah on 16th May 2004, I went to Kuta beach. I took out a coin, silently I offered a prayer and offering to that spirit that had spoken to me in my dream. Facing the open sea, I closed my eyes, felt the coin in my right hand, I whispered to him, "Please let me complete my offering to you and I prayed for your soul happiness. Thank you for your help." I opened my eyes and with all the strength that I had, I threw the coin as far as I could. The sun shine was lovely that afternoon and I felt the warmth of love and happiness within my heart, and I saw the morning glory of Life.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Noorasmah asked me what I was doing. I told her that it was something that I should have done a long time ago. And now I had done it. We walked the shores of Kuta beach happily and Noorasmah was falling in love with Bali. </div>

              <div> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In late March 1993, Yani and I were in Jakarta. We were there until middle of June 1993. We needed to have some cash to set up a small business in Bali. Yani sold her jewelries, the house furnitures and other items; and the little house in Jakarta.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>We stayed in a small hotel called Hotel Danau Toba in the district of Jatinegara, south of Jakarta. I know the name of the hotel may sound a misnomer to you because Lake Toba is located in Sumatra but the hotel name is authentic. In front of that small hotel, there was a church. While staying there, I met three spirits from the unseen world without Yani's knowledge.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>One afternoon after Yani had completed her afternoon prayer, she told me that she heard a voice. Yani became a Muslim again after she met me and naturally she would try to follow the religious precepts of Islam again. After she had completed her afternoon prayer that day, she had actually questioned herself within her heart whether her manner of praying was correct. She told me that she had said something like this within her heart, "I wonder whether my manner of praying is correct?' Immediately after that she heard a male voice replied to her, ' Yes, correct. Your prayer is correct.' I thought to myself that maybe she was imagining and took it as a passing statement from her.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>One evening, while she was praying, I was sitting on a stool in front of her about three metres away observing her. She had completed her evening prayer and while she was still sitting crossed legs on the praying mattress, praying for Allah's Blessing with her face downcast looking at her open palms, suddenly she looked up at me and smiled very sweetly for a few seconds. Then she downcasted her face again. There was something different about her expressions, especially, about her smile. I never saw her smiled in that manner before. When I saw that, I felt goose bumps all over my body. It was unusual for me to feel that way while observing her praying. I immediately rush towards her and sat in front of her. Then I questioned her strictly and looked at her straight in the eyes.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"Who are you?"</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"Huh..What is it?" she responded with surprised.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"Who are you?" I questioned her again.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"What are you talking about. What's wrong with you", she replied with a smile.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"I repeated my questioned again, "Who are you?"</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"I'm Yani. What's wrong with you?" she answered.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"Don't lie to me. You're not Yani. Who are you?" I said firmly again.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"Yani! I'm Yani! This is Yani! She replied and staring at me angrily.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>At this point, she closed her eyes as though she was like going to faint but I hold her by the shoulders and shook her. She opened her eyes again.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"Who are you?" I firmly questioned her again.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>She ignored my questioned, closed her eyes again and about to faint again. I shook her again and she opened her eyes again. She was annoyed and stared at me with fierce expressions on her face.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"Who are you?" I persisted further.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"When you're angry with your wife, please do not grip the back of her neck with your hand. She feels painful."</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>She spoke with firmness and strict toned. She looked at me directly into my eyes. She was very angry with me. Then she closed her eyes and she sort of like going to sleep. Her body slanted slightly on the right hand side of her body, maintaining still in her crossed legs sitting position on the praying mattress.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>When she had replied to me in that anger manner, I was sort of surprised and I felt ashamed too. Her statement was justified because sometimes when Yani was stubborn and angry with me, I would use my right hand to grip her by the back of her neck to release my anger towards her. So, when I heard her siad that, I did not stopped her and I let her go.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I sat on the bed nearby and for about fifteen seconds she closed her eyes then opened her eyes again. When Yani saw me sitting on the bed, she smiled at me and she did not asked me anything. Yani's usual smile expression was different from the earlier one that I had seen and had encountered.  I was certain that personality that I had encountered was not Yani. Yani even did not asked me whether there was something wrong with me or about my interrogation. She was oblivious as though nothing had happened. I looked at her and remain reticent. I kept quiet about it and I did not query Yani anymore with my curiosity. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The next day I thought about the incident the whole day and I observed Yani very carefully. Evening came and while she was doing her evening prayer nothing happened.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Later, while we were sitting in our room talking about general things and then suddenly, Yani became quiet. She was like gazing into empty space as though she was thinking of something and her mind seemed so far away. I saw it, observed her for a few seconds, then touched her hands, shook it lightly and she seemed shocked when I did that. Then I asked her whether she was alright. She looked at me, nodded that she was alright but remained silent and then turned her face slightly to another direction. She started to gaze again like looking something at a distant. I let her be and observed her. A few seconds later she turned to me, smiled at me sweetly like I had seen the day before. She said "Hello" to me and I replied vice versa. I knew I was not conversing to Yani's personality. It was someone else. When I enquired for her name she smiled sweetly at me and said, "My name is Margarita."</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
              <div>
              <div>Margarita told me that she was seventeen years old and she met Yani while Yani was working at Hailai Executive Nightclub at Ancol, Jakarta in 1992. She described Yani as a naive and silly girl but sympathised with her because Yani had commitments for her family at the village. She came to Yani again when she found out from her friends in the spirit world that Yani was in Jakarta again.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Margarita told me that her mother was good in spiritual matters and she was helping some humans for spiritual healing matters. Margarita's mother disallowed her to know about her work. Margarita's mother was a Muslim Djinn or Spirit and Margarita herself was a Muslim Djinn.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Margarita's father was formerly a Christian Spirit but then he became a Muslim later. She told me that her father had a large trading business and they were very wealthy in the spirit world. They lived in a big house with swimming pool. She was the only child and daughter in her family.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>She told me that she had a maroon Toyota Corolla car and she had a driver to her disposal. She told me that the cars in her world could go through any solid matters.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Margarita loved to disco at Hailai and she loved to drink too.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I was smoking while talking to her then she asked me for a cigarette. Yani did not smoke but Margarita was a smoker. She smoked expertly without any coughed.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I asked her whether I could see and meet her personally besides via my wife's body by materialising herself before me or perhaps meeting me in my dream. She mentioned that if I saw her, I would fall madly in love with her and if I saw her world, I would not want to return to my own world again.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>She told me that in her world they could transform themselves into animals, for instance, like a bird.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Once, she suddenly stopped talking in the middle of our conversation, as though she was thinking or concentrating about something else. When I intervened she ' Shsss..' at me with her fore finger upon her lips. After about a minute later, she told me that she was communicating with her driver who was waiting for her outside. She said that in her world they could communicate with one another with their thoughts. I was surprised with her explanation, which I never thought that I would actually hear from someone or a spirit that possessed a human physical body, who would tell me that to me. I was ignorant about the subject of telepathy at that time.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Margarita told me that when the physical world was day time, her world would be night time and when the physical world was night time, her world would be day time.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>She told me that she knew about Yani's and my problems but she could not do anything about it because she was not a spirit that had special powers or knowledge; but her mother possessed that ability. She did not want her parents to know that she was meeting a human being. In fact, she had asked her friends in her world to teach her about the method of meeting humans because she did not know the method.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>She said that she had been watching Yani and I for quite awhile without our knowledge. So when she managed to meet me, she was quite happy because she never met a man like me before. She said that she liked to converse with me because I talked to her like a friend. She advised me, "We need to be patience and tolerance to win", which she meant was pertaining to our difficulties of the house's sale transaction matters in Jakarta. She knew that we relied on someone, a middleman, for the business transaction to be completed. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>That night we talked for a long time, several hours in fact, about many things but she needed to return to her home in the spirit world before her parents looked for her. She said she would come back to meet me everyday and if I thought about her, she could feel it and she would know about it. She warned me not to tell Yani about her and our meeting. She would not meet me again if I talked to Yani about it. She made me promised to her that I would honour it. And I did as she requested. Then she bid goodnight and she remained silent, gazing into empty space just like Yani did prior to Margarita's appearance. I observed for awhile about one minute, then I shook Yani's hands lightly. Yani was shocked when I did that. Then she told me that she was tired and immediately went to sleep.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I did not sleep well that night because I was wondering about the conversation I had with Margarita. Yani and Margarita were so different in characters and intellect. Yani was more like a child and she was still immature even though she was already twenty years old, whereas Margarita was matured and lady like with a personality that would enthrall, enthuse and entice a person to listen. I felt pleased and happy of our meeting because I was talking to a young spirit woman from the spirit realm personally, which I had never encountered before in my life. I was talking to her like I was conversing to any ordinary human being or more like a girlfriend. That was the beginning of our human and spirit relationship.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>As she had assured me, she met me everyday without the knowledge of my wife. Sometimes she came in the morning, at noon, in the evening and at night. She told me that sometimes, she stayed overnight together with Yani and I. She said she listened to our conversation and she also listened to our thoughts. She would actually know about our thoughts and emotions too. She said that she loved to be near us because we became like her own friends or family. And Margarita and I became very closed.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>We talked about my first wife Noorasmah in Singapore and she queried me about my feelings for Noorasmah. We talked about Yani too. We joked with each other and we ate together. Though I had a lot of worries when I was in Jakarta, she became my closed companion and she gave me encouragement to face the obstacles with a positive attitude. She began to meet me a couple of times in a day and I had begun to think about her more often in my mind. Yani's image in my mind became further away and I always wondered about the beauty of Margarita because I heard from Malay people who mentioned that female Djinns or Spirits in the unseen world were all beautiful if compared to human females. My mind began to imagine about her youth and beauty. I really wanted to meet her personally but she never came to my dream to meet me.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>My obsession with Margarita grew as time passed and Margarita too seemed to be obsessed with me. I began to wish more for Margarita's companionship than to my own wife, Yani. We were compatible to each other and we were actually becoming like a couple in courtships. We began to feel affectionate for each other and we were actually falling in love.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I want to be truthful to you about this story of mine and I know you are wondering whether all this was a fantasy of my own imagination. It was not my imagination. It happened truly and I am aware of this story still because it happened and it is a mark in my conscience that will remain for the rest of my life. I hope you forgive me for narrating this story to you. It sounds crazy, disgusting but it really happened.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Margarita and I became intimate and whenever she stayed overnight, we would do hanky-panky but I would always controlled myself from having sex with her because we were two different beings and we were also not "married". We had to overcome our lust and she too knew that we were unsupposed to commit that sinful act. She became very attached to me and she often stayed overnight with me, due to this reason and I did not mind at all.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I was like a man who had no scruples and conscience though I was married to Yani. Each time when Yani went to sleep, Margarita would come to take over Yani's body. Whenever she came to possess Yani's body while she was asleep, Yani saw Margarita and Yani would scorn at her for meeting her always, over and over again. I watched and listened to Yani's reactions and scorned words while she was sleeping. Yani would speak like this to Margarita in her sleep.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>"Who are you?"</div>
              <div>"What you want from me?"</div>
              <div>"What! You want to borrow my body to meet my husband!"</div>
              <div>"Why you want to meet my husband!"</div>
              <div>"Go away! And don't come near me again"</div>
              <div>"Always you! Always must be you! Why must you always come to me."</div>
              <div>"Go away! You bitch! I don't want to see you again understand!"</div>
              <div>"Why! You again!. Always must be you. Always must be you. I hate you. Go away!"</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>No matter what Yani had said to Margarita and scorned at her, and no matter how obstinate Yani had been towards Margarita, Margarita had always managed to possess Yani's body to meet me.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Once, when Margarita had refused to go away from Yani, Yani had actually went to the bathroom, took a small pail of water, threw it at Margarita, scorned her to go away while she was totally asleep and with her eyes completed closed tight. She did not even tripped and fell down. She could actually walked to the bathroom without any difficulties as though she was awake. It was like somnambulism. But once Margarita took controlled of Yani's body, my wife would be soundly asleep. When I asked Margarita where was my wife, she pointed me to the place on the sleeping pillow, right next to her head, "There she is, sleeping soundly like a baby. Her (Soul) light is dimmed now. That means she's sleeping."</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Once I asked Yani what she had dreamt last night. She said that she saw a young woman in black mini-dress with shoulder length hair. She wore high heel shoes. She wore gold rings on every finger and she wore gold bangles on both hands up to her elbows. When I asked her what this young woman really looked like; whether it was fair or dark skin, short or tall, slim or fat, ugly or pretty; Yani could not recall. I was anxious and eager to know how Margarita's appearance looked like.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Once Margarita had told me about her problem with a male Spirit in her world. Her father had a business partner and her father had wished that she be married to his business partner's son. Margarita and her father's business partner's son were already engaged and due to be married in the future, but she disliked her fiance.</div>
              <div>Each time when her fiance visited her house, without her father's knowledge, her fiance would sneak up to her room and he tried to do something bad to her. She could not inform her father because her father trusted and loved her fiance like a son.</div>
              <div>She asked me what she should do to stop him from doing something bad to her. I told her to lock her bedroom door but she said that she had done that but he always managed to enter her room because he had the door key to her bedroom. So I told her that she should lock her bedroom door and put a chair against the doorknob so that he could not open the door. She told me that she had done that too and he still could enter her bedroom while she was asleep. I told her that if I could help her I would but it was up to her whether she should inform her father or not.</div>
              <div>I was actually angry and perhaps jealous too, when I heard her story. So I told her that if I managed to meet up with her fiance, I would give him hell although it was none of my business. After that she never mentioned to me about her fiance anymore.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>What I am going to write here is not good. In fact it is repugnance. But it is the truth and you want to know the true story about Margarita and I.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>One night, Margarita and I were succumbed to our lust. Before that happened, I had informed her that we needed to be 'married' first. She agreed to my suggestion and she told me that she would call for witnesses to our solemnisation. She told me to lie down next to her and held her hand. We held hands and she closed her eyes. Then we waited and I was wondering of what was going to happen to us. Then suddenly she took a deep sharp breath as though a sudden breeze of wind had gone into her nostrils. We remained in a reposed position for about fifteen minutes, then she opened her eyes and she said it was completed. There were three witnesses from her spirit world. We were already 'husband' and 'wife', then we consummated our marriage.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I need to let you know that I was actually feeling very awkward making love to her with Yani's physical body but it was not Yani. What happened? It was as though I was attracted to a beautiful female alien from outer space and subconsciously I wanted to know what it would be like to have a female companion from another world beside my own world. It was a stupid thing to do and usually this kind of thing happened due to our own desires. I felt guilty after that and I hated myself for getting involved with Margarita. I had cheated on Yani and I supposedly had a third 'wife' in the spirit world.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>After our 'marriage', Yani began to ask me whether I knew anyone by the name of Rita. I lied to her that I had never known a woman by that name. At one time, she was so adamant until she suspected that I had an affair with another woman behind her back. I reason with her that I was always near her and how was I going to have an affair with another woman. She accepted my explanation. Then I queried her why she had suspected that I had an extra marital relationship. She told me that she heard a male voice numerous times advising her about taking good care of her own husband and there was a woman by the name of Mbak Rita that was seeing me without her knowledge. I told her that she was talking nonsense and she was imagining all that up in her mind. I kept silent about it and we never talked about it anymore.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I asked Margarita about her 'wedding' rings since we were married. She told me that she would try to do something about it. I did not know how she was going to get her 'wedding' ring.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>One day Margarita asked me about something, which I thought was quite puzzling too. She had asked me whether the dead human corpse would be alive again should she go into the dead human physical body. I did not know how to react or answer her but I just told her it was not possible.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Margarita and I often ate together and I noticed that the manner she ate was quite strange but I just ignored it. I did not mentioned or asked her about it. When she ate anything, there would be a clap..clap..clap sounds as she chewed her food. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Many times she told me to keep quiet because she somehow another knew that someone was listening or peeping us from outside our room. We kept quiet for awhile then she would say it was nothing except that somebody was listening to us. One early morning, while we were awake and talking, suddenly she informed me that there was a Peeping Tom outside our room. I saw nothing but she did. We opened the room door and rushed outside to see who it was. There was this middle age man who suddenly approached us from a nearby room and he had queried us what was the matter. We told him that there was a Peeping Tom outside our room and he anxiously volunteered to look for that Peeping Tom. He quickly went out of the hotel premises to look for that Peeping Tom. The strangest thing was that we had never seen him around the hotel before and then my intuition told me that he was that Peeping Tom but he had pretended to be a good Samaritan just to escape from us. We told the hotel management about it and from that day onward, there was nobody trying to peep into our room or other guests' room. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
              <div>Many times Margarita had invited me to follow her back to her world but she mentioned to me that if I agreed to her invitation, she would call someone from her world to do that task because she did not know the method of doing that task. When that happened, I would be dead in my world but I would still be alive in her world. She said to me that she would be there in her world to wait and invite me personally should I wish to follow her. She sometimes insisted and persisted me to follow her but I had always told her that my duties in my own world was not completed yet. I did not want to see Yani in difficulties. She did not force me but she always persuaded me and she told me that I could help her father's business.</div>
              <div>Once I was willing to follow her because I felt tired of living a life of a fugitive. We held hands lying next to each other in bed and I was afraid of death. She closed her eyes for a few minutes, suddenly she took a deep breath and at the same time, I heard Yani's voice calling my name. Margarita opened her eyes and I told her to forget about the idea. Yani's voice changed my thoughts and my mind. Later, Margarita told me that the spirit that wanted to take your life changed his mind too because he felt ashamed and sympathetic for Yani.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Many Indonesians and some Malays believed that humans and Djinns could be married. There are stories about this and sometimes the humans would follow their Djinn spouses to their world. I thought in the past it was only a folklore but it happened to me. The Taoists believed that they could arrange a wedding for a spirit couple in the world of the spirit. Usually it would be for their decease loved ones that had died as a single so that their loved ones in the spirit world could have a happy life. It sounds ridiculous yet many of them believed in it. My case was not any different to the beliefs of many Indonesians, Malays and perhaps others too. Hollywood produces many Dracula films and most of the Draculas could seduce female and male humans for love and blood.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Once I had intentionally asked Margarita about how she had died because I had suspected that maybe she was a soul of a decease woman and not a Djinn. She replied that she had died of asthmatic attacked. After saying that, she realised that she had spoken something that she was not supposed to say to me. When I queried further about her death, she told me that she did not wish to talk about it anymore with some irritations and slight anger. I let it go and I took it very lightly, convinced myself that Spirit was Spirit and the soul was not the same identity as the Djinns in the unseen realm, even though I had heard from Mbak Rani's decease mother and Mbak Mary who had admitted that they were the souls of decease human beings. I discounted their assertions and sticked to my religious teachings of Islamic faith that souls in Hereafter could not communicate with humans after their death but Djinns and the Devil, they could.</div>

              <div>I have no opening words in this chapter. In fact I have no idea how to begin with my writing again. I was in a state of 'writer's-block' for two days before I could actually commence my writing again. I felt the best way to solve this problem was to write spontaneously according to the reminiscence I had about them and picked up the momentum from there on.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In retrospect, I have to compliment them and give them the credit for allowing me to know them and sharing their lives together with me while I was in Indonesia. Why they had came into my life is still a mystery to me but they had made me wondered so much about them until I had decided to do a researched about their world and about their identity as Spirits. The stories they told me about their world about themselves were the clues I had used in my quest for more knowledge about the soul, life after death, life as a human being and as a Spirit.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I am writing down the stories they had told me while I was living in Indonesia and none of it is my own creation. I am writing it according to my remembrance and the incidences that had taken place while I was in Indonesia. When I wrote about their stories, it was written without any influences from other sources that I came across either on printed materials or through information I had heard from other people or seen on films. I met them through my wife, Yani and I lived with them for nearly three years. Perhaps when you encounter anybody who is possessed, you could ask the entity about their lives and about their world too. Then maybe you could dictate their stories and compile it into a printed book.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>A Spirit named Seth had possessed Jane Roberts, an American woman and her husband Roberts, had written down Seth's words for publication. It was called 'SETH'. George Anderson, a famous American Psychic, was a religious Catholic and when he did any reading or discernment for his guests, he saw in his mind eye angels, saints, symbols, words, Mary and sometimes Jesus too. He heard voices or sounds within his mind and he could feel the decease souls' emotion within his heart. He has a book called 'We Don't Die', written by someone else too. You too can do likewise and all you need to do is to find a medium that is willing to be the co-author for the book.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Margarita was the first soul entity I had encountered in Hotel Danau Toba and later I met the next entity. This happened in our room one early evening. It appeared about three weeks after Margarita. It came unsuspectingly because Yani was not gazing into empty space like the manner prior to Margarita's appearances to meet me.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I remembered noticing the changed in Yani, in the manner she had behaved and had talked to me. She was talking very childishly and her voice tonation sounded sharper and higher in pitched if compared to Yani or Margarita. Yani usually would without fail called me by using my pet name as 'Dee-Dee' but this entity kept calling me 'Mas' (a Javanese way of addressing to a male as Brother or Mister) continuously while we were talking. I suspected something was amissed with Yani's manner but I allowed our conversation to continue for awhile, then suddenly I questioned her.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>She was sitting on the bed and I was sitting on a stool by the bed. "Who are you?", I queried in a normal speaking toned. Immediately, after my questioning, its miens and behaviours switched like a demon and making fierce frightening eerie sounds. Its face expression looked very scary with its face downcasted, its evil sharp eyes glaring at me and baring its teeth. It brought up its hands as though it was trying to strangle me and I felt quite frightened with that sudden changed. I said to this enity like this, "Ah! Don't try to scare me. I'm not afraid of you. You know I have many friends in your world too. I know you are not an evil Spirit. So don't be afraid or shy. Tell me who you really are? Come on stop that nonsense". When it heard that, it stopped its evil characteristic behaviours, brought down its hands, it looked up at me, then it smiled at me as widely and childishly happy. I laughed a little and it laughed too. Then we started talking. She called herself as Natalia.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The hotel where we stayed while in Jakarta was located near to a red light district area and many of its guests patronised it for short time or long time. We saw many couples came and went. In front of the hotel's main entrance, oppositely across the small one way road, there was a medium size Church. Natalia told me that she lived in that church and she was a Christian. She had been observing Yani and I before she came near us. Natalia told me that she always saw a young fat female spirit in black mini-dress that wore lots of jewelries, visited Yani and I. And when she (Margarita) ate any food, her mouth motion would look like and sounded like a 'Bebek' or a Duck while eating.  That had attracted her attention because she was very curious. When Margarita was absent, Natalia said that she would come near to our room and peeped inside it. When I heard Natalia's description about Margarita, I was shocked but I remained silent.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Natalia had a 'husband' named Mas Anton and he worked in a hotel in Jakarta. He always returned home late at night. She always waited for him to return home because he would bring home some food and they would eat together. She said that she always felt hungry. She narrated an incidence to me that once there was a Middle Eastern man, a middle-aged man who stayed in Hotel Danau Toba too. He had an Indonesian young woman companion with him. They were touching each other and they were aroused with sex desires. So when that man was inserting his genital into that young woman, he found it difficult to do so. He made a remarked to the woman, "Why is it yours is so difficult for me to enter. Its so tight as though it belongs to a small girl." Then Natalia laughed childishly and said, "I had possessed that woman." When I heard that I was totally surprised. So I asked her, "Why you possessed that Indonesian woman and had sex with that man?" She replied, "I was hungry. After that man had sex with me, he bought some food to eat." I was silent after listening to her story. It reminded me of my own lust for Margarita.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>At the time when Natalia had narrated that incidence, there was a Middle Eastern man staying in the same hotel. He was in his late forties and he told us that he came to Indonesia to recruit some maids. Yani and I had noticed that he had two young female Indonesian teenagers with him and they always stayed together with him. Could it be that same man? Maybe Natalia used that story to teach me some moral values? That was the exact account I heard from Natalia. The questions here are, "Why must she possessed that Indonesian woman and had sex with that Middle Eastern man? And why she did not wait until after that woman had sex with that man, then later possessed that woman to eat the food bought by that man?" I did not ask Natalia these questions. It never crossed my mind.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>There are a few matters that I want to highlight to you. The Taoists and some Buddhists (that combined Taoism and Buddhism Beliefs), commemorated their decease ancestors or the hungry ghosts from the world of the unseen with galore of food offerings during the month of "The Hungry Ghosts Month Festival" or it is sometimes called as "The Seventh Month". They even provided entertainments - live opera shows for the ghosts or souls to watch it. They believed that the seventh month is the time when the gate of Hell is open and the souls or ghosts are liberated for a short period before they are repatriated to Hell again. There are differences in the methods or manners of Margarita and Natalia desires for foods and entertainment from humans but it is not vary if compared in terms of their motives - to eat and be merry.</div>
              <div>Seth the spirit, who had possessed Jane Roberts for book dictation, would always request from Roberts for drinks and cigarettes. My own mother's spirit followers had requested for such items too. Mbak Rani's spirit followers did the same thing too.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Later when Margarita met me, I told her about Natalia. I asked her whether she knew her. She claimed she did not know Natalia. I told Margarita to look for Natalia at the Church opposite the hotel and get to know her. She did as I told and she met up with me again. She had to ask around to find Natalia and finally she met her. Margarita told me that Natalia was a young girl about twelve or fourteen years old. She lived in one of the rooms at the Church. She was childish, cheeky and quite naughty. She looked like Chinese and she looked quite pretty but her body was thin. Margarita told me that she had often seen Natalia sitting at the entrance of the Church as though she was waiting for somebody. I felt sympathetic for Natalia so I asked Margarita whether she could help her, especially with food supplies. Margarita was rich so I had asked her for that favour and I even suggested to Margarita to regard Natalia as her younger sister. Margarita agreed to my suggestion and fulfilled my request like a faithful 'wife'. Later, when I met Natalia again, I told her that she could meet me and eat whatever food she wanted to eat. She was very happy with my suggestion and somehow another, deep in my heart, I had regarded Natalia like my younger sister too. From that day onward, I had a 'wife' and an adopted 'sister' in the world of the spirit. They looked up at me like their own family too. I did not meet Mas Anton, Natalia's 'husband' until I returned to Jakarta again in July 1993.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Once I was chatting with Natalia, I asked her who were her parents. She did not know them. Then I purposely asked her nicely whether death was painful. I was so surprised when she replied to me that it was not painful at all. She said that death was painless and it happened very fast. She told me that she had died of a train accident. A train had hit her while she was walking to school. After her death, she was crying at the train station. A priest saw her crying and brought her back to his Church and ever since then, she had lived there. There she met Mas Anton who took care of her like a sister initially. Then later they became very closed and they decided to become like 'husband' and 'wife'. "Where is your parents?" I queried further. She did not know. "Can you remember your parents or their names?" I questioned her. She said "No". "Can you remember where you stay before?" I asked her. She answered "No". I wanted to ask her more questions but she interrupted me and said, "Mas Robi, please do not ask me anymore about this. I do not want to talk about it anymore." I could see that Natalia was sad of my questioning and so, I stopped asking her questions.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>There was a train station nearby the Church and the hotel that we were staying. After hearing her story, I took it that probably Natalia was an orphan in her world of the spirit or in her previous life. I remembered Margarita had mentioned this to me before, "Once a baby is born to the physical world and cry, it already has sin." I did not know what she meant by that statement but I just listened to her. Was she referring to reincarnation? Or was she trying to say all humans were born as Sinners? Indirectly it means the same thing if you looked at it in Hinduism or Buddhism theological sense but not in Christianity, Islam or Judaism. Who could say and assert that these statements are false or true or maybe we need to find more about it before anything could be said and concluded that this is true and that is false. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
              <div>
              <div>Natalia informed me that Margarita has bought for her new clothes to wear and she even brought her home to meet her family. They were very kind spirits and they treated her well. Natalia said that Margarita lived in a big house with a big swimming pool too. Margarita had also brought her along to meet her friends at two five stars hotels in Jakarta, one in the city central and other one in the Ancol district north of Jakarta. I used to check-in into these two hotels with Yani, each time I visited Jakarta.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Once I brought Natalia to eat at a fast food chain. She happily commented to me with delight that most of the rich people foods were delicious. When I heard that I empathetically wished for her a better life.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>We went to see a Dracula movie at the cinema one evening. Yani and I were travelling in a taxi while Margarita and Natalia supposedly travelled in Margarita's maroon Toyota Corolla with the chauffeur. They were following our taxi. Then, the taxi had suddenly stopped and when that happened, Margarita's car went right through our taxi. Margarita told me that Natalia was screaming her heart out because she thought that both cars were going to be in a drastic accident. In the cinema, while watching the Dracula movie, Natalia met me and claimed that she felt scared watching the Dracula movie; and just before she left Yani's body, she indicated to me that she would be sitting with Margarita at the empty seats in front of Yani and I.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>One day, I saw Natalia was doing 'Goose Marching' and she was really swinging her arms and moving her legs forcefully. I queried her why she walked in that manner. She said that it was difficult for her to walk because Yani's body felt very heavy and she really needed to use all her strength to move Yani's body.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>When Natalia ate her meals, she did not eat like the manner of Margarita, whereby she would chew hard and there would be a loud clap..clap..clap sounds. Natalia's manner of eating was normal like any humans except that there would be a slight clap..clap..clap sounds too as she chewed her food. That was the way I differentiated the characteristics between Margarita and Natalia, while I ate together with them. They would take turn to eat the food and they would leave some food for Yani too. Yani did complain that sometimes she felt the food was not enough for her albeit it had looked so much. She sometimes felt that the food had dminished in a short time eventhough she had ate it slowly. I kept quiet about it and jokingly made a remarked that probably she needed to say a prayer before eating, in order to avoid from eating together with the devils.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Once Yani and I were eating instant noodles that we had ordered from a nearby food vendor, while eating, Margarita came to eat together with me. Margarita left Yani's body before the food was diminished. Yani while in that kind of altered states of half awake and half asleep, told me that she saw a fat young woman with many jewelries adorned to her body, was eating a bowl of instant noodle lika a duck. It was as though she had witnessed it from outside her own body. When Yani was in that altered state of mind, she could still converse with me and when she spoke, it was very sincere and honest. It was as though her soul within her body was talking to me but later when she had regained her full consciousness of herself, her attitudes and characters would be normal again. It was like a patient being hypnotised by a psychiatrist and in that kind of states, the patient would say things sincerely and truthfully. It was like that for Yani when she was in that kind of altered state. Later, as I got to know more about Margarita and Natalia, whenever they came to meet me, sometimes Yani would be in a daze and gazed into empty space but sometimes she was not. They could come suddenly but when they left Yani's body, Yani would be like in the hypnotised state for a few seconds. I would shake on Yani's hands gently and she would be startled and then wake-up from her 'slumbering' but she would be totally oblivious about it.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Natalia came to me one early morning while I was sleeping and she woke me up.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>She said, "Mas Robi, can I take Rp40000 from Mbak Yani's wallet to buy a pair of jean for myself." Sleepily I had replied "Okay" and went back to sleep. Before I fell asleep, I saw that "Yani" too had went back to sleep after Natalia had met me. I had given Yani more than enough cash for her expenses and I had cash in my own wallet too. Why must Natalia seek my permission? She could have taken it without my permission or knowledge.</div>
              <div>So later, after I woke up, I checked Yani's wallet, it contained more than enough cash. I did not know the exact amount of cash that Yani should have left in her wallet after deducting the Rp40000 supposedly taken by Natalia and I did not ask Yani about it. I noticed that Yani did not buy a new pair of jean for herself and if she wanted to buy a new pair of jean for herself, I would know about it too because we normally went practically anywhere together. If Yani wanted to buy a new pair of jean, she need not had to seek permission from me.</div>
              <div>One day, I entered our room suddenly and when I opened the door, I saw Yani was searching for something in her own bag. She was totally in shocked and began to cry, pleading with me to leave the room immediately. When I refused, she cried even harder and pleading with me to leave. So I left the room for awhile and went into the room again but Yani was acting normal as though nothing bad had happened. I asked what was the matter until she had cried. She was confused with my question and she did not understand what I meant.</div>
              <div>Later when Natalia came to meet me she said that her friend had this knowledge and ability to take money from the physical world. Her friend had helped her once to take the Rp40000 from Yani's wallet. Natalia claimed that she did not have that kind of knowledge and ability. She apologised to me and said that her friend was in need of cash and she had no wish to do that again. I did not take it seriously and told Natalia to forget about it. Later, I checked with Yani about any cash missing from her wallet and she said that she had more than enough cash in her wallet. She was wondering why I had asked her and I did not tell her anything about it. When that incident happened, my own wallet was with me. Why would Yani want to steal her own money from her own wallet? Why must she cried when I caught her searching for something in her own bag? I knew there were nothing valuable in her bag except her own wallet. And why must she pleaded with me to leave the room? Yani had never behaved in that manner before.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>After that incident, I had wondered whether my wife, Yani, was suffering from mental illness or maybe a split personality but I just did not take it so seriously. I just put that thought aside and forgot about it. Later, while in Bali, I realised my assumption about her mental illness or split personality was totally wrong. An interesting unplanned experiment happened and I had proved something to myself that I was wrong.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>While in Danua Toba Hotel, Natalia had informed me that there was a Spirit in the hotel manager's office. It looked horrible. It had long fingernails and long hair that covered it's face. It's stature was big and it looked very evil. Natalia was afraid of evil spirits herself.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Natalia also told me that there was a woman spirit in one of the hotel room. She always cried. Natalia had informed me this before Yani and I heard about it from the hotel staffs. They said that they was a young woman who had committed suicide by drinking insecticide in one of the room and sometimes they could hear a woman crying when the room was empty.</div>
              <div>Later, Yani got acquainted with one woman who was a mistress to a married man. She stayed in that hotel once a month to meet her lover. She had occupied that same room whereby the young woman had committed suicide and she was not frightened about it. She was indeed a brave woman. She did not believed in ghosts.</div>
              <div>This woman told Yani that sometimes she heard a woman crying in that room and sometimes she saw a figure of a woman in the dark but she ignored it. When she switched on the light, it would disappear and that was about all it could do.</div>
              <div>Sometimes when they were having sex, the ghost would appear but it did not disturb them. Sometimes her lover would remark to her that she was not like herself but like someone else. When that happened, they could do it all night long but she felt there was nothing wrong with herself. She took it as a challenged when her lover intimately wanted to have sex all the time. But she did admit to Yani that she had wondered about it too because she did not feel tired. She was also puzzled about the strength she had. Where it came from? She jokingly told Yani that maybe the suicide woman's soul had possessed her. Yani told me what this Javanese woman had told her. They were conversing in Javanese.   </div>

              <div><span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #ff0000;">Margarita's anger (1993, Jakarta)</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I have to be honest with you. After I had heard the description from Natalia about Margarita's appearance, my feeling and desire for Margarita was in decadence. About Margarita's manner of eating food, before Natalia told me about it, I had already noticed it but I had just disregarded it, thinking that it was normal for a spirit to eat in that manner. After Natalia had informed me I assumed that Margarita had refused to meet me in my dream because her appearance was ugly and fat. I had visualised Margarita in my mind as a young, sexy and beautiful being. I felt uneasy and so each time when Yani was going into altered state of mind without her realising it, I would make her fully awake again and again to prevent Margarita from meeting me. Yani who was oblivious to what was happening to her, was annoyed with my action for making her always startled. When I asked her what she was thinking about, she just said that she was actually thinking of nothing. It was just like staring or observing an object without thinking about anything. And while I was startling Yani to bring back her to the real world, Margarita was angry with me. When she managed to meet me, she already knew my feelings for her by then.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I expressed to Margarita that we had made a mistake by 'marrying' and "It is not possible for a mermaid to live on land with a man and it is not possible for a man to live with a mermaid under the sea." I suggested to her for us to call it off and besides, her parents did not know about the 'marriage'. She was angry with me and she stared at me.  She told me that she would be the one who would decide whether I remained as her 'husband' or not. She queried me about my feelings for Yani and I could sense that she was jealous. She frightened me by performing and demonstrating her anger and character like a devil by muttering, "I want blood. I want your blood." For a moment there I thought she was really a demon and I had been rused by the demon herself. I reasoned it as only an illustration from her that she could become an angel or a demon. Then we talked again.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>That afternoon after we had discussed about our relationship matters, just before she left Yani's body, Margarita had pinched very hard on Yani's left hand until it turned very red and later there was a blue-black mark. When Yani's personality came back on again, she complained about the painful swelling on her left hand. She had wondered how that swelling had happened and I did not tell her anything about Margarita or about the caused of her swelling on her left hand. Why would Yani pinched herself on her left hand until it swollen if Yani was impersonating as Margarita? Nevertheless, Margarita always met up with me and we did not talk about it anymore. I had put the matter aside and we remained as it was.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>This incidence proved my insincerity towards Margarita too and I knew I had hurt her feelings. Later when I came back to Singapore, when I reviewed my life in Indonesia, I felt like a bastard for treating her that way, though she was a soul or spirit from another dimension or spiritual world. I promised myself that if ever I managed to meet Margarita again, I would apologise to her about my past actions upon her. She really loved me. I knew because I felt her loves for me.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
              <div>I asked Margarita about the discotheques in her world too and how different it was when compared to the discotheques that were present in the physical world. She answered that it was much better in the world of physical. I asked her "Why?". She said there was a difference in feeling thrilled and happy. That was the reason she loved to go for discotheques in the physical world rather than within her own world. </div>
              </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I asked Margarita about us making love in my dream instead of through Yani's body. She replied that the feelings would not be the same as when she made love through possession of Yani's body. I queried her further, "Why?" She could not answer me definitely. She sort of like saying to me that it was not the same over and over again. I could not understand her explanation. Back then, I did not know much about the meaning about the soul and the physical body. If she had explained to me back then, I would be confuse with her explanations perhaps.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I asked Margarita about whether they could eat the foods from the world of physical without possessing a human body. She told me they could. I asked her how would I know whether spirits from her world had eaten the food or not. She said that the food would taste differently. It would be tasteless. Well, this answer was not surprising for me for I had heard about it too from the Taoists who would offer foods for their decease ancestors and the hungry ghosts from the unseen realm for them to eat during the Hungry Ghosts Month Festival. They mentioned that the food would be tasteless when you eat those food offerings to the dead.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I asked Margarita whether Michael Jackson was famous in her world. She said that Michael Jackson was very famous in their world too. In fact everyone in her world knew Michael Jackson and loved Michael Jackson so much. I was surprised to hear that. And I asked her whether there were Michael Jackson's cassette tapes and compact discs in her world. She said they had them in her world too. So I asked her how they managed to procure it and who produced them. She did not know how they managed to have it and how they produced it. She could not give me a definite answer. I just let it go.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>These were all the questions I had put forward to Margarita and back then I was so ignorant of many things, especially, matters related to the spirit world. I only thought about it seriously after I had returned to Singapore and I did my researched about them. I discovered many new things that I did not know about in the past. Perhaps these questions would help you in your researched work in your own belief about them.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
              <div>Natalia told me that Mas Anton took care of her well. They lived in one of the rooms in the church opposite the hotel. They did not own many belongings in their room. Some kitchen and cooking utensils plus a mattress for them to sleep. They did not have many clothings. They were poor spirits. She would make for him coffee and somethimes she would cook for him. They always ate together. She was just waiting for the day when Mas Anton would have enough cash for a new life together. Anton had told her that he loved her and not to worry about anything. He had promised her that they would be 'married' and once he had enough money, he would buy a house to live in and he would buy all the good things for her and for their house. Is heaven and hell like earth? Where there are materials like on earth?</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>There was a book titled "Berdialog Dengan Djinn" or Dialog With Djinn, it was written in 'Bahasa Indonesia' or Indonesian National Language, translated by an Indonesian man. It was originally written in Arabic and later translated into 'Bahasa Indonesia". The story was from the middle east region. Sorry, I could not recall his name. I read this book when I was in imprisonment. He mentioned that the world of the Djinn and the world of mankind are similar. The Djinns have all the things we humans have in the physical world and whatever professions that we humans have in the physical world, they, The Djinns, from the world of the unseen, have it too. If you asked any religious Muslims, they would agree with the "Berdialog Dengan Djinn" author. In this book, it  mentioned that the world famous magician David Copperfield, the Non-Muslim Djinns had 'signed' an agreement with him and there was a newly converted Muslim Djinn that had mentioned that he would try his best to destroy David Copperfield's Non-Muslim Djinns. Interesting to read but many of the things that were mentioned in that book, were based upon Islamic Faith belief of the Djinns and their world.</div>
              <div>   </div>
              <div>When I read the book 'Immortality' written and compiled by the late Ian Curry, there was a chapter in that book whereby the soul entities from the unseen realm mentioned that they have all those professions that we humans have on earth. They too have all the materials that we humans have on earth too and they have activities like on earth too, for instance, golf, drinking and etc. The interesting part was that they mentioned it was free. And I was not surprised but my inmate friends (a Buddhists and a Christian) were and they just stared at me after reading Ian Curry book. I had mentioned to them about the spirits that I had met while I was living in Indonesia and what they had told me. Most of time I would compare the information written by famous authors with the direct experiences and informations that I had while living in Indonesia. It actually helped me to understand about the physical world and the spirit world more and better. </div>

              <div><span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #ff0000;">Natalia remarks (1993, in heaven)</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In the middle of June 1993, we left Jakarta for Bali. Our planned was to return to Jakarta again somewhere in July 1993 by air flight from Bali to finalise the sale transaction. We intended to return to the same hotel. It was a sudden planned and Margarita or Natalia did not meet me before we left. So I thought maybe they would not mind if we left the hotel without noticed. Furthermore, we would be returning to the same hotel in the month of July 1993. Our planned was to go to Surabaya and from there to go to Malang, East Java. We intended to meet Yani's Aunt and invite her to stay with us in Bali.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Now, during my stay in this hotel, I did not meet Busu through Yani's body but I remembered asking Margarita or Natalia whether they had seen Busu together with us. They mentioned that there was no such spirit and I had told them about Busu. Maybe they saw him but Busu had told them to keep that information as a secret.   </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The bus journey would take about eighteen hours. We checked out from the hotel in the late afternoon and headed for the bus terminal at Tanjung Rambutan. We bought Executive Class express bus tickets and boarded the bus.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>When the bus started to move out from the bus terminal, suddenly Natalia came on through Yani, "Mas Robi, where are we going?" I was so surprised with her sudden appearance, "What are you doing here Natalia? You must return to your own house now." Crying, she said that she wanted to follow us. I told her that it was impossible and she must returned home immediately. She was crying like a small child and pleading with me to allow her to follow us. I relented to her demand because I did not want to attract any attention from the other passengers. I told her to stop crying, be a good girl and listened to me. She was joyful to hear that and kept quiet.</div>
              <div>Then, after awhile of silence, she said this to me, "Mas Robi, do you know why I want to follow Mbak Yani and you?" I replied that I did not know. "I overheard your discussion with Mbak Yani about going back to Bali and later coming back to Jakarta again by flight. I want to see Bali and I've never ride in a plane before. Thats the reason I wish to follow Mbak Yani and you", she said it childishly and happily. We laughed together.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Once during the bus journey she came to me, "Mas Robi, I've "Pis-Pis" (urinated)." So shocked and surprised, I asked her "Where?" She pointed below the seat where she (and Yani) was sitting. I saw there was a small pool of water and I immediately checked Yani's jean. It was not wet and I told her the next time if she needed to do that, do it in the toilet that was available at the rear of the bus. She naughtily laughed but I was not angry with her. I was puzzled how she did that because the passengers in front and behind us did not have any young children. Where the water came from? I knew that Yani did not drop or spill any mineral water bottle but maybe the passengers behind or in front of us did. Or maybe Natalia just wanted to joke with me. Of course I did not touch, smell or taste it whether it was urine or fresh water. Who would do that, especially inside a bus?</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Why would Natalia meet me in the bus and let me know of her presence with us? I have no idea. She could have kept quiet about it and follow us secretly without my knowledge. Did Yani purposely acted like a small girl and cried shamefully to attract other passengers in the bus?</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Upon reaching Malang, we checked into a good hotel. I could not remember the hotel name but it was one of the best hotel in Malang. Natalia did not meet up with me partly because Yani was absent. She spend most of her time at her aunt's place. I was at the hotel waiting for her and her aunt. They came in the evening and we talked. Yani's aunt could not follow us to Bali because she had other matters to settle before she could follow us. We decided to return to Malang again to meet her after we had completed our sale transaction in Jakarta.</div>
              <div>The next day, we checked out from the hotel and proceeded to Surabaya airport and took a flight to Bali. I already felt exhausted and I could not bear the long distance and sitting twelve hours inside the bus to return to Bali. The air flight journey would only take half an hour from Surabaya to Bali. In the airplane, Natalia came to me for awhile and said it was fun riding in an airplane. She looked happy and informed me that she would be sitting in an empty seat in front of us.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The following day, Natalia met me and I queried her about the spirit occupants of our home in Bali. Natalia said that they were a childless spirit couple and they were very kind. They were Christians. Natalia had introduced herself to them as my sister and they were willing to take her into their home like their own daughter. Natalia called the spirit lady as "Ibu" (Mother) and her 'husband' as "Bapak" (Father). They did not reveal their names to me. Ibu's 'husband' was working in a hotel in Bali and Ibu was a 'housewife'.</div>
              <div>I had instructed Natalia when we were still staying at the hotel in Jakarta that if anybody in her world enquire about her identity and her relationship with me, she was to tell them, "I'm his sister". I was happy to hear from Natalia about Bapak and Ibu living together in our home. So I reminded Natalia to send my best regards and thanks to them for taking her into their family. They never meet me personally through Yani. I did not know what were the reasons. When they had anything to say to me, it would be through Natalia.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In Bali, there was one occasion while I was reading in the front room, Yani came to me and she had queried me whether I had called for her. I told her that I did not and so I asked her what was the matter. She said that she heard a girl voice calling her name and asked her, "Mbak Yani, what are you doing? I thought it was Dee Dee (my pet name)." I guessed it was Natalia but I did not tell Yani about it.</div>
              <div>Sometimes, when I observed Yani preparing foods in the kitchen, she was liked in hypnotised state of mind and there was a time I asked her what she was doing, "I'm learning how to cook." It seemed so naive and sincere as though it was not Yani but I did not query her further. I had taught Yani how to cook some dishes that my own mother had taught me and I did not bother to know whether it was Yani or Natalia or Ibu or some other entity. I just let it be and when Natalia came to meet me, I did not ask her whether she was learning to cook some dishes through Yani. It never crossed my mind to question her that.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>We spend most of our time at Kuta Beach or shopping for clothings or groceries at Matahari Shopping Centre in Denpasar, Bali. There was one occasion whereby we were patronising at the beachfront cafe of Natour Hotel in Kuta, watching the open seas and admiring the sunset. Yani and I left that place just after the sunset and while I was walking, I tripped and nearly fell down.</div>
              <div>Later that evening, we saw a taxi passed by and sort of stopped for awhile in front of the house. Then Natalia came to meet me crying. She said that she nearly got lost because while we left the cafe at Kuta Beach, she had stayed behind. She was not eager and willing to go home yet. She had wanted me to stay longer at Kuta Beach and she reminded me about the incident while I was walking, I tripped and nearly fell down. She said that she did that to me on purpose to let me know or gave me a signed about her desires to stay longer at the beach because she loved Kuta Beach. (Yani was walking in front of me when that incident had happened and she did not see it).</div>
              <div>So when she stayed behind and when the time came when she felt of going home, she realised that she did not know the way home. She cried and then an idea came to her. She remembered our home address and the area of our residence. She took a taxi to go home and Ibu paid Rp5000 for her taxi fare. Ibu scolded her for being naughty and advised her not to repeat it again. Why Natalia did not inform me of her desires to stay longer at the beach through Yani? I did not know. It did not cross my mind to ask her that question.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I bought a big blue beach hat with flower patterns on it for Natalia at Kuta, Bali. This hat could be folded into a hand fan. So, wherever we went, Natalia would put one her favourite hat, sometimes even at home she would put it on. When it was Yani personality, Yani would take off that hat and she would not ask any question about that hat. When Natalia took over Yani's body, she would put on that favourite hat of hers. Funny but true.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I queried Natalia about Busu. She told me that Ibu said that Busu was not willing to take a bath when Ibu told him too because he was dirty. He was stubborn. But he always slept in the toilet. He did not come to meet me through Yani though I remembered him. And did not know the reason why he was so stubborn.  </div>

              <div><span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #ff0000;">Natalia's Happiness (1993, while going back to Paradise)</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In the early period of July 1993, we took a flight from Bali to Surabaya for a transit flight to Bandung, West Java. We wanted to have a sight-seeing. While on board a plane to depart for Bandung, Natalia came to meet me and she was crying. She said that she was nearly left behind because she went out of Surabaya airport for awhile to see some of the scenery nearby while we were waiting for the transit flight to Bandung. She told me that she had never seen Surabaya city before. When she came back to the airport, Yani and I were already missing. She cried but she had remembered about the plane that we were supposed to board for Bandung. She said that she had queried a guardian spirit at the airport about that plane and she had managed to board it just before its departure.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>At Bandung, we took a train to Jakarta. We were not in the hurry and we had decided to take a leisurely excursion. It was a pleasant journey for Yani and I. And it was a good opportunity for me to see Indonesia and its people. It was my first train ride in Indonesia.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Upon reaching Jakarta train station, we took a taxi to Hotel Danau Toba. Natalia met me in the taxi and she put on her favourite blue beach hat that I had bought for her in Bali. The minute we reached the hotel, Natalia was the first person to rush out from the taxi. She rushed out quickly to the hotel lobby. She seemed excited, anxious and happy. We checked into the hotel and managed to accommodate the our old room again. Natalia wore her hat for quite sometime until Yani's personality returned. Yani like the hat too because it could be folded into a fan but as for Natalia it was a fabulous souvenir from Bali. Most of the hotel staffs and the food vendors outside the hotel that knew us were so pleased to see us again. This time we stayed until late July 1993.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>That evening, Margarita met up with me. She said Natalia left Jakarta without informing anybody and they were looking all over Jakarta for her. Even her 'husband', Mas Anton, was worried about Natalia's disappearance. Margarita was not angry with me and she felt happy to see me again. Then she left and Natalia appeared. She said that Mas Anton wanted to meet me and would I mind. I agreed to meet him.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Mas Anton met me. He greeted me and I did likewise. His character and voice was manly, different from Yani, Margarita and Natalia. He always stroke backward the front fringe of his hair with his right hand and pulled it down to make a fringe in front of the forehead. He said, "Natalia didn't inform anyone where she was going. I was worried about her. I don't blame you, Mas Robi. I blame Natalia for being inconsiderate and I've scolded her for leaving me without saying anything. I saw her wearing that blue hat and I was so surprised. I'm happy to meet you, Mas Robi." I told Mas Anton what had happened and invited him to stay with us in Bali. "Natalia loves to stay in Bali and I've already regarded her like my own sister. Mas Anton, you're working in a hotel in Jakarta, why not work in Bali. There are many hotels you can work for over there." He looked at me momentarily and then slightly turn to his side. He was like thinking or perhaps communicating with Natalia but I would not know because I assumed he was. About a minute later, he told me that he could not make up his decision immediately because he had some commitments with his 'employer'. That was the reason he gave me. However, he said he would not mind Natalia to stay with me in Bali and he would go to Bali after he had settled his work duties in Jakarta. He asked me for my address in Bali and we parted.</div>
              <div>Then Natalia came on. She said her friends and Mas Anton were very surprised to see her wearing the blue hat. She left after saying that her friends wanted to ask her about Bali. Margarita came to ask me about my planned. I told her that Natalia would stay in Bali with me and Mas Anton would join us later. I had invited Margarita to come along too and she said that she would be there later. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I have no idea about Mas Anton's and Bapak's exact nature of profession in the hotel industry in their world and I thought that probably they were working as guardian spirits for the hotels in their world. I did not ask them about it and they did not tell me exactly their nature of work too. I took for granted that they were guardian spirits. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Many Malays, Indonesians, Chinese, Indians and others that believed in spirits have been told in their folklore and religion that spirits guarded sacred worshipping places and things or buildings and homes of humans. This was my belief in the past too when I was ignorant about the spirit's nature. There were many stories told by young and old Muslims in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia and perhaps other parts of South-East Asia countries, whereby humans who slept in a Mosque at night and then the next morning they found themselves sleeping outside the Mosque. Majority of them believed in that story. They were told that the Muslim Djinns would carry those people sleeping inside the Mosque to the exterior premises because the sleeping humans were obstructing the praying areas for the Muslim Djinns. So the Muslim Djinns carried their body and put them outside the Mosque.</div>
              <div>In my own opinion, if the stories were true, I would say that they were sleep walking (Somnambulism) or they were possessed by the Muslim Djinns while they were asleep, the Djinns then walked outside the Mosque and left the body there. Whether they were 'Guardian Spirits'? I would say that they were in a sense that they needed to do something and learned more about the question of Life and God for themselves in order to grow and develop further for their soul development. They were not Djinns but souls of decease human beings. Most of them probably were wandering souls and some were permanent occupants in that buildings or homes, that would become their heavens or hells.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Margarita and Natalia could behave like Yani too. Sometimes when the hotel staffs came to see us about some matters unexpectedly, while Margarita or Natalia was talking to me, they could suddenly behaved like Yani and they spoke in Yani's voice toned too.</div>
              <div>There was one occasion whereby Yani had received a phone call at the front reception. After she had hung-up the telephone, Natalia grinned and gave me a little laughed. She said that the caller did not know that she had coversed with her instead of Yani. I saw it with my own eyes and I heard the way she spoke over the phone. It was exactly the idiosyncrasy of Yani. I did not question their ability to impersonate Yani's characters because I knew they could make Yani talked or behaved to anybody as and when they wished to or when it was necessary. I knew they could make Yani become herself again very quickly and later they could possess Yani again without difficulties because they had became experts in their possession skills. I guessed they did that to protect Yani and even avoid her from being seen by other people as strange. If they wanted to trick me or they had tricked me, they could and I would not even know the difference.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>The day came for us to check out from the hotel. It was already late afternoon and we had already finalised the house sale transaction. Yani wanted to do some shopping in Jakarta before we left for Bali. She did not tell me exactly what she wanted to buy. So we checked into another small good hotel, which the ambience was better and their services were efficient. I could not remember the hotel name but it was not so far from Hotel Danau Toba. The hotel exteriror was tinted with many dark glasses.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I stayed behind in the hotel room while Yani went out to do her shopping. When she returned, Natalia came to meet me saying that Yani had coincidentally met her ex-boyfriend, Erick. Then Natalia left Yani's body. She had gone to a jewellery shop in one of the exclusive shopping centre to purchase some jewellery for herself. I guessed it was meant to replace all those jewelleries that we had pawned.</div>
              <div>Natalia had informed me this before Yani told me about it herself. When Yani woke up from her 'slumbering', she told me what I had already heard from Natalia about her coincidental meeting with her ex-boyfriend while shopping for some jewelleries. I was not angry with her or felt jealous about it. I just listened to her and queried some questions as though I had heard it for the first time.</div>
              <div>Later Yani went to sleep because she felt very tired. While watching television and while Yani was sleeping, I felt hungry and so I ordered some food for us through the room service. Yani was really sleeping like a log and she did not know that I had ordered some food. I thought that I would wake her when the food had arrived to our room. I must tell you that I was also thinking that Natalia had not eaten her meal too. I was thinking whether she would turn up and eat together with me. When the food had arrived, Yani was still sleeping soundly and I had carried our meals to the small dining table quietly. Thinking that I would wake Yani up to eat when everything was ready then suddenly, Natalia woke up from the bed behind me and said, "Ah! Mas Robi, I want to sleep but you always call me to eat." She woke up and ate together with me and then left some food for Yani. When Yani personality came back on, while she was eating quietly, she suddenly stopped and she made a remarked to me that she remembered that she was sleeping, "When did you wake me up?" I told her that she had awaken herself and I kept silent. I could see that Yani was really puzzled but she just put the matter aside and ate her meal. I could see that she was still confused after the her meal. </div>
              <div>How did Natalia know about my thoughts for her to eat together with me? Could she read my mind or was Natalia inside my mind? Was I possessed by her without my own knowledge because she too could possess me?</div>
              <div>The next day we checked out from the hotel and proceeded to Mohammad Hatta International Airport in Jakarta. We bought air tickets to Bali. Natalia came to meet me during the flight and said to me, "Mas Robi, how nice it is from above. I wish I've a binocular so that I can see those people below from above." After saying that, she informed me that she would sit in an empty seat next to the window in front of me and left Yani's body.            </div>

              <div><span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #ff0000;">Natalia's regret (1993, Bali)</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>In Bali, we bought a Honda Civic car, 1984 model. We bought it to travel all over Bali and understand the customs, traditions and religion of Balinese. Furthermore, it would be difficult for us to go from one place to another without private transportation.Yani took up driving lessons and I taught her some driving skills too. Then finally, we got ourselves driving licenses. We spent most of the time driving around Bali, going to the places of interest and Yani took up aerobic classes at a residential building next to the side of the main road of Jalan Bypass - Tuban, which was not far from our home. Natalia mentioned to me that she learned driving with Yani. She also mentioned to me that she always followed Yani for aerobics classes too and they would do aerobics together.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>One morning,Yani and I were washing the car outside the garage, in front of our house then suddenly she faced to the house of our neighbour opposite our house and spoke loudly, "Good Morning Mbak Rita. Ya, I'm washing the car." Thinking that she was talking to someone, I looked at our neighbour's house and there was nobody there. I knew it was Natalia talking to someone at our neighbour's house and I asked her who it was. She replied, "Oh! Nothing, Mas Robi." A few questions immediately popped up in my mind, "Who is this Mbak Rita? Is it Margarita or some other spirit entity by the name of Mbak Rita? I know our neighbour and there is nobody by the name of Mbak Rita?" I know Natalia call Margarita Mbak Rita too? Is Margarita and Rita the same entity? And I don't know that Margarita is here in Bali now?" I thought about it for a short while but I did not pursue the matter with Natalia further.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Natalia began to miss her 'husband', Mas Anton, in Jakarta although she had mentioned to me that she already had some spirit friends in Bali, especially within our neighbourhood area, to entertain her. She told me that whenever she listened to her favourite song (a sad song about two lovers being together but her lover married someone else; sang by a popular female Malaysian artist (and Yani too loved that song. Yani too told me that she felt sad when she listened to that song). I could see from her expression that she really felt sad about it. I advised her to be patient and I told her that I believed Mas Anton would come later after he had settled his work duties in Jakarta. At one occasion, she mentioned to me that a male friend of hers from her world had invited her to go to Jogyakarta and she asked for my permission whether she could follow him there. She did not mention to me about her male friend's name and I did not ask her about it too. She told me that she needed some cash for the journey. I told her that I had no objection and I would provide the cash for her. Then a few days later she decided not to go without any reason given to me.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>One late morning, Yani was sleeping and she was like having a bad dream. I noticed that she was sort of rousing herself up from her sleep. So I went to her but she rose up from her reposed position to sit on the bed and she was so angry with me. She sat up with her arms in akimbo. It was someone else staring at me with angry eyes and she said, "You make your wife worry and she is sad about it." This entity spoke like a child and I had the impressioned that it was a boy entity. He shouted at me, "You are not good! You are a bad man! I don't like you!" He looked angry so I queried him, "Who are you talking about? You mean my wife Yani?" He shook his head. "You mean my wife, Noorasmah?" I queried him. He said nothing but nodded his head. "She's in Indonesia? Which hotel is she staying? Where is she now? Is she in Jakarta?" In surprised response I had queried him further all these questions. He stared at me and then went back to sleep and closed his eyes. So I tried to make him talked but he just refused to speak to me. While he was trying to go away from me, I was trying to make him speak to me more so I asked, "Who are you? You know my wife Noorasmah? I want you to tell her that I still love her." That minute when I spoke that statement, Yani suddenly gave me a hard punched above the corner of my right eye and woke up from her sleep. She stared hard at me and lied down. I asked her what was wrong with her and why she did that to me. She seemed very angry and she cried. Then she went back to sleep.</div>
              <div>Later, when Yani had woke up from her sleep, she did not ask me about that incident but she was sulking. Somehow she still remembered my last statement. It seemed that when I said that statement to that spirit boy entity, Yani personality had returned. In my mind, I told myself that probably that spirit boy entity was trying to cause problem between Yani and I. He left Yani's body at the right time when I spoke out that statement and he could make Yani regained her personality immediately. I was also actually wondering maybe I had mistook Yani for that spirit boy entity, which had supposedly possessed Yani's body. I also had wondered to myself whether I had spoken to Yani herself instead of someone else. Any common sense person would say that I was actually talking to Yani and not some possessing boy spirit.</div>
              <div>Yani asked me why I had said that statement to her. I told her that she was like having a bad dream and so I was trying to see whether she was alright. She said that I was talking nonsense. I told her my life with Noorasmah was over and that was in the past. I did not want to think about it anymore. Yani managed to cool herself down and we did not talk about it anymore. I was actually upset and angry too with myself for talking to that boy entity, which supposedly possessed Yani. I was regretting at what I had said to Yani. In my mind, I was thinking maybe it was Natalia and if it was, I was going to scold her.</div>
              <div>Later, when I was sitting down at the dining table, Yani sat opposite me and Natalia came to meet me. This what she had said to me, "Mas Robi, Ibu told me not to meet Mas Robi today because Ibu said that Mas Robi is angry." I asked her angrily, "Natalia was it you?" She replied, "No! Mas Robi." I spoke loudly to her, "Then if it's not you, then WHO!" She was like feeling sad and maybe a little bit angry with me too. "No! It wasn't me. I wasn't around." I asked her, "Then WHO!" Natalia replied, "I don't know but Ibu told me that she saw a boy wearing white shirt and red short like the SD (primary school) uniform. She saw him running out and away from the house when she had returned home. My anger and suspicion on Natalia lessen and then I apologised to her. Then Natalia left Yani's body without a word spoken. I had to trust Natalia's and Ibu's word for it because I saw Natalia sincere expression and I had thought of her like my own sister, though she lived in the unseen realm. Then I let the matter to be forgotten.</div>
              <div>The question here is about my angry thoughts towards Natalia. It was in my mind. How did Natalia know about it though she had said that Ibu had informed her about it? I have to say this one more time. If I had said it to Yani about my anger thoughts towards Natalia, then it would be valid to say that Yani knew about it and turned herself like Natalia's personality, but Yani did not have that knowledge about my anger with Natalia. How did Yani know about a boy entity when she herself did not know about it unless she was pretending to be that spirit boy entity? How could Yani know about it if I did not tell her about it? And how did Natalia know about it?</div>
              <div>Yani was a person who was afraid of ghosts, evil spirits and devils. Yani was not that sort who believed that she had spirits following her around because she was also afraid of being possessed too. Why would Yani behaved in such manner to make me talked about Noorasmah or to make me feel angry and maybe distrust her own mental instability? If she had impersonated those personalities of Natalia or Margarita or Mas Anton, the questioned here is, "Why must she do that?" What she would gain from doing that? Was she really suffering from multi-split personalities or was she suffering from delusion? If she was a manic depressed person, I would be the first one to know.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I was waiting for Yani in the car at the building that she had attended her aerobic classes. I went there to fetch her. After her aerobic classes she saw me and entered the car to sit in the front seat but before she could close the car door, she turned around to face at the back seats and shouted, "Oh! Ah! You cannot follow. You cannot follow. Get out! No! You cannot follow. Come on, get out!" I was so shocked and I turned around to see what was it that she was shouting at. There was nothing there. I asked her why she was shouting. She told me, "Mas Robi, there's a small boy who wants to follow me. I'm telling him that he cannot follow us." She turned to face at the back seat again, "You cannot follow us. Get out. Get out from the car." It was Natalia shouting and not Yani. Then she turned around and sat down quietly. I drove off after that then I asked her, "Who was that small boy?" She said, "I met him here outside the building. He look so dirty and he lives nearby the building in one of those shanty houses by the road side. I gave him some money to buy some food and snacks for himself. He loves to eat Es Dong Dong (ice-cream cone)." I did not ask further about it and we talked for awhile about what she did during the aerobic session and then Natalia left Yani's body. Yani was in that hypnotised state for a few seconds and she spoke to me about her aerobic session too. We did not talk about that invisible boy at the car back seat. Yani was not aware about that incident. I knew it was useless to ask her about that because in the past when I mentioned to her about something Margarita or Natalia did or said, she would be confused and lost. She would not understand my questions. If I told her she would say that I was talking nonsense.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Margarita and Natalia had warned me before not to mention anything to Yani about their possessions and meetings with me. They had told me that if I did that, they would not come and meet me again. I tried to tell Yani about them in Bali but each time I told her, I noticed that she was frightened and she would say that I was talking nonsense and she would disbelieve it. She would refuse to accept the facts that she was possessed. She would take it that I was joking about it even when I was talking to her seriously and she would tell me to stop talking about it. Due to that I stopped talking about it to Yani and we would not talk about it again. I just let things be and let it passed.</div>
              <div>I needed to tell Yani about it and there was no one else to tell to because I did not have any close friends. I was a fugitive and I needed to be in low profile. Furthermore I needed to clarify to her the truth about her being possessed and she disbelieved me. This is my way to tell you that I was not hallucinating or making up the stories. I wanted to see the truth about my encounter with those spirits in Indonesia. I needed to check and balance the rationality of my thoughts because after I had met them through Yani, I was always wondering about them and it seemed that they had spent most of the times with me. It was like a time loss for Yani and sometimes Yani was puzzled about her 'absent-mindedness', which I could see was genuine and it was not an act to delude or please me.</div>
              <div>Then Natalia would meet me to remind me that I was trying to inform Yani about her. I would deny it but she would say that she saw me trying to tell Yani about her. I would keep quiet about it. Natalia was not angry with me but she would sort like pleading with me, childishly crying and wishing that I stopped trying to tell Yani about her or the others. Then she would remind me, "If Mas Robi tell Mbak Yani, I will not meet Mas Robi again." Why are they afraid of me telling Yani? I do not know their reasons. So I would just remind myself not to say anything to Yani about them again and furthermore I loved them like my own family though they were from the world of the unseen. I did not want to lose them either and I enjoyed their companionship too.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Once we had patronised a 24 hrs fast food chain at Legian Street in Kuta, Bali. It was late at night and there were no customers except Yani and I. We ordered our meals and sat down to eat inside the restaurant premises. As we ate, Natalia came to meet me to eat together with me. She said the food was delicious. We were talking about general matters about what she was doing before her appearance and sort of joking about it. I saw there was only one crew at the counter and I was in a jovial mood. So I told Natalia, "Natalia, why not you go to that young girl at the counter and whisper to her ears to order all the meals that they have. So that we can see her reactions later." I thought it would be fun to make ourselves quietly laughed at the young girl at the counter. Natalia giggled about the idea and she was also quite reluctant at first but I persuaded her to do it for fun sake. She left Yani's body and Yani was in that hypnotised state of mind while quietly chewing her food.</div>
              <div>About a minute later to my surprised, I heard that young girl at the front counter started to order all the meals that they had in the their menu and I looked at her. She was ordering the meals over the microphone. There was no customer at the counter and I looked around the restaurant to see whether there were other customers too. There were none. The supervisor came out from the kitchen to see what was happening. I could see from the supervisor's reactioned to that young girl, "Where are the customers? Who are you ordering for?" I could see from my seat that the young girl was confused herself. Then while the supervisor was talking to that young girl at the counter, Natalia came back on, "Mas Robi, next time please do not ask me to do that again. I pity that girl and it is not good to do that." Then she left.</div>
              <div>If Yani was suffering from multi-split personalities, she would not be able to do that tricked on that young girl. It proved to me that Natalia really existed and she was an entity that had her own mind or intelligence. Natalia was not Yani's imagination and Yani did not impersonate the characters of Natalia. Unconsciously, I had experimented and proved to myself that Natalia really possessed Yani to meet me.   </div>

              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: large;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">THEY CAME TO STAY</span></strong> </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: large;"> </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #0000ff;">It could only gestures about with its hands and calling for "Lia, Lia." </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #0000ff;">It was behaving like and talking like a little child. It was trying to talk. </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #0000ff;">So I guessed it meant Natalia's name. </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #ff0000;">I cried so hard when I reviewed this incidence while in Changi Prison </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: xx-small;"> </span></div>
              <div>In late August 1993, I noticed that Yani felt quite lonely without her family near her and I knew she was also worried about her family at the village. We went back to East Java to fetch Yani's half-younger brother Adi to live with us in Bali. He was the second eldest in her family and he was about eighteen years old back then.</div>
              <div>We visited Cak Pur's and Mbak Rani's home. There Mbak Rani told us that Busu felt lonely and sad too because I did not love him like I used to. So, he wished to remain silent. I waited at their home while Yani went back to fetch her half-brother. When Adi came, I was so happy to see him too. We left Cak Pur and Mbak Rani and I did not know how to explain to them about our whereabout for Yani disallowed me to let them know about our address in Bali for security reasons. I let her talked to them while I just remained silent. But they seemed to understand our situation. We bid them farewell and told them that we would visit them again whenever we could. That was the last time I saw and spoke to Cak Pur and Mbak Rani. </div>
              <div>Back in Bali, most of the time we spend our time swimming at Ramayana Hotel at Jalan Kartika Plaza in Kuta to pass our time together and since Adi had never visited Bali before, we showed him most of the places of interest in Bali too. Adi felt thrilled to see tourists, especially White people for he had never had the chance to see those White people personally and he felt embarrassed whenever he saw female tourists in bikinis because for him it was just like seeing them naked.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>There was one occasion in the evening, Yani, Adi and I were talking and joking in the living room. Yani told us that she could make money disappeared. She used Rp1000 currency to demonstrate. She rolled the currency note neatly, placed it on her right palm and closed it tight. The two ends of the rolled currency note were jutting out from her right palm and so she pushed it inside the palm. Then she brought her closed right palm about an inch away from her mouth and then blew on it slowly. She opened up her right palm and the money was gone. When Adi and I requested her to show us again her tricked she refused adamantly. Adi and I were confounded with her magic trick ability.</div>
              <div>We had watched her very carefully. I was watching her hands and her mouth very carefully. Yani never showed me that tricked before and if she had known it, I was very sure she would have shown me earlier, especially, during the period when we were travelling to many parts of Indonesia. During that time, most of our time we played card games and I had shown her some card tricks or other tricks that I knew for entertainment. She had none to show me. The demonstration she did was exactly the same method that the spirit entities, Mbak Seri and Mastro, at Jombang, had demonstrated to Yani and I. Did she learn it from those spirits (Mbak Seri and Mastro) while in Jombang? Was she possessed by one spirit entity that Adi and I were not aware of? If she was, who was it? I do not know where she learned that trick and she never showed it again to anyone. I only saw her did that once.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>One evening, Yani and I were in the living room watching television. Adi was out. Then out of a sudden, Yani laughed loudly in a male voice with her arms akimbo, "Ha..Ha..Ha." Then pointing at me it said, "I know this man. He is not good. I am the 'Jago' (Champion) here." Then he left Yani's body. I was caught by surprised and I felt frightful too with that unexpected demonstration. So while Yani was still in that hypnotised state of mind, angrily I called for Natalia to meet me. Natalia came and I could see that she was afraid of me. Angrily, I asked Natalia whether she was trying to play a joke with me. She claimed it was not her. "It's Ibu's nephew from Jogyakarta (in Central Java) that did that to Mas Robi. He was only joking and playing with Mas Robi. They are laughing now." I asked, "Where is he now?" She replied, "Outside". I went to the main door and angrily in soto voce manner, spoke to someone invisible outside, "If you dare, come and meet me personally. I want to meet you and you better apologise to me nicely." After that I went inside the living room. Natalia had left and Yani was still sitting on a chair and she was still in that altered state of mind. Then he came to meet me through Yani's body again. He stared at me with his arms akimbo and I angrily questioned him why he did that stupid performance upon me. "It's only a joke. I thought I could make you feel frighten. I love to joke." I listened to his explanation and I asked for his name. He called himself Anton. His full name was Anthony and he was a Christian. I told him not to do that kind of tricked on me again and I told him to apologise to me. He apologised honestly and happily. Then I ruffled his hair for him to feel awkward too. He stared at me but he knew I was only joking too. We laughed a little for awhile. He told me that he came to visit his Aunty in Bali for a vacation and he said his sister too came along together with him. After Mas Anton left Yani's body, Nonik, Mas Anton's sister came for awhile to introduce herself  to me. I could not remember what we had talked about. Both of them were teenager spirits. </div>
              <div>About this spirit entity, Mas Anton, he was not Natalia's 'husband' from Jakarta. I think if you asked me now, I would say honestly to you that they could trick me or impersonated themselves as different spirit entities with different names, and I would not know at all would I? </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>This reminded me of the religious teachings of the various faiths, which mentioned the 'evil spirits' and 'devils' could transform themselves into many forms and identities. I would also say that 'angels', 'deities' and God could also transform into many forms and identities too.</div>
              <div>In the past, I had believed in all these evil and holy spirits but I do not believed in them now. Perhaps, I used to believe because I did not 'see' at them seriously and carefully; but after I 'see' them seriously and carefully, it was no longer a belief or faith.</div>
              <div>God is an unseen Supreme Being and Creator. You need faith to believe in Him. If you 'see' God, then it is no longer faith. What would you call it then if it is no longer a belief or faith? I do not want to have Blind Faith or Blinded by Faith. I would just call it Theology Knowledge.</div>
              <div>I would read the Holy Scriptures as a human who wishes to know other humans' way of life and intellectual thinking. If I explained my belief in theological sense, which I normally do to connect my understanding with those who does, I would say that "God" knowledge is Infinite and since His Knowledge is Infinite, that means His Words cannot be compile or written in just one Holy Scripture or even billion and billion of Holy Scriptures too because He is Infinite and His Knowledge is also Infinite. There is no end and His Knowledge will grow together with mankind in time.</div>
              <div>I would also say that Science, Technology and other Knowledge too besides Theology, are also knowledge from 'God' and Theology is only a drop of water in a vast ocean of 'God's Knowledge. The more you learn about other knowledge, in whatever languages it may be, the more you will understand about 'God'. His language is universal and his knowledge is universal too, plus, it is Infinite.</div>
              <div>It is written in the Holy Qur'an that if all the trees are used as pens and all the oceans on the surface of earth are used as inks, all these utilities would be exhausted or insufficient to write all His Words and His Knowledge.</div>
              <div>'God' and mankind grow together with Time throughout the ages. Though it is mentioned in the Holy Qur'an that Allah has completed His religion (Islam) for mankind through His Inspiration by Himself or via His angel to Prophet Muhammad about one thousand five hundred years ago, He did not mention that He has completed His Knowledge for mankind. Prophet Muhammad himself has said that his religion was his religion and other religions were other religions. Allah has mentioned to him that there was no compulsion in Religion.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I would say to you that my Belief and Philosophy is, "Religion lies within every human heart and there it would remain until one fine day, you discover it for yourself." Where I got this statement? I heard and felt a whisper in my heart when I questioned myself the definition of religion, in cell number 23, landing three, F Hall, Changi Prison, in 1996.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
              <div>I bought an air-rifle for my past time to shoot some small clay crabs at a small river next to an abandoned fish farming pond.This area was situated inside a compound of an empty and deteriorating house, which was formerly the main house for the fish-farming business. Its gates were always opened and I could go there anytime of the day. Adi used the air-rifle for shooting some birds and small iguanas. He managed to adapt himself with Bali environment and he had a good Javanese friend with him always.</div>
              <div>One early morning, while I was shooting at the clay crabs alone, then came Yani to join me. Then later, Natalia and Nonik came to join me with the shooting activity. They took turned to shoot at the clay crabs. They seemed pleased with their shooting ability too. They told me that there was an old male spirit, wearing black attires in their world that scolded them for shooting the clay craps. He lived in that empty and deteriorating house within the compound. He said something like this to them, "Why must you shoot them? They have done nothing wrong to you." Was that question meant for me to see that lives of all living things are precious?</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Natalia, Nonik, Anton and I went to many places of interest and sometimes we went to a discotheque at Melia Bali Sol Hotel, a five star hotel at Nusa Dua. Yani disallowed Adi to follow us because she did not want her brother to be influence by this kind of nightlife.</div>
              <div>There they would take turn to dance with me but normally, I would not dance. I loved to watch people danced. Yani would not be aware of her being possessed by these spirit entities and I too sometimes found it difficult to identify who was who because they came and went without noticed. Yani sometimes would not be in the altered state of mind before or after they came. Its like she became so easy for them to take over her body and mind in a split second. The Yani I used to know became like someone else and sometimes she became quite upset with her own brother for minor mistakes. She seemed to become hot tempered and she experienced frequent headaches.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Nonik met me once about the schools in Bali. She asked me whether I knew any good schools in Bali that she could go to. She loved Bali and she thought of living in Bali with her aunty. She wished to quit school in her spirit world, in Jogyakarta and continued her education in Bali. She told me she was in SMA 3 (equivalent to second year college student in Singapore). I borrowed from my neighbour a telephone directory and she started jotting down all the SMA schools nearby and in Kuta area on a piece of paper. Her handwriting was neat if compared to Yani's handwriting.</div>
              <div>One month later, Yani found the list of schools. She asked me whose handwriting was it and I told her that she had wrote it herself. I knew who wrote it but I wanted to see Yani's reaction. She denied it.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>One afternoon, Yani was sitting on the floor at the living room eating. Then without any warning, she called out, "Lia, Lia." I was surprised to see her acted that way because I had never came across this behaviour before. I knew it was not Yani's personality. </div>
              <div>I tried to communicate with this entity but it seemed that it could not converse with me at all. It could only gestures about with its hands and calling for "Lia, Lia." It was behaving and talking like a little child. It was trying to talk. So I guessed it meant Natalia's name.</div>
              <div>I asked this entity whether it meant "Natalia". It nodded to me with its sad eyes. It saw a plate of rice in front and it grabbed a fist of rice and ate them as though it was very, very hungry. I let it be for awhile and I was wondering who was this entity. It seemed that Natalia was not around so I asked it where it was staying. It showed me with its hand at a direction which I had assumed was at the building where Yani went for her aerobic classes. I asked whether it was staying there. It nodded to me with an innocent child expression. Then I realised it was that small boy entity that Natalia had shouted at in the back seat of the car after Yani had completed her aerobic classes not long ago. He was very hungry and he kept eating the rice on the plate. I asked him whether he wanted to return to his home. He nodded and I took him by his hand while he was still eating the rice.</div>
              <div>As I brought him to the car, I saw he walked with difficulties because his left leg was bend and his whole left foot was bending inward. He walked with the outer side of his left foot. He was a crippled. His left hand was sort of bend too. His whole body slanted to the left side and both his arms were lifted up as he walked, as though like a little child trying to balance himself as he learned to walk.</div>
              <div>He was like sad when I put him inside the car. I was trying to send him back at his home as fast as I could and when I stepped on the accelerator, he was crying and gesturing to me to slow down because he was afraid of the speed of the car.</div>
              <div>Upon reaching at the building where Yani attended her aerobic classes, I could see he was very sad to leave. He quietly looked at me with that sad innocent child face and with his right hand he waved goodbye to me. Then he left.</div>
              <div>Yani regained her consciousness and she asked me why we were inside the car. I told her that we went for a car ride. I could not recall whether I had talked to Natalia about it or not, but this incident caused me pain within my heart, each time I thought about it. I felt I was cruel towards this little child. I could have let him eaten more food and probably waited for Natalia to meet me. I could have known this little boy better and made him part of the family sooner instead of sending him back to his home. I was pleased when sometime later he came to my house again.          </div>

              <div><strong></strong> </div>
              <div><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #ff0000;">Gordon's and Jean's comment (In Bali, 1993)</span></strong></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: large;"></span> </div>
              <div>We went to Burger King fast food chain restaurant in the late evening at Legian Street in Kuta, Bali. Yani and I, Natalia, Nonik and Mas Anton were together with us. Natalia came and ate together with me. Then Natalia suddenly said, "Hmmm...Handsome. He looks handsome." So I looked up and asked her what she meant by that statement. She said that there were two White men seating at the table behind me. I turned around to see, there was nobody; the seat and table were empty. Natalia kept smiling at something behind me and said, "Handsome. Handsome. They are looking at me and smiling too." So I told her, "Why not make friends with them and tell them to join us." "Oh! Mas Anton is already talking to them now", she replied. I told Natalia that later we could go for a car ride, probably they could join us and see Bali. Natalia said that they were reluctant to follow us because they did not want to trouble me. I told Natalia to tell them not to worry about that and just joined us. Then Natalia said that they agreed to my invitation.</div>
              <div>Natalia said that their names were Gordon and Jean. They were Australians going for a long vacation after completing their studies. They planned to travel to Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines and Indonesia.</div>
              <div>We went for a car ride towards Nusa Dua Beach. Yani was conscious of our journey to Nusa Dua Beach and she was asking me why we were going there. I told her that I just wanted to see Nusa Dua Beach at night. When we reached that area in Nusa Dua where it was quite dark, Natalia came, "Ah! It's dark. I'm so scared Mas Robi. I'm going to sit at the back seat together with them."</div>
              <div>At Nusa Dua Beach, it was quite dark but I knew from what they (Margarita and Natalia) had told me that their world would be day time and I felt no fear within me, after I had known about their world time difference from my world (the physical world). I have no more fears of the darkness and the Beings of darkness because I had surmounted it as a person who believes that Beings of the unseen and humans are all the same.</div>
              <div>Yani and I brought a torch light out from the car front compartment for this trip and we sat down watching the nightlights at the distance from Nusa Dua Beach.</div>
              <div>Natalia came to meet me laughing, "Mas Robi, Gordon and Jean are sun tanning and swimming naked. They don't feel shameful. They're beaconing to Nonik and me to join them. Mas Anton is swimming in the sea and he wore trouser." Than Natalia left Yani's body.</div>
              <div>Yani and I were conversing about our future and some other matters about her brother, Adi. She wished that Adi could learn English and probably worked in for the hotels or restaurants in Bali. I told her that we needed to send Adi for English lessons and I would teach him some English too.</div>
              <div>Natalia came again, "Mas Robi, they're rich men. They've lots of US dollars." Natalia told me all these with excitement in her voice. I could not recall what else I had spoken to Natalia or to them through Natalia. </div>
              <div>After spending our time at Nusa Dua Beach, we went for a car ride around Bali at Kuta and Denpasar. We came home about 4 a.m. in the morning and I did not sleep that night. Yani slept like a log. I washed the car instead of going to sleep. I only slept after washing the car.</div>
              <div>The next day, near noontime, after I woke up from my sleep, Yani was already awake and preparing some lunched. Natalia came and said, "Gordon and Jean wish to return to their hotel. They want to take a taxi but Gordon and Jean wish to thank Mas Robi before they leave. They say that they do not know how to come to meet Mas Robi because they do not know the knowledge of possession. I want to teach them but they say that if they come to the world of physical, they probably would not want to return home to the world of the spirit again." I offerred to send them back to their hotel and Natalia said, "They say Mas Robi is tired because Mas Robi did not sleep the whole night. They're wondering why Mas Robi can't sleep at night." I thought that probably Natalia had told them about it because I usually had difficulties sleeping at night. I told Natalia to tell them not to worry about it and I wished to send them back to their hotel.</div>
              <div>I send them back to their hotel. They were staying at Kartika Plaza Hotel at Jalan Kartika Plaza in Kuta. It was a five star hotel. At the hotel car park, Natalia came to me again, "Mas Robi, Gordon and Jean invited us (Natalia, Nonik and Mas Anton) to their room. Is it okay with you if we follow them?" I told Natalia that it was alright then she left Yani's body. Yani was still in hypnotised state when I drove off from the hotel car park and during the journey back home, she regained her consciousness. I could not recall what happend after that.</div>
              <div>
              <div>Yani and I used to go for a car ride to know Bali better and we always did this to pass time when I could not sleep at night. I was not working for about a year and during that period we were always going to places to see more things. I was thinking about what sort of small business that we should open up in Bali. Quietly too, in my mind, I was actually thinking about Noorasmah and her situation in Singapore.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
              <div>After the meeting with Gordon and Jean, most of the times Yani and I had our own life back again. There were no frequent possession like in the past. Yani was always her usual self. Natalia and the others seemed too busy with their own activities.</div>
              <div>However, there was one occasion when Yani and I went to Kuta to eat chicken porridge. Chicken porridge was Yani's favourite dish. Yani ate about three bowls of chicken porridge because Natalia, Nonik, Mas Anton, Gordon and Jean were also eating together with her. I ate about two bowls of chicken porridge (only). Natalia mentioned to me, "Gordon and Jean love the chicken porridge but we've to be considerate about the food intake or else Mbak Yani will feel too full." It seemed that Natalia had taught Gordon the art of possession on humans. </div>
              <div>Gordon and Jean seemed to be very quiet spirit entities. I always heard news about them from Natalia and Mas Anton. Gordon did not speak to me when I spoke to him. He just listened to me without looking at me. He loved to eat salads at home. Jean never met me either and Nonik seldom came to meet me because she was busy with Jean. Mas Anton and Natalia told me that Nonik and Jean were closed. She seemed to be fond of Jean rather than Gordon. Nonik would talk to me about Jean those few occasions when she came to meet me. Well, I really could not recall my conversation with Nonik, sorry.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>One early evening at home, Yani went to the front door, then suddenly she became hysterical, crying and shouting, "Ah! Get away! Ah! Get away!" I rushed to the door to see what was happening but I saw nothing outside the door. I quickly brought Yani to the sofa to sit and she calmed down. I asked her what was the matter but she remained silent in a dazed. Natalia came to meet me and said, "Mas Robi, Nonik saw a cripple and dirty little boy outside the door. She was startled by this little boy appearance outside the door. This boy is the boy I met at the outside of the building, where Mbak Yani and I attended the aerobic classes. He's here to look for me. Gordon carried the boy inside." Natalia told me that his leg was crippled and he had no family; but everyday there was an old woman who gave him food to eat. She did not know who was that old woman. He was an orphan.</div>
              <div>After listening to her I had thought about my encounter with this little boy entity. I was quiet and lost in my own thoughts. Then Natalia informed me that Ibu was not willing to take care of this little boy. I told Natalia that she was an orphan too and she should know what it was like to be an orphan. I told her that I wished this boy to be a part of our family. Natalia was quiet but she knew my empathy for this boy and she agreed to my wish. That day this boy became our family and from that day he lived with us. Natalia did not know his name so she said that they would think of a name for him.</div>
              <div>The next day, he came while I was driving and he was so happy travelling in a car. He played with the cassette player and pounding his hands on the dashboard, so I had to speak to him and controlled him. Natalia came earlier on to speak to me before he came to meet me. So, I guessed Natalia and the rest probably wanted me to be accustomed to him.  He really behaved and sounded like a little child. He was like learning and trying to talk. He had difficulties in explaining and expressing things. Natalia said Gordon estimated that this boy aged was around two or two and the half years old. Then later, they decided to name him Soni because he loved to listen to the 'SONY' compact hi-fi system at home. Soni called me, "Om (uncle) Bi."</div>
              <div>Mas Anton told me that they went to Soni's living quarters. There they saw the place was filthy and stuffy. There were many newspapers lying around and the house was dark.</div>
              <div>As time went by, Soni and I became quite closed. I began to loved his company and I pampered him with care and my love. He always slept with Yani and I. He would suckle his thumb until he fell asleep. Like a little child, his body was flexible and he could fold up his legs all the way up to bite his own toes. Yani never did that. The rest were quiet and Soni was the one who had always talked to me with his baby language. He could also joke with me and I taught him to behave obediently too when he was naughty.</div>
              <div>Sometimes at home Soni would crawl to me because he found it difficult to walk. One evening, Adi saw Soni walked up to me limping. So he laughed because he thought that Yani was joking around. He saw and heard Yani talking to me like a child who was like learning to talk and he cound not understand it. I told Adi that Yani was possessed by a little boy spirit. He just stared at me and said nothing because he was not sure what I meant. He kept quiet and never asked me any questions.</div>
              <div>I think Adi told his sister about it but he faced the same thing. Yani disbelieved him. Natalia, Nonik, Mas Anton and Gordon never showed to Adi their presence and personalities. They knew when to behave like themselves and when to behave like Yani. Unlike Soni, sometimes when we were eating at Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant, he would eat and talk like a small child. Sometimes people would be puzzle by Yani's behaviours and conversation. I would always tell Soni softly to behave and he sometimes listened to me and sometimes he did not. I was relieved that each time when Soni came to meet me we were sitting down and not while we were walking in shopping centres, supermarkets and fast food chain restaurants.</div>
              <div>Natalia told me that Nonik loved to tease Soni with the word "Pencang or Cang", which in Bahasa Indonesia or Malay means as a Limper. Natalia told me that Soni would bite Nonik or anyone who called him that name.</div>
              <div>Soni loved to eat ice-cream cone, which he called it as "Es Dong Dong". Dong-Dong means holding in the hand. I had to buy for him cartons of ice-cream just to make him happy and he disliked seeing Adi eating his ice-cream without his permission and Adi did not know about this. I knew because Soni had complained to me in his own language. He seemed to dislike Adi and I did not know why. Adi seemed to mind his own business and he did not seem to realise that his sister was really not herself because he had told himself that probably Yani was just jestering around with her funny characters.</div>
              <div>He loved flowers with sweet aromas. Many a time, he had actually wanted to pluck some beautiful colourful flowers just outside the front door but I stopped him. I told him that Mbak Yani would be mad with him should he do that. Then he would listen to me and stopped begging me to pluck the flowers for him. I had too because those flowers were Yani's favourite flowers. It seemed that the house belongs to Ibu and I suspected that those flowers were also Ibu's favourite flowers. She was the 'boss' and the others were just her guests staying in her home.</div>
              <div>When we went swimming, I saw Soni swimming like a baby with difficulties because of his left hand and left leg were handicapped. When the tourists that were patronising the Ramayana Hotel restaurant, next to the swimming pool saw it, they just observed with full attention because they thought that Yani was a handicapped; but when Yani came out from the swimming pool, they were surprised to see Yani walked normally. They were puzzled. I could see their face expression and they would just look at us and some of them even smiled at us.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>We spend our time swimming, shopping, listening to music and watching videos, watching the sunset at Kuta Beach, sight-seeing Bali tourists' areas, eating in fast food chains (KFC, Burger King &amp; Pizza Huts) and western or local restaurants or at road side food vendors, going to the discotheques and going for night car rides whenever I could not sleep at night. At one occasion, Natalia came to me while we were at KFC. After we ate she wanted to walk through the glass screen instead of exiting from the main entrance because the car was parked near the glass screen panels where we had sat down to eat. I stopped her from doing that and she told me that she had forgotten that she was inside Mbak Yani's body. I guessed, perhaps she was playing with me.</div>
              <div>I have to let you know that they told me that they too have foods in their spirit world. They could even cook it at home or they could buy the foods with their money. They said that they used Indonesian currency or if they had US dollars, they could use it too. They need not have to eat in the humans' world. They even told me that in their world, they have police, military and other professions too. Inside my mind when I heard them mentioned that back then, I had believed that there was another world just like the physical world.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Natalia began to miss Mas Anton alot because there was still no news from him. I told her to contact Margarita in Jakarta to see Mas Anton. She said that there was no news yet about Mas Anton in Jakarta. She was really worried and miserable when she thought about Mas Anton in Jakarta; but Gordon and the rests had managed to make Natalia happy.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>When we travelled in a car at night, many dogs would crowd around it to bark and howl, even within my own neighbourhood vacinity. Sometimes, late at night, the dogs would bark and howl in front of my home too. Sometimes while I filled up the car for petrol at Pertamina Petrol Station at night, any dogs opposite the road would bark and howl at my direction. Then later, when we had opened up a small mini-restaurant business, while Yani was riding around on her bicycle, many dogs would crowd around her too to bark and howl but they never bit her. Once she fell down from her bicycle because of this. Natalia told me that the dogs would not bark or howl at them after they had gotten used to them. They never mentioned to me about animals in their world. I wonder why?   </div>

              <div> </div>
              </div>
              <div>One evening at the door, Yani turned around to face me with her arms akimbo and stared at me angrily. Then she said, "Where is my friend? Why you take away my friend from me? Om (Uncle), just because you're rich, you think you can take my friend from me! And now I've no more friend to play with me." Her voice sounded like a boy. I was surprised because Yani and I did not have any misunderstanding pertaining to friends. Adi was out with his close friend.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>He called himself as Budi. He was looking for Soni. Budi stayed at the lifeguards' shed at Kuta Beach, which was not far from Yulia Beach Inn, where Yani and I accommodated in the past when we first came to Bali.</div>
              <div>He said that he was the one who had nursed and taken care of Soni until he was healed from his injuries. Soni was knocked down by a car and became a crippled. </div>
              <div>Budi did not know his parents but he told me that he had a photograph of his father who he had mentioned was from Singapore.</div>
              <div>He loved Soni because they had always played together at the riverbank. He and Soni used to earn money by running errands for the tourists to buy foods, drinks or cigarettes for them at Kuta Beach and the tourists would then give them tips. I did not know whether Budi knew Soni's real name. It did not cross my mind to ask Budi what name he used to call Soni before Soni came into my life.</div>
              <div>When I asked Budi whether he would like to stay with us, he said that he was already big enough to take care of himself. I told him that he could come to our home anytime he wished . He could eat, watch television or listen to music, take a bath, meet and play with Soni. I told him that I wanted him to be near Soni again. He liked that idea. He wished to learn to play the guitar and I taught him some tunes. That day onward, he became a part of our family. Later when Natalia met me, she said that Budi was about six or seven years old and he looked like a Chinese or a Japanese. He was an orphan too. </div>

              <div> </div>
              <div>Natalia met me one evening saying that Gordon wished to 'marry' her. Gordon wanted to know whether I would agree to his proposal of 'marriage' to her since I was like a brother to her. He was talking to me through Natalia and I did not know why he had refused to meet me personally. I was speechless and I was also thinking about Natalia 'marriage' to Mas Anton in Jakarta. I thought about it and told myself that maybe Mas Anton was not able to commit himself to Natalia. It seemed that Gordon was more a suitable spirit to take care of Natalia. It was a difficult situation and I was not so sure whether Mas Anton was coming to Bali or not. It was already about three months since I spoke to Mas Anton in Jakarta at Danau Toba Hotel and he had not arrived in Bali yet.</div>
              <div>I asked Natalia whether Gordon was present with us and she said that Gordon was sitting in an empty chair just next to me. Natalia informed me that Gordon said that if Mas Anton came to Bali, he would like to meet him and tell him what he felt for Natalia. Gordon said that he loved Natalia and he would take care of Natalia well. I did not know how to answer them.</div>
              <div>I asked Natalia whether she loved Gordon and she replied 'yes' to me. I asked her about Mas Anton and whether she really wished to marry Gordon. She replied that Mas Anton was already not interested in fulfilling her dream. When I asked her what she meant by that statement, she did not elaborate anything to me because she told me that I would know about it soon. She sounded rather sorrowful and disappointed. I need to know her feelings for Mas Anton because she seemed rather furious with Mas Anton. She cried when she mentioned this to me, "I wish I had met Gordon earlier instead of Mas Anton."</div>
              <div>So I asked Gordon through Natalia whether he really loved Natalia. Gordon answered 'yes'. I decided to agree with their planned because I felt that maybe Mas Anton would not fulfill his promised and Gordon would make a better 'husband' and he would be able to provide Natalia security and a good life.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Yani and I went to a private hospital in Denpasar for fertility medical examination. Natalia came to meet me for awhile and then left because she was afraid of the injection needle. Later when she came again to meet me, she told me that Gordon and her too went to see a doctor in their world for fertility medical examination. I was surprised to hear that and I was also surprised to hear that they too have doctors in their world. It was like that for me and I believed that you too are surprised to hear about this.</div>
              <div>Natalia informed me too that they had seen and consulted a specialist doctor in their world pertaining to Soni's handicapped. The doctor in their world told them that Soni's left leg and left arm could still be rectified through operation because Soni was still very young and it was not too late for them to make it normal again. Natalia said that the expenses for the operation was going to be expensive and the whole medical expenses would be about US$20,000. She told me that Gordon was willing to bear the expenses. They had decided to have the operation done for Soni and it would be soon.</div>
              <div>A few days later, Natalia informed me that Soni had gone for the operation and he was doing well. His left leg and left arm was casted. Natalia said that everything would be well for Soni and they needed to take good care of Soni. Natalia informed me that Soni was resting in the hospital and they would be present at the hospital for Soni. I told Natalia to convey my gratitude to Gordon for helping Soni and I. I did not have that kind of money to help Soni even if Soni was a physical boy instead of a boy spirit. </div>
              <div>A few days later Soni came to meet me and with his baby talked and gesturing, he showed me his left leg and left arm. He disallowed me to touch his left leg and left arm. He said it was painful when I did that. He seemed like in pain. So, to brighten him up and forget about his pains, I had promised him that I would buy for him cartons and cartons of ice-creams for being a brave and good boy. He nodded happily and he smiled at me. I was so pleased and happy for him too because he would be able to walk normally again like those normal children. And I could not wait for the day for Soni to show me that he could walk normally again.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>A week later, Natalia, Mas Anton and Nonik told me that Gordon's parents and siblings had arrived in Bali. They came to meet Natalia and to witness the 'marriage'. Gordon's parents and siblings were from Australia and New Zealand. I was informed by them that Gordon's parents and siblings were present at my home at Kuta Permai. I was so pleased to hear that news. However, they did not meet up with me and spoke to me personally but they did mention that I was so different from other humans that they had met. Natalia told me that Gordon's parents wanted to see me and they were not accustomed to meeting humans like the way I met Natalia and the rest. It seemed that they wished to keep their distance from me and I assured them through Natalia that I was happy to have them as my guests of honour in my own home. Natalia laughed when I told her to mention that to them. And she told me that they laughed too, perhaps for them, this kind of situation was something out of this world. Probably too, they thought that I was mad to believe such things could happen. Well, it happened.</div>
              <div>Gordon's nephew came to meet me instead. He called himself as Henry. A boy spirit from New Zealand. In the beginning, he found it difficult to express himself in "Bahasa Indonesia" (Indonesian National Language) but later he could converse to me in Bahasa Indonesia with a foreign accent. He loved to listen to Indonesian and Malay songs, especially, traditional and pop songs. He loved the sounds of the traditional instrument of the 'Gamilan', which was usually used for traditional music in Indonesia and Malaysia. He loved to speak to me in Bahasa Indonesia even though I had spoken to him in English. </div>
              <div>Here, I liked to emphasize that Yani did not know to converse or understand English. In this incident, 'Yani' could comprehend English. I was puzzled at first but then I realized that she was possessed by Henry and Yani did not know anything about it the whole time.</div>
              <div>Henry loved to eat whatever Yani had cooked, especially, the dish of fried potatoes mixed with eggs. He too loved to eat the Indonesian food called 'Bakso' or Beef Meatballs soup with noodles. And he also mentioned to me that he loved to play with Soni and Budi too. They were good friends to one another.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Mas Anton told me that Natalia's and Gordon's wedding would be held in a five star hotel at Nusa Dua. On the day of Natalia's and Gordon's 'wedding', Yani and I went for a dinner at that five star hotel where the 'wedding' was to take place. Indirectly, I felt that if I did that, it meant that I was attending Natalia's and Gordon's 'wedding' solemnisation. I was hoping that Natalia would meet up with me at the hotel's restaurant to tell me about her 'wedding' day. She did not turn up nor did the rest too. I felt a little bit disappointed.</div>
              <div>After dinner, Yani and I went back home. Yani was so happy with the dinner we had at the exclusive hotel and she felt very pleased with my idea of having dinner in that grand hotel at Nusa Dua.</div>
              <div>The next day, Mas Anton came to meet me and he informed me that Natalia and Gordon had gone for their 'honeymoon.' He would be taking care of Soni during Natalia's absence. He made a remarked, "Your sister got married but you didn't give her anything."</div>
              <div>Mas Anton said that Gordon's family would be around for a few more days before they returned to Australia and New Zealand. Mas Anton told me that Budi, Soni and Henry were always out and playing together. </div>
              <div>Mas Anton too told me that Nonik and Jean were also falling love. Nonik came to meet me and she said that while Natalia was dressing-up in her wedding gown, she was always asking for me whether I was present at the hotel or not. She was very excited. That was all Nonik told me and then she left. In my heart, I felt pleased and happy. Natalia did not forget about me.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Natalia told me once before that Gordon's parents had owned a hotel in Sydney in Australia and they were very wealthy. And Gordon's was their only son and they really loved Gordon very much. This was the reason Gordon's parent's had relented to his wish and Gordon was unhappy with his life because his girlfriend married another guy. That was the reason Gordon and Jean wanted to see the other countries so that he could make himself happy again instead of being sad always.     </div>

              <div><strong><span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #ff0000;">Margarita (Bali, 1993)</span></strong></div>
              <div><strong></strong> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>During Natalia's absence, Mas Anton, Soni and sometimes Budi, came to meet me. Mas Anton said that Nonik and Jean were always together and they wished to spend time alone most of the times. Mas Anton said that he had to carry Soni around when they went out to places and he felt like a baby sitter, but he did not mind it because he loved Soni too. Mas Anton said that his father from Jogyakarta had advised him to survey the market in Bali. His father would like to see Mas Anton do business in Bali since he loved to stay in Bali. His father would support him with the capital. Mas Anton said that maybe he would like to open up a travelling business in Bali.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Budi told me that he usually played with Soni at the riverbank most of the time. Budi would come to watch television or video movies or he would play the guitar and asked me to teach him more about guitar playing. I would relent to his requests most of the times. He was happy to be a part of the family now.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>At this period of time, many of the neighbourhood's little boys and girls would come to watch the video movies at our home. They loved to watch these movies because I played all the good movies for them to watch. Yani and I did not mind at all of their presence and company. In fact we loved to have them around in our house because it made the house lively. Adi would play with them or talked to them but most of the times he was always out with his friend.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Soni would converse with me with his child talked and he would always ask me for Natalia's whereabouts. It seemed that he missed Natalia so much. I had to explain to him that Natalia and Gordon went for their honeymoon and I had to assure him that Natalia would return home soon.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>One day while Yani and I were travelling in our car towards Denpasar to buy our groceries at the supermarket in Matahari Shopping Centre, Yani was in a dazed and then Margarita surprised me with her presence. I was so happy to meet her again after a long period of her absence. Margarita said that it was better for Natalia to forget about Mas Anton in Jakarta because he had decided to marry the daughter of his employer. His employer had promised him that the hotel business would be his if he agreed to marry his daughter. His employer's daughter was a handicapped and she was in a wheelchair. Mas Anton took the offer of his employer.</div>
              <div>Later, I showed Margarita the Hyatt Hotel at Nusa Dua, where Natalia's wedding was held and she said "Wow!" She was very pleased with it. She said, "Natalia is lucky to have Gordon in her life now. She has suffered so much and I am very happy for her."</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Mas Anton told me that when Margarita told him that she was my 'wife', he was shocked and he could not believed it. Budi met me to ask me whether the fat woman that adorned herself with many jewelleries assertion that she was my 'wife' was true or false. I replied to him "Yes, Its true." He was shocked and surprised too and then he left without any more questions. Nonik asked me the same question too and I replied to her with the same answer as I had replied to Mas Anton and Budi. She said that Ibu was shocked and surprised too. Then she left.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Margarita told me that she left Jakarta without her parent's knowledge and she came to Bali with her friends for a holiday. But her friends did not know her secret destination and intention. She would love to live in Bali with Yani and I. I was not so sure whether it was good or bad for her to come but it was a dream come true for her. As she always told me before, "I will know where you are and I love you so much Mas Robi."</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I like to mention something here. When Yani and I were staying at Hotel Danau Toba in Jakarta, the owner and manager of that hotel was a cripple. He was bounded to a wheelchair.</div>

              <div> </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>One afternoon Yani was possessed by an entity who was crying out, "Ni! Ni! Ni!" It was looking for Soni. This entity's behaviour was also like Soni but the difference was, it was not handicapped. It could not talk well like Soni though and it had difficulties in expressing itself. So I let it took a nap for awhile with me and when I woke up, I saw it was playing with the make-up sets that belongs to Yani. It was playing with the lipsticks and it's face was messy with lipsticks and make-up powders. I stopped it from playing further with the lipsticks and make-up sets. It was happy playing with it and I told it not to play with it anymore. I tried to explain to it that Yani would be angry if she found out. It listened to me with it's happy and innocent face, just like a little child. After that we took our nap again. I observed the behaviours of this entity very closely and it liked to suckle its right thumb and before it went to sleep, it's eyes were moving aimlessly, staring at the ceiling, as though it was thinking or wondering about something.</div>
              <div>Later when Margarita came to meet me, she said that this entity was a small boy and he looked like Soni. They were like twins and they were both White Boys, with blonde hair and deep blue eyes. His name was Heru. Margarita said that Mas Anton was so surprised to see another boy who looked just like Soni. That day, Heru became a part of our family.</div>
              <div>Margarita and Mas Anton told me that they went to the shanty houses along the riverbank near a bridge just next to Jalan Bypass, just outside the entrance of Kuta Permai residential area. There they met an old woman that was taking care of Heru.</div>
              <div>The old woman told them that Soni and Heru were borne by a woman who was a singer and she had fallen in love with an Australian man. There was a local man who was also interested in her but she had rejected him and he did some black magic charmed on her. The Australian man was deported to Australia when she was already pregnant. Then later, Soni and Heru were born and one night their mother quietly left them. Soni was taken care by a family that was living at the house near to the building where Yani had took up her aerobic classes. Heru was taken care by the old woman herself. When the family that was taking care of Soni wanted to shift, Soni had refused to follow them and after that he lived all by himself in that house. Budi and Soni would always drop by her house to play with Heru at the riverbank. </div>
              <div>Margarita and Mas Anton had invited the old woman to stay with them at our home in Kuta Permai but the old woman had declined the offer because she did not want to burden them. The old woman said that she was very happy to see Heru being a part of their family because Heru would have all the things he wanted in his life. She was not able to provide Heru those things that little boys would like to have in his life. Heru addressed me as "Om (Uncle) Bi" too. In the later part of my life in Bali, Heru became very, very closed to me. He was like a son to me and I was like a father to him.</div>
              <div>It did not cross my mind to ask Margarita or Mas Anton to query that old woman, Soni's real name. Sorry, I wish I had.</div>
              <div>By the way, this story reminded me about Yani's personal life story of her own mother. This story too sort of reminded me about my own story, especially about being deported. Was it a premonition or a predestine planned about my future before it actually took place? I sometimes wondered about it but I took it as only a story that could happen to anybody, anywhere and at anytime in the whole wide world, without even seeing it as predestiny or a prophecy. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>When I met Heru, there was a thought that flashed in my mind that Soni and Heru were possibly White Boys. I could not explain to you why I thought that way but I was wondering where that thought came from. I must say something here. I did not know why they had never mentioned to me before that Soni was a white boy. Coincidentally, my neighbour next door had twin babies too. One was a male and the other one was a female. Their aged were around one and the half year old and these twins had an elder brother, aged around seven years old. Their mother was a Balinese Christian and she worked as a money-changer in Kuta. Her husband worked on a fishing trawler and he was a Javanese Muslim. He would only be at home for a short period, about a month rest, and then he would go for oversea trips again. His mother was an old woman from Jakarta and she was there to take care of her grandchildren. Yani was quite closed to this old woman because she could converse with Yani in Javanese. Yani too loved to play with the twins and the twins' mother too was very friendly with Yani and I.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Most of the religious teachings taught that every human has a guardian angel or a good spirit to guide and protect them in their lives. While I was doing my researched in Singapore pertinent to the spirits that I had encountered while living in Indonesia, I was wondering and questioning the possibilities of these so called guardian angels or good spirits crossing over to other humans' lives or go into humans' mind to do their angelic mission. I had postulated it that it was plausible because they seemed to know what I was thinking in my mind. They had used simple scenarios that they had picked up from my own life or Yani's life. They seemed to teach me or guided me or reminded me or change my principles and conscience in my life while I was living in Indonesia.</div>
              <div>Have you ever thought of some problems or questions secretly in your mind, which you alone knew about it? Then when you talked to someone else about other matters, they seemed to talk about your secret problems or questions and they even gave answers or solutions to your secret problems or questions obliviously. When this happens to you, it is like coincidence or synchronisity or God was using him or her as His instrument to talk to you. I think it is quite wonderful to have this enigma questions and later have someone else gives you the answers. Some religious people called it as a miracle. Many of you would call it as instincts or intuitions. Many psychics would call it telepathy or synchronisity. I would call it as interaction and communication of the souls in the unseen realm. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>One day Natalia came to meet me. She and Gordon had just returned home from their honeymoon and they were very surprised to meet Heru too. They did not know that Soni had a twin brother. She told me that Gordon was worried about handling two little boys. I told Natalia to inform him not to worry about it because I would try to help him taking care of them too.</div>
              <div>Natalia said that they went to Lake Toba in Sumatra and Batam for their honeymoon. They had wanted to go to Singapore but they were afraid of being caught by the 'police' in the spirit world there because Natalia did not have a passport.</div>
              <div>She also mentioned that when Gordon and her were honeymooning, there were many spirits in their world were surprised to learn that Gordon was her 'husband' because they thought that Natalia was a sister or a daughter to Gordon. This statement that she told me reminded me of the times when Yani and I were going to many places in Indonesia.</div>
              <div>Many Indonesian people had wondered the same thing about our relationship. We too were in Batam island before and I did have a fantasy about sneaking into Singapore but I had never told Yani about it. How did Natalia know about my thought and was she using this story about her honeymooning as a guideline for her to use it on me? While Yani and I were drifters within Indonesia, we told many people too that we had just got married and we were on our honeymoon journey.    </div>

              <div> <span style="font-size: xx-small; color: #ff0000;">Margarita's warning (1993, Malang, East Java)</span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>After Heru became a part of the family, Mas Anton told me that Natalia, Gordan and Soni were staying in one of the hotel at Nusa Dua for a week or two after they had returned from their honeymoon. Later on after their returned, Natalia told me that Gordon just wanted to have some privacy and time for themselves. They brought Soni along with them because Natalia had promised me that she and Gordon would take care of him. I guessed they had regarded Soni like their own 'son'.   </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>During Soni's absence, Heru was always looking for Soni but I told him that Soni would be back soon. He too loved flowers with sweet aroma. He loved to see things and he loved to stare at it and then he would query me about them. So I talked to him more often than the rest. I could not remember much about what Heru and I talked about because he was still communicating to me like a child learning to talk.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>
              <div>Budi told me that he had already attended SD (Primary) school in his world and he was in SD Satu (Primary One) class. He told me that he was the oldest and much bigger in body stature among the rest of the SD Satu class students. Many of the pupils were afraid of him and he was happy to study there. So I told him to study hard. I promised him that if he managed to pass his examinations and attained the first standing position in his class, I would buy for him a bicycle. He was happy to hear that from me and he was also smiling widely. He seemed to listen to me now like I was his uncle. </div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Well, as usual, we went for swimming at Ramayana Hotel in Kuta. So when Heru came to meet me while we were in the pool, I asked him whether the rest were swimming too and he nodded. He pointed with his forefinger that they were at the other side of the pool. Heru swum like a dog, paddling all his four limbs. I think most babies would swim like that.</div>
              <div>Yani was not a good swimmer and I had taught her the breast stroke style while we were in Lombok. Eversince then, she loved swimming. Margarita told me that she was a good swimmer because her house in Jakarta had a swimming pool. I asked her to show me her swimming skill and she swum like a skillful swimmer. </div>
              <div>There was an elderly Caucasian man sitting in the restaurant and I was aware that he was watching Yani while she was swimming. The beautiful thing was that after Margarita had demonstrated to me her swimming skill, he had actually smiled and clapped his hands. Both Margarita and I smiled at him and we were delighted with his participation.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Later I met another entity who called himself as Ricky. He was the cousin of Gordon from Australia. He came to Bali to visit Gordon and also for a holiday. He loved to drink and he always got drunk. Margarita told me that when Ricky got drunk, it was difficult for them to control him because he would be very aggressive and annoying. But when Ricky was not drunk, he was really a very nice man.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>It was in the middle of October 1993, Yani and I decided to open a small food business in Bali. We had decided to go back to Malang, East Java, to fetch her aunty, Lek (Aunty) Mim. We needed her help to cook and run the food business together with us. </div>
              <div>Margarita told me that Natalia, Gordon, Mas Anton, Nonik, Jean, Ricky, Budi, Soni, Heru and herself would join Yani and I for that trip.</div>
              <div>We took a flight to Surabaya and at Surabaya we checked into Natour Hotel. Yani told me that she wished to visit her family at the village from there. She chartered a car from the hotel. The trip would take her about three to four hours. In my mind, I took for granted that all of them would follow Yani to her village.</div>
              <div>Later in the evening, when Yani had returned to the hotel, Soni came to meet me telling me with his child like talked that there was a male spirit wearing black clothing in his world at Yani's village. He had smiled at him and beaconing to him to come near to him. Soni said that he had refused to go near that man because he was afraid of him.</div>
              <div>The next day, Yani and I checked out from the hotel and took a taxi to Malang. There we checked into a good hotel and while having our meal at the hotel restaurant, Soni, Budi and Heru would come to eat together with me. They told me that they loved to spend most of their time swimming at the hotel swimming pool. And while staying there, we went to a discotheque in that hotel every night.</div>
              <div>In Malang, Margarita mentioned to me that Gordon, Jean, Ricky, Budi, Soni and Heru, loved to Trishaw rides and eating the barbeque corns. And in Malang, Margarita informed me that Mas Anton met a spirit that was Black and she was like Mas Anton's companion. They did not tell me about the entity's origin.</div>
              <div>Lek Mim agreed to come and lived with us in Bali. We were in Malang for about a week.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I would like to mention an incidence in this hotel at Malang. One evening, two days before we checked out from the hotel, I noticed about Rp100000 was missing from my wallet. I had always kept track of the amount of money in my wallet. So I asked Yani whether she had taken the money from my wallet. She said "No". I told her about the amount that was missing from my wallet. I was also thinking very hard whether I had used the money but I checked every bills and cash that I had spend. I knew very clearly that I was supposed to have so much cash balance in my wallet after deducting all the expenses. Yani was also puzzled with the missing cash. I told Yani that with this missing amount, we would have shortage of cash for our trip back to Bali. Even with Yani's cash from her wallet, it would not be sufficient for our fares. So we decided to go to the bank tomorrow morning.</div>
              <div>That night Margarita came to meet me. I told her about the missing cash from my wallet and the cash shortage for the fares if I did not withdraw some cash from the bank tomorrow morning. This what she told me, "Mas, I can give you the cash but it's not my cash. It's a loan from someone else and later when you have the cash, you must return it. You can use this cash from our world but when it's midnight, this cash will turn into ashes. It's not good for you to use this cash to pay your bills because the cashier that receives this cash would be blame for the money that is loss." I was thinking about what she had told me then she asked me to take out my bankbook. I was wondering why she had instructed me to do that.</div>
              <div>We were sitting on the bed and my bankbook was inside my bag, which was on the floor about one metre away from the bed. I took my bag to the bed and took out my bankbook to show it to her. She saw it but she did not touch it and she did not even want to see the content of my bankbook. Then she told me to put it back inside my bag. After that I put back the bag to the same original place earlier on, about one metre away from the bed. She was silent for about a few seconds and then she instructed me to look inside my bankbook whether there was anything inside it. I went to the bag again and took out my bankbook again to see whether there was anything inside it. I said there was nothing. She told me to look inside the bankbook carefully again. I followed her instruction and look inside the bankbook very carefully but there was nothing inside it. I told her that there was nothing inside it. She told me to put back the bankbook inside the bag again and I placed the bag on the floor. I sat on the bed facing her. We talked for awhile and then she instructed me again to look inside the bankbook again. I picked up my bag from the floor, took out my bankbook, then when I flipped open my bankbook, I was so surprised to see there was solid hard cash inside my bankbook. The cash was very new and it was in Rp20000 currency notes. There were five pieces of it, the exact amount of Rp100000 that was missing from my wallet earlier on. I was very, very shocked and confused about the materialisation of the Rp100000 hard cash in my bankbook. How she did that? She smiled at me and then left Yani's body but Budi came to meet me crying.</div>
              <div>Budi was crying when he said this to me, "Om, please forgive Budi. I've stolen the money from Om's because I've no money to buy for my own airfare ticket to Bali. I don't want to trouble or burden them with my expenses anymore." I was not angry with Budi because I was still in a state of surprised about the materialisation of the hard cash in my bankbook. I told Budi not to repeat that bad action again and if he needed cash or anything, he should ask me and I would be glad to give him.</div>
              <div>The next day Yani and I went to the bank and withdrew some more cash, just in case we needed it for emergency. The day after we checked out from the hotel, we took a taxi from Malang to the airport in Surabaya and bought airflight tickets to Bali. There were no incident of cash shortages.</div>
              <div>This incidence would be indelible to me for the rest of my life. It was something I saw and experienced without any doubts because I was wide-awake and I was not drunk or hallucinating or possessed by them.        </div>

              <div><span style="font-size: small;">Margarita came to meet me one day and she asked me again to follow her back to her world. She really wanted to take me to her. She said that she would find someone who could take me to her world because she did not possess that knowledge and she had assured me that she would be there to invite me. That was what she had mentioned to me.</span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: small;">I was feeling miserable with my life as a fugitive and I was actually missing my family in Singapore. Earlier that day I had a misunderstanding with Yani and I felt lonely but not her. She had her brother and aunty living together with us. </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: small;">I had agreed to Margarita's suggestion and then I lie down on the bed. Margarita went out of the room and a few seconds later came back into the room again. I was waiting for Margarita to lie next to me and held my hand. It was not Margarita's personality but it was a different entity. </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: small;">This entity had a low hunchback. She walked to my side of the bed and in a low old woman voice she said, "Why must you follow her? Your life now is good here. It's not good for you to follow her." Then she collapsed over me. I tried to wake her up but that entity had already left Yani's body and Yani was unconscious. I carried Yani and put her down to lie next to me. She was breathing normally. Then I took a nap.  </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: small;">I had no idea how long my nap was but I was awakened by Yani who was crying for me not to leave her. I felt very weak and sleepy. I had difficulty waking-up. When I opened up my eyes, I saw that she was crying and apologising to me pertinent to her stubborness and anger towards me that we had earlier on. She really cried and it was not an act. I felt weak and faintly I asked her what was the matter. She thought I had suddenly fell ill and I was dying. Well, I felt warmed and I had a slight headache and maybe a slight temperature too. I told her not to worry about my health and I was alright. She mentioned that if possible she did not want to see me fell ill again because she would be confused and she would not know what to do. She told me that she was trying to wake me up for quite sometimes but I did not open up my eyes. She was really worried for me. While I was napping, I did not recall any dream that I had. Maybe I was really dying huh!</span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: small;">There were no possession for a few days then one day Margarita met me and said this, "Mas Robi, if you follow me to my world, it's as though I've murdered you. Please forgive me." Then she left Yani's body. She never invited me to follow her anymore from that day onward and we never talked about it anymore too. </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: small;">Mas Anton came to meet me one day and informed me that his sister Nonik and Jean were going home to Jogyakarta to get 'married'. Their parents were willing to accept Jean as their 'son-in-law'. Mas Anton said that he would still remain in Bali. That was the last news I heard from him about Nonik and Jean. I never met Nonik anymore after that news.</span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: small;"> </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: small;">I remembered telling Heru that I was angry with Yani. He just listened to me. Then while Yani was asleep, suddenly Yani shouted "Ouch! Ouch!" Two times she shouted but she remained asleep. The first time when she shouted that, her face turned to the left and the second time her face turned to the right. It looked as if she was punched and she seemed to feel the pain too. Heru came on and told me that he had punched Yani for being stubborn and angry. I quickly examined Yani's face but there were no bruises. I felt relieved and softly I scolded Heru never again to do that on Yani. He just smiled at me with the tip of his tongue sticking out and I could sense that he felt guilty for doing that left right combination. In my heart, I was laughing too when I saw his expression. I wondered where Heru had learned that violent action. Maybe too much watching violent movies I guessed.</span>      </div>
