              <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
              <p>Gandhi said, "If we are to have true peace in the world, it must begin with the children."</p>
              <p>The national PTA CEO, Byron Garrett recently quoted as saying in Leadership Spotlight: "It's better to build children than to repair men and women."</p>
              <p>Teacher and leader Mary McLeod Bethune: "We have a powerful potential in our youth, and we must have the courage to change old ideas and practices so that we may direct their power towards good ends!"</p>
              <p>With corporal punishment and verbal abuse still being practiced / allowed in even one of our schools, NOW is the time to be a living example of what humanity can in fact be.</p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Puppies for Sale</span></strong></p>
              <p>A store owner was tacking a sign above his door that read "Puppies For Sale."<br><br>Signs like that have a way of attracting small children, and sure enough, a little boy appeared under the store owner's sign. "How much are you going to sell the puppies for?" he asked.<br><br>The store owner replied, "Anywhere from $30 to $50."<br><br>The little boy reached in his pocket and pulled out some change. "I have $2.37," he said. "Can I please look at them?"<br><br>The store owner smiled and whistled and out of the kennel came Lady, who ran down the aisle of his store followed by five teeny, tiny balls of fur.<br><br>One puppy was lagging considerably behind. Immediately the little boy singled out the lagging, limping puppy and said, "What's wrong with that little dog?"<br><br>The store owner explained that the veterinarian had examined the little puppy and had discovered it didn't have a hip socket. It would always limp. It would always be lame.<br><br>The little boy became excited. "That is the puppy that I want to buy."<br><br>The store owner said, "No, you don't want to buy that little dog. If you really want him, I'll just give him to you."<br><br>The little boy got quite upset. He looked straight into the store owner's eyes, pointing his finger, and said, "I don't want you to give him to me. That little dog is worth every bit as much as all the other dogs and I'll pay full price. In fact, I'll give you $2.37 now, and 50 cents a month until I have him paid for."<br><br>The store owner countered, "You really don't want to buy this little dog. He is never going to be able to run and jump and play with you like the other puppies."<br><br>To his surprise, the little boy reached down and rolled up his pant leg to reveal a badly twisted, crippled left leg supported by a big metal brace. He looked up at the store owner and softly replied, "Well, I don't run so well myself, and the little puppy will need someone who understands!"<br><br>We ALL need someone who Understands!</p>

              <p>A store owner was tacking a sign above his door that read "Puppies For Sale."<br><br>Signs like that have a way of attracting small children, and sure enough, a little boy appeared under the store owner's sign. "How much are you going to sell the puppies for?" he asked.<br><br>The store owner replied, "Anywhere from $30 to $50."<br><br>The little boy reached in his pocket and pulled out some change. "I have $2.37," he said. "Can I please look at them?"<br><br>The store owner smiled and whistled and out of the kennel came Lady, who ran down the aisle of his store followed by five teeny, tiny balls of fur.<br><br>One puppy was lagging considerably behind. Immediately the little boy singled out the lagging, limping puppy and said, "What's wrong with that little dog?"<br><br>The store owner explained that the veterinarian had examined the little puppy and had discovered it didn't have a hip socket. It would always limp. It would always be lame.<br><br>The little boy became excited. "That is the puppy that I want to buy."<br><br>The store owner said, "No, you don't want to buy that little dog. If you really want him, I'll just give him to you."<br><br>The little boy got quite upset. He looked straight into the store owner's eyes, pointing his finger, and said, "I don't want you to give him to me. That little dog is worth every bit as much as all the other dogs and I'll pay full price. In fact, I'll give you $2.37 now, and 50 cents a month until I have him paid for."<br><br>The store owner countered, "You really don't want to buy this little dog. He is never going to be able to run and jump and play with you like the other puppies."<br><br>To his surprise, the little boy reached down and rolled up his pant leg to reveal a badly twisted, crippled left leg supported by a big metal brace. He looked up at the store owner and softly replied, "Well, I don't run so well myself, and the little puppy will need someone who understands!"<br><br>We ALL need someone who Understands!</p>

              <p>Hello Paw_Bell,</p>
              <p>Welcome to the group. Hmm...by looking at your nick name...I guess you are a Dog Lover and maybe you even love other animals too.</p>
              <p>Your story reminded me of a homeless little boy that I met in Bali in 1993. When I met him, his left leg was crippled due to a car accident that had happened, caused by an inresponsible driver who hit him while he was walking at the side of the road. And he was taken care by another homeless little boy of 7 or 8 years old only, until one day he met a couple who brought him in into their family and took care of him. They had his left leg examined by a specialist anthroscopy doctor. The doctor mentioned to the couple that the little boy left leg could be normal again after a surgery. This was possible due to the fact that this 3 year old boy was still young and his left leg bone was still soft. Well, without any delay, the surgery was done and after that the little boy could walk quite normally though there was still a slight limp, but this too disappeared after a regular therapy and of course being a little, he loves to run around and play with other children too. I think by now, he is walking normal again. I hope he is well and happy now.</p>
              <p>Thanks for sharing your article Paw_Bell and be kind to all animals is a noble deed, indeed.</p>
              <p>With Love,</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>I like to share with you a story about a little boy that I love in Bali...he was a homeless little boy of two and half years old or three years old when I met him. While living in Indonesia my name was Mochamad Robi Hussein and Heru called me Om Bi or Uncle Bi for short. Heru taught me many things especially about children and love of a father to a son or daughter. Its true that parents or adults can learn many things from small little children by their questions and also by their behaviours.</p>
              <p>I have appended below the story for your reading....thanks for being here to listen to others and their story everyone.</p>
              <p>With Love,</p>
              <p>Joe</p>
              <p> </p>
              <div>One day Heru asked me, "Om Bi, do you know my Papi and Mami?"</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I did not know how to answer him, so I lied to him and said 'yes' to him.</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>Then he asked, "Are they good or bad?"</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I was not prepared for this kind of question from him, so I lied to him, "They are good."</div>
              <div>He queried further, "If they are good, why they left Heru?"</div>
              <div> </div>
              <div>I told him, "They never left Heru but they went to Australia for work to earn alot of money and after they have alot of money, they will come back to take care of Heru."</div>
              <div>I asked him why he asked all these questions.</div>
              <div>He said, "My friends always call me a 'step' child or a 'bastard' child. What is a step child and what is a bastard child means, Om Bi?"</div>
              <div>I could not answer him and I told him not to listen to his friends' teasing.</div>
              <div>Then he asked again, "Om Bi, will my Mami and Papi come back for Heru again because if they don't, later when Heru has grown bigger, Heru will look for them in 'Australi'.</div>
              <div>I lied to him that his parents would return home one day for him and I remained silent because of his questions.</div>
              <div>Then Heru said, "Om Bi, Heru have no Papi. Can Heru call Om Bi, Papi?"</div>
              <div>I wanted him to be happy so I let him called me 'Papi'.</div>
              <div>Then he asked me, "Papi, Heru never 'nen-nen' (breast feeding) before because Heru's Mami never gives Heru to 'nen-nen'. Can Papi gives Heru to 'nen-nen'?"</div>
              <div>I was so surprised with his requests but I wanted him to be happy and forget about his parents. I agreed to give Heru to 'nen-nen' and he wanted to suckle my nipple but I told him that I felt ticklish, so instead I gave him to suckle one of my ear lobe and he was very pleased with it.</div>
              <div>That day was the day I became like a father to Heru and he called me 'Papi' until the day I was deported to Singapore. I let him to suckle my ear lobe everytime when he wanted to go to sleep and he was always with me from that day onward. I also told him to called Yani (my wife) 'Mami' instead of 'Tante' (Aunty) and he should regard Yani like his own mother too. When Budi and Soni (the other homeless children that we brought into our family) wanted to call me 'Papi' too, he disallowed it but I did not mind if they wanted to call me by that name too. Heru adamantly disallowed it, but told Heru this, "Love All and Heru is number One." He loves that statement and I guess, Heru learned something from that statement too. He is a loving boy and he loves everyone that meet him...</div>
              <div>Thanks Heru...Papi love you too.  </div>

              <p>Hi All,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many times when I listen to Class 95FM late at night and heard this quotation of <strong>"It takes two second to say,'I Love You,' but it takes a lifetime to show it,"</strong> that statement strucks my heartstring because it is true. I'm just wondering, how many of us really know to say that statement and remain faithful to its expression to the one we love.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thought I share my thoughts with you and thanks for listening.</p>

Since people always made fun of me about my appearance, I have always been sensitive about it. <br><br>Due to a severe illness that began about four years ago, I have progressively dropped weight and am now at a dangerously low weight. Despite my extremely thin appearance, one of my friend's wives upon our first meeting had nothing but positive things to say about me and my appearance. I can’t forget when she told me, "You look great just as you are!" <br><br>Those words were such a blessing to hear from someone; they allowed me to more fully heal and to accept myself. Her positive attitude about my appearance and her desire to help by throwing out ideas for treatments were more than I could have wished for. To feel totally human, accepted, and whole, even now, is the greatest gift anyone could have given me! Thank you!<br><br></span></div>

              "Leave People Feeling Better About Themselves"<br></strong></strong><span style="font-size: large; color: #000080;">From Kindness: Making a Difference in People's Lives: Formulas, stories, and insights<br>By Zelig Pliskin <br>Printed with Permission of Shaar Press <br></span><span style="color: #00007f;"><br>A valuable principle to keep in mind is: Leave people feeling better about themselves as a result of having met you.<br><br>Some people take pleasure in putting others down. It makes them feel more powerful to make others feel lower. In reality, the perpetration of such a crime lowers and demeans the perpetrator rather than the victim.<br><br>The person who leaves others feeling better about themselves elevates himself. The question to ask yourself is, "What can I say to this person that will give him a positive feeling?"<br><br>Be sincere in what you say. The goal is not to flatter or to give people a false sense of having a positive quality or attribute that they are missing. Rather the goal is to keep on developing your own "good eye" to see the positive in each person. When you develop positive feelings about other people, not only what you say will make them feel good but also how you say it. And not only your words will accomplish this, also the look on your face and your smile.<br><br>Use enthusiastic expressions. Instead of saying, "Not bad," you can say, "That was really good."<br>Instead of saying, "That was o.k.," you can say, "You’re doing great."<br>Instead of saying, "That seems right," you can say, "That was very insightful."<br><br>Here are some other possibilities:<br><br>* "I admire your kindness."<br>* "I respect the way you handled that."<br>* "You have a lot of courage to do that."<br>* "That was magnificent of you."<br>* "I find you an inspiration."<br>* "There is a lot that I can learn from you."<br>* "You are so kind to have said that to me."<br>* "Your goodness is so much a part of you that you take it for granted."<br>* "Every time I see you I feel happier."<br>* "Whenever I meet you, I remember the kindness you have done for me."<br><br>One of the author's students told him this story:<br><br>"I am now embarrassed to admit that I used to take pleasure in putting people down. I was a low-paid clerk at a non-prestigious job. It gave me a sense of being one-up to always say things that implied that I am superior and this person is inferior. Even when I wasn’t on the job, whenever someone told me about an accomplishment of theirs, I would say something to the effect that this was minor in comparison with what others have done."<br><br>"I changed my pattern after meeting someone who told me that he made a resolution to always leave people feeling better about themselves. I tried to belittle this person in a number of ways. Then the person asked me, "Tell me the truth. How would you like people to feel after an encounter with you?" This wasn’t really a question. We both knew what I was up to. From then on I realized that if I really want to feel good about myself, the way to do it is to make others feel good."<br></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><br></span><p></p>

He never drove past someone waiting for a bus without stopping to ask if he could give them a ride; when they accepted his offer he did not tell the person where he was going, so they would not know if he was going out of his way or by how much. <br><br>When my husband and I were married, he was at the wedding in a wheelchair because he had broken his hip the Friday before the wedding. So instead of going to the hospital he went to our wedding because my mother-in-law had passed away a year and a half before and he didn’t want my husband to be at his wedding without a parent by his side. <br><br>When I got asthma attacks he was beside himself; when I broke my arm and he was in the hospital and couldn’t talk, he tapped my cast and stroked my face to comfort me; when I was upset he always said "don’t take everything to heart." <br><br>At his funeral people who did not know my father-in-law well could not understand why I cried so much over the loss of an in-law. They didn’t realize that I was crying over the loss of one of my dearest friends. <br><br></span><strong><span style="color: #00007f;"><br></span><span style="font-size: large; color: #00007f;">"Positive Role Models"<br></span></strong><span style="font-size: large; color: #000080;">From Kindness: Making a Difference in People's Lives: Formulas,</span><em><span style="color: #00007f;"> </span></em><span style="font-size: large; color: #000080;">stories, and insights<br>By Zelig Pliskin <br>Printed with Permission of Shaar Press <br></span><span style="color: #00007f;"><br>Your role models create you. They are your vision of what you wish to do and to become. They provide a clear picture of the measures to be undertaken to get there. Helping someone find an empowering role model will make a major difference in his life.<br><br>Some questions you can ask are:<br><br>"Who do you admire and respect?" "What specifically do you admire and respect about that person?"<br><br>"If you could be like any specific individual, who would you choose?"<br><br>"If there were a few people who could teach you to be like them, who would you want to teach you?"<br><br>"Who have you met or read about that you would like to emulate?"<br><br>"Do you have a secret wish to be like any great person?" If the response is "no," you might ask, "If you would have a secret wish, what would it be?"<br><br>Read biographies of great people. They expand your mental vision as to what is possible for you. After reading a biography, think about other people you know who would gain from reading it. You can have a powerful influence by telling someone, "I can see you being like this person in the future."<br><br>If someone confides in you and says, "I see myself eventually being like this great person," take heed how you respond. Don’t belittle or ridicule him if you feel that this picture is too unrealistic. It’s almost a certainty that this person’s having a role model will enable him to accomplish much more than he would if he didn’t have this role model.<br><br>A friend made the following observation:<br><br>For a while I would ask each person I met, "Who is your role model?" An interesting pattern developed. Those who were most successful almost all immediately listed their role models. Those who were less successful either didn’t have one or would say, "I would like to be like this person. But it’s definitely out of my reach."<br><br>This showed me the importance of influencing young people to find role models and of getting people to see that even if they won’t exactly reach the level of their role models, following their role models will get them further than if they didn’t have that picture in mind.<br>
