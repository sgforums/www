              <p><span id="app2437228683_tale1949044366"> Touching story of a Mother &amp; Son<br><br>My
              mom only had one eye. I hated her, she was such an embarrassment. My
              mom ran a small shop at a flea market.She collected little weeds and
              such to sell, anything for the money we needed she was such an
              embarrassment.There was this one day during elementary school. I
              remember that it was field day, and my mom came. I was so embarrassed.
              How could she do this to me? I threw her a hateful look and ran out.
              The next day at school..."Your mom only has one eye?!" and they taunted
              me.<br> <br>I wished that my mom would just disappear from this world
              so I said to my mom, "Mom, why don't you have the other eye?! You're
              only going to make me a laughingstock. Why don't you just die?" My mom
              did not respond. I guess I felt a little bad, but at the same time, it
              felt good to think that I had said what I'd wanted to say all this time.<br> <br>Maybe it was because my mom hadn't punished me, but I didn't think that I had hurt her feelings very badly.<br> <br>That
              night...I woke up, and went to the kitchen to get a glass of water. My
              mom was crying there, so quietly, as if she was afraid that she might
              wake me. I took a look at her, and then turned away. Because of the
              thing I had said to her earlier, there was something pinching at me in
              the corner of my heart. Even so, I hated my mother who was crying out
              of her one eye. So I told myself that I would grow up and become
              successful, because I hated my one-eyed mom and our desperate poverty.<br> <br>Then
              I studied really hard. I left my mother and came to Seoul and studied,
              and got accepted in the Seoul University with all the confidence I had.
              Then, I got married. I bought a house of my own. Then I had kids, too.
              Now I'm living happily as a successful man. I like it here because it's
              a place that doesn't remind me of my mom.<br> <br>This happiness was
              getting bigger and bigger, when someone unexpected came to see me
              "What?! Who's this?!"... It was my mother...Still with her one eye. It
              felt as if the whole sky was falling apart on me. My little girl ran
              away, scared of my mom's eye.<br> <br>And I asked her, "Who are you? I
              don't know you!!!" as if I tried to make that real. I screamed at her
              "How dare you come to my house and scare my daughter! Get out here
              now!" And to this, my mother quietly answered, "oh, I'm so sorry. I may
              have gotten the wrong address," and she disappeared. Thank good ness...
              she doesn't recognize me. I was quite relieved. I told myself that I
              wasn't going to care, or think about this for the rest of my life.<br> <br>Then
              a wave of relief came upon me... one day, a letter regarding a school
              reunion came to my house. I lied to my wife saying that I was going on
              a business trip. After the reunion, I went down to the old shack, that
              I used to call a house...just out of curiosity there, I found my mother
              fallen on the cold ground. But I did not shed a single tear. She had a
              piece of paper in her hand.... it was a letter to me.<br> <br>She wrote...<br> <br>My Son,<br>I
              think my life has been long enough now. And... I won't visit Seoul
              anymore... but would it be too much to ask if I wanted you to come
              visit me once in a while? I miss you so much. And I was so glad when I
              heard you were coming for the reunion. But I decided not to go to the
              school.... For you... I'm sorry that I only have one eye, and I was an
              embarrassment for you.<br> <br>You see, when you were very little, you
              got into an accident, and lost your eye. As a mother, I couldn't stand
              watching you having to grow up with only one eye... so I gave you
              mine... I was so proud of my son that was seeing a whole new world for
              me, in my place, with that eye. I was never upset at you for anything
              you did. The couple times that you were angry with me. I thought to
              myself, 'it's because he loves me.' I miss the times when you were
              still young around me.<br> <br>I miss you so much. I love you. You mean
              the world to me. My world shattered! Then I cried for the person who
              lived for me. My Mother.</span></p>

              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sharing The Full Story - Calling On Friends</span> </strong> <br><br><br>When we are going through a difficult time, we may hesitate to call <br>even our best friends because we don't want to burden them with our <br>troubles. This can be especially true if we've been going through a <br>series of challenges, and we're starting to feel as if we sound like <br>a broken record. It is important to remember that at times like <br>these our friends sincerely want to be there for us whenever they <br>can. We can always check with them to make sure it's a good time for <br>them before we start talking, and if it's not a good time, we can <br>call back at another time, or call another friend. <br><br>We know for ourselves that when we have a good friend, we don't want <br>them to suffer alone when we are just a phone call away. We want <br>them to call us and share their sorrows with us, as well as their <br>joys, because this is what sharing a life through friendship is <br>about. It is at our lowest points that we really need to rely on our <br>friends without worrying that we are a burden. If you are feeling <br>self-conscious about having a tough time, you can bring this fact <br>into the conversation by acknowledging it. Chances are your friend <br>will reassure you that she is happy to be there for you. In fact, <br>rather than feeling taxed, most of us feel better when we have <br>helped a friend simply by listening empathically while they share <br>their feelings. <br><br>Without our friends, we would be hard pressed to get through the <br>tough times and celebrate the good ones. If we leave our friends out <br>of our process when the going gets tough, our friendships can begin <br>to feel shallow. On the other hand, when we include our friends in <br>the full story of our life—the good, the bad, and the ugly—we build <br>authentic relationships in which we can be who we truly are. When we <br>do this, we invite our friends to bring their whole selves to the <br>relationship as well.<br><br><br><br><a href="http://www.dailyom.com/"><span style="color: #003399;">http://www.dailyom.com/</span></a></p>

              <p>"As we grow up, we learn that even the one person that wasn't supposed<br>to ever let you down probably will. You will have your heart broken<br>probably more than once and it's harder every time. You'll break<br>hearts too, so remember how it felt when yours was broken. You'll<br>fight with your best friend. You'll blame a new love for things an old<br>one did. You'll cry because time is passing too fast, and you'll<br>eventually lose someone you love. So take too many pictures, laugh too<br>much, and love like you've never been hurt because every sixty seconds<br>you spend upset is a minute of happiness you'll never get back. Don't<br>be afraid that your life will end, be afraid that it will never begin."<br><br>~anonymous~</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Subject:  Interesting aspects of life - Warren Buffet<br><br><br></span></strong>There was a one hour interview on CNBC with Warren Buffet, the second richest man who has donated $31 billion to charity. Here are some very interesting aspects of his life:<br><br>1. He bought his first share at age 11 and he now regrets that he started too late!<br><br>2. He bought a small farm at age 14 with savings from delivering newspapers.<br><br>3. He still lives in the same small 3-bedroom house in mid-town<br>Omaha ,that he bought after he got married 50 years ago. He says that he has everything he needs in that house. His house does not have a wall or a fence.<br><br>4. He drives his own car everywhere and does not have a driver or security people around him.<br><br>5. He never travels by private jet, although he owns the world's largest private jet company.<br><br>6. His company, Berkshire Hathaway, owns 63 companies.He writes only one letter each year to the CEOs of these companies,<br>giving them goals for the year. He never holds meetings or calls them on a regular basis. <br><br>He has given his CEO's only two rules. Rule number 1: do not lose any of your share holder's money. Rule number 2: Do not forget rule number 1.<br><br>7. He does not socialize with the high society crowd. His past time <br>after he gets home is to make himself some pop corn and watch Television.<br><br>8. Bill Gates, the world's richest man met him for the first time only<br>5 years ago. Bill Gates did not think he had anything in common with Warren Buffet. So he had scheduled his meeting only for half hour. But when Gates met him, the meeting lasted for ten hours and Bill Gates became a devotee of Warren Buffet.<br><br>9. Warren Buffet does not carry a cell phone, nor has a computer on his desk.<br><br>His advice to young people: "Stay away from credit cards and invest in yourself and<br><br>Remember: <br><br>A. Money doesn't create man but it is the man who created money.<br><br>B. Live your life as simple as you are.<br><br>C. Don't do what others say, just listen  to  them, but do what you feel good.<br><br>D. Don't go on brand name; just wear those things in which   you feel comfortable.<br><br>E. Don't waste your money on unnecessary things; just spend on them who really in need rather. <br><br>F. After all it's your life then why give chance to others to rule our life."</p></div>

              <div>A SUPER GOOD ONE!!!!!!<br><br>The Good Husband...<br><br>Jack wakes up with a huge hangover after attending his company's Christmas Party. Jack is not normally a drinker, but the drinks didn't taste like alcohol at all.<br><br>He didn't even remember how he got home from the party. As bad as he was feeling, he wondered if he did something wrong.</div>
              <div><br>Jack had to force himself to open his eyes, and the first thing he sees is a couple of aspirins next to a glass of water on the side table.<br></div>
              <div>And, next to them, a single red rose! Jack sits up and sees his clothing<br>in front of him, all clean and pressed.</div>
              <div><br>He looks around the room and sees that it is in perfect order, spotlessly clean. So is the rest of the house. He takes the aspirins, cringes when he sees a huge black eye staring back at him in the bathroom mirror.<br><br>Then he notices a note hanging on the corner of the mirror written in red<br>with little hearts on it and a kiss mark from his wife in lipstick:<br><br>"Honey, breakfast is on the stove, I left early to get groceries to make you your favorite dinner tonight. I love you,darling! Love,Jillian"<br><br>He stumbles to the kitchen and sure enough, there is hot breakfast, steaming hot coffee and the morning newspaper. His son is also at the table, eating.<br></div>
              <div>Jack asks, "Son...what happened last night?"<br><br>"Well, you came home after 3 A.M., drunk and out of your mind. You fell<br>over the coffee table and broke it, and then you puked in the hallway, and got that black eye when you ran into the door.<br><br>Confused, he asked his son, "So, why is everything in such perfect order and so clean? I have a rose, and breakfast is on the table waiting for me??"<br><br>His son replies, "Oh THAT!... Mom dragged you to the bedroom, and when<br>she tried to take your pants off, you screamed, "Leave me alone, I'm married!!"<br><br>Broken Coffee Table $239.99<br>Hot Breakfast $4.20<br>Two Aspirins $1.38<br>Saying the right thing, at the right time . .<br>PRICELESS!!!<br></div>

              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: navy; font-family: 'Arial', 'sans-serif';">  </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'Tahoma', 'sans-serif';"><strong>WHY WE SHOULD GO HOME ON TIME...</strong> <br>  <br>  Mr. Narayana Murthy is undoubtedly one of the most famous persons from <br>  Karnataka. He is known not just for building the biggest IT Empire in India but <br>  also for his simplicity. Almost every important dignitary visits InfoSys <br>  campus. He delivered an interesting speech during an employee session with <br>  another IT company in India. He is incidentally, one of the top 50 influential <br>  people of Asia according to an Asiaweek publication and also the new IT Advisor <br>  to the Thailand Prime Minister. <br>  <br>  Extract of Mr. Narayana Murthy's Speech during Mentor Session: <br>  <br>  I know people who work 12 hours a day, six days a week, or more. Some people do <br>  so because of a work emergency where the long hours are only temporary. Other <br>  people I know have put in these hours for years. I do not know if they are <br>  working all these hours, but I do know they are in the office this long. Others <br>  put in long office hours because they are addicted to the workplace. <br>  <br>  Whatever the reason for putting in overtime, working long hours over the long <br>  term is harmful to the person and to the organization. There are things <br>  managers can do to change this for everyone's benefit. Being in the office long <br>  hours, over long periods of time, makes way for potential errors. <br>  <br>  My colleagues who are in the office long hours frequently make mistakes caused <br>  by fatigue. Correcting these mistakes requires their time as well as the time <br>  and energy of others. I have seen people work Tuesday through Friday to correct <br>  mistakes made after 5 PM on Monday. <br>  <br>  Another problem is that people wh o are in the office long hours are not <br>  pleasant company. They often complain about other people (who are not working <br>  as hard); they are irritable, or cranky, or even angry. Other people avoid <br>  them. Such behaviour poses problems, where work goes much better when people <br>  work together instead of avoiding one another. <br>  <br>  As Managers, there are things we can do to help people leave the office. First <br>  and foremost is to set the example and go home ourselves. I work with a manager <br>  who chides people for working long hours. His words quickly lose their meaning <br>  when he sends these chiding group e-mails with a time-stamp of 2 AM, Sunday. <br>  <br>  Second is to encourage people to put some balance in their lives. For instance, <br>  here is a guideline I find helpful: <br>  1) Wake up, eat a good breakfast, and go to work. <br>  2) Work hard and smart for eight or nine hours. <br>  3) Go home. <br>  4) Read the books/comics, watch a funny movie, dig in the dirt, play with your <br>  kids, etc. <br>  5) Eat well and sleep well. <br>  <br>  This is called recreating. Doing steps 1, 3, 4, and 5 enable step 2. Working <br>  regular hours and recreating daily are simple concepts. They are hard for some <br>  of us because that requires 'personal change'. They are possible since we all <br>  have the power to choose to do them. <br>  <br>  In considering the issue of overtime, I am reminded of my oldest son. When he <br>  was a toddler, if people were visiting the apartment, he would not fall asleep <br>  no matter how long the visit was, and no matter what time of day it was. He <br>  would fight off sleep until the visitors left. It was as if he was afraid that <br>  he would miss some thing. Once our visitors' left, he would go to sleep. By <br>  this time, however, he was over tired and would scream through half the night <br>&amp; ; with nightmares. He, my wife, and I, all paid the price for his fear of missing <br>  out. <br>  <br>  Perhaps some people put in such long hours because they do not want to miss <br>  anything when they leave the office. The trouble with this is that events will <br>  never stop happening. That is life! Things happen 24 hours a day. Allowing for <br>  little rest is not ultimately practical. So, take a nap. Things will happen <br>  while you are asleep, but you will have the energy to catch up when you wake. <br>  Hence, <br>  <br>  <br>  "LOVE YOUR JOB, BUT NEVER FALL IN LOVE WITH YOUR COMPANY BECAUSE YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN THE COMPANY STOPS LOVING YOU" </span></p>

              <div><span style="font-size: small; color: #0000ff; font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>The moral of the story is</strong> .... </span><br><span style="font-size: small; font-family: sans-serif;"> </span> <br><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #3366ff; font-family: Arial;">A jobless man applied for the position of "office boy" at Microsoft. The HR manager interviewed him then watched him cleaning the floor as a test. </span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #3366ff; font-family: Arial;">"You are employed" he said. "Give me your e-mail address and I'll send you the application to fill in, as well as date when you may start. </span></div>
              <div> </div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #3366ff; font-family: Arial;">The man replied "But I don't have a computer, neither an email". <br>"I'm sorry", said the HR manager. If you don't have an email, that means you do not exist. And who doesn't exist, cannot have the job." <br><br>The man left with no hope at all. He didn't know what to do, with only $10 in his pocket. He then decided to go to the supermarket and buy a 10kg tomato crate. He then sold the tomatoes in a door to door round. In less than two hours, he succeeded to double his capital. He repeated the operation three times, and returned home with $60. The man realized that he can survive by this way, and started to go everyday earlier, and return late. Thus, his money doubled or tripled every day. <br>Shortly, he bought a cart, then a truck, and then he had his own fleet of delivery vehicles. <br><br>5 years later, the man is one of the biggest food retailers in the US . He started to plan his family's future, and decided to have a life insurance. He called an insurance broker, and chose a protection plan. When the conversation was concluded the broker asked him his email. </span></div>

              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #3366ff; font-family: Arial;">The man replied, "I don't have an email."<br></span><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #3366ff; font-family: Arial;"> </span></div>
              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #3366ff; font-family: Arial;">The broker answered curiously, "You don't have an email, and yet have succeeded to build an empire. Can you imagine what you could have been if you had an e mail?!!" </span></div>

              <div><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #3366ff; font-family: Arial;">The man thought for a while and replied, "Yes, I'd be an office boy at Microsoft!" <br></span><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #ff0066; font-family: Arial;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>Moral of the story </span></strong></span></div>

              <div><strong><strong><span style="font-size: small; font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Insighting Advice For Couples </span></span></strong></strong><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;"><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><span class="style11">By Richard &amp; Lorraine Platt, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists</span><br><br><span class="style11"><strong><span style="font-weight: bold;">7 Steps to Maintaining an Inspiring Relationship</span></strong></span><br><br><span class="style11"><strong>1. </strong></span></span></span><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Put Love First.</strong></span><span class="style11"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">   Amidst our daily life, we often lose sight of what is most important. We get caught up in feelings, thoughts and activities that distract us from what is deeper. When you’re confused and upset, you can find your way back to center by looking towards love. Love is the lighthouse that guides you safely home. Love goes beyond words and feelings to include compassionate action. So, imagine what you would think, feel or say if you were loving your partner in the moment and let this guide your actions. For example, instead of defending yourself when your partner is upset, try to understand and imagine where they are coming from.  This prevents power struggles and provides the space for true connection.</span></span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;"><br><br><span class="style11"><strong>2. </strong></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Be More of Who You Really Are. </strong></span><span class="style11"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">  If you have created a healthy relationship then you are with someone who encourages your self-expression. There is only one thing you have to share with your partner that they cannot experience with someone else…complete intimacy . In order to have intimacy on all levels (sexual, spiritual, emotional, and intellectual) you must honestly show yourself, including your soft underbelly. Seeing and loving each other into fuller expression is the key to a profoundly passionate relationship.  Be vulnerable enough to let your partner see who you really are and be ready to receive love and acceptance. </span></span></span></div>
              <div><span class="style11"><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></span> </div>
              <div><span class="style11"></span><strong><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;"><span class="style11">3. </span></span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Give It Away.  </span></strong><span class="style11"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">We have all been bruised by life and are fearful of being wounded again. Our first instinct when we are scared is to close off and minimize perceived threats. Unfortunately this makes life predictable, unfulfilling and limited. You will feel even more distant from your partner if you let the fear dictate your interactions. The best way to move beyond fear is to do the very thing you resist.  If you want love…give your partner love, if you want attention or appreciation, give your partner these things. You are acting as if you love and trust your partner and you are bigger than your fears and wounds. Opening yourself and taking this risk with a trustworthy person brings in even more love and will heal the past for both of you. </span></span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;"><br><br><span class="style11"><strong>4. </strong></span></span></span><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Give up Being Right.</strong></span><span class="style11"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">   Relationships flourish when you keep your eye on the highest good. When you’re focused on winning, often you’re trying to make the other lose. A successful relationship is about being teammates with a common goal. Your chosen partner is here to heal you and is bringing to light aspects of yourself that you cannot see. Therefore, always assume 100% responsibility for your experience, especially in a disagreement. Often there is something in what your partner is saying that is true. When you respond to your partner’s deeper message instead of reacting, you create a powerful experience of healing negative conditioning and initiate a deeper connection between you. </span></span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;"><br><br><span class="style11"><strong>5. </strong></span></span></span><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Open Your Partner.  </strong></span><span class="style11"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Intimacy requires taking risks and moving beyond what is comfortable. If you and your partner are distant from each other, be willing to reconnect. Set aside some quiet time to look into each other's eyes and breathe together.  Hold hands and feel the precious presence of your partner.  Stop everything else and be together.  Making space to open yourself and your partner in this way will nurture your love and bring endless rewards for years to come. </span></span></span></div>
              <div><span class="style11"><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></span> </div>
              <div><span class="style11"></span><span style="font-size: medium; font-family: Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;"><strong>6. Make Passion Your Purpose.</strong> Passion is the lifeblood of a juicy relationship. It is vital that you discover what brings you to life and do whatever it takes to keep the juices flowing. This includes every area, from food to sex to spiritual pursuits to your mission in the world. It is a powerful and hot relationship wherein the partners support and enhance each other’s passions. Evolving individually and becoming more of who you really are adds juice to your own life and to your relationship.<br><br><strong>7. Get An Attitude of Gratitude.</strong> You get more bees with honey. What you focus on expands. So stay focused on what you want to grow. i.e. what is great about your partner and your life together, what your dreams are, what you want to manifest together etc. It has been clinically proven that relationships that have a high appreciation to criticism ratio stay passionately together for the long haul.<br><br>We wish you success and happiness in creating an inspiring relationship. We know that simply reading these steps can be like reading an article on how to play tennis. It is good information, but you only improve your skill through practice.</span></span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>BE PATIENT</strong> <br><br>This is a true story which happened in the States. A man came out of his home to admire his new truck. To his puzzlement, his three-year-old son was happily hammering dents into the shiny paint of the truck. The man ran to his son, knocked him away, hammered the little boy's hands into pulp as punishment. When the father calmed down, he rushed his son to the hospital. <br><br>Although the doctor tried desperately to save the crushed bones, he finally had to amputate the fingers from both the boy's hands. When the boy woke up from the surgery and saw his bandaged stubs, he innocently said, "Daddy, I'm sorry about your truck." Then he asked, "but when are my fingers going to grow back?" The father went home and committed suicide. <br><br>Think about this story the next time someone steps on your feet or you wish to take revenge. Think first before you lose your patience with someone you love. Trucks can be repaired.. Broken bones and hurt feelings often can't. Too often we fail to recognize the difference between the person and the performance. We forget that forgiveness is greater than revenge. <strong><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br><br>People make mistakes. We are allowed to make mistakes. But the actions we take while in a rage will haunt us forever. </span></strong><br></p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>PERSONAL PERCEPTION</strong> <br><br>Different people have different perception. One man's meat could be another man's poison. A couple bought a donkey from the market. On the way home, a boy commented, "Very stupid. Why neither of them ride on the donkey? "Upon hearing that, the husband let the wife ride on the donkey. He walked besides them. Later, an old man saw it and commented, "The husband is the head of family. How can the wife ride on the donkey while the husband is on foot?" Hearing this, the wife quickly got down and let the husband ride on the donkey. <br><br>Further on the way home, they met an old Lady. She commented, "How can the man ride on the donkey but let the wife walk. He is no gentleman."  The husband thus quickly asked the wife to join him on the donkey. Then, they met a young man. He commented, "Poor donkey, how can you hold up the weight of two persons. They are cruel to you." Hearing that, the husband and wife immediately climbed down from the donkey and carried it on their shoulders. <br><br>It seems to be the only choice left. Later, on a narrow bridge, the donkey was frightened and struggled. They lost their balance and fell into the river. <strong><span style="font-weight: bold;">You can never have everyone praise you, nor will everyone condemn you. Never in the past, not at present, and never will be in the future. </span></strong><br><br>Thus, do not be too bothered by others words if our conscience is clear..</p></div>
