            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>RIGHT SPEECH</strong> <br><br>There is a Chinese saying which carries the meaning that <strong><span style="font-weight: bold;">"A speech will either prosper or ruin a nation." </span></strong>Many relationships break off because of wrong speech. When a couple is too close with each other, we always forget mutual respect and courtesy. We may say anything without considering if it would hurt the other party. <br><br>A friend and her millionaire husband visited their construction site. A worker who wore a helmet saw her and shouted, "Hi, Emily! Remember me? We used to date in the secondary school." On the way home, her millionaire husband teased her, "Luckily you married me. Otherwise you will be the wife of a construction worker." She answered,"You should appreciate that you married me. Otherwise, he will be the millionaire and not you." <br><br>Frequently exchanging these remarks plants the seed for a bad relationship. It's like a broken egg - cannot be reversed.</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>NO OVERPOWERING <br><br></strong>Many relationships fail because one party tries to overpower another, or demands too much. People in love tend to think that love will conquer all and their spouses will change the bad habits after marriage. Actually, this is not the case. There is a Chinese saying which carries the meaning that <strong><span style="font-weight: bold;">"It is easier to reshape a mountain or a river than a person's character."</span></strong> <br><br>It is not easy to change. Thus, having high expectation on changing the spouse character will cause disappointment and unpleasantness. <br><br>It would be less painful to change ourselves and lower our expectations..</p></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><p><strong>CREATING PERFECT RELATIONSHIPS?</strong> <br><br>A person visited the government matchmaker for marriage, SDU, and requested "I am looking for a spouse. Please help me to find a suitable one." The SDU officer said, "Your requirements, please." "Oh, good looking, polite, humorous, sporty, knowledgeable, good in singing and dancing. Willing to accompany me the whole day at home during my leisure hour, if I don't go out. Telling me interesting stories when I need companion for conversation and be silent when I want to rest." The officer listened carefully and replied, "I understand you need television." <br><br>There is a saying that a perfect match can only be found between a blind wife and a deaf husband,<span style="color: #000080;"><span style="color: navy;"> </span></span>because the blind wife cannot see the faults of the husband and the deaf husband cannot hear the nagging of the wife. Many couples are blind and deaf at the courting stage and dream of perpetual perfect relationship. Unfortunately, when the excitement of love wears off, they wake up and discover that marriage is not a bed of roses. The nightmare begins.</p></div>

Always bear in mind that because of her shortcomings and weaknesses, she could not find a better husband than you." <br><br>We all look forward to being loved and respected. Many people are afraid of losing face. Generally, when a person makes a mistake, he would look around to find a scapegoat to point the finger at. This is the start of a war. We should always remember that when we point one finger at a person, the other four fingers are pointing at ourselves. <strong><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br><br>If we forgive the others, others will ignore our mistake too.</span></strong> <br><br></span></span></div>

              <p><strong>TRUST</strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">TRUST is a very important factor for all relationships. When trust is broken, it is the end of the relationship. Lack of trust leads to suspicion, suspicion generates anger, anger causes enmity and enmity may result in separation.<br><br>A telephone operator told me that one day she received a phone call.   She answered, "Public Utilities Board." There was silence. She repeated, "PUB." There was still no answer. When she was going to cut off the line, she heard a lady's voice, "Oh, so this is PUB. Sorry, I got the number from my Husband's pocket but I do not know whose number it is." <br><br>Without mutual trust, just imagine what will happen to the couple if the telephone operator answered with just "hello" instead of "PUB". </span></p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>WIFE VS. HUSBAND</strong></span></em></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">A couple drove down a country road for several miles, </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">not saying a word. An earlier discussion had led to an </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">argument and neither of them wanted to concede their </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">position. As they passed a barnyard of mules, goats, </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">and pigs, the husband asked sarcastically, </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">"Relatives of yours?" "Yep," the wife replied, "In-laws." </span></span><br><br><em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">WORDS</span></span></span></strong></em></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">A husband read an article to his wife about how many </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">words women use a day... 30,000 to a man's 15,000.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The wife replied, "The reason has to be because we </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">have to repeat everything to men...</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The husband then turned to his wife and asked, "What?" </span></span><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><em>CREATION</em></span></span></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">A man said to his wife one day, "I don't know how you </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">can be so stupid and so beautiful all at the same time.</span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">" </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The wife responded, "Allow me to explain. God made </span></span><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">me beautiful so you would be attracted to me; </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">God made me stupid so I would be attracted to you!" </span></span><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><em>WHO DOES WHAT</em></span></span></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">A man and his wife were having an argument about who </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">should brew the coffee each morning.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The wife said, "You should do it, because you get up </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">first, and then we don't have to wait as long to get our coffee." </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The husband said, " You are in charge of cooking </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">around here and you should do it, because that is your </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">job, and I can just wait for my coffee." </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Wife replies, "No, you should do it, and besides, it </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">is in the Bible that the man should do the coffee."</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Husband replies, "I can't believe that, show me."</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">So she fetched the Bible, and opened the New </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Testament and showed him at the top of several pages, </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">that it indeed says.......... "HEBREWS" </span></span><br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><em>The Silent Treatment</em></span></span></span></strong></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">A man and his wife were having some problems at home and were giving </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">each other the silent treatment. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Suddenly, the man realized that the </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">next day, he would need his wife to wake him at </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">5:00 AM</span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> for an early </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">morning business flight.</span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Not wanting to be the first to break the </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">silence (and LOSE), he wrote on a piece of paper, </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">"Please wake me at </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">5:00 AM</span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">." He left it where he knew she would find </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">it. The next morning, the man woke up, only to discover it was </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">9:00 AM</span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> and </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">he had missed his flight. </span></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Furious, he was about to go and see why his </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">wife hadn't wakened him, when he noticed a piece of paper by the bed. </span></span><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The paper said, "It is </span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">5:00 AM</span></span><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">. Wake up." </span></span><br><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Men are not equipped for these kinds of contests. </span></span><br><br><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">God may have created man before woman, but there is always a rough draft before the masterpiece. </span></span><br><br><strong><span style="font-size: medium;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">SEND THIS TO SMART WOMEN WHO NEED A LAUGH AND TO MEN YOU THINK CAN HANDLE IT </span></span></strong></p>

He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.<br><br>After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on.<br><br>The Policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is.</div>
              <div><br>So, as the couple passes, he says to them," Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together.</div>

The wife quickly wraps herself in a<br>towel and runs downstairs. When she opens the door, there stands Bob,<br>the next-door neighbour. Before she says a word, Bob says, "I'll give<br>you £800 to drop that towel." After thinking for a moment, the woman<br>drops her towel and stands naked in front of Bob. After a few seconds,<br>Bob hands her £800 and leaves.<br><br>The woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs. When she<br>gets to the bathroom, her husband asks, "Who was that?"<br><br>"It was Bob the next door neighbour," she replies.<br><br>"Great!" the husband says, "did he say anything about the £800 he owes me?"<br><br>Moral of the story: If you share critical information pertaining to<br>credit and risk with your shareholders in time, you may be in a<br>position to prevent avoidable exposure.<br><br><br><br>Lesson 2:<br><br>A priest offered a nun a lift. She got in and crossed her legs,<br>forcing her gown to reveal a leg. The priest nearly had an accident.<br>After controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg. The<br>nun said, "Father, remember Psalm 29?" The priest removed his hand.<br>But, changing gears, he let his hand slide up her leg again. The nun<br>once again said, "Father, remember Psalm 129?"<br><br>The priest apologized, "Sorry Sister but the flesh is weak."<br><br>Arriving at the convent, the nun went on her way. On his arrival at<br>the church, the priest rushed to look up Psalm 129. It said, "Go forth<br>and seek, further up, you will find glory."<br><br>Moral of the story: If you are not well informed in your job, you<br>might miss a great opportunity<br><br><br><br>Lesson 3:<br><br>A sales rep, an administration clerk, and the manager are walking to<br>lunch when they find an antique oil lamp. They rub it and a Genie<br>comes out. The Genie says, "I'll give each of you just one wish."<br><br>"Me first, me first!" Says the admin clerk. "I want to be in the<br>Bahamas , driving a speedboat, without a care in the world." Puff!<br>She's gone.<br><br>"Me next, me next!" says the sales rep. "I want to be in Hawaii ,<br>relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse, an endless supply of<br>Pina Coladas and the love of my life." Puff!<br><br>He's gone.<br><br>"OK, you're up," the Genie says to the manager.<br><br>The manager says, "I want those two back in the office after lunch."<br><br>Moral of the story: Always let your boss have the first say.<br><br><br><br>Lesson 4:<br><br>An eagle was sitting on a tree resting, doing nothing. A small rabbit<br>saw the eagle and asked him, "Can I also sit like you and do nothing?"<br><br>The eagle answered: "Sure, why not." So, the rabbit sat on the ground<br>below the Eagle and rested. All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on<br>the rabbit and ate it.<br><br>Moral of the story: To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be<br>sitting very, very high up.<br><br><br><br>Lesson 5:<br><br>A turkey was chatting with a bull. "I would love to be able to get to<br>the top of that tree," sighed the turkey, "but I haven't got the<br>energy."<br><br>"Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?" replied the<br>bull. "They're packed with nutrients."<br><br>The turkey pecked at a lump of dung, and found it actually gave him<br>enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree. The next day,<br>after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch.<br><br>Finally, after a fourth night, the turkey was proudly perched at the<br>top of the tree. He was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot him out<br>of the tree.<br><br>Moral of the story: Bull Shit might get you to the top, but it won't<br>keep you up there for long.<br><br><br><br>Lesson 6:<br><br>A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold that the<br>bird froze and fell to the ground into a large field. While he was<br>lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him.<br><br>As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to<br>realize how warm he was. The dung was actually thawing him out! He lay<br>there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy.<br><br>A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate.<br>Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow<br>dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him.<br><br>Moral of the story:<br><br>(1) Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy<br><br>(2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend<br><br>(3) And when you're in deep shit, it's best to keep your mouth shut!</span><span style="font-size: x-small; color: #000000; font-family: Arial;"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;"> </span></span></p></div>

              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>Why Modern, Western Marriage Has Become A Bad Business Decision For Men</strong></div>
              <div>This writing seeks to educate <strong>men </strong>about the realities of what they may be getting into when they marry a Western Woman. An informed decision is less likely to be one that may be regretted later in the marriage.  The intent is not to dissuade men from marrying, but to encourage them to communicate frankly their concerns and expectations regarding marriage with their potential spouses. The secondary aim of this essay is to enlighten <strong>women </strong>to a few of the reasons why increasingly larger numbers of successful, eligible, unmarried men, who would otherwise prefer monogamous long-term relationships, are turning their backs on marriage.</div>
              <div>Society typically paints a negative stereotype of men who hesitate, delay, or elect not to marry.</div>
              <div>They are labeled as either:</div>
              <div>    A) Womanisers who are unable to participate in a long term relationship, or <br>    B) Selfish, childish or irresponsible men who can not take care of themselves or another person.</div>
              <div>No other explanation is ever explored.</div>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>The cost of proclaiming your undying love </strong><strong><br><br></strong></div>
              <div>In University, in professional sports, in politics, in the workplace; women have the same educational and professional career opportunities as men.<span>  </span><a rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #003399;">Contrary to commonly believed feminist propaganda</span></a>, women do indeed get paid the same salary as men,<strong> </strong><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"><a rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #003399;">given that they are willing to work the same types of jobs as men, and work as many hours as the men do</span></a>.<span>  </span></span><span> </span></strong>Despite this reality, many women come into marriage with very few assets, and often are <a rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #003399;">saddled with substantial quantities of debt</span></a>.  In general, men are the ones who save and invest.<span>  </span>Don't believe me? <span> </span>Count the number of women of marrying age that you know who subscribe to<span> </span>financial services magazines or newspapers.<span>  </span>A significant number of 20-something and 30-something women spend all of their disposable income on luxury rental apartments, upscale restaurants, frequent exotic vacations, leased cars, spa treatments, and excessive amounts of clothing, purses, shoes and accessories.<span>  </span><a rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #003399;">Yet ironically, in the media, men are the ones who are portrayed as reckless, irresponsible spendthrifts.</span></a><em> </em></div>
              <div>When marriage enters the picture, double standards and financial imbalances leave responsible men to pick up the slack and fix the mess she may have made of her finances.<span>  </span>Men are forced to spend their hard-earned savings, or take out an usurious loan, on a diamond ring.<span>  </span>Women justify this relatively recent, mid-20<sup>th</sup> Century ritual, which was <a rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #003399;">spawned by a brilliant 1940's mass-brainwashing campaign launched by DeBeers</span></a>, by insisting that a man <em>wants</em> to buy her a diamond and that it makes him proud to be able to proclaim his love and affection towards her in this fashion. <span> </span>Granted there are some men who may be inclined to declare their commitment to a life-long partner in this way, but there are plenty of men whom seek a lifelong partnership and commitment who have no interest in buying diamonds. <span> </span>What choice do these men have? <span> </span>None! <span> </span>To many young men, the ring, catered wedding, and honeymoon in an exotic locale at a five-star hotel is an unwelcome land mine on their journey towards adult financial stability and independence. <span> </span>To add insult to injury, he is now locked into a lifetime of insurance payments for this grossly overpriced jewelry. <span> </span><a rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #003399;">Contrary to popularly held belief diamonds are not rare at all, but instead are common and inexpensive.<span>  </span>Their high price is due to their supply having been artificially manipulated</span></a>.<span>  </span>Some men are more concerned with realising their dream of owning a home and becoming financially stable enough to begin a family and responsibly provide for their welfare.<span>  </span>Men worry about these matters, because, ultimately, it becomes their sole responsibility.</div>
              <div>The purchase of the diamond ring is a predictor of things to come. <span> </span>Immediately after buying it, the man may be rewarded with bridal demands to finance all or part of a lavish wedding, depending upon the size of his bank account and the ambitions of his fiancée.<span>  </span>The average costs of today's Western Weddings frequently exceed that of a house down payment or, in certain parts of the world, the entire cost of the house itself.<span>  </span>If a man enters a marriage having saved up a down payment for his dream home, it can suddenly be snatched right out from underneath him. <span> </span>Many men may object to spending such a large sum of money on what is basically a very expensive one-day, four-hour party. <span> He</span> also will be spending a year of his life planning it, when he could use the same time to further his career or education.<span>  </span>However, what a man wants is really not of any concern anymore at this point in the proceedings. <span> </span>His wants, desires, hopes and dreams are ignored almost in their entirety.<span>  </span>Her opinions regarding the wedding are frequently non-negotiable. A wedding is no longer an event that is equally for the bride and groom. <span> </span>As many of today's Bridezilla’s will gleefully remind you, "Today is MY day!".<span>  T</span>his gives her licence to become selfish, irresponsible, demanding and childlike.<span>  </span>A man who balks at spending his entire life savings, or shouldering a five-figure debt load, for the ring, catered wedding and honeymoon in an exotic locale at a five-star hotel, can and will be labeled as a selfish cheapskate or not a "Real Man".<span>  </span>If a woman leaves such a man for him suggesting that they try to keep their costs under control, she would have the full support of everyone around her as she dumped him.</div>
              <div>"She can do better", "Clearly, he doesn't love her", “He doesn’t deserve her”, and similar sentiments will be muttered in quiet circles just out of his earshot.<span>  </span>This is a sign of her good self-esteem and healthy self-image, and a sign that she won't settle for anything less.<span>  </span>She is the poster girl for the Modern, Independent Woman.</div>
              <div>Imagine if a man demanded equal treatment and asked that she buy him a new bass boat, and a two-week bear hunt in Siberia as a condition of marriage. <span> </span>This would be viewed as absurd, yet women do it every day. <span> </span>Modern Western Marriage is supposedly an equal partnership, isn’t it?</div>
              <div style="text-align: center;">The injustices go from bad to worse when children enter the picture. <span> </span>If he can afford to carry the entire familial financial burden, the woman may now elect to stop working entirely.<span>  </span>She will often make this decision regardless of how he may feel about it.<span>  </span>The day she stops working is the day that all of her past financial baggage unequivocally gets tossed onto his shoulders. <span> </span>If the woman has racked up substantial credit card debts, these are now his payments to make; if the woman has not bothered to pay off her student loans, these become his responsibility; if she owes an enormous sum on her luxury car note, it is up to him to pay it off.<span>  </span>Irony of ironies is that he is now paying for her degree and she isn’t even working anymore! <span> </span>Can he object? <span> </span>Can he say: "No Honey, you made your mess, and it should not be my job to clean it up. You knew that you wanted kids even before you met me, and you should have planned ahead." <span> </span>No, he cannot.<span>  </span>The payments can't be deferred until she is once again able to continue repaying them herself, <a rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #003399;">not if he wants to retain a clean credit rating to get a loan for their dream home</span></a>.<span>  </span><span> </span>If he even suggested that she return to work to pay off some of her own debt load, he opens himself to criticisms of being an unsupportive husband and bad father who is endangering the welfare of his children.<span>  </span>Now the noose tightens and the responsible husband compensates for the mother’s freewheeling and irresponsible past, and begins slowly to pay off her old debts. <span> </span>In the most twisted turn of events yet, the debt he is paying off may often be on credit cards used to finance Vacations, Hotel Rooms and Christmas gifts shared with previous husbands, boyfriends, fiancés and lovers.<span>  </span>Caveat Emptor! <span> </span>This is the reward for today's man who works hard, makes sacrifices, plans ahead, and invests wisely.  By getting married to the typical Modern, Western Woman, the man is certainly susceptible to being railroaded into this situation, because it is completely acceptable within today's gender roles and societal norms.<strong>  </strong></div>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>Marriage can mean career slavery</strong><strong><br><br></strong></div>
              <div>Anyone who says, "Slavery is dead" clearly has not contemplated the predicament of the average Western Husband, where a<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;"> good paycheck can mean career slavery.<span>  </span></span></strong>Merriam-Webster's English Dictionary defines slavery as "…(T)he state of a person who is a chattel (an item of tangible movable or immovable property) of another person." <span> </span>If the husband earns enough to support both of them, he would be hard pressed to make an argument to preserve equality and have her continue working as he does. <span> </span>If the wife decides to stop working, the man who has been left holding the financial bag finds his options very limited. <span> </span>He may find himself working in a career that he hates, for abusive and exploitative management, excessively long hours, in a position that is physically dangerous or demanding, in an organisation that has no growth potential, far away from home.<span>  </span>At this point, considering the corner he's been painted into, he is often powerless to affect any positive, meaningful change in his own life.<span>  </span>He may have been harbouring delusions that once his wife was able to return to work, he would be able to gain some flexibility to rectify some of the shortcomings in his own career.<span>  </span><span> </span>Perhaps changing careers or accepting a lower salary at a different firm in exchange for better hours, a <span> </span>shorter commute, or more fulfilling work.<span>  </span>Nevertheless, the distinct reality is that he will continue to shoulder the financial responsibilities of his family alone.  His reward for working hard and getting ahead is to become trapped into his career, and become a specialised beast of burden to an emotionally and financially dependent family. Does it really pay to work hard anymore and apply oneself to his full potential?</div>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>If she stops working, she may never work again.</strong><strong><br><br></strong></div>
              <div>There are many debates about the merits of a stay-at-home mother vs. a working mother. <span> </span>My goal here is to simply educate the prospective husband on frequently unseen risks he is taking on when he agrees to accept 100% of the financial burden to allow his wife to stay at home.<span>  </span>An informed decision is less likely to be one that may be regretted later in the marriage.</div>
              <div>Every parent will agree that staying home with children is backbreaking and often mind-numbing labour. <span> </span>Many new fathers may concede that it is much easier to go to work than to stay at home with several children. <span> </span>However, the greatest imbalance in efforts and contributions to a marriage can manifest once all of the children are of school age. <span> </span>The house is now empty from 8am-3pm. <span> </span>The wife has 7 hours to herself while the kids are at school and the husband is at work. <span> </span>After a few years of hard work at home, many wives may feel entitled to "kick back" and take it easy. <span> </span>The good, supportive husband, however, has worked those same years, <a rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #003399;">has done his 50/50 of the housework</span></a>, and is still working just as hard to support the family once the kids are in school. <span> </span>His workload has not diminished, and it may have even increased as her expectations rise.<span>  </span>He is rarely afforded the same option to scale back his daytime efforts.</div>
              <div>What motivation does the modern wife have to return to work? <span> </span>Very little. <span> </span>For several years now, the man's salary has been enough to live on. <span> </span>Otherwise, she would have been working to make ends meet.<span>  </span>Unless tight finances dictate that she must return to work, the husband really has little say in this matter. The wife can hide behind many different excuses in order not to work, despite having little to do from 8am-3pm.<span>  </span>Among the commonest are:</div>
              <div><strong>"I'm busy with the housework" </strong><br>It is easy to exaggerate the labours of daily housework. <span> </span>Yet how long does it take to throw clothes or dishes into the washer, and remove them later?  Vacuuming can be done in 1 hour a week. <span> </span>Grocery shopping is another hour per week. <span> </span>A decent meal can be prepared in under an hour. <span> </span>Does all of this add up to 7 hours a day? The lie that housework is hard, time-consuming drudgery is no longer as persuasive as it may have been in the past, because in an age of later marriage, many men are already experienced in cooking, cleaning, and general housekeeping and know that it doesn’t take that much effort or time.<span>  </span>Humourously, not every stay-at-home-wife even performs all of these duties.</div>
              <div><strong>"I can't find a job" </strong><br>She has been out of work too long, and therefore is unable to find a job. <span> </span>This may be true, but many men do not consider this risk when they agree to support her while she "temporarily" stops working. Hopefully now they will, and can make a more informed decision.<span>  </span>Many wives may use this as a convenient scapegoat to stop looking for any job at all. <span> </span>The next section describes how this can be used against him in the event of divorce.</div>
              <div><strong>"It doesn't pay for me to work"</strong><br>In the short run, the expenses of returning to work such as gas, lunch, clothes and day care may not make it worthwhile for her to return to the workforce. <span> </span>This may be true, but does that justify her playing tennis, drinking lattes and ‘catching up with her friends’ while her husband toils away? <span> </span>Many couples may be too shortsighted to thoroughly and comprehensively think through this issue. <span> </span>Initially, the cost to benefits ratio may not be ideal, but her returning to work will improve her job skills and network of contacts and over time the return on investment will improve.<span>  </span>More so than strolling through the local mall every afternoon and window-shopping for new window treatments.<span>  </span>Over time, as her career gets back on track, and she becomes qualified for better jobs, her salary should also improve.</div>
              <div>It should be duly noted that some working wives view their salary as "personal spending money", and still expect the man to pay all or most of the bills.<span>  </span>Western Women are often heard to claim that, “What's mine is mine, and what's his is ours.”<span> </span></div>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>Even more unfair double standards that favour wives </strong></div>
              <div><strong>Cheating</strong><br>If a married man cheats, he's the scum of the earth.<span>  </span>He is a selfish jerk that has jeopardised the family unit, done his ‘thinking with his little head’, and disrespected his wife and children. <span> </span><a rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #003399;">However, when the woman cheats, she's portrayed as the victim of an insensitive and inattentive husband</span></a>. <span> </span>“Poor thing, he ignores her. <span> </span>It is for her empowerment, to boost her ego. She deserves it after bearing and rearing his children.”<span>  </span>It’s good for her self-esteem. <span> </span>Worse, her cheating is portrayed as the man's fault.<span>  </span>If he works long hours to provide for her and the children, he works too much.<span>  </span>If he is tired at the end of the day from 13 hours of manual labour, then he doesn't compliment her as much as she wants.<span>  </span>Into this vacuum of conflicting expectations steps the first man who “makes me feel like a Real Woman again…”.<span>  </span>You read that correctly; the man who is scrambling to pay the mortgage and car payments and is working double shifts to pay for the consumer goods she demanded to have is now considered a negligent and emotionally abusive husband. The man who may be working two jobs to allow her to be home with her kids is now considered a candidate for Domestic Violence.</div>
              <div>When a woman cheats, the first thing people ask is what he did, or more often, didn't do, to drive her into the arms of another man.<span>  </span></div>
              <div>When a man cheats, no one <strong>ever </strong>asks the same question.</div>
              <div>When a woman cheats, the reaction will be; "Oh, poor thing, I guess her husband couldn’t get the job done in the bedroom".</div>
              <div>When a man cheats, no one <strong>ever </strong>stops to think; "Oh poor fellow, his wife was horrible in bed."</div>
              <div>Let’s not forget what happens if a man were to leave his wife for a younger woman.<span>  </span>This will become fodder at the coffee shop for months.<span>  </span>It is automatically assumed that he is a shallow sex maniac whose <em>only </em>motivation was to be with a younger woman. <span> </span>The possibility that his wife was lazy, or a reckless spendthrift, or verbally or physically abusive, or grossly overweight, or an incompetent mother, are rarely considered and are often totally ignored. <span> </span>The myth is that the only reason a man leaves his wife is to be with a younger, more attractive woman.<span>  </span>Never mind if she is a better match for him and a more supportive, nurturing mate.</div>
              <div><strong>Pre-Nups </strong><br>If a man insists on a Pre-Nup, he is selfish and unromantic. <span> </span>However, when is the last time a woman who demanded a Pre-Nup was called "unromantic"? <span> </span>On the contrary, if a woman requests a Pre-Nup, she is being fiscally responsible, sensible and looking out for herself. (Note: If your fiancée refuses to sign a Pre-Nup, she has just shown her hand.<span>  </span>Best to leave now.) <span> </span>Why is it that a woman can refuse a Pre-Nup, and it is accepted by society? <span> </span>In reality, the man should be outraged that she is after a legal contract, and not love.</div>
              <div>What is astounding is the hypocrisy of the usual reaction towards Pre-Nups. <span> </span>Women can conveniently assert that a man is unromantic if he suggests a Pre-Nup. <span> </span>After all, how can a man pollute true love with the signing of legal paperwork! <span> </span>However, what is a marriage licence?<span>  </span>Nothing more than a legal contract entered into between the man, woman and local and state government authorities.<span>  </span>A woman does not seem to balk at signing <em>this </em>legal paperwork, which entitles her to at least half the assets a man has accumulated as well as half of everything he earns in the future, and obligates him to support her in perpetuity in the event of a breakup. <span> </span>Why aren't men allowed to note how unromantic <em>this </em>contract is? <span> </span>The distraction of bridal magazines, place setting selection, floral arrangements, churches, wedding dresses, receptions, wedding showers, and honeymoons have clouded the legal reality of what men are getting themselves into. <span> </span><strong>Marriage is as much an unromantic legal contract as a prenuptial agreement is.</strong></div>
              <div><a rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #003399;">Initially, Pre-Nups were devised as a way to protect <em>women</em></span></a>. <span> </span>Nuptial agreements were popularised in the 19th century, mostly to protect heiresses from marrying men who were "out for their money". <span> </span>Until the Married Women's Property Act of 1848, under English Common Law, a woman's property, upon marriage, was usually transferred to her husband.</div>
              <div><strong>"Stupid, Irresponsible" Men</strong><br>Men are severely abused in our media, quite frankly.<span>  </span>Just watch any TV commercial or sitcom and see how they portray men as idiots, dolts, or well intentioned, if bumbling, buffoons.<span>  </span>If women were portrayed in commercials in the same fashion, “Women’s Organisations” would have a fit.<span>  </span>If it weren’t for their wives in these shows and ads the men would be lost "animals", unable to feed themselves or perform even the simplest of tasks.<span>  </span>Other commercials make it appear that men act without thinking, only responding in an impulsive and irrational manner, and that the wife is the brains of the family.<span>  </span>Even many women will agree that women often are the ones who act upon emotions and make judgments solely based up on emotional attachments and not logic or reason. Almost every "couples budgeting" article will portray the woman as the one who has to rein in the man's childish spending, when in truth it is usually the woman who cannot control her expenditures.</div>
              <div><strong>Job Loss</strong><br>If a husband loses his job and is having trouble finding work, the wife is completely and totally justified in threatening to leave him.<span>  </span>However, can you imagine the reaction if a husband threatened to leave a wife who was in the exact same position? <span> </span>He would be vilified! <span> </span>If a man loses his job, the woman is justified in resenting the fact that the financial burden lies on her. <span> </span>He is no longer a ‘good provider’.<span>  </span>When is a man allowed to resent this very same predicament? <span> </span>If a man is laid off and cares for the household and kids while the wife is working, he may be accused of not pulling his weight! <span> </span>Yet this is exactly the same situation that women demand more recognition for with each passing year!<span>  </span>No matter what role the man plays, he loses!</div>
              <div><strong>Traditional Roles </strong><br>It is perfectly acceptable for a woman to demand that a man make a certain salary, drive a certain car, live in a certain part of the city, have a certain job, have the'right' manners, talk a certain way, walk a certain way, behave a certain way, have a degree from the 'right' University and dress in a stylish fashion, to be deemed "marriage material" and be able to provide her with the stability she feels she deserves. <span> </span>If a man demands his wife do the cooking and cleaning, he can now be labeled old fashioned and sexist. If he asks her to carry her weight financially, just as he does, he may be criticised as an inadequate provider. If a man insists that his wife honor the conjugal requirements of the marriage contract, he can and will be accused of sexual abuse, sexual assault or rape.</div>
              <div>To add insult to injury, some women have gotten so pampered that they not only quit their jobs the day they find out they are pregnant, but they then go out and hire as many nannies, cooks, gardeners and pool boys as their husband can afford. <span> </span><a rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #003399;">Many Western Wives stay at home and hire someone <strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">else </span></strong>to rear the kids and clean up, while they drink lattes and go shopping all day with other pampered "stay-at-home" mothers</span></a>. <span> </span>Does it pay to work hard and get ahead anymore, if this is how your hard-earned money is squandered?</div>
              <div>The concept of the pampered wife is a relatively new one. Most of Western Civilisation was primarily an agricultural economy even up until the 1920's and 1930’s.<span>  </span>Western Wives contributed to the well being of the household by helping on the farm. <span> </span>A man needed a wife as an equal partner. <span> </span>It was not until the 1950's that the first generation of Western Wives, first in The States and later in Europe, Australia and New Zealand , began to emerge as dead weight. Perhaps this coincides with the spiking of the divorce rate in The States, and later Europe and the other English Speaking Nations, and the rise of Feminism. <span> </span>Perhaps men have become tired of giving so much, while getting so little in exchange.</div>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>Divorce</strong><strong><br></strong></div>
              <div><strong><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.dont-marry.com/%3Ca%20href="><span style="color: #003399;">43% of Western Marriages end in divorce</span></a>, and <a rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #003399;">70% to 93% of these divorces are initiated by women</span></a></strong>.</div>
              <div>All men should consult a legal professional before marrying, and understand the implications of divorce, because the chances are 1-in-3 that they will participate in one whether they like it, want it, inititate it or not.</div>
              <div>Upon divorce, all assets accumulated during and prior to a marriage are subject to division.<span>  </span>It has become, simply put. a licence to steal.<span>  </span>Even if the woman has not worked in years, and has spent the intervening decade(s) shopping and lunching from 8am-3pm, she is entitled to half, or more, of everything the man worked for during the course of the marriage. <span> </span>Is this fair? <span> </span>How many people would ever agree to a job contract that stipulated that in the event of separation that one party would have to return 50% of the gross amount of everything in the pay packet?<span>  </span>No one in his or her right mind would knowingly sign such an agreement. <span> </span><strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Yet Western Men unknowingly agree to the exact same insanity each time they sign their marriage contract!</span> </strong></div>
              <div>"Assets accumulated prior to a marriage are exempt from a divorce".<span>  </span>In theory this is true, in practice it is not. <span> </span>If funds from an account are commingled or combined, it can become marital property. <span> </span>How do funds become commingled, or mixed?<span>  </span>If even the smallest sum from a prior account is spent towards the marriage, all of that account will now be considered marital property.<span>  </span>Buy your child a lollipop from your own account, and a good lawyer will take one-half of it for your ex-wife when you divorce. <span> </span>If a woman moves into a home the man owned prior to the marriage, it is not safe from divorce. <span> </span>If she so much as hangs up a sheet of wallpaper, puts up draperies, paints a wall, or installs a light fixture, the home is now classified as joint marital property, and is now subject to equal division.<span>  </span>Worse actually, <a rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #003399;">the man can be ejected from the home</span></a> if she makes a false claim of domestic violence, physical abuse, verbal abuse or child abuse.<span>  </span>Where is the equality and fairness?</div>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>Note:</strong> "Equal Division" is also somewhat of a misnomer. <span> </span>Often, she can get upwards of 70% - 90% of the assets, while the man gets the majority of the debts!<span>  </span>She gets all of the benefits, he gets all of the responsibilities. <span> </span>This, of course, is just and right and is his reward for working so hard all of those years. He can afford it; she can't because she was not working.<br></div>
              <div style="text-align: center;"><strong>If you pamper your wife, it can be used against you <br></strong></div>
              <div>Imagine that in the spirit of generosity and kindness that you gave a beggar a hot meal. <span> </span>A generous act, indeed.<span>  </span><span> </span>Now imagine your reaction if that same beggar sues you in court.<span>  </span>He is petitioning the judge to have you keep providing him with the food that you gave him willingly, freely, out of a big heart.<span>  </span>The judge orders you to keep feeding the homeless man meals, indefinitely, forever, because he has become accustomed to eating those meals! <span> </span>This is categorically absurd, yet this happens to Western Men in divorce court every day. <span> </span>Instead of thanking you for paying her bills for all those years, what you get is the privilege of being legally forced to pay her bills forever<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">! </span></strong><strong></strong></div>
              <div>After having children, many women demand to quit working and stay home. <span> </span>Before the kids came along, many of these same women may have been in careers they hated, working long hours, and enduring long commutes. <span> </span>It is the man's generosity and dedication to his own career that enables her to walk away from her own career. <span> </span>During a marriage, a man with a stay-at-home wife might work long and grueling hours in order to support her. <span> </span>He will pay the mortgage, the property tax, grocery bill, phone bill, cable bill, Internet bill and electric bill.  He also pays for her car, gas money, clothes, and vacations.</div>
              <div>As one final slap in the face, the man may be punished for working hard enough to allow his wife to have the luxury of staying at home with the kids. <span> </span>As noted above, after the children are in school, the wife may enjoy a life of leisure and relaxation that is afforded to her by her man's hard work. <span> </span>In the event of divorce, he will be legally obligated to support her for years or decades to come.<span>  </span><span> </span>Because she stopped working and led a life of leisure, the ex-husb<span style="color: #000000;">and is now responsible for supporting her, forever! </span> History has a tendency of rewriting itself.  Originally, a woman may have had a career that she may have hated, and was begging to leave.  Western Women often "play" at work and career for a few years after University, and then when they near 30 or grow tired of the workplace they seek out a man to "take her away from all of this", whatever "all of this" may be.  In fact her desire to leave the world of work may have been her motivation to have kids in the first place.  But now, in her eyes, and <strong>definitely</strong> her lawyers eyes, she "gave up" her career for her man and his kids.  She is now "owed" all of her "lost income".  His gift of leisure and support to her has now become twisted and is viewed as her sacrifice!  Another way in which the situation is turned against him is that he will be characterised as being threatened by her having her own career, and that he forced her to quit her "lucrative career" and stay home with the children.  Her lawyer will now attempt to convince the judge that he wanted to "oppress" his wife and "keep her down".  Truthfully now, how many men do you personally know that are upset at having a wife that earns a good living?  Many of these misleading stereotypes still run rampant in our society, and are routinely used to the woman's advantage during a divorce.  As a result of her not working, regardless of whether she was minding the home or not, she remains a financial liability.</div>
              <div>Generous, caring men who spoil their wives should certainly think twice about how this generosity can later be used against them. The phrase used in divorce court is "She has become accustomed to a certain lifestyle".  A husband's reward for spoiling his wife today is the legal obligation to spoil her indefinitely, forever. Buy her a luxury car today, and you may be obligated to buy her luxury cars after she leaves you for another man! Yet, imagine a husband that became accustomed to eating a home cooked dinner, or regular conjugal visits. Now imagine the courts obligate the ex-wife to continue cooking for him and sharing her bed with him and his new girlfriend each night, despite being divorced!  Inconceivable, but it happens the other way around every day!</div>
              <div>The ultimate insult, however, comes when the man loses half or more of his life's assets even when she has decided to leave him.  Yes, <a rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #003399;">a wife can unilaterally decide to kick a man out of his own home</span></a>, and have the courts force him to continue paying the bills, while she is sleeping with her new boyfriend in the very house the husband worked so long and hard to buy!  She can, and often does, spend her alimony check on gifts for her new boyfriend or lover!  How is it that the legal system supports a woman who feels entitled to this?</div>
              <div>The risks are clear, yet what exactly are men getting out of marriage?  Many times, the reasons men get married are unfounded.<br></div>
              <div style="font-weight: bold;">Many of the traditional  reasons why a man gets married are a myth.</div>
              <div><span style="font-weight: bold;">"I won't die alone"</span><br>Wrong. The simple fact is that one spouse WILL die alone.  Visit the hospital and go to the terminally ill or cardiac departments.  Few people have the time to sit with an ill relative all day and all night.  Yes, you may get visitors, but they aren't having the same thoughts as you are. You're contemplating your mortality, while they're wondering what food the hospital cafeteria offers. In the end, even with a loving and supportive family, most of us will leave this world alone, unless you both die simultaneously in an accident of some kind.  Your spouse may die fifteen years before you, or you may be in the hospital for your last year.  Ultimately, we all die alone. Married or not.</div>
              <div><span style="font-weight: bold;">"I won't grow old alone"</span><br>Not necessarily. A marriage can self-destruct at <em>any </em>time. Your partner may initiate divorce at age 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65 or 70. Many married people end up in the same position (alone) as if they had never married at all.  Now they enter their twilight years broke, as a result of being stripped of half or more of their life's assets, losing half their retirement and pension funds, and being assessed alimony payments.  Experiencing financial devastation from one divorce often may preclude a man from ever marrying again.  This is a common observation of many middle-aged Western Women. Q: "Where are all the men?".  A: "He is broke from the divorce settlement, alimony and child support payments."  Thus these women don't find him marriable, and he grows old alone and poor.</div>
              <div>Men are led to believe that not marrying implies only one destiny; that of a solitary monk in a cave, a shunned loner.  However, life is not so black and white.  Not marrying does not mean you cannot continue to date or have meaningful relationships throughout your life. There are plenty of single people in all age brackets.  A bad marriage can be the loneliest of institutions, because most of your emotional outlet and companionship is concentrated into one person who gives back nothing in emotion, affection or support.  Young men in their 20's and 30's should be more aware of the alternatives that exist in life. They should be aware that marriage is a <em>choice, </em>and is not the only path life has to offer. An informed decision is less likely to be one that is later regretted.</div>
              <div><span style="font-weight: bold;">"I'll get regular sex" </span><br>Not from Modern, Western Women. Access to regular sex is the oldest and the most frequently cited reason to marry.  <a rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #003399;">Many men now know that Modern, Western Women frequently stop having sex after just a short time of being married</span></a>.  There are plenty of "sexless" marriages.  Talk to a few married couples that are honest about their relationship. One or both partners may stop wanting sex after kids, or the sex may be as infrequent as once a year or once every six months, or the wife may only have sex when she wants the husband to buy her something, take her somewhere, or remodel the house.  <a rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #003399;">Read the honest opinions of married men on the Internet</span></a>.  Most Western, Married Men will have more sex with their Western Wives in the <em>first six months</em> of their marriage than they will in the <em>next 40 years</em>. Lastly, it remains to be seen whether sex with one exclusive partner for forty years or more is even a natural act, or just a man-made convention.  In many Western Nations, the wife is no longer required to have sex with her husband. She can deny him at any time, for any length of time. She can, if she wishes, <strong>deny him sex forever </strong>and <strong>there is nothing that he can do</strong> about it.. In fact, if he inisists that she honor her end of the marriage contract by being available for sexual relations, he can and will be accused of, charged with, and <strong>arrested</strong> for Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault or Rape.</div>
              <div>Marriage is hardly a guarantee of regular sex, as many people are led to believe.</div>
              <div><span style="font-weight: bold;">"I'll have someone to cook and clean for me"</span><br>Not necessarily. While a Modern, Western Woman is perfectly justified in quitting her job in the name of staying home with the kids, she can also demand that the husband pay for a cook, a maid, and a nanny. This leaves the man to earn the money, and leaves him to pay for maintenance of household and children, while the wife gets to play at being a housekeeper.  Today's woman is empowered by <em>not </em>performing the traditional housewife duties, regardless of whether she is working or not.  If a husband asks that his wife perform traditional household duties because she is not working, he will often be labeled sexist, abusive or controlling, even if he is doing his "traditional role" of paying all the bills, providing for his family, and performing the traditional manly duties of vehicle repairs, maintaining the lawn and house upkeep.</div>
              <div><span style="font-weight: bold;">"It is the proper religious thing to do"</span><br>Perhaps, but it is a complete farce to watch couples that haven't gone to church, temple, shrine, mosque or hall in 10, 15, or 20 years suddenly become regulars a few months prior to their marriage in order to gain approval of their religion. In most cases, they don't go back for regular services after their wedding.  If you are not actively religious, why would you need your personal relationship to be endorsed by religious figures whom you will never see again?  Religion today is nothing more than a way to socialise and network with the neighbours.  It is not a reason to be married.  Some religions, like the Catholic Church, will only allow you to be married once. So when remarrying, divorced people will get the marriage "annulled"; as though it never existed in the first place.  A convenient man-made loophole to circumvent a man-made custom.  A complete farce.</div>
              <div><span style="font-weight: bold;">"I have to be married to have kids" </span><br>Not anymore.  Her ovaries do not physically need a contract at the government center in order to be fertilised by your sperm. Cro-Magnon man had children long before lawyers invented marriage contracts. Often, you do not need to be married in order to share health benefits.  You do not need to be married to designate your partner on a life insurance policy.  You do not need to be married to own a dream home together.  It is ironic that responsible parents who raise a healthy family, but never actually sign marriage paperwork, get less respect than divorced parents or married parents who are ineffective, inattentive or incompetent.</div>
              <div>-Having a lifelong, faithful, committed relationship has nothing to do with being "married".<br>-Owning a beautiful dream home together has nothing to do with being "married".<br>-Rearing healthy, happy, and successful children has nothing to do with being "married".<br>-Building a family and life together has nothing to do with being "married".<br>-Growing old together has nothing to do with being "married".</div>
              <div>In fact, recent changes in cohabitation, partner and marriage law have proven that the only tangible consequence of marriage is having a formalised separation process that usually requires the talents of an attorney.<br><br>You <span style="font-weight: bold;">do</span> need to be married in order to throw an extravagant four-hour party, and share the same last name.</div>
              <div>You <span style="font-weight: bold;">do</span> need to be married in order to involve the state and government in your romantic affairs.</div>
              <div>You <span style="font-weight: bold;">do</span> need to be married in order give away half of everything you own.</div>
              <div>Besides that, marriage does nothing more than introduce lawyers and phony, crooked religious figures into your life.  These are people that otherwise would have nothing to do with your life or your relationship.</div>
              <div style="font-weight: bold;">Men need to stop and ask themselves:</div>
              <div>"Why exactly am I getting married?  What exactly does marriage mean to me in today's world?  What is the benefit to me to get married?"</div>
              <div>It is no longer a lifelong commitment, because it can be reversed overnight on her unilateral whim.</div>
              <div>Marriage was originally created as a way for families to merge land, property, political power and influence; perhaps people should return to viewing it as just that and nothing more.  The rest of it is fake modern TV Fantasy and Tabloid Gossip and Hype polluting the minds of today's impressionable youth, and a way to keep the multi-billion-per-year wedding industry chugging along.  Perhaps the only criteria should be to ask oneself: "How excited am I for us to merge our finances and assets?"  When all the fluff and hype are boiled away, that may be the only remaining reality.  Spend a day in divorce court, and you'll see exactly what is real and tangible and lasting about marriage. You'll see women who signed the marriage contract under romantic pretenses who are now expert laymen attorneys who can cite case law.  Bouquet throwing ex-brides now embroiled in warfare to get everything that is coming to them and more!  The rest are myths, lies, bold unsubstantiated promises, and maybes.  "For better or for worse..."</div>
              <div><a rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #003399;">The Western Divorce rate is 43%</span></a>.  It is higher in some parts of the world such as <a rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #003399;">California</span></a>, Great Britain and Australia.  <a rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #003399;">In Japan the recent change in pension law may have many pensioners out on the street</span></a>.  <a rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #003399;">In India new changes to dowry law have men being threatened by their wives</span></a>.  Consider the number of people who are in a bad marriage, but elect to stay; <a rel="nofollow"><span style="color: #003399;">Men who don't want to lose 50%</span></a>, women who know they can't support themselves alone.  Next, think of how many more couples stay together just for the sake of the kids. Of these "forced marriages", consider how many of these marriages involve infidelity, no sex, or sleeping in separate beds or separate rooms.  I estimate the percentage of happy and monogamous marriages to be under 5%. Are these odds you would take in a business venture, investment or loan?  Most of the risk-averse population would not. Yet they seek this exception to the rule everyday through marriage.</div>

When he cried out, the Lord appeared and asked, "Why are you crying?"<br><br>The woodcutter replied that his axe has fallen into water, and he needed the axe to make his living.<br><br>The Lord went down into the water and reappeared with a golden axe. "Is this your axe?" the Lord asked.<br><br>The woodcutter replied, "No."<br><br>The Lord again went down and came up with a silver Axe. "Is this your axe?" </div>
              <div>the Lord asked.<br><br>Again, the woodcutter replied, "No."<br><br>The Lord went down again and came up with an iron Axe. "Is this your axe?" </div>
              <div>the Lord asked.<br><br>The woodcutter replied, "Yes."<br></div>
              <div>The Lord was pleased with the man's honesty and gave him all three axes to keep, and the woodcutter went home happy.<br><br>Some time later the woodcutter was walking with his wife along the riverbank, and his wife fell into the river. When he cried out, the Lord again appeared and asked him, "Why are you crying?"<br><br>"Oh Lord, my wife has fallen into the water!"<br><br>The Lord went down into the water and came up with ANGELINA JOLIE. "Is this your wife?" the Lord asked.<br></div>
              <div>"Yes," cried the woodcutter.<br><br>The Lord was furious. "You lied! That is an untruth!"<br><br>The woodcutter replied, "Oh, forgive me, my Lord. It is a misunderstanding.<br></div>
              <div>You see, if I had said 'no' to ANGELINA JOLIE, you would have come up with<br>CAMERON DIAZ.</div>

              <div>Then if I said 'no' to her, you would have come up with my wife. Had I then said 'yes,'</div>
              <div>you would have given me all three. Lord, I am a poor man, and am not able to take care of all three wives, so THAT'S whyI said yes to ANGELINA JOLIE ."<br><br>The moral of this story is: Whenever a man lies, it is for a good and honorable reason, and for the benefit of others.<br><br>That's our story, and we're sticking to it! - "WE HONORABLE MEN!!!!!!"</div>

You must find a man that is 'faithful', not 'spendthrift' and must be a 'virgin'."<br><br>With this advise from her mother, the girl went to Town. After some months later, she came home to her kampung to get her mother's blessings to marry.<br><br>"Mother, I've met my match following your instructions. My future husband is faithful because when we went out for a holiday one day, he took care of me specifically even though there were so many prettier girls around. Isn't that being faithful?".<br><br>Her mother nodded in agreement.<br><br>"Then, since the day was getting late in the night and rain was pouring, my boyfriend decided that we stay the night at a hotel. He also suggested that in order not to spend too much, we shared one room only.Isn't he not spendthrift guy?"<br><br>For the second time her mother nodded her head in agreement, but with a little concern.<br><br>"And finally mum..., I know he is a virgin".<br><br>"How did you know he is still a virgin?"
