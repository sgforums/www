            <div class='col-md body'>Thought I share this article appended below.<br><br>Joe<br><br><span class="large"><strong>Enough Versus Greed</strong></span><br><br>Several questions have been raised in discussing this topic that we need to ponder on. Here are the questions:<br><br>LetÂ’s pretend that we are children once again and that we have this powerful imagination to let us picture things that we know are not real. LetÂ’s assume for a moment that we had an environment where all of us could have enough of all the stuff that we need to survive and lead a good life. A good life is one where we have a good roof over our heads, good food on the table, a loving family and friends who are safe, and a tolerant community that accepts our beliefs and values our contributions as equals.<br><br>First: Is it part of our racial memory in our instinct to survive that we would still want more and more. Is greed an integral part of our spiritual nature or<br>something that we developed because of not having enough all through out our history? Is the passion to have more than the others, something we can live without? Is it impossible for most of us to be satisfied at any point? Are we not able to figure out for ourselves that we have to manage our appetites<br>instead of our appetites managing our lives?<br><br>Second: Assuming that the answer is no to the first question. Assuming that greed is not part of our spiritual nature and we can manage it rationally.  Can<br>we rationally come to some limits that would make sense for everyone as to what is enough.  We have to assume that some of us will always work harder, do better, be more intelligent, be more passionate, be more creative, and so on than others. It does not make sense that the lazy will have the same as the industrious. It does not make sense those who do work that others donÂ’t want to do, will have the same as everyone.  Is it possible that we can agree that although we all have enough for everyone to live a good life that we also have a limit for those who do more? For example, the most that anyone have, is eight of anything, e.g. eight houses, eight years in a<br>sought after job, eight meals a day, and so on.<br><br>Third:  Assuming that the answer is yes to the second question. Can we rationally accept that once we have lived a Â“good lifeÂ” that we should allow the next generation to do their own thing? Can we accept that it is enough to have a limited effect on what happens next after we die?  Can most of us be satisfied that we will be able to leave behind something that is enough for the next generation or our beloved institutions to continue to enjoy our generosity for only a limited length of time. Can most of us stop ourselves from claiming the needs of future generations and beloved institutions as part of our own?  At least in addressing for our personal needs, we have a reasonable chance that we can satisfy them when we had enough. If we extend these needs to our future generations and institutions, we will never<br>know if we will ever accumulate enough.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span class="large"><strong>LIVE FOR LOVED ONES</strong></span><br><br>There was once this guy who is very much in love with his girl. This romantic guy folded 1,000 pieces of paper cranes as a gift to his girl. Although, at that time he was just a small fry in his company, his future didn't seem too bright, they were very happy together. Until one day, his girl told him she was going to Paris and will never come back. She also told him that she cannot visualize any future for the both of them, so they went their own ways there and then...Heartbroken, the guy agreed. But when he regained his confidence, he worked hard day and night, slogging his body and mind just to make something out of himself.<br><br>Finally with all the hard work and the help of friends, this guy had set up his own company ..You never fail until you stop trying. One rainy day, while this guy was driving, he saw an elderly couple sharing an umbrella in the rain walking to some destination. Even with the umbrella, they were still drenched. It didn't take him long to realize they were his girl's parents.With a heart in getting back at them, he drove slowly beside the couple, wanting them to spot him in his luxury sedan. He wanted them to know that he wasn't the same any more; he had his own company, car, condo, etc. He made it! What he saw next confused him, the couple was walking towards a cemetery, and so he got out of his car and followed...and he saw his girl, a photograph of her smiling sweetly as ever at him from her tombstone and he saw his paper cranes right beside her...Her parents saw him. He asked them why this had happened. They explained, she did not leave for France at all. She was ill with cancer. She had believed that he will make it someday, but she did not want to be his obstacle... therefore she had chosen to leave him.<br><br>Just because someone doesn't love you the way you want them to, doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have. She had wanted her parents to put his paper cranes beside her, because, if the day comes when fate brings him to her again...he can take some of those back with him...<br><br>Once you have loved, you will always love. For what's in your mind may escape but what's in your heart will remain forever. The guy just wept...The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right beside her knowing you can't have her, see her or be with her ever again.........hope you understand. Find time to realize that there is one person who means so much to you, for you might wake up one morning losing that person who you thought meant nothing to you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME</strong></span><br><br>A young man learnt what's most important in life from the guy next door, from Mr Belser.<br><br>It had been some time since Jack had seen the old man. College, girls, career, and life itself got in the way. In fact, Jack moved clear across the country in pursuit of his dreams. There, in the rush of his busy life, Jack had little time to think about the past and often no time to spend with his wife and son. He was working on his future, and nothing could stop him.<br><br>Over the phone, his mother told him, "Mr. Belser died last night. The funeral is Wednesday."<br><br>Memories flashed through his mind like an old newsreel as he sat quietly remembering his childhood days.<br><br>"Jack, did you hear me?"<br><br>"Oh, sorry, Mom. Yes, I heard you. It's been so long since I thought of him. I'm sorry, but I honestly thought he died years ago," Jack said.<br><br>"Well, he didn't forget you. Every time I saw him he'd ask how you were doing. He'd reminisce about the many days you spent over 'his side ofthe fence' as he put it," Mom told him.<br><br>"I loved that old house he lived in," Jack said.<br><br>"You know, Jack, after your father died, Mr. Belser stepped in to make sure you had a man's influence in your life," she said.<br><br>"He's the one who taught me carpentry," he said. "I wouldn't be in this business if it weren't for him. He spent a lot of time teaching me things he thought were important... Mom, I'll be there for the funeral," Jack said.<br><br>As busy as he was, he kept his word. Jack caught the next flight to his hometown. Mr. Belser's funeral was small and uneventful. He had no children of his own, and most of his relatives had passed away.<br><br>The night before he had to return home, Jack and his Mom stopped by to see the old house next door one more time. Standing in the doorway, Jack paused for a moment. It was like crossing over into another dimension, a leap through space and time. The house was exactly as he remembered. Every step held memories. Every picture, every piece of furniture.... Jack stopped suddenly.<br><br>"What's wrong, Jack?" his Mom asked.<br><br>"The box is gone," he said.<br><br>"What box?" Mom asked.<br><br>"There was a small gold box that he kept locked on top of his desk. I must have asked him a thousand times what was inside. All he'd ever tell me was 'the thing I value most,'" Jack said.<br><br>It was gone. Everything about the house was exactly how Jack remembered it, except for the box. He figured someone from the Belser family had taken it.<br><br>"Now I'll never know what was so valuable to him," Jack said. "I better get some sleep. I have an early flight home, Mom."<br><br>It had been about two weeks since Mr. Belser died. Returning home from work one day Jack discovered a note in his mailbox. "Signature required on a package. No one at home. Please stop by the main post office within the next three days," the note read.<br><br>Early the next day Jack retrieved the package. The small box was old and looked like it had been mailed a hundred years ago. The handwriting was difficult to read, but the return address caught his attention. "Mr. Harold Belser" it read. Jack took the box out to his car and ripped open the package. There inside was the gold box and an envelope. Jack's hands shook as he read the note inside. "Upon my death, please forward this box and its contents to Jack Bennett. It's the thing I valued most in my life." A small key was taped to the letter. His heart racing, as tears filling his eyes, Jack carefully unlocked the box. There inside he found a beautiful gold pocket watch. Running his fingers slowly over the finely etched casing, he unlatched the cover. Inside he found these words engraved: "Jack, Thanks for your time! Harold Belser."<br><br>"The thing he valued most...was...my time." Jack held the watch for a few minutes, then called his office and cleared his appointments for the next two days.<br><br>"Why?" Janet, his assistant asked.<br><br>"I need some time to spend with my son," he said. "Oh, by the way, Janet...thanks for your time!"<br><br>"Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take but by the moments that take our breath away."<br><br>Think about this. You may not realize it,but it's 100% true .<br><br>1. At least 2 people in this world love you so much they would die for you.<br><br>2. At least 15 people in this world love you in some way.<br><br>3. The only reason anyone would ever hate you is because they want to be just like you.<br><br>4. A smile from you can bring happiness to anyone, even if they don't like<br>you.<br><br>5. Every night, SOMEONE thinks about you before they go to sleep.<br><br>6. You mean the world to someone.<br><br>7. If not for you, someone may not be living.<br><br>8. You are special and unique.<br><br>9. When you think you have no chance of getting what you want, you probably won't get it, but if you trust God to do what's best, and wait on His time, probably, sooner or later, you will get it or something better.<br><br>10. When you make the biggest mistake ever, something good can still come from it.<br><br>11. When you think the world has turned its back on you, take a look: you most likely turned your back on the world.<br><br>12. Someone that you don't even know exists, loves you.<br><br>13. Always remember the compliments you received. Forget about the rude remarks.<br><br>14. Always tell someone how you feel about them; you will feel much better when they know and you'll both be happy.<br><br>15. If you have a great friend, take the time to let them know that they are great.<br><br>Share this story to all the people you care about. You will certainly brighten someone's day and might change their perspective on life, for the better.</div>

              Hello Everyone,
              
              Good Morning.
              
              A conversation with someone you loved or with someone you are close will help you to understand something that you may not be aware. Now, what happens if you are able to talk to God Himself. Hmmm.....it is something like this....
              
              A TALKED WITH GOD
              
              God: Hello. Did you call me?
              
              BB (Busy Busy): Called you? No. Who is this?
              
              God: This is GOD. I heard your prayers. So I thought I will chat.
              
              BB: I do pray. Just makes me feel good. I am actually busy now. I am in the midst of something.
              
              God: What are you busy at? Ants are busy too!
              
              BB: Don't know. But I can't find free time. Life has become hectic. It's rush hour all the time!
              
              God: Sure. Activity gets you busy. But productivity gets you free time. Activity consumes time. Productivity frees it.
              
              BB: I understand. But I still can't figure out. By the way, I was not expecting YOU to buzz me on instant messaging chat.
              
              God: Well, I wanted to resolve your fight for time, by giving you some clarity. In this net era, I wanted to reach you through the medium you are comfortable with.
              
              BB: Tell me, why has life become complicated now?
              
              God: Stop analyzing life. Just live it. Analysis is what makes it complicated.
              
              BB: Why are we then constantly unhappy?
              
              God: Your today is the tomorrow that you worried about yesterday. You are worrying because you are analyzing. Worrying has become your habit. That's why you are not happy.
              
              BB: But how can we not worry when there is so much uncertainty?
              
              God: Uncertainty is inevitable, but worrying is optional.
              
              BB: But then, there is so much pain due to uncertainty...
              
              God: Pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional.
              
              BB: If suffering is optional, why do good people always suffer?
              
              God: Diamond cannot be polished without friction. Gold cannot be purified without fire. Good people go through trials, but don't suffer. With that experience their life becomes better, not bitter.
              
              BB: You mean to say such experience is useful?
              
              God: Yes, always. Experience is a hard teacher. She gives the test first and the lessons afterwards.
              
              BB: But still, why should we go through such tests? Why can't we be free from problems?
              
              God: Problems are: Purposeful Roadblocks Offering Beneficial Lessons to Enhance Mental Strength. Inner strength comes from struggle and endurance, not when you are free from problems.
              
              BB: Frankly in the midst of so many problems, we don't know where we are heading...
              
              God: If you look outside you will not know where you are heading. Look inside. Looking outside, you dream. Looking inside, you awaken. Eyes provide sight. Heart provides insight.
              
              BB: Sometimes not succeeding fast seems to hurt more than moving in the right direction. What should I do?
              
              God: Success is a measure as decided by others. Satisfaction is a measure as decided by you. Knowing the road ahead is more satisfying than knowing you rode ahead. You work with the compass. Let others work with the clock.
              
              BB: In tough times, how do you stay motivated?
              
              God: Always look at how far you have come rather than how far you have to go. Always count your blessing, not what you are missing.
              
              BB: What surprises you about people?
              
              God: When they suffer they ask, "why me?" When they prosper, they never ask "Why me?" Everyone wishes to have truth on their side, but few want to be on the side of the truth.
              
              BB: How can I get the best out of life?
              
              God: Face your past without regret. Handle your present with confidence. Prepare for the future without fear.
              
              BB: One last question. Sometimes I feel my prayers are not answered.
              
              God: There are no unanswered prayers. At times the answer is NO.
              
              BB: Thank you for this wonderful chat. I am so happy to start the New Day with a new sense of inspiration.
              
              God: Well. Keep the faith and drop the fear. Don't believe your doubts and doubt your beliefs. Life is a mystery to solve, not a problem to resolve. Trust me. Life is wonderful if you know how to live.
              
              Thank you God.

However, life is about learning too because without making mistakes in your life that is unheard of and one important element about making mistakes in your life is that you will definitely learn from it the good and bad quality of that direct experiences, your soul will definitely develop and lastly gain wisdom from it.

              In 2004 I read a book 'A Path With Heart' written by Jack Kornfield. So before I returned it to the library, a thought came to my mind, "Why not share it with those people who wish to know the path." Its beautifully written and I confessed, it won my heart.
              
              I hope it will help you in your life and I wish all the happiness in your life.

              p.s Thanks Jack. A book of yours with many lives and yet it breathes in one book. God Bless You Wherever You Are.
              
              
              Extracted from the book 'A Path With Heart' by Jack Kornfield
              
              "There is a tribe in east Africa in which the art of true intimacy is fostered even before birth. In this tribe, the birth date of a child is not counted from the day of its physical birth nor even the day of conception, as in other village cultures. For this tribe the birth date comes the first time the child is a thought in its mother's mind. Aware of her intention to conceive a child with a particular father, the mother then goes off to sit alone under a tree.
              
              There she sits and listens until she can hear the song of the child that she hopes to conceive. Once she has heard it, she returns to her village and teaches it to the father so that they can sing it together as they make love, inviting the child to join them.
              
              After the child is conceived, she sings it to the baby in her womb. Then she teaches it to the old woman and midwives of the village, so that throughout the labor and at the miraculous moment of birth itself, the child is greeted with its song.
              
              After the birth all the villagers learn the song of their new member and sing it to the child when it falls or hurts itself. It is sung in times of triumph, or in rituals and initiations.
              
              This song becomes a part of the marriage ceremony when the child is grown, and at the end of life, his or her loved ones will gather around the deathbed and sing this song for the last time."

            <div class='col-md body'>Life is beautiful if we learn to love life. That essence of life is within life itself. To understand the true meaning of unconditional Love, is to love life itself, which is below you, around you and above you. It is not an easy task or journey for anyone of us to achieve that kind of love, for to love means is to let go of our ego "I" and think of we or us.

              Thought I share this article in conjunction with the coming Vesak Day on 31st May 2007. I love reading Buddhist spiritual text because it has come to my realization that we are also a Mind or Consciousness in the human physical body.
              
              Hope you will enjoy reading it for it make sense to me that we have to let go of something to gain something else....whether it is good or bad....it is your own choice and action.
              
              The text below was extracted from the book "A Path With Heart", written by Jack Kornfield. I discovered this book in April 2004 at the library and I found it very loving and compassionate. Thanks Jack. You are a good writer.

              p.s. I'm a mix blood. My late mother, Hajjah Salmah Bte Eusope was a Chinese. During Japanese Occupation of Singapore in WW2, she was given away to a childless Javanese couple for safety reasons. My late father, Haji Mahmood Bin Hussein, was a Malay.
              
              
              "An old Chinese Zen monk who, after many years of peaceful meditation, realized he was not really enlightened. He went to the master and said, "Please, may I go find a hut at the top of the mountain and stay there until I finish this practice?" The master, knowing he was ripe, gave his permission. On the way up the mountain the monk met an old man walking down, carrying a big bundle. The old man asked, "Where are you going, monk?" The monk answered, "I'm going to the top of the mountain to sit and either get enlightened or die." Since the old man looked very wise, the monk was moved to ask him, "Say, old man, do you know anything of this enlightenment?" The old man, who was really the Bodhisattva Manjusri - said to appear to people when they are ready for enlightenment - let go of his bundle, and it dropped to the ground. As in all good Zen stories, in that moment the monk was enlightened. "You mean it is that simple; just to let go and not grasp anything!" Then the newly enlightened monk looked back at the old man and asked, "So now what?" In answer, the old man reached down and picked up the bundle again and walked off toward town."
              
              This story shows both sides of spiritual practice. It teaches us to let go, to relinquish our grasping and identification with all things, and reminds us that we just rent this house for a while. Once we have realized that, it teaches us, we must reenter the world with a caring heart. We must pick up our bundle and carry it back into the realm of human life.

            <div class='col-md body'>I wrote this note to my wife on 18th April 1999. The message was meant for her and I to look at our relationship while I was away from her. I like to share this with you for it brought many good thoughts and feelings to my heart and mind.<br><br><strong>"In our private worlds, God, our Creator, is mostly likely to whisper in the gentle stirrings of conviction, guidance, and the experiences of grace. But also in our private worlds is the grim reality of darker, shadowy forces that we identify with the word evil or sinfulness. If God whispers, evil often shouts, and personal worlds break when that shouting gets our attention.<br><br>The principle of being silent with listening - We wished to be listeners to the deep sources where certain kinds of heavenly truth are tapped only by those who have a heart to be attentive. So we became aware that God has much to say that we had not been hearing. We were usually too busy and in places where the noise levels were too high. God will not shout, he whispers in the deep.

              I like this movie link because it gives meaning to our time that we have in our lives. Now, what happens if your time is lessen...because you are sufferring from terminal illness...what will you choose to do for the time you have left...and what will you do if you are given a second chance and change to have more time with your family and friends..
              
              Take a look at the link appended below and take your time to digest the idea of time clearly if not wisely.

            <div class='col-md body'>Thought I share this true story with you.<br><br>Thanks.<br><br>Joe<br><br>I was living in Bali from December 1992 to December 1995. I ran a 24 hours mini-restaurant in Bali while I was living in Indonesia. I met many local customers and foreign tourists while I looked after the business during the night till the next morning. Many of them came to patronise my mini-restaurant due to one reason because they knew where to have someone to listen to their stories and sometimes their worries. I loved to listen to them and sometimes my ex-wife too like to talk and listened to them.<br><br>There was this Canadian man. He was around his late fifties. He came to Bali often because he was a businessman in trading. He told me that his clients in Canada would request him to find some items in Bali or other parts of Indonesia for them and they would pay him handsomely.<br><br>He was a divorced man with no children but he had an illegitimate son with another woman in Canada. He would not go back to his wife for this reason because he had been unfaithful to her.<br><br>He was a very kind and loving man. He had all the things in his life and he lived in Toronto. He lived alone in a big house and most of the time his house was empty because he was always abroad for a long time, mainly in Indonesia, sourcing for trading items for his clients back in Canada.<br><br>One night he came to me and he spoke about my wife. He told me that he had a woman once in Jogyakarta, Central Java, Indonesia. She was a Muslim and she was very pretty too. She was young and very loving kind of person. They got serious with their relationship and he was so hurt when one day he found out that his girlfriend had loved him for his money. He had found out about it when he went to the money changer and asked her how much that he needed to marry her. She requested a large amount for the wedding and she told him that they needed a house with so much cost involved to make it look beautiful and cosy. He spoke to her about the money and why he needed to spend so much to make her his wife. She refused to explain to him and then he realised, she was in loved with him for his wealth and money. He left her and then decided not to marry anyone who had an affair with him because of his Nationality or wealth.<br><br>He cried when he told me his story. I was unable to say anything but I just listened to him. Then he left and told me to take good care of my wife.<br></div>
