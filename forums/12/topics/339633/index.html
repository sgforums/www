              <p>I first met, and fell attracted to her 5 years ago, when I was in secondary two.</p>
              <p>We were just schoolmates. We know each other, but never actually talked. Nevertheless, her features and personality strike me as really attractive.</p>
              <p>However, as another self-pitying boy with inferior complex and no guts to speak of at that time, I did not approach her, get to be her friend and know her better.</p>
              <p>(I dared to share my feelings with few people in fear that the wrong words may spread around in school. So I wrote down my feelings on various online forums, including sgforums. What some people told me was that I was too young to know what love is, that it's just puppy love and I'll forget her soon. That I should concentrate on my studies</p>
              <p>I've not forgotten her. And I did reasonably well for my studies despite thinking of her.)</p>
              <p>And so, I tormented myself emotionally and mentally for two years before both of us graduated from secondary school. She went to poly and got a boyfriend soon afterwards. I went to JC.</p>
              <p>All these whiles, I've not met a single girl who is able to invoke the same feelings within me. I was not attracted to anyone else as much as I was attracted to her. She was the only one, and she did not even do anything.</p>
              <p>Since I don't really know her, she is probably not what I thought of her to be in the first place. But I can't stop thinking about her anyway.</p>
              <p>Even though we became total strangers, even though it's even more impossible now, I still think of her from time to time. Not as much as I was as an emo kid in secondary school of course. But I still think of her and wonder how she is doing, if she is happy, and if the present would be different had I had the courage back then to even take the first step approach her.</p>
              <p>A few months back, I ceased being friends with her on Friendster. I don't know if she deleted me or it's a problem with Friendster. I know Friendster recently had some problem with some account's friends, some people's friends count dropped drastically.</p>
              <p>But that problem is now solved. Most account's friends count are back to normal. And I'm still not friend with her and can't view her friendster profile. How can I help but not wonder anything?</p>
              <p>You may think I'm pervertic, a coward or just plain childish. I'm actually stalking someone on friendster without daring to take real physical action. Perhaps I am. But my social skills is not that good in the first place, how can I possibly approach a total stranger?</p>
              <p>It seems like she has broken up with her boyfriend recently. I inferred that. So it kind of made me think of her all over again, and wonder how she is doing now, if she is happy or what.</p>
              <p>After saying (or typing) all these, I rekon my obsession sounds pervertic or psychotic.</p>
              <p>There's no particular question I want to ask or answers that I want over here. Just felt an urge to spill out my feelings somewhere.</p>

              <p>you should go ahead and give yourself a chance. its either that, or regret not having done anything after she gets married and has 2 kids.</p>
              <p>also, does she know you exist? if not, it'll be difficult to kickstart anything</p>

              <p>if u din dare to approach her and talk to her, how do u know what her personality is like? and how did u become her friend on friendster in the first place? :s</p>

              <p>Your words strike me hard.</p>
              <p>I've once read a book written by a monk. It mentioned that sometimes, people don't really love the person they thought they were in loved with. They are just attached to the feeling of 'high' related to being 'in love' and excitment when they are with that person, or thinking about them.</p>
              <p>If you really 'love' someone, you need not be with that person. You'll love that person unconditionally and truly want that person to be happy, even if they are not with you and happy in a relationship with your best friend</p>
              <p>I've actually read it before, but I've failed to apply it to my own thinking.</p>
              <p>There's no way I can sincerely be attracted to someone whose personality I don't even know.</p>
              <p>You are perhaps right. There are certain aspects of me that I should reflect on and work on changing. It's not that I can't let go, but it's that I'm secretly (to myself) refusing to.</p>
              <p>It's high time to end this once and for all after such long time.</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

                  her friendster profile. How can I help but not wonder anything?</p>
              <p>You may think I'm pervertic, a coward or just plain childish.
                  I'm actually stalking someone on friendster without daring to take
                  real physical action. Perhaps I am. But my social skills is not
                  that good in the first place, how can I possibly approach a
                  total stranger?</p>
              <p>It seems like she has broken up with her boyfriend recently. I
                  inferred that. So it kind of made me think of her all over again,
                  and wonder how she is doing now, if she is happy or what.</p>
              <p>After saying (or typing) all these, I rekon my obsession sounds
                  pervertic or psychotic.</p>
              <p>There's no particular question I want to ask or answers that I
                  want over here. Just felt an urge to spill out my feelings
                  somewhere.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I first met, and fell attracted to her 5 years ago, when I was in secondary two.</p>
              <p>We were just schoolmates. We know each other, but never actually talked. Nevertheless, her features and personality strike me as really attractive.</p>
              <p>However, as another self-pitying boy with inferior complex and no guts to speak of at that time, I did not approach her, get to be her friend and know her better.</p>
              <p>(I dared to share my feelings with few people in fear that the wrong words may spread around in school. So I wrote down my feelings on various online forums, including sgforums. What some people told me was that I was too young to know what love is, that it's just puppy love and I'll forget her soon. That I should concentrate on my studies</p>
              <p>I've not forgotten her. And I did reasonably well for my studies despite thinking of her.)</p>
              <p>And so, I tormented myself emotionally and mentally for two years before both of us graduated from secondary school. She went to poly and got a boyfriend soon afterwards. I went to JC.</p>
              <p>All these whiles, I've not met a single girl who is able to invoke the same feelings within me. I was not attracted to anyone else as much as I was attracted to her. She was the only one, and she did not even do anything.</p>
              <p>Since I don't really know her, she is probably not what I thought of her to be in the first place. But I can't stop thinking about her anyway.</p>
              <p>Even though we became total strangers, even though it's even more impossible now, I still think of her from time to time. Not as much as I was as an emo kid in secondary school of course. But I still think of her and wonder how she is doing, if she is happy, and if the present would be different had I had the courage back then to even take the first step approach her.</p>
              <p>A few months back, I ceased being friends with her on Friendster. I don't know if she deleted me or it's a problem with Friendster. I know Friendster recently had some problem with some account's friends, some people's friends count dropped drastically.</p>
              <p>But that problem is now solved. Most account's friends count are back to normal. And I'm still not friend with her and can't view her friendster profile. How can I help but not wonder anything?</p>
              <p>You may think I'm pervertic, a coward or just plain childish. I'm actually stalking someone on friendster without daring to take real physical action. Perhaps I am. But my social skills is not that good in the first place, how can I possibly approach a total stranger?</p>
              <p>It seems like she has broken up with her boyfriend recently. I inferred that. So it kind of made me think of her all over again, and wonder how she is doing now, if she is happy or what.</p>

              <p><br>Why don't you send her a message through friendster and ask her to add you back as a friend again?</p>
              <p>You can always add her to your msn using her friendster's email.</p>
              <p>Then come back here and we will try to help you if we can.</p>
