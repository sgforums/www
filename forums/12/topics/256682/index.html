If you confront him, he would just cook up another story of things like "I don't love her at all", or whatever.<br><br>And when he does that, most likely you would believe him, because you already like him.<br><br>But ask yourself, can this guy be trusted? If he becomes your boyfriend eventually, what makes you think that he would not do what he did to his ex, to you?<br><br>He is a predator. Do you want to be his sheep?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, like most of the people here already agree the true intentions of the guy. Question is do u condone such an action from a person that is attached already ?<br><br>He may drop u like a sack of potatoes once he gets his eyes fixed on another and  i would say that is his modus operandi.<br><br>I say .. stuff him..<br><br>Confronting him will just make him say all kinds of excuse. Maybe u can help him stop lying by not confronting him.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmm....i feel that you should be cautious of him....if he's attached and he can date you frequently instead of his gf....just picture this incident of you and him but with other girls (instead of you)....<br><br>I feel that he's playing around...and he's not being honest with you in the first place....its ok to stay as friends....but if he makes anymore move more than whats happening currently....its time to think if its worth keeping him as your friend?<br><br>Anyway...hoping that you will make a good decision out of this =)</div>
