See i already give u some slack due to my believe that u are relatively stress out. I believe your GF is in a worst situation then u psychologically. She has to bare 99% of the burden of unwanted pregnancy. Please show her more care and concern. Take good care of her health too. After the operation please keep a close eye on her for some do suffer from depression.<br>Seem u are so determined for abortion do it quick, i dont care if u need to borrow or beg to raise the money, for everyone passing minute will make parting for yr gf harder.</div>

The girl is still young and in university, if she should carry a baby, it might be a burden to her future. Both of them haven't even thought about marriage i persume? It may be simple just to give birth to a baby but who can ensure its future if both parties are not even committed. Do what you think its best for all parties, even if it means an abortion in this case. However it does not mean you hold no responsibilities towards your girlfriend after this incident.</div>
