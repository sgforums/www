            <div class='col-md body'>dont want to do then DONT DO. how the heII can they force you? physically drag you? i just always REFUSED all the way. all they can do is OPEN THEIR MOUTH to shout or try to waste your time further, by telling you to STAY BACK whenever. just REFUSE that too, then they can only OPEN THEIR MOUTH more.<br><br>i skipped all my cip, except once i went to go see ah pehs look retarded. at an old folks home, they told me to wash the chairs. i poured detergent on the chairs then smeared it with the cloth. then i let the ah pehs sit on the soapy chairs and get butt rash!<br><br>the cip after that i didnt go, and went out whole day n night as usual, the next day when the teacher asked me, some girl classmates said i got go.  the teacher said "are you sure he was there? i didnt see him". the girls said "yeah he was there! i saw him". i said nothin. the teacher looked disbelieving but at the end i got my hours in my report book <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why so stressed up over so trivial stuff? Like someone who mentioned earlier, there are more to come next time you go army or working life.<br><br>In the army, let's say you don't want to do whatever you are supposed to do, ganna extra (sounds familiar to school?). You also lan lan have to do. It's life lah! Just accept it. Next time you become a lao-jiao, then your kar-kia also like you, dun listen to instructions, purposely dun do the things you tell them, you also die. So dun look at things from your own perspective. There are things that happen when we need to accomodate to each other. You think the teachers so eng want to force you to do this meh? I think they also ganna from either the school management or board of directors or even MOE, to roll out the programmes to students. There are some things that are really beyond the control of certain people.</div>
