            <div class='col-md body'>ifish, I would encourage you to take the huge first difficult step and move on first. You see, at of this moment you are still in this endless circle of love like a dogfight including her and her bf. You can only see yourself and realised how silly things will really turn out in the future ONLY if you are out of that circle.<br><br>Unlike primatives, we humans have the unique ability to move on and out of our projected destiny....especially when it becomes endless or when it's heading towards a certain death....we can make a choice to step out or step back.<br><br>I would like to recommend you to listen to a song by Jay Chou. It's called Tui Hou (Step Back) and it's in his Still Fantasy album...track no.5. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The longer time you spent staying on, the deeper regret you would be feeling later.<br><br>To make it easier for you, don't you used to stay as close/closer friend towards her because you're worried about her and you somehow don't feel comfortable/safe seeing her alone? But right now she already got a bf, so your  task is completed and you don't really have any reasons left to stay on anymore. Instead, you are still hanging around and searching for another reason to stay on cos you're kinda attached to this routine mission of yours. I would encourage you to move on before the feeling of being left behind consumes you. Trust me, girls move on faster and cleaner than guys.<br><br>And it doesn't means you're leaving or ending the friendship with her, the friendship between you and her still stays. However, you know that this is probably a very bad time for you or her to pick up both your friendships towards each other....it does feels a little bit wrong, uncomfortable and awkwardness isn't it? You will know when you are ready to pick up the friendship again with her...after you've moved on and found someone else to supercede her in you heart.<br><br>Be strong and move on, you'll be stronger everyday unless you chose to feel weaker everyday. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ifish:</div><div class="quote_body">She have always treated me as a close friend.. Thats what I think. I'm the one who wanted to bring the r/s to the next level..<br><br>and about the hearing part, it's not anything new coming from her.. her current bf was actually from her pass r/s. They broke up for 1 year and now patch again. Of course I was hurt time and again hearing about their happy times but on another hand, I'm just glad she's happy.<br><br>I know the closeness will never be the same.. seeing that last time we use to msg everyday about everything and now, nothing at all. Not even a simple hi message.<br><br>and i agree with you about being used. I feel that way but dont know why i never stop doing them.</div></blockquote></div>

Of course at first I was sad all that la.. considering I have jio her for quite a long period of time all that.<br><br>She's one of my closer classmates around and because she got attached recently, I tend to move away from her a little bit.<br><br>But after yesterday conversation with her on msn, I realised that after the "seperation", both of us do really miss each other company. She still treats me as a good friend.<br><br>My qn is..<br><br>Is it ok for us to be as close as last time? Just as good friends? What I worry is that the gal bf will mind. Considering that he knows I use to like her.<br><br>Btw, me and the guy only meet once or twice. Doubt we recognize each other if we meet on the streets. So, cat say much about the guy character.</div></blockquote>Cross the bridge when you come to it... I don't think it will lead to vast consequences if you continue to be friendly with her... stop when it becomes unbearable, but cross that bridge when you come to it..... otherwise.. life is for living, not worrying...</div>
