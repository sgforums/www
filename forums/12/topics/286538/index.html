            <div class='col-md body'>Hello ifish, actually it is still possible to be friends with her. But it depends if she still want you to be her close friend like before. Naturally a girl will miss her close friend like yourself when she's attached...but that's is if both of you are really close friends before she's attached.<br><br>Another thing is, are you mentally prepared to accept and  listen to all her happy stories with her bf? I'm sure you won't mind their troubles and would even be more keen to give her your attention if you know that their relationship are on the rocks! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>She probably will not be able to spend time with you as a close friend like before and eventually you will realised that all she wanted was for you to be always there and around for her. IT doesn't matter to her a bit if she's not spending enough friendship time with you cos she's not going to spend a single bit of her time and emotion calculating the time you think she should at least spent with you.<br><br>If you can and is willing to accept all this, then go ahead reclaimed back your friendship with her. I feel that it's better to let you know about it before you realised the truth in the future and things can turn sour when you finally accept the fact that you're not that important to her and you have always been used by her. Being used is probably one of the worst things that can happened to a guy and I know that most girls can claim guilty on that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good Luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ifish:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi<br><br>Recently, my crush, got attached.

But it depends if she still want you to be her close friend like before. Naturally a girl will miss her close friend like yourself when she's attached...but that's is if both of you are really close friends before she's attached.<br><br>Another thing is, are you mentally prepared to accept and  listen to all her happy stories with her bf? I'm sure you won't mind their troubles and would even be more keen to give her your attention if you know that their relationship are on the rocks! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>She probably will not be able to spend time with you as a close friend like before and eventually you will realised that all she wanted was for you to be always there and around for her. IT doesn't matter to her a bit if she's not spending enough friendship time with you cos she's not going to spend a single bit of her time and emotion calculating the time you think she should at least spent with you.<br><br>If you can and is willing to accept all this, then go ahead reclaimed back your friendship with her. I feel that it's better to let you know about it before you realised the truth in the future and things can turn sour when you finally accept the fact that you're not that important to her and you have always been used by her. Being used is probably one of the worst things that can happened to a guy and I know that most girls can claim guilty on that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good Luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br></div></blockquote>She have always treated me as a close friend.. Thats what I think. I'm the one who wanted to bring the r/s to the next level..<br><br>and about the hearing part, it's not anything new coming from her.. her current bf was actually from her pass r/s. They broke up for 1 year and now patch again. Of course I was hurt time and again hearing about their happy times but on another hand, I'm just glad she's happy.<br><br>I know the closeness will never be the same.. seeing that last time we use to msg everyday about everything and now, nothing at all. Not even a simple hi message.<br><br>and i agree with you about being used. I feel that way but dont know why i never stop doing them.</div>

If she likes you, who cares about the boyfriend?<br><br>I think you just forget her k? Don't waste your time and life on her.<br><br>The only thing she can help is intro more female friends to you. That's it.<br><br>For all the talk about missing each other, deep down you have a crush for her but what about her? Does she feel the same way for you? If no, I suggest you don't waste your time.<br><br>If she truly likes you, why can't she dump her boyfriend and be with you?<br><br>There are tons of girls that are worth looking instead of wasting your time on others who don't dig you except only for companionship.<br><br>If friendship is only what you are looking for, then go ahead.<br><br>doko</div>

It may sound stupid BUT if you really were to think about it, you will get what I mean.<br><br>When facing problems regarding relationships, friendships or whatever you can name it, NEVER EVER consult people in SGF. Most of them are keyboard warriors who have never really been into a really solid relationship. Just take the guy below your thread as example. You think he's fit to give advices? I've never met him, but i'm sure he's a LOL person in reality. Shy, small built etc.<br><br>k I wont LOLOLOL @ YOU this time round because this has got to my most constructive post LOLOLOL</div>
