Especially now that your relationship is so unstable and you're still rather young.... Who knows you might really need your friends one day...?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Are you sure the relationship is confirmed over? Refusing to respond may not necessarily mean he wants to break up with you. He may just be angry and does not want to say anything he may regret later when he's still "hot" in the head.<br><br>Call him, meet him, talk to him. If he refuses, give him some time to cool down first and then try again. Sinking yourself into this state of self-pity is not going to solve any problems.</div>
