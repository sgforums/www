When he talks to other girls, he expects you to trust that those are just normal friends.<br><br>No one is in an absolute correct position. So just sit down and sort things out nicely with each other. If you can't believe him, don't expect him to believe you. If you can't give up all those guy friends for him, then don't expect him to give up all those female friends for you.<br><br>Give and take.

            <div class='col-md body'>once a relationship becomes too exclusive and alienates you from your friends, i feel you ought to examine it carefully for such alienation and exclusion serve to stagnate you.<br><br>and who says a BOYfriend should have the right to control you or make u feel inhibited?<br>has he given a promise/oath to marry you?<br><br>why make needless and senseless sacrifices just for the rush of feelings/emotion in a relationship<br><br>i know it sounds harsh... but somehow i feel compelled to give advise for i have the feeling you are still rather young.<br><br>one step perhaps is to be completely honest to him about your needs. people all needs friends. friends are there to help you whenever the boyfriend is not around. its not like the boyfriend will be there for you no matter what?<br><br>just draw and DO DRAW the line where an investment of emotion have to be made for that friend. in a way, you will gain his trust....<br><br>and open both your perspective on what's the right thing to do.<br><br>and your friends will appreciate your maturity and honesty too. try to include your boyfriend into your conversations too. it'll make them know where you stand... that's as a friend and classmate</div>

You often quarrel over this matter. So how can you maintain your relationship with your guy friends and at the same time maintain a loving relationship with him?<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I read the other posts and I guess I'll try not to repeat any advices that were mentioned above.</span><br><br>You mentioned that that those guy friends in your class are close to you. Do they know the plight that you're going through with your boyfriend? This is my first suggestion to you, and i hope this will be the most useful and successful solution to your problem.<br><br>Let your close guy friends know what you are going through with your bf. Ask them to help you by being more friendly to your bf, by smiling and exchanging greetings. This will create a mutual understanding btw your bf n them, that "hey, we're really good friends of ur gf, we have no intention of pulling her away from you". Create that sense of trust btw ur bf n ur friends so that he will feel more comfortable when you hang around with them.<br><br>Then, on your part, do not hide anything between you and your bf about your close guy friends. Let him know how you really feel about those friends of yours, not literally though. Share those amusing moments, jokes and situations with your close guy friends with him. Let him know that you find them very fun to mingle with, clearly indicate to him that there are no feelings btw u n them, and why wont those feeling develop (eg, He's too short for me, i dont like the mole on his face, he looks dumb when he eats).<br><br>Consider this solution. If you have doubts that it might work, let me know, and I'll work another one for you. Similarly, if you need more elaborations, let me know as well. *Cheers*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

Take care of your boy's ego and how your friends may convey the 'message'. If done it the wrong way, your bf might feel upset with you for 'complaining' to your friends about his possessiveness.</div>

But we cant deny the fact that many couples are experiencing this problem of trust as well, even if they are much older.<br><br>That is why it is important for either the guy or the gal to have initiative and find a way to solve their trust issue.<br><br>And I've realised that nowadays younger kids are always boasting off the number of ex-gfs/ex-bfs they have. Moreover, it is quite common for a sec sch gal to have more than 30 r/s during their sch days. Hope you're not one of them. What I really find dumb, is that they never learn from their experiences. They just want to accumulate those numbers, for the sake of it.<br></div>
