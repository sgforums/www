            <div class='col-md body'>Originally posted by sherry anne:<br><strong>Im 20 yrs old this year and i know i cant say i know what is love.a year ago when i was still workin i met this guy who is 15 yrs my senior.He happens to be a business partner of my elder brother.He started out bein very sweet to me and callin me daily to talk to me about almost jus everythin under the sun.We did had lots of fun talkin cos our characters could click pretty well.but i knew he was married and i told him i cannot possibly think of me more than a friend.I felt i was doin the right thing.Months later, we are still talkin on the phone and he still visits me at work becos he says he likes me and he misses me very much.<br><br>Then he told me he's a divorced man not married.and if i wil still be willin to take him.Of cos at that point of time,i like him alot.much more than i probably should i guess.So i agreed to be with him.then a month into the relationship i started hearin bout him bein still married.i fell out with my elder brother cos of him and we dont talk to each other anymore now..cos my elder bro is still mad at me for bein with him.He cannot forgive me.even my parents.my friends.<br><br>my boyfriend then told me that he wasnt exactly divorced.he was jus seperated from his wife.he told me he didnt marry her cos he loved her.he cared for her yes but from the first year they were together..he'd been askin for a divorce but she wouldnt agree.so they lived apart.i believed him and continued being with him.i didnt mind.later on,he told me he wants to break off with me cos he doesnt want to hurt me anymore.he thinks its unfair to me and that he doesnt want me to waste my time on him anymore.he says that its better that i find someone else who can promise me what he cannot.he then said the reason why he didnt pursue the matter on the divorce is cos he knew he didnt have the courage to.he doesnt know how to face the family on both sides if he really does that.he doesnt wish to go thru questionings and those guilt they may inflict on him.i told him i dun care if he divorced cos by then i've already fallen very much in love with him.i m willin to go thru anything.i dun mind.<br><br>his attitude towards me have been up and down these two weeks.sometimes he is very passionate and makes me feel as if he really is willin to do anythin for me.sometimes he says very mean thing to me and it hurts me alot.i really hurt a lot when he says those things.i dun blame him i jus cannot help feelin the hurt.im confused by his moods.he doesnt have a new girl frend that i know cos wherever he is even if he';s overseas he willl call me and constantly messages me all thru the day to tell me what he's doin.i do trust him with what he tells me cos i really have thrown in all i have for this relationship.im only worried if he still loves me or if he has already grown tired of this relationship cos of the stress and burdens it brings.<br><br>he is very busy with his business and he's also a performer so he hardly has time for me.thou wherever he goes and whatever he does he will call me and tells me about it,i really have very little information bout him.<br><br>i have asked bout his home number before but he doesnt wish to reveal.he thinks there's no need to.i didnt push it.i jus let it go cos i dun like to force information out of people.m i very stupid?mayb i should have asked more.the only way i can find him is thru his mobile.that's all.i duno where he stays.only the area not the real address.why so?is he lyin to me?i trust him but can i?<br><br>now..more months into our relationship and every two days he would say he wants to break up.i dun understand thou i never once blame or got mad at him.i jus asked him why.but usually in the end..we didnt end up breakin off.he said he loves me very much and he's worried ill leave him for another better guy one day.point is i understand when he said he's riskin everythin on the line to love me.cos his business is indeed takin a very bad turn since i've been with him.his business partners dun agree on our relationship.i keep reassurin him but sometimes i dun know how to handle the sudden emotions outburst of his moods tellin him he cant take the stress he wants out.i dun understand and i duno how to handle it.<br><br>he cried when i said i cant take it anymore and i wanna go.that was the one and only time i initate a break up but he begged me not to go and cried.he even brought up all the promises i said to him before.i didnt leave him then.and i never brought up that subject ever again.he told me he cannot lose me.he says he doesnt mean to be moody and stressed up and initates break ups all the time.he jus wans my assurance when ever i pacify him and tell him i love him and that i dun wanna break off.he felt reassured.<br><br>im only 20.im willin to put up with alot of things for him but i just wan to be sure that he loves me and he means it.i dun wanna love someone who doesnt love me.i dun mind money i can feed myself.i just feel very bogged down by unknowns.i duno why despite how much i love him,he still wans to break off every once in a while and i must cry so much each time for him to see that in fact he cant bear to leave me either.his wife told him in the face that she will stab him and me to death if she ever sees us together.i have no one to turn to or talk to about this becos they;ve all fallen out with me over him.i have no one else left.and what hurts me most is that he keeps sayin he wans out once in a while.but he says he loves me.he says he has to leave me cos he doesnt wan to hurt me.he doesnt wan me to go thru anytin for him.he is afraid to be hurt should i leave him someday.what should i say to him?what can i do?<br><br>thou ive been with him so long,he has never disrespected me.i dun sleep with him.and he doesnt mind.he doesnt force nor ask nor gets angry over it.he says he wil only do it to me when he can marry me and give me a family.<br><br>there're guys who like me.but i dun go out nor talk to them.i stay home and quit my job cos he feels insecure.i dun go out with frends cos he worries i might run off with another guy.i have done all i could think of.just today..he wants to leave me again cos of a guy.that guy works somewhere near the mall next to my place.he keeps followin me around and leavin things at my doorstep.buyin me breakfast lunches and dinners leavin them outside.he even sends me free mobiles.i didnt take them but my boyfriend hates it and blames me for it.i have tried my best.i feel so bad.i don't know how to please him.Can u help me?now my brother is warnin me he'll beat him up if i still dun leave him.the people i know hates him and he hates them.im stuck in between tryin to pacify both sides.i m not workin now and i have got bills to pay but he doesnt like me workin in places where guys can get to talk or know me.i understand where he's comin from but i really need someone to help me.i love him.and thou he wants to support me.i dun wan to take his money.i dun wan his family to think im with him cos he's flithy rich.they think im a 20yr old girl just hankerin after his money.<br><br>thank you for ur time.i appreciate u even readin this.my name is ashley.<br><br>ashley<br></strong></div>

And his age and experience... Probably much more superior than you.... And so many things that you don't know about him.. Despite that, the form of 'restriction' he's trying to conform to you... I mean... How can you don't work just because he don't want you to run away with other guys? Can he prevent you from seeing other guys from the rest of your life...? Now, that is DEFINITELY NOT healthy....<br><br>Why don't you just try to find a job for now and see how things develop on from there between you and him...?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wow, it seems that you've been through a lot.<br><br>I'm 20 years old as well, and i don't know what's love either. So i don't say i have loved anyone before.<br><br>How to start?<br><br>You have a boyfriend who's 15 years your senior, currently married though separated, and is so busy that he rarely has time for you. He's also an insecure person who's so scared of leaving you, that he forbids you to work, and to be in contact with any males.<br><br>When he found out about the guy who leaves stuff at your doorstep, he flares up and blames <strong>You</strong> for it.<br><br>He keeps in contact with you as and when he cans, and trys to meet you up whenever he's free.<br><br>However, he would initiate break-ups ever so often, and cause you deep hurt. When you initiated a break-up saying you can't take it anymore, he cries and pours out all his sweet words he has been saying all the while.<br><br>His wife has also threatened the both of you should she see you two together.<br><br>You have stopped working, and probably cut off all contact with your friends either, because you said you're alone.<br><br>Day in and day out, all you're living for is his messages and phone calls. Your stack of bills slowly pile up, and you cannot pay them because you refuse to take his money, and also because you're not working.<br><br>That kind of sums it up right?<br><br>Now lets begin..<br><br>____________________________________________________________<br><br>Ashley, <span style="color: red;">WAKE UP!</span><br><br>Can't you see what you're doing..?<br>You've given up your ENTIRE life, your friends, your jobs, your relationship with Everyone.<br>And for what..?<br><br>For a relationship that has been persecuted by everyone. A rocky relationship in which both sides are suffering. One that has no winners.<br><br>As i said, i don't know a lot about love, but i don't think Love = Suffering + Not having a life!<br>No, its definately not that. I think you got your defination of Love all wrong.<br><br>You want to leave him, but you couldn't. Why..?<br>1) You still like him alot, and think about the good things he has done for you.<br>2) Your entire life is messed up, and you're afraid to let him go. Because he is the Only familiar thing in your life. Even if he causes you pain, you know that he'll be there.<br><br>But Ashley, BEcause he is there, that is why your whole life has gone down the drain! You're not living for anything else anymore. You're living only for HIM!<br><br>And is he worth it.? Ask yourself. Is he worth it?<br><br>Is he worth it, for you to stay at home all the time, leaving you all alone in this world, forbidding you to make any male friends, forbidding any contact with males at all.<br><br>Is he worth it, for you to cry tears and tears for him, when all he does is to treat you mean? Yes, he treats you well sometimes, but do you not admit he hurts you... alot?<br><br>Ashley, you're 20. Twenty years old. You should be having the time of your life, enjoying all the beauty that Mother Earth gave us, living a carefree life before you start work.<br><br>But at this rate, i don't know where you will be in 5 years time, 10 years time.<br>Probably still living this life, probably not. But are you going to endure another 10 years of pain? Can you even possibly marry a man, 10 years from now, who has dealt you so much pain, robbed you of everything Life has to offer?<br><br>Do you not think that you have dedicated enough of your time to him?<br><br>It is time to make a decision in this lose-lose relationship.<br><br>What will it be?<br></div>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>To add on,<br><br>You should stop seeing him for a while. Yes, it will be very painful, but it'll do more good than bad.<br><br>If you want, ask him to see you when he has gotton over that horrible insecurity of his, and when he is divorced for real(not that it really matters.)<br><br>Find a job, start a new life anew. Start paying your bills, and start Living again.<br><br>Be kind to yourself Ashley, stop inflicting more pain and suffering upon yourself, and start to Love yourself.<br><br>Harsh advice, but i hope that helps.~<br>Aaron</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ashely, it seems to me that you were very confused and helpless when you were typing your story.<br><br>You have lost your freedom.  Do you want to lose your kins, your frens, your dreams also?<br><br>He's so much older than you.  Is this love?  Just like an owner keeping his pet in a cage.  He forbids you to go out, blame it on you when you have suitors.<br><br>You are still young.  I would advise you to leave him and get your own life.  The way he threatens to break up with you, the pressure he has been giving you..and the pressure given by your family..will be too much for you to take.  One day, you might just go bersek.<br><br>You have to think for yourself.  Is this what you want?  How much is he willing to provide for you?  I mean marry you and give you a status.  He is rich, no problem finding other girls.  But what about you?  he dun even give you his home number.  You dun know where he lives.  Can you trust him?  Who knows?  Maybe he is still living with his wife and keeping you as a mistress.<br><br>Wake up from your senses, dun be blinded by your so called LOVE..you may love him too much, but what about him?  You have to really think for yourself..dun let him ruin your future.<br><br>If you dun have your kins, no frens, and he leaves you..how are you going to get on with life?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Read my comments in blue...<br><strong>Originally posted by sherry anne:<br>Then he told me he's a divorced man not married.and if i wil still be willin to take him.Of cos at that point of time,i like him alot.much more than i probably should i guess.So i agreed to be with him.then a month into the relationship i started hearin bout him bein still married.i fell out with my elder brother cos of him and we dont talk to each other anymore now..cos my elder bro is still mad at me for bein with him.He cannot forgive me.even my parents.my friends.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">You have your reasons for being in this relationship ie you love him.<br>But your family members also have valid reasons to go against it.  I don't know about your relation with your family.  But what if they are right about this.  If your boyfriend has an upright character, regardless of what's going on with his life (his supposedly seperation or divorce), your family will still give you the blessings.  But in this case, they are not.  Why?  Could it be his character is questionable???</span><br><br>my boyfriend then told me that he wasnt exactly divorced.he was jus seperated from his wife.he told me he didnt marry her cos he loved her.he cared for her yes but from the first year they were together..he'd been askin for a divorce but she wouldnt agree.so they lived apart.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">"Doesn't love the wife.  Seperated from the wife, but still staying together"....<br>Trust me.  Your story is not new and your boyfriend's trick is quite old.  The next time he initiates a breakup, just say yes.  This way, he will not have anymore chance to say "breakup" with you and you will not get hurt this way anymore.  </span><br><br>his attitude towards me have been up and down these two weeks.sometimes he is very passionate and makes me feel as if he really is willin to do anythin for me.sometimes he says very mean thing to me and it hurts me alot.i really hurt a lot when he says those things.i dun blame him i jus cannot help feelin the hurt.im confused by his moods.he doesnt have a new girl frend that i know cos wherever he is even if he';s overseas he willl call me and constantly messages me all thru the day to tell me what he's doin.i do trust him with what he tells me cos i really have thrown in all i have for this relationship.im only worried if he still loves me or if he has already grown tired of this relationship cos of the stress and burdens it brings.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Has it ever come across to you that his up and down attitude indicates that he doesn't like you as much as when you first started?  I know this hurts.  But it's true.  I don't see any love on his part in this part of the story.<br><br>He's in overseas and he calls you to tell you what he's doing.  Have you ever thought that he could be meeting another girl after he put down the phone?  Or worse still, one hand holding the phone, and the other hand holding a girl's hand.  I am telling you this because IT IS POSSIBLE.</span><br><br>i have asked bout his home number before but he doesnt wish to reveal.he thinks there's no need to.i didnt push it.i jus let it go cos i dun like to force information out of people.m i very stupid?mayb i should have asked more.the only way i can find him is thru his mobile.that's all.i duno where he stays.only the area not the real address.why so?is he lyin to me?i trust him but can i?<br><br><span style="color: blue;">No, you can't trust him.  If he wants to get rid of you, he can just change his mobile number.  That's simple!  </span><br><br>now..more months into our relationship and every two days he would say he wants to break up.i dun understand thou i never once blame or got mad at him.<br><span style="color: blue;">That's good.  Since he initiates breakup so often, it's a lot easier for you to break away from this trap.  </span><br><br>he cried when i said i cant take it anymore<br><br><span style="color: Blue;">The next time he cries, turn away from him.  Don't look at him.  </span><br><br>im only 20.im willin to put up with alot of things for him but i just wan to be sure that he loves me and he means it.i dun wanna love someone who doesnt love me.i dun mind money i can feed myself.i just feel very bogged down by unknowns.i duno why despite how much i love him,he still wans to break off every once in a while and i must cry so much each time for him to see that in fact he cant bear to leave me either.his wife told him in the face that she will stab him and me to death if she ever sees us together.i have no one to turn to or talk to about this becos they;ve all fallen out with me over him.i have no one else left.and what hurts me most is that he keeps sayin he wans out once in a while.but he says he loves me.he says he has to leave me cos he doesnt wan to hurt me.he doesnt wan me to go thru anytin for him.he is afraid to be hurt should i leave him someday.what should i say to him?what can i do?<br><br>You are only 20.  But what if 20 years later, he's still not divorced and you're still waiting for him and having to put up with his "initiating of breaking up" every two days.  By then you'll be 40.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">The truth is.... I have known a number of woman who started their relationships at your age.  And they are now in late 30s or 40.  And they are still waiting for the man to divorce the wife and marry them.  Each of them has a similar story as you.  And the saddest thing is... after 15 to 20 years in the relationship, they are still telling the same story like yours!  15 to 20 years is a long enough time to raise a kid and have a happy family.  Think about it.<br><br>If you want to end up like these women,<br>If you want to come back here when you are 38 or 42 years old and tell us the same story that you have told us here,<br>go ahead and stay on in the relationship.  Nobody is going to stop you.  It is your life.</span><br><br>thou ive been with him so long,he has never disrespected me.i dun sleep with him.and he doesnt mind.he doesnt force nor ask nor gets angry over it.he says he wil only do it to me when he can marry me and give me a family.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">You don't sleep with him?  Good for you!  It should make it a lot easier for you to pull yourself out of the relationship.  It is not doing you good in any way AT ALL!  Mentally, emotionally and maybe physically (it's bad for health to feel sad, we all know that).  </span><br><br>there're guys who like me.but i dun go out nor talk to them.i stay home and quit my job cos he feels insecure.i dun go out with frends cos he worries i might run off with another guy.i have done all i could think of.just today..he wants to leave me again cos of a guy.that guy works somewhere near the mall next to my place.he keeps followin me around and leavin things at my doorstep.buyin me breakfast lunches and dinners leavin them outside.he even sends me free mobiles.i didnt take them but my boyfriend hates it and blames me for it.i have tried my best.i feel so bad.i don't know how to please him.Can u help me?now my brother is warnin me he'll beat him up if i still dun leave him.the people i know hates him and he hates them.im stuck in between tryin to pacify both sides.i m not workin now and i have got bills to pay but he doesnt like me workin in places where guys can get to talk or know me.i understand where he's comin from but i really need someone to help me.i love him.and thou he wants to support me.i dun wan to take his money.i dun wan his family to think im with him cos he's flithy rich.they think im a 20yr old girl just hankerin after his money.<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Other guys like you??  Well, maybe one of them is the right one, the man of your life, the one who will give you life happiness?  Why aren' t  you giving yourself or them a chance???  You have every right to find your own happiness.  You know... YOUR OWN HAPPINESS.  If you lose the opportunity or miss the boat, nobody is going to feel sorry for you.  Your boyfriend is not going to thank you for that. </span><br><br></strong></div>
