              <p>You mean Euthanasia.</p>
              <p>Currently, it is illegal to perform that in Singapore, so you will have to travel to Thailand ( The nearest country which allows it ) to do so.</p>
              <p>If you are single, the only possible loved ones in your life whom will be with you when you are old will be your parents. And if you were to die, who will look after them? That will be very unfilial of you, as you died on purpose and abadoned them.</p>
              <p>If you are healthy and well, even if you are old, you still could work or help out others. There are many instances of old people over 70 helping out others in organisations throughout Singapore.</p>
              <p>On the otherhand, if you are old and having bad health, you will probably end up in the old folks' home, and be supported by charity organisations. Well, in Singapore, you do not have a lot of options, and if you have no one else to support you, that is where you would end up in.</p>

              <p>If you have planned, then it should not be a burden to others. Example for me, I dun plan to get married or even in the near future. I bought myself health insurance that can sustain medical bills and i make sure my parents buy the health insurance as well. Next, I bought saving insurance that is enough to fit my death expenses. So...... As long as I work, not choosy abt salary.... go out regularly w my kakis...... Life passes beautifully for me.</p>

              <p>Basis of life is suffering.  <br>Lifestyle repeats itself-  sleep,eat,work. <br> (Of course, the occasional socialising with others; going out etc.)<br><br>Everything is superficial, unless one<strong> inspires great change</strong> in himself, or someone else.</p>
              <p>Hopefully, things turn out fine for every being who ever lives.<br>That is, living the life that he/she wants.</p>
              <p>Which person, in the world, would want to care for an old man? (unless one is a paid care-giver)  <br>Would you?  <br>Don't you have better things to do?  <br>Don't you want to spend time with your family, hobbies?  <br>Travel?  <br>Enjoying your own life?</p>

              <p>U feel alone - cos simply put u dont like your own company -  if u dont love yourself  -  how can another do so or even appreciate u -  cos u would eventually reject them - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">cos if u dont have it in you</span> = u wont see it another.</p>
              <p>As for being old - u are aging - either simply wasting away - or evolving, aging gracefully. </p>
              <p>No one is privy to what u do with others or ... and what u are all about, i m not asking u to tell me or anyone here ... i am merely guessing.</p>
              <p>I have merely skimmed the surface - do understand that all that u suffer is cos u are unaccepting of what u are , if u care  - do that for yourself first lar, the rest will fall into place.</p>

              <p>are u doing school project or what? but frankly speaking many pple didnt get themself prepare for a lonely old age. u need to get yourself prepare physically and psychologically according to your own financial status when u retire.</p>
              <p>old pple dont eat much and dont sleep much. train yourself to have a meat per day, u can also reduce your expenses this way where u have no more income and have to depend on your cpf saving. get a smaller flat as u no longer need to move around that much.</p>
              <p>when u are lonely, there are many stuff u can do at home. one of them u can consider is meditation. u can pass your time and make yourself psychologically healthy by doing that.</p>
              <p>practice yoga every morning to keep yourself physically healthy also another example.</p>
              <p>those thing like anjoying yourself or go travel u can forget about it if u cannot afford. avoid going to geylang to look for young china girl friend, they will drain your saving and make your life miseable.</p>
              <p>lastly when that time arrives, close your eyes, put on a smile and bid this world good bye...., u come to this world alone and will be leaving alone. there no such thing as i come to this world with my friends and will be leaving together with all of them.</p>

              <p>well. old and useless huh.</p>

              <p>and want to end it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>some how, to end own life take courage. but i suggest you keep your life for something better, maybe you will find something better to do and you enjoy it tomorrow. so live another day for tomorrow. and tomorrow live another day for the next.... like that you won't die, there's always hope u find something better to do tomorrow</p>
