            <div class='col-md body'>it's time to do something about it. I hope you are strong enough to walk away from this guy. He's already planning to marry his girlfriend? Then wat happens after he's married? you gonna continue to be with him? like a mistress?? No one wins in an affair. Not the man, the wife, the mistress, even the family. Don't be part of the tragedy. Be strong and walk away. That will put you on the road to recovery and to better things in life. Learn from this experience. Remember that what you sow is what you will reap. I've found out in many situations, what you dish out to people will somehow come back to you. That's what they call retribution.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>
