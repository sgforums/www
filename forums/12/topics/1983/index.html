This is case, what's really "liao", only he knows.<br>That's what my ex-gf did too. She wants to break off, said I treat her good, and blames herself but still want to break off. Dun ask me, I also have no idea until now y she wanted to break off. I thought by letting her go was a happiness for her, so be it.<br><br>------------------<br>--Appreciate what you have now and not what you don't--</div>
