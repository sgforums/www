            <div class='col-md body'>Look, if a guy likes you enough, he will make the move to let you know his feelings.<br><br>The fact that he is holding back and keeps looking for other girls means he is not interested enough. As simple as that.<br><br>I think we girls should just keep some dignity to ourselves and stop bothering ourselves thinking about this kinda guys who don't even have the courage to voice out their feelings. One day when they are interested enough, they will let you know by asking you out, etc. Until then, just treat him as a friend. Don't be too nice to him by running over to help him everytime he asks for help. Otherwise he will get used to your companionship and start seeing you as one of his male buddies instead.<br><br></div>

He is very popular with girls. But, he never makes the first move. He will come in and out of my life. When he starts appearing before me, I know for sure that he has broken up with his gf. When he starts disappearing from my life again, i know he has found himself a new gf again.<br><br>During the times that we spent together after his breakup, i asked him how come he is always meeting me instead of other girls. His reply to me was that he doesn't have close female frens. Hmm... Then, after intense period of meeting, he will distanced himself from me.<br><br>Puzzled by his behaviour, I asked him one day after he got himself another gf again, :"how come you never considered me to be your gf as we know each other so well?" His reply was: "Coz you never asked me!" He also mentioned that if he starts to fall in love with someone, he will try to control himself by distancing himself from her. Hmm...<br><br>So, there are some guys in this world, who actually are waiting for girls to make the first move.<br><br>If you really like him, and feel that he is the one for you, why dun you make the first move?
