OK, maybe let's not talk about whether there's friendship in the first place.<br>When we pigeon-holed someone as a colleague, neighbour, etc, our guard is naturally down due to familarity &amp; social patterns.<br><br>So, if they are behaving more than what they are supposed to be in their roles, take a step back. Manitain a wider barrier. (Which I think you are doing now)<br><br>Another thing that is common amoung the three guy is that they do not want to know you on a deeper level. They have in-turn pigeon-holed you as such and such based on their preception and stops there.<br><br>Furthermore you may not have corrected them on the spot when they start their funny business on you.<br><br>And base on this preception, you are :<br>1)Emotional Crutch<br>2)Flower Pot<br>3)Lamp Chop<br><br>I hate guy#2 more. They pretend to be buddies and touches the ladies all over. Cad.<br><br>Guy#3, just aviod meeting him totally. Nothing but sex on his mind.<br><br>Guy#1, still OK lah. Out of sight, out of mind. Just know what you want.<br><br>Do you want to change their preception? Are they worth it?<br>It's really up to you.<br></div>
