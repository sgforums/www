            <div class='col-md body'>There are 3 kinds of guys I encounter now which I m quite confused about.Need some advice on how I should deal with them.<br><br>Type 1-the ambigious frd:<br><br>sometimes friends. sometimes not. sometimes more than that.<br><br>He can be very sweet and do things like send me home or call me when he's overseas and stuff, sometimes the things he says and the way he acts makes it seem like we are somehow more than frds. but the thing is i can never really get hold of him. sometimes he can just disappear for weeks or a few months without any news and still thinks we are very close when he "resurfaces" again. what's really odd about this fellow is at times he makes me feel like i m his most treasured companion, at other times just regular not very close sort of friends and at other times still, not really friends at all.<br><br>On several occasions, he had told me that i m his best friend and how i wish it is true. the thing is, nvm whether we would end up dating or not,i really enjoy his companionship and is more than happy to be his best friend or good friend but the way he's so unpredictable torments me cos i dun know to react to him, i dun know wat to expect. i can't even expect what i can from a regular friend. what should i do the next time he appears again? i m getting sick of the numerous roller coaster rides he brought me through.<br><br>Type 2-the "buddy":<br><br>They are the sort I m girl buddy to, I either know or at least hear a lot abt their gfs and helps solve their girl woes.<br><br>It seemed perfectly fine to me.until i realise that most of the times they just use me to do things like fill the few hours waiting gap before they meet their gfs.one even asked me to accompany him to orchard and said that he's going to meet his gf after that. so i asked him "u just want me to accompany u there n then leave?" he smiled. wat is this? i m not his nanny, bodyguard or escort. it has happened more than a few times,the above example being the most explicit one. I dont think any frd deserve to be treated like that.<br><br>Though hanging out with them can b fun and i geninuely believed in the frdship we shared, these recurring instances are making me think twice abt it. do they really take me as a buddy? or just some 3rd class entertainment to pass time before they meet their princesses? one of them is quite touchy too, puts his arms around my shoulders, rests his head on my shoulder i thought buddy buddy it's ok but when he tried to hold my hand it's too much. didnt allow him to. what's he thinking? would he do smt like this if his gf is around?<br><br>Type 3- the dirty fellow?:<br><br>For the first month after we met he was nice,funny and would sms or call me almost everyday. though he made some dirty jokes at times i didnt really mind that. he made me so many promises and said he loved me but i didn't believe him. I m lucky i didn't.<br><br>The next 2 or 3 months,he reduced the frequency of contact by at least 75%. he now only smses me like once in a week and talk to me on msn occasionally. and it seems like sex is all that is in his mind now. yesterday after we exchanged a few smses he sent a msg that goes like this: i will grow harder and longer when u touch,want to try? i think he tried to imply smt the msg before this msg and when i didnt understand he seemed rather annoyed and said "do i look like i m kidding?"<br><br>And one thing odd abt him is that he said a few girls made him offers and wanted to have sex with him and he said he's not the kind of men who would accept offers. even if it doesn't involve money. I dun understand. If he wants sex so badly he should take those offers. why bother asking me for sexual requests when he knows i would say no? n it's not like he enjoys rejection cos everytime similar situations happen he'd b quite annoyed n cease contacting me for some time. he'd normally just be suggestive and not ask like this so i thought he was just kidding.<br><br>m i being too naive? is he just another dirty old man that i should steer clear of? it seems like majority of the guys i met just want to seek gratifications from me,sexual or otherwise. they just want excitement. they dun care abt me actually. having this kind of guys around just makes me feel more lonely as it has dimmed my hopes of finding friends who will ever want to understand me. m i plain unlucky? or there too much of them out there?<br><br>All Good mates out here,give me your take on the guys and my situation.Are these guys normal?What should i do?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">would appreciate if u use spacing after full-stop, and use paragraphs.  Very straining to my eyes when I read.<br><br>How do u treat ur guy frens?<br><br>It could be how you project yourself that gave them the wrong idea or watever.<br><br>Dun you know how to say NO to them?<br><br>For the first guy who gave u mixed signals, maybe you should just have a good talk with him over it.  Also, ask yourself, do you regard him as a friend or more than a fren?<br><br>For the second guy, I think he deserves a scolding.  Even if he is so comfortable with you, he should jolly well know that he is attached and know what he should not do.<br><br>For the third guy, cut off all contacts with him.  If he harass you again, tell him that you will report to police for sexual harassment.  </span></div>

I dont think any frd deserve to be treated like that.<br><br>Though hanging out with them can b fun and i geninuely believed in the frdship we shared, these recurring instances are making me think twice abt it. do they really take me as a buddy? or just some 3rd class entertainment to pass time before they meet their princesses? one of them is quite touchy too, puts his arms around my shoulders, rests his head on my shoulder i thought buddy buddy it's ok but when he tried to hold my hand it's too much. didnt allow him to. what's he thinking? would he do smt like this if his gf is around?<br><br>Type 3- the dirty fellow?:<br><br>For the first month after we met he was nice,funny and would sms or call me almost everyday. though he made some dirty jokes at times i didnt really mind that. he made me so many promises and said he loved me but i didn't believe him. I m lucky i didn't.<br><br>The next 2 or 3 months,he reduced the frequency of contact by at least 75%. he now only smses me like once in a week and talk to me on msn occasionally. and it seems like sex is all that is in his mind now. yesterday after we exchanged a few smses he sent a msg that goes like this: i will grow harder and longer when u touch,want to try? i think he tried to imply smt the msg before this msg and when i didnt understand he seemed rather annoyed and said "do i look like i m kidding?"<br><br>And one thing odd abt him is that he said a few girls made him offers and wanted to have sex with him and he said he's not the kind of men who would accept offers. even if it doesn't involve money. I dun understand. If he wants sex so badly he should take those offers. why bother asking me for sexual requests when he knows i would say no? n it's not like he enjoys rejection cos everytime similar situations happen he'd b quite annoyed n cease contacting me for some time. he'd normally just be suggestive and not ask like this so i thought he was just kidding.<br><br>m i being too naive? is he just another dirty old man that i should steer clear of? it seems like majority of the guys i met just want to seek gratifications from me,sexual or otherwise. they just want excitement. they dun care abt me actually. having this kind of guys around just makes me feel more lonely as it has dimmed my hopes of finding friends who will ever want to understand me. m i plain unlucky? or there too much of them out there?<br><br>All Good mates out here,give me your take on the guys and my situation.Are these guys normal?What should i do?</div></blockquote><span style="color: green;">i think i belong to the first one how?</span><br></div>

If it sounds alien to you then most prob we dont know each other ba. Anyway back to the topic, I feel that I'm like that to most gal frds. This sort of situation is most applicable to my female ex classmates and sch mates. This could be the reason why I have less than a handful of close female frens. After reading your descriptions of type1 frens, I got this very shou feeling. After abit of thinking, only then I realise that I'm like that. Yeah, I'm as shock as you are too.</div>
