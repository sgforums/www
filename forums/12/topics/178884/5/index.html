I doubt he seriously mean anything, else he won't text you so much rubbish.<br><br>The 2nd guy has clearly established to you that he's attached, so whatever things he does with you <strong>does not have</strong> any romantic intentions on you.<br><br>You seem to be roll-back girl for the first guy.
