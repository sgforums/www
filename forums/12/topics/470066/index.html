              <p>I believe this is not the right mindset I should have.. But I kinda cant stand my current family anymore.</p>
              <p>Too biased. (Any argument, my brothers are always right)</p>
              <p>Embarrassing. (They dun have very good mindset about my future MIL. The things she buys for my family, my family always hiam..) </p>
              <p>Now the way I leave no diff from renting a room from them like that.. </p>
              <p>PS. why is it always alright for them to compared us(kids) with another kids, but will always scold us if we compare them with other parents? [eg. since young, if i wanna get anything, she says go be other pple's kid luh] </p>

              <p>You are sorely mistaken if you think getting married is your escape route from your toxic family.</p>
              <p>First you need to acknowledge your family members are toxic, they simply are negative people and there is <strong>no way</strong> you can please them.</p>
              <p>They will always find something to be unhappy about no matter what you do, or what your in-laws do.</p>
              <p>The toxic behavior will eventually spill over into your marriage and ruin your marital life. Toxic family members are also very <strong>manipulative</strong>.</p>
              <p>Toxic and negative people do not like seeing other people live happy life... and they will pull you down to their unhappy level.</p>
              <p>Once you are aware, you need to shield yourself from their negativity. When you are married , you need to shield your husband and your in-laws from your family's negativity.</p>
              <p>Do not allow yourself to be victims of toxic people.</p>

              if you have found true happiness, then by all means get married, but don;t get married in order to escape from the current misery...it is like jumping from one pit fire to another...
              
              yes, sometimes you will find living together with your family members a chore especially when there are biases...this is human...

              <p>they might have been hurt throughoutly in the past, esp. TS's parents who passed it down to their son(TS's bros). they left no hope in this world. They are unable to pick themslves up setback after setback. They are WEAK, hence they wanna act tough.</p>
              <p>If u still care for your family, a lighter and gentle touch regarding their issues will help alot to release their negativity in them, but do beware that if they dun wanna be 'saved from their misery' , no amount of things u do can change them, ultimately, they still need to depend on themselves.</p>
              <p>If u decided to bo chup your family and get married, .....TBC</p>
