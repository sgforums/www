I hope sometime can give me some advice on how to live and cope with it.</div></blockquote>Sometime, we are crippled by our own dark past. Sometime we must learn to let go excessive baggage so that new things can come to us. I don't know what bad or ugly memories you have had that had affected you so badly, you gonna know that these memories are not real anymore. No point holding onto them and their influence on you. Sometime, time will heal your wound but it also really depends on whether do you allow it to happen? I know u might feel pain at time but understand that pain comes and goes. We move on.<br><br>Getting irritated over small thing could depict your helplessness and frustration in life. Have a little patience on yourself. Don't be too hard on yourself. You are still recovering from the pain that you have had. Control your temper when you feel irritation arising in you. You probably discover your environment will be a lot friendly when you don't aggravate this irritation of yours..<br><br>Take time off, change your new environment if you are not happy with it. See things from a different perspective. You are probably a lot more fortunate than others.<br><br>Some tips on getting yourself out of your comfort zone.<br>Build your confidence slowly by DOING things that you are afraid of socially. Join an interest group and slowly get yourself out of the shell. Join it with people that you already know will probably help you making there baby steps. Don't overly-analysis what others think of you or how you think of yourself.. it will just make you more neurotics.<br><br>I could suggest you seek a professional help if it gets any worse and when you can't cope with it. Seek help when you really need it.. Be wise.<br><br>Cheers.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My advice is " kill " the anxiety order. Always tell yourself that anxiety disorder is torturing you , you hate it , it is your enemy. You want to conquer it , you dont want it to overshadow you. You do want to be its slave. It is making you miserable , uncomfortable and you are sick of it. You are full of hatred for it. You swear at it whenever it makes you unwell. Use your mind to " kill " it.<br><br>Also , read up more of this problem , understand it and finally " cure " yourself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for all the advices. I have tried ways and means to overcome this problem but it just wun go away. The anxiety disorder seems to be in my blood. My chests a lot almost everyday thinking of unhappy things all the time although my life is not that bad.<br><br>I am a self employed with a stable income, caring gf and great family but i just find it hard to make myself feel happy. Sometimes really dun understand whats wrong with me. I still feel life is draggy and tough, cant sleep at night thinking of anything unhappy, ranging from childhood unhappiness or even a quarrel few days ago. It is like a loop, that keep playing all the time in my mind. It is not that i do not have happy moments in my life, just that my mind just keep focusing on the negatives things in life all the time without control.<br><br>Life should be reaching an exciting and happy stage as business is good and is contemplating marriage with the love of my life of 6 years but I feel negative and sad all the time. Sometimes i try to inflict physical pain on myself like knocking my head on the wall or biting myself really hard till it bleeds to overcome the chests pain, caused by anxiety, but it failed most of the time. Always feel breathless and depress. Haiz.................<br><br>Always wanted to seek professional help but always put it off cause of costs and afraid what other people may think of me. Maybe it's really time for me to seek professional help.<br></div>

Try to see for how many minutes you can stop your mind from thinking. And then try to extend the time. Do this whenever you catch your mind circulating bad memories.<br>Then later choose your thoughts. You can just as well think of your gf, or your parents, or something good. Practice.<br><br>Don't try to socialise.<br>Just be yourself. Attend functions, events, gatherings,parties, etc, just be there. Talk to those who talk to you. Listen and answer. Say what you can say, otherwise just answer questions, and contribute a bit more. Dont worry.<br><br>I attend alot of karaoke sessions with my wife, and I never sing.

Sometimes really dun understand whats wrong with me. I still feel life is draggy and tough, cant sleep at night thinking of anything unhappy, ranging from childhood unhappiness or even a quarrel few days ago. It is like a loop, that keep playing all the time in my mind. It is not that i do not have happy moments in my life, just that my mind just keep focusing on the negatives things in life all the time without control.<br><br>Life should be reaching an exciting and happy stage as business is good and is contemplating marriage with the love of my life of 6 years but I feel negative and sad all the time. Sometimes i try to inflict physical pain on myself like knocking my head on the wall or biting myself really hard till it bleeds to overcome the chests pain, caused by anxiety, but it failed most of the time. Always feel breathless and depress. Haiz.................<br><br>Always wanted to seek professional help but always put it off cause of costs and afraid what other people may think of me.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello,<br><br>I went through that before, I'm still in the process of recovery and I can tell you it's not easy -- I still get attacks every now and then, though less frequently.<br><br>You know, I believed that I was weak, helpless and well, damaged in every sense because of my inability to function like a "normal" person, because of the sheer number of attacks that I suffered from. I kept feeling that there was something wrong with me.<br><br>Coming from someone who has been there, you have you actively learn to love yourself, build up on that a step at a time, take an appreciative step back and look how far you've come since babyhood. Things like that. Kick those negative thoughts, but if they do linger, find an outlet. I used to write all those thoughts down in a diary when they repeated in my head, I wrote accounts of the emotionally abusive memories too. It helped, because after a while, you run out of things to write, and you realise, those problems are just ghosts from the past. Trust me, it takes a while before you get it all out of your system, but write whatever comes to mind, and when you're out of the danger zone, look back at your older entries and try to piece together what's bothering you. You'd find that most of the entries repeat, and you might observe repeating patterns of negativity.<br><br>Just identify the patterns and thoughts, and go about trying to solve them. Avoid hurtful situations if you can afford to, like if socialising stirs an attack, avoid extensive socialising. You are not obliged to entertain anyone if you don't feel like it, and sometimes a simple 'No' can make your day.<br><br>The idea is to break the cycles, and learn to appreciate yourself better.<br><br>Hey, it's not the end of the world. (: Sometimes, we get into these ruts when we didn't receive help earlier, or recognise that we're driving into a ditch. The road to recovery isn't easy, but if you've got support, love and determination, you'd make it.<br><br>I was referred to a counsellor once in sec school, it didn't help me much because I wasn't ready to receive any help. I got this far pretty much on my own, and with the help of my bf. Not saying that talking to a professional doesn't help, but make sure you genuinely want help before you go seeking it.<br><br>Take things a step at your time, I'm sure you'll bounce back.</div>

If I can do it, so can you!<br><br>Most importantly, learn to understand that not every outcome of things around you depends on you alone. If things screw up, sometimes, they are just beyond your control. Build up your self confidence. A lil' bo-chup attitude goes a long way. Tell yourself that whatever goes wrong can be fixed.<br><br>Always look and try to anticipate the future. If you forsee a problem coming, formulate plans how you are gonna tackle it. Once you've made your plans, quit thinking of the problem and worrying. Move on and focus on the present. Execute the plans you have already made only when the problem actually manifests itself.Enjoy what you have while you have......
