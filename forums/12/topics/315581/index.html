But it was really different today. I knew I had to muster up the courage to tell him again that I liked him and asked him to give me a chance. Instead of the usual rejecting by acting blur, he said, "I really like you but I have a phobia of something." Then I was already really sad because I am getting rejected again. I asked him what he said he doesn't know too! I really like him and I really wish we could be together, our friends said that we are very compatible to. I really need and like him and that like has already blossomed into a love. How can I pursue his heart?</p></div>

              <p>well, no offence here but most pple will say that they could manage thier time between studies &amp; r/s but seriously, I still think you should put your focus on your studies 1st then talk about r/s at a later stage..</p>
              <p>If he's willing to wait then I'm sure after your studies, he'll still be there waiting for you no matter what..</p>
