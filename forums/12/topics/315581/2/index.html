              <p>I am so confused. It is a very long story, I like this guy and
              he has been my classmate since primary school. He offered to walk
              me home today as we both study in Woodlands and we both live at
              Yishun. I already had a big crush on him since primary four just
              that when I told him he always rejected me. But it was really
              different today. I knew I had to muster up the courage to tell him
              again that I liked him and asked him to give me a chance. Instead
              of the usual rejecting by acting blur, he said, "I really like you
              but I have a phobia of something." Then I was already really sad
              because I am getting rejected again. I asked him what he said he
              doesn't know too! I really like him and I really wish we could be
              together, our friends said that we are very compatible to. I really
              need and like him and that like has already blossomed into a love.
              How can I pursue his heart?</p>

              <p>Sheong,</p>
              <p>At sec 1, do you think he is ready for a committed relationship ? I doubt it.</p>
              <p>I think it is best you just remain good friend and enjoy the companionship.</p>
              <p>I can tell you desperately wants to "Posses" him. You want to make him yours so no one else can touch him. A selfish thought, but love doesn't work this way.</p>
              <p>May I remind you that he is not a "thing" and he cannot "belong" to you. Not at this age, not at his current life phase.</p>
              <p>He already says he like you, that's really good enough. Don't push it.</p>
              <p>The more you try to pull him in, the faster he runs away.</p>

              <p><br>Ok lah...since he told u that he also likes you, then just maintain in this way 1st way which is alot better than rejecting you with a "i dun like you, actually"....</p>
              <p>Maybe during one of the journeys back to Yishun, you might wanna ask him again on what his phobia is.....</p>
              <p>You----must not have the attitude or mentality of demanding an answer from him though...(Maybe he's a mama's boy? Or he's a SHE? or he has a bf? )</p>
              <p>Got chance to be togather lah....but dun pin 100% hope...don't worry so much....just come out more often and study togather lor....</p>
              <p>/For those who kpkb so much about she's too young to know such things...nnbz...what makes you all think that at your ages, you all know about such things...</p>

              <p><br>Sheungjoy...this is a little weird but I was taking a bus from Yishun at around 4:30pm+++ and it stopped at the traffic light near GV. I was looking outside the bus window and I saw 2 students, a boy &amp; a girl walking slowly. Both are not talking and the girl appeared to be shy. While waiting for the light to turn green, he offered to carry your file or something and just grabbed it from you. both smiled. aww so sweet to observe this 2 kids :)</p>
              <p>I was wondering is that both of you??? haha</p>
              <p>and I wonder what is his "...a phobia of something". hmmm...I think i can use this as a title for a short film :D</p>

              <p>When TS mentioned she like that guy since pri 4, my first thought was 'wow, that's long'.</p>
              <p>That is, until she revealed she's just in...sec 1!!!</p>
              <p>My goodness...you should just focus on your studies first. No matter how much you think you like that guy, at your age you're still too young to know what true love is...not enough exposure to the world.</p>
              <p>When I pri 4 that time (19 this yr) I also go around childishly telling people 'I love this girl so much I'll do anything for her' and all that dramatic crap...but in a few years time you'll realise that even adults don't really understand what love, commitment and sacrifices are all about, much less a 13 year old kid.</p>
              <p>So...when the forumers here advice you to focus on your more important studies first, they are absolutely correct.</p>
