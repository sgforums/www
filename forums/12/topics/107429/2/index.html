No doubt about it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Genuine or not. Since things are already done and you know what you're doing won't be acceptable. Just understand that there'll be an amount of consequences which you might have to bear if things are to go wrong.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Leo Gal,<br><br>I can sympathize with ur situation. Having a spice in ur life can be exciting. However, not everything exciting or feels good is morally right. So you have to control urself and do what is right instead of doing what is exciting but wrong.<br><br>If u can follow the straight narrow boring path of righteousness, instead of the easier wide path of excitement and spice, then u should be alright. It might not be easy initially, it might be boring, it might be dull, but ultimately, this is what u want to do. Because if u dont, ur conscience bothers you, and you know deep down that you are actually unhappy and living a shallow life.<br><br>For now, stay away from your lover. Your lover is obviously a jerk. He knows you are married but still take advantage of you. Get another job. He is abusing his position as your boss to exert his stature and authority and take advantage of you. Tell ur lover u want to break off for good. Quickly resign and find another job. If u cannot find a good job, take a temp job first and continue looking for another job while doing the temp job. Cut off all contacts as soon as possible. Dont accept his calls, etc.<br><br>My other advice is, never ever confess to ur hubby. Never. Even if he forgives u, he will be deeply hurt and may never recover for the rest of his life. Just keep quiet and carry this secret with u till the grave. That is the best for everybody.<br><br>I wish u all the best.</div>
