Although you are not really in deep agony, the turmoil of gulit would likely to haunt you periodically.<br><br>You are confused.<br><br>Confused over what is happening.<br><br>Do not be mistaken over Love by your situation. Mentioned before; the thrills and different experience is what fuel the lust between the both of you. So what if you got a good husband and he got good gf? That may not be what you two are looking for, in between each phrase of our life (I have just ate my lunch, doesn't mean I cannot consume a pack of sushi 5 minutes later). This automatically reflect in the action and reaction in Love, which indirectly satisfy certain 'wants' or 'ungiven needs' that your psyche craved for. If you really think hard enough, it may not be so much about the action 'sex' by itself, more likely, it's the components that contributed to the action. (i.e. Thrill)<br><br>Love and Lust usually don't react to common logic, it boils down to the point where you still have to face with your bare heart and answer to the much-avoided ultimate question: <strong>is that what you are looking for</strong>? This incident will prick on you forever, unless you have made a sensible choice for yourself, in considering your current relationship over a unable-to-commit man. I believe the answer is rather simple, but will you be upholding your decision like stone?<br><br>Or would you prefer to stall until the day where the truth is thrown into the air uncontrollable? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>It's your call.<br><br>Cheers</div>
