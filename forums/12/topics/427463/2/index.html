              <p>i would agree wif nelstar tat it depends where u draw the line...if the line stops at the law, then it cannot be considered an affair unless an illegal marriage has occurred...but in the eyes of morality, its an open debate...personally i would consider it an affair because to me, in a marriage there are 2 parts...1) the form, 2) the essence</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the form is liken to the status...simply means tat both are legally married, and officially husband and wife...its a status legalised by law, being physically married...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>the essence is liken to the feelings and affections...simply means tat both are emotionally married, tat they are not in the marriage merely out of responsibility...the marriage is not driven by guilt, responsibility but rather by true love...true love in this case means sticking to 1 partner not just physically but emotionally...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i would conclude by saying tat the case TS cited is most probably a case of a marriage tat has the form but is losing its essence...once the essence is completely lost, holding on to the form will only cause both parties to be miseraby married...</p>

              <p>I just got a simple question for S</p>
              <p>What if J knows another gal call A, asked A out for dinner and they started from there. J grows to like A and keeps giving S excuses to spend some time with A.  J hates himself for that but he don't know how to stop it. J allows A to hug him.</p>
              <p>How would S feel?</p>
              <p>1) If S feels nothing and is happier with L then is time for the the D word.</p>
              <p>2) If S feels jealous about J, then is time to work things out with J and kicking L out of her life</p>
              <p>Always remember this</p>
              <p>if L can hug S when she is married, how would you know L is not have sex with B,C,D gals?</p>

              <p>Marriage is a man made process, it is about bringing both sex together and then, call for a celebration. The west god said, go produce yourself, he never said go get marry, or need to make whatever vows, the hindu never mention about marriage, their only said, offer to their brahim god and get togther to produce decendent, the muslim, just call for a celebration, and for them, more better, can marry more than 3 wivies, so what is marriage to them?? then the taoist and the confused confucius in the chinese said about house and home, the need to form a family and have decendent,  respect the elder, nothing about marriage. Man created an occasion, and oso because the commerical and businesses also want to make money, including the lawyers, counsellors and those doing bride and groom business. Peoples also wanted to celebrate here and there, whereby hotels and restuarant also can make money. So are the tour agencies and all those tour bus, agents etc etc, so marriage is a lucrative business, and who said there should be a honeymoon? It all man make ya</p>
