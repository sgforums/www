            <div class='col-md body'>I liked this girl for a long time already. I finally got her number so I SMSed her asking her out but, she didn't reply. I thought I allow things to settled down abit first so, I decided not to do anything in the meantime. However, I wanted to let her know I still liked her so, I sent her Good Night SMSes once everyweek.<br><br>In the beginning, she didn't bothered to reply those Good Night SMSes but, she does wish me back on special occasions such as Chinese New Year and Valentine's Day. Although rarely, she does sent me funny SMSes every now and then.<br><br>She seems to be replying to my Good Night SMSes more often these few weeks so, I thought I try something different. I send her stupid questions like "Sleep already?," "Raining?," etc. She only replies to some of them though.<br><br>Then, I finally picked up the courage to call her. However, she said she was on another phone so, I hunged up.<br><br>I haven't seen her for months but, I don't want to stop just when she is just starting to respond to me. I heard rumors that she is already attached but, I don't know how true that is, since her Updated Profile in Friendster still states Single and nobody seemed to know who her boyfriend is.<br><br>I know this doesn't applies to me, since I already know her for years but, how do you woo a stranger that you just met on the street or just tell me what should I do?</div>
