            <div class='col-md body'>Hello to those who sincerely lend a listening ear and give feekback........<br><br>Rather frustrated now, partially due to economy downfall which is affecting the whole world and Sg as well.<br><br>For example, I had a malaysian friend who had completed his education (malaysian degree) there, and sincerely wanna come Sg to work cos of better prospect but MORE importantly he had to get more money to support his younger siblings who are all studying so as to lighten his parent workload.<br><br>In order to help him, i had been sourcing ard for him as well for the past 2 mnths ......... but all to no avail. All companies now only looking for S'porean and PR, and those with experiences....... So, does that really mean that a malaysian with no experience is not possible to find a single job in this Sg now? He desperately need a job here .......<br><br>Yes yes, I myself know the market situation in Sg now, so I can't be grumbling much but its just a kind of way i vent my frustration. The feeling of wanna help but can't, and feeling so helpless is awful, 1st time in my life i ever realise. I know, there are so many pple, and s'porean are jobless outside now, and things like that etc etc. So its natural for company to employ locals. Nothing wrong abt this of cos but then, if all companies stay think this way, think my friend can ever forget abt coming........<br><br>Think my friend is gonna to suffer for a much longer time. Think chances are bigger when economy start picking up.<br><br>Sign~ so helpless.<br><br>------------------<br>nOthiNg iS ImpOsSibLE In tHiS wOrLd<br>EvEn tHe wOrD ImPoSsiBLe SaYs "i'M pOsSiBLe"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup, I understand and agree wif what all the feedback you pple say. Don't deny it.<br><br>Anyway, my friend manage to get a job here. At last, one company is willing to employ him, a small company. However, the bad news came again........<br><br>His application for work permit is rejected. His company intend to reapply again, claiming that they will get the work permit for sure. Though the company is confident, my friend can't help but feels and get kinda worried.<br><br>My qns is, does anyone have experience or come across this situation? I heard that Malaysian with a degree is not hard to get a permit but how come he can't get one. I mean, will there be any chances that he WILL NOT get the permit?

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe there is a quota on the number of permits a day. Maybe cause he doesn't have a lot of money, maybe cause his grades were not tt fantastic? Maybe some distant relative of his commit some crime and get black listed.. tons of reasons.. but well strange</div>
