              <p>Tell you what? You were so wrong on many levels. I wanted this to be closed but your post caught my attention because it was so funny. I started having a crush on him more than three years ago, mind you, but he didn't really notice my existence until recently when I got chance to join him in the same project and then spent some time alone with each other, so it's absolutely not his honesty that made me fall for him and it's pretty much that he didn't really find me sexually attractive back then, otherwise he had done something ages ago already. And he did tell me he likes me and asked me to be his gf before he asked me to have sex, mind you second time. But it's not difficult to figure out what the liking and asking to be gf were all about, I'm no longer some naive innocent girl. Again, I'm not going to explain why but it's not at all my guess, it's the fact and I had my way to have him admit it in the end. So it's me who was always direct and honest, not him.</p>
              <p>Also I wouldn't be turned off if a guy tells me immediately he finds me sexually attractive, my colleages do that all the time and I'd take it with a pinch of salt if I'm not interested. But I would find it hard to digest if a guy starts off with loads of lies, mind games and all before he says it. Then I wouldn't call it honesty.</p>
              <p>And ok, I don't act as a good girl, by this lable, I just wanted to say I have my morals to hold onto. Who doesn't have their 'bad' side? Didn't I say something about being naughty in the bedroom? Let a guy show me his love and respect, let me fall for him, then he might get an eye opener.</p>

              <p>Don't bother yourself with those guys TS. They don't think with the head upon their neck but the one down there! They measure their manhood by the numbers of girls they have bedded and can bed. Many guys who moan that good girls are conservative are either have no luck in finding a girl in between who makes them proud in front of family and friends yet has the power to witch them crazily in bed or got turned down by the girls which to them, is an insult ;). Some declare they don't want a virgin because virgins can't satisfy them in bed but deep inside secretly crave for one. Those guys are just selfish, they only care about their needs and desires, they never care the sh** out of yours, they aren't worth your time, girl. They may be happy now thinking they are the centre of the universe, but one day, when they look back at what they call victories, they will probably face a devastating consequence or suffer the pain of loneliness and question themselve what they are actually looking for in their love life. Those guys are pathetic.</p>
              <p>Of course being a sexual naughty guy isn't a bad thing though as long as he has the ability to control his animal side appropriately, as you said.</p>
              <p>I personally think you did the right thing by walking away from that guy, TS. If you are not into a nsa relationship, you just keep your doors shut like what you did and only open to the one who deserves what you have to offer ;)</p>

              <p>yes girls like TS are rare obviously. Don't want to sound harsh but I have damn pretty and smart female friends but they only go after money and similar things (girls share their tactics and "achievement" too lol). For them, jumping into bed with a rich guy is not a big deal as long as they can be showered with expensive gifts or later a luxury life if their plan of becoming gf or wife of the targeted guy is succesful (and those girls can be big cheaters too) but I believe there are guys who don't mind the girls' intentions as long as they can have what they want, often sex, or a pretty doll to escort them that they consider a boost to their ego lol. But honestly speaking, is it resistible if there is a good looking rich guy to open his expensive car for you, invite you to his luxury apartment for a drink? by then, sex is already out of question because the girl has already gone blind. But of course not every girl would do that. Girls who don't are definitely a gem, a keeper ;)).</p>
              <p>Like me, I can't tell if I can walk away from a Brad pitt looking guy if he opened his Lamborghini car for me and invited me to his castle even if he is a womanizer keke.</p>
              <p>But I think only insecure guys will need to use their looks, money, social position and all to attract girls. Real men are confident to have girls like them for who they really are. But again, sadly, chances for those real men also decrease because we have more materialistic girls these days.</p>

              <p>By reading your other posts, I'd dare to say you've suffered
              from some sort of emotional/psychological problem.</p>
              <p>Tell you what? You were so wrong on many levels. I wanted this
              to be closed but your post caught my attention because it was so
              funny. I started having a crush on him more than three years ago,
              mind you, but he didn't really notice my existence until recently
              when I got chance to join him in the same project and then spent
              some time alone with each other, so it's absolutely not his honesty
              that made me fall for him and it's pretty much that he didn't
              really find me sexually attractive back then, otherwise he had done
              something ages ago already. And he did tell me he likes me and
              asked me to be his gf before he asked me to have sex, mind you
              second time. But it's not difficult to figure out what the liking
              and asking to be gf were all about, I'm no longer some naive
              innocent girl. Again, I'm not going to explain why but it's not at
              all my guess, it's the fact and I had my way to have him admit it
              in the end. So it's me who was always direct and honest, not
              him.</p>
              <p>Also I wouldn't be turned off if a guy tells me immediately he
              finds me sexually attractive, my colleages do that all the time and
              I'd take it with a pinch of salt if I'm not interested. But I would
              find it hard to digest if a guy starts off with loads of lies, mind
              games and all before he says it. Then I wouldn't call it
              honesty.</p>
              <p>And ok, I don't act as a good girl, by this lable, I just wanted
              to say I have my morals to hold onto. Who doesn't have their 'bad'
              side? Didn't I say something about being naughty in the bedroom?
              Let a guy show me his love and respect, let me fall for him, then
              he might get an eye opener.</p>

              <p>if he's just a random guy i agree u should totally forget about him. but if u still can be friends so why not give him a second chance? i meant if he still holds onto u and wants to be with u then why not? unless he insists in a sexual rs then this man isn't worth it, don't buy into it. even a jerk if he really cares for u, he would think about what u want, not what he wants.</p>

              <p>Don't bother yourself with those guys TS. They don't think with
              the head upon their neck but the one down there! They measure their
              manhood by the numbers of girls they have bedded and can bed. Many
              guys who moan that good girls are conservative are either have no
              luck in finding a girl in between who makes them proud in front of
              family and friends yet has the power to witch them crazily in bed
              or got turned down by the girls which to them, is an insult ;).
              Some declare they don't want a virgin because virgins can't satisfy
              them in bed but deep inside secretly crave for one.</p>

              <p>hahahahah can't stop laughing at this. one of my frds play play guy married a girl she was still a virgin until their wedding. he was scared that she is a dead fish in bed but still decided to marry her nonethelss because he loves the girl but it turned out that she is even more horny than him once she is into it lol</p>
