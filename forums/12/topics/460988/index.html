              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>Just wonder, why do some guys have no respects for girls, play with their emotions and think it's easy to get into their pants by using mind games and some shitty tricks? I am not talking about some loose girls (no offense) but the opposite, the so-called 'good' girls? Don't get it wrong, a 'good' girl can become naughty in the bedroom and enjoy 'wild' fun but definitely only with someone she is in love with, who loves her, respects her and deserves her best of both worlds.</p>
              <p>I myself happened to have a huge crush on this guy. Though I could tell there was something wrong the very first time we hung out by his blatant looks at my sensitive body parts, his suggestive questions then texts etc but I initially gave him the benefit of the doubt that guys are basically horny creatures (pretty much almost) so I tried not to take it personally. However, I always kept myself on guard then finally walked away before it's too late when I compeletely realized his true crappy intention. Even if he ever had a little feeling for me, his inappropriate sexual urge and lack of respect say a lot about him. So I left it cool and didn't even reveal to him what I actually detected. Save myself the drama.</p>
              <p>I just have no respect for guys fooling around with such a shameful 'no sex no talk' rule. It's actually disgusting and heart breaking that a guy would leave the girl once he gets what he wants and has enough of it then starts to look elsewhere for new adventures. And I feel sad for girls who are fooled by those jerks.</p>
              <p>Hope that when a girl follows her heart, she doesn't fail to bring her brain along and don't be gullible.</p>
              <p>Hope we don't have too many bastards in Singapore.</p>

              <p>I can't share everything here, but I never felt that he cares for me/has feelings for me enough to make a further move. So, this --&gt;"even if he ever had a little feeing for me, his inappropriate sexual urge and lack of respect say a lot about him". If a guy truly respects a girl, he wouldn't ask to have sex with her when there is no certain mutual emotional connection, if not love.</p>
              <p>But anyway, as shared above, I am talking about this as a general matter, not that I wanted to blame him, believe me. I already moved on, I don't wish to look back and blame the past. On a side note, for some reasons, I still believe he is a good friend.</p>

              For him, asking for sex could just mean a normal hangout stuff to do. Just like us asking friends out for a drink or two.
              
              You can treat this as a normal invitation and decline him politely but still be his good friend. Be cool. Don't overreact. But you gotta protect yourself by not letting him take advantage of you.
              
              Alternatively, you can tell him off and put a full stop to this friendship. I believe he's used to getting cold answers if he's been doing this to other girls.

              <p>but sadly, I noticed the ones I treat well don't seem to like me as much as the ones I ignore and treat more poorly lol . my parents are rather mild, unlikely to kick anyone out with only clothes on their back. that might apply more to what your parents imparted.</p>
              <p>unless the other side's too dumb, I do always say. eveything can be negotiated. no need to argue.</p>

              <p>and the loves you more then you love the other side don't work for everyone. especially with girls these day. they're better off marrying someone of good character but they love more then the guy loving them more.</p>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>Just wonder, why do some guys have no respects for girls, play with their emotions and think it's easy to get into their pants by using mind games and some shitty tricks? I am not talking about some loose girls (no offense) but the opposite, the so-called 'good' girls? Don't get it wrong, a 'good' girl can become naughty in the bedroom and enjoy 'wild' fun but definitely only with someone she is in love with, who loves her, respects her and deserves her best of both worlds.</p>
              <p>I myself happened to have a huge crush on this guy. Though I could tell there was something wrong the very first time we hung out by his blatant looks at my sensitive body parts, his suggestive questions then texts etc but I initially gave him the benefit of the doubt that guys are basically horny creatures (pretty much almost) so I tried not to take it personally. However, I always kept myself on guard then finally walked away before it's too late when I compeletely realized his true crappy intention. Even if he ever had a little feeling for me, his inappropriate sexual urge and lack of respect say a lot about him. So I left it cool and didn't even reveal to him what I actually detected. Save myself the drama.</p>
              <p>I just have no respect for guys fooling around with such a shameful 'no sex no talk' rule. It's actually disgusting and heart breaking that a guy would leave the girl once he gets what he wants and has enough of it then starts to look elsewhere for new adventures. And I feel sad for girls who are fooled by those jerks.</p>
              <p>Hope that when a girl follows her heart, she doesn't fail to bring her brain along and don't be gullible.</p>
              <p>Hope we don't have too many bastards in Singapore.</p>

              <p>Firstly, most guys are horny as you said, they tend to think not with their brains sometimes infront of girls/ladies. The reason i believe why you are feeling bad/indignant about the way he sees or treated you, is because you both are into this with a different mentality or a different intended outcome. For him, he probably wanted another adventure but for you, you probably are looking if this could progress into a more in depth r/s. When there is a huge disparity in what both parties are looking for, things happen. It so happened that you have brains over emotion for if otherwise, that guy would have gotten his way.</p>
              <p>I believe ladies are sensitive creatures, i believe you knew long ago what his intentions are but basically, as per all girls i've came acrossed, they choose to take it at a lighter note and find "reasons" for it which in your situation "all guys are horny". Most ladies will choose to think only of the good side without really trying to see the real intent. Thats how things happen i believe.</p>
              <p>Anyway, such guys are everywhere, so the thing is how u handle/reject/not get taken in by them. Otherwise it is up to you whether you want to play their game and take whatever with a pinch of salt. If not, reject their advances and hold your line until you probably find someone who can satisfy you emotionally.</p>
              <p>Well, actually there's alot of logic behind why you somehow still feel that he is a good friend. But im so called not supposed to reveal it too much. You could pm me if you would like to know.</p>
              <p>Anyway since you've moved on. good luck take care all da best!</p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>Thank you all for the inputs.</p>
              <p>Actually I was not 
              hoping for an explanation specifically to my situation but still 
              appreciate your responses to that. I was cool enough to let it go on 
              good terms, so citing my personal experience may have made the thread 
              misleading. Let's put the story of the guy and me aside then :).</p>
              <p>So there I go again talking about jerks (not guys who act like jerks but actually ain't) and innocent girls.</p>
              <p>Guys
               are horny creatures, yes pretty well so. But let's distinguish between 
              one with self-control and one having no control/responsibility for their
               behavior; one who goes for promiscuous girls who are sexually available
               to get laid and one who targets at whoever girls out there, esp. 
              innocent girls and asks for sex in the name of love that never exists in
               the first place, leads her to believe that he cares about her without 
              actually caring about her. Most of girls aren't silly enough to fall for
               tacky pick-up lines. Many girls can easily see through jerks but some, 
              unfortunately, really can't hence become the jerks' victims both 
              emotionally and physically. So let's not suggest this type of naive girl
               to stay chill and turn the guy down if she is not into the game. She 
              simply doesn't see what is actually happening with her eyes closed.</p>
              <p>Don't
               get me wrong. I tend to look at pple from both sides, good and bad, 
              even often overlook their flaws. But let's say, a guy might have a lot 
              of appealing traits, great intellect, decent sense of humour, a 
              successful businessman, an amazing conversationalist, you name it, but 
              if he has no ability to display restraint/has no respect towards women, a
               man of no manner who seeks pleasure out of a woman's innocence and 
              misery, his devil side obviously overwhelms the good side of him. Well, 
              then he can still be a friend considering his possible good side, but 
              hardly a boyfriend, at least in my book. I say hardly, because there is 
              always exceptions.</p>
              <p>I actually have quite a number of 
              friends/acquaintances who can't seem to handle a sexless relationship. 
              They have flings behind their gf/bf's back (girls do that too, let's 
              face it) so I'm not unfamiliar with seeing this sort of thing. But 
              despite having reckoned it for quite a few years, I still just don't 
              have yet an anser that can explain thoroughly as to why some pple live 
              such an irresponsible/unhealthy life, if not so lack of morals.</p>
              <p>Well
               then, if a guy holds on to his fantasy that being a player is 
              attractive, and he would emotionally and/or physically abuse 
              some/countless number of girls to feel high, to get laid, at the end of 
              the day, he is just a plain loser. When a guy has self-respect and 
              respects his girl, wins her heart by his maturity, wisdom, love and 
              care, has power to build a loving and healthy relationship with her, 
              it's when he wins big, imo :)</p>
