              <p>Just wonder, why do some guys have no respects for girls, play
              with their emotions and think it's easy to get into their pants by
              using mind games and some shitty tricks?</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>The guys you
               were referring to, have only sex or at the very least some making out 
              time, as their goal. As such they will resort to any tactics to achieve 
              the goal. Mind games, playing the part of a caring, sensitive male, and 
              other 'tricks' are just some ways to hook the girl.</p>
              <p>Sex as <em>the </em>goal
               is likely to stem from the fact that guys have generally a higher sex 
              drive than ladies, i.e. they get horny fast and with more frequency.</p>
              <p>On
               your personal experience, you did the right thing for yourself by 
              walking away. You do not want a no-strings attached type of relationship
               with your crush, and he was looking for nothing more than a fling. Both
               your aims do not tally, but you are probably at the losing end if the 
              situation goes on further. If you still like him, you may try talking to
               him about his behaviour (his leering and sexually-fuelled messages) and
               how it makes you uncomfortable.</p>

              <p>I already pinpointed the self-control thingy. Having high libido
              shouldn't be used as an excuse to abnegate one's responsibility for
              their inappropriate/unhealthy/immoral attitude and behavior.</p>

              <p>Second this.</p>
              <p>Guys having extremely high sex drive with low or no self-control are often impulsive. They tend to cheat more than others due to the urge to seek variety in their sex life.</p>
              <p>Looks like your crush found you sexually attractive that isn't a bad thing actually. But what he might have done wrong was to push you on what you weren't comfortable yet I guess. Guys have sex to feel loved while girls need to be comfortable and feel loved to agree to sex.</p>

              <p>Hi guys,</p>
              <p>Just wonder, why do some guys have no respects for girls, play with their emotions and think it's easy to get into their pants by using mind games and some shitty tricks? I am not talking about some loose girls (no offense) but the opposite, the so-called 'good' girls? Don't get it wrong, a 'good' girl can become naughty in the bedroom and enjoy 'wild' fun but definitely only with someone she is in love with, who loves her, respects her and deserves her best of both worlds.</p>
              <p>I myself happened to have a huge crush on this guy. Though I could tell there was something wrong the very first time we hung out by his blatant looks at my sensitive body parts, his suggestive questions then texts etc but I initially gave him the benefit of the doubt that guys are basically horny creatures (pretty much almost) so I tried not to take it personally. However, I always kept myself on guard then finally walked away before it's too late when I compeletely realized his true crappy intention. Even if he ever had a little feeling for me, his inappropriate sexual urge and lack of respect say a lot about him. So I left it cool and didn't even reveal to him what I actually detected. Save myself the drama.</p>
              <p>I just have no respect for guys fooling around with such a shameful 'no sex no talk' rule. It's actually disgusting and heart breaking that a guy would leave the girl once he gets what he wants and has enough of it then starts to look elsewhere for new adventures. And I feel sad for girls who are fooled by those jerks.</p>
              <p>Hope that when a girl follows her heart, she doesn't fail to bring her brain along and don't be gullible.</p>
              <p>Hope we don't have too many bastards in Singapore.</p>
