Don't women work now???  I thought your Mona works.  No??  Oh no, I can't believe there is still dinosaurs in this day and age.  How old are you, Mr. Ding, if I may be so rude as to ask?<br><br>Actually, I do sympathise the situation.  I know and can understand where you are coming from.  I realise you have your troubles with the marriage or your wife's behaviour but using that as an excuse to "go out and look for other women" IS NOT a solution.  Perhaps you should have visited this forum before you embark on a relationship with Mona or otherwise.  The outcome may have been different.<br><br>I find many morally uprighted forumites around here and many write very well with meaningful scripts.  Well, that is if you are open enough to accept people's views and advices.<br><br>Did you ever discuss with your wife about how you feel and how you would like the marriage to be?  Have you ever asked yourself, why your wife behaved like she did?  Was it a reaction to your unfavourable actions?  Both parties have a part to play, so you can't just blame your wife.  Actually, talk about blame, you ARE the only one doing the blaming around this thread.  I don't see other forumites blaming you.  We were merely expressing our sentiments of what we thought of you or your behaviour.<br><br>Anyways, you have already made up your mind.  As a fellow human being, I wish you well and with your new found love, Mona.  But one word of advice, if you continue to behave or have that type of old modes of reasoning, you may well lose Mona as well.  Be open.  The world has been evolving and it looked like you stood still.  And as for your wife, I honestly hope you will try to make it easy for her and your daughter.  Don't be too hard.  Nobody deserves anything bad.  Everybody feels good when they do a good deed and that includes you too, Mr. Ding.</div>

It is indeed a very long thread but I didn't need to go very far to NOW understand why Mr. Ding's wife behave how she behaved!!!  But wow!  hyuuga neji, you do have a good memory eh?  Or actually, the first thread was in Mar/05 and that French kiss incident in 2004.<br><br>Mr. Ding, if you are complaining or blaming about your wife's behaviour towards you (the slapping and scolding)....well, you should know why she did that?  If you have no self control and has no sense of commitment, then whomever you end up with, you will go astray again.<br><br>Now I sort of feel happy for your wife.  At least she is off the hook and can look forward to having a second chance at life and love.  Just hope that her healing period can be less painful and short.<br></div>

If her chance is higher then for the sake of my daughter, i will stay with her. I did try to be a good husband but she just isn;t the one for me.<br>My daughter is very young less than 1 yr old so if she grows up with Mona, eventually Mona will take over the role of my wife. I notice sometimes my wife is talking to herself and that scares the fricking SHIT outta me. She is a little crazy i think how can I not divorce her what if she inflict harm on me? I don't even dare to go near her when she is cutting veges or cooking...sick women</div>

Or actually, the first thread was in Mar/05 and that French kiss incident in 2004.<br><br>Mr. Ding, if you are complaining or blaming about your wife's behaviour towards you (the slapping and scolding)....well, you should know why she did that?  If you have no self control and has no sense of commitment, then whomever you end up with, you will go astray again.<br><br>Now I sort of feel happy for your wife.
