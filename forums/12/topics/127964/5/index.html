Why is it that when this kind of things happen, all like to blame the guy? The wife is at fault too for controlling the husband, scolding him infront of his friends and even worst scold his friends not giving him face at all and check his sms secretly everytime simply no privacy at all staying with this women. Husband buy condom, consficate it and say husband plays around outside. kiss another girl go home tell her kena 2 slaps and no sex allow for few weeks. all these are her actions that are forcing me to look for another girl outside now she knows liao what can she do.
