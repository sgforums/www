            <div class='col-md body'>you want the scientific explanation or not?? anyway doubt you will reply this soon might as well give it to you.<br><br>Psychologically, all of us enjoy being touched.. and we have to be touched. When we are babies, we have to be touch, carried, cuddled, play with, if not we will be kind of anti-social and will not developed fully.<br>There was this experiment that they put a toy for a boy to play, and not to bother him anymore. then a girl is given all the hugz and touches, all the physical stuff. the boy is happy with the toy, but later shows result that the boy is kind of anti-social and not fully developed up to the stage that it should as a baby.<br><br>Then there was another case of 2 groups of babies from an orphange, one is a slightly smarter, and the others are a little bit slow.. So 2 psychologists put the groups of 13 babies in the care of some mentally retarded 'mothers', who didn't do a good job of taking care, but provided play, hugz and love. Left the other 13, who are considered smarted in the hands of the normal hands of the people in the orphanage, which has limited attention and stuff other than being fed, and clothed. 2 yrs later, they were tested of their IQ, and the supposed to be mentally retarded children gained 28 pts in IQ and those supposed to be smarter ones lost 30 pts. further research shows, the supposed to be mentally well children have only average of primary 6 education and only 2 got married. The other supposed to be retarded group had 5 in the uni, one even went for graduate school, and 11 of them got married. MOst importantly, these 13 people are more self-supportive and hold higher paying jobs than the other group.<br><br>Coming back to our discussion, many of us love to be touched, but we don't get it esp in the lonely isle of sg. Our parents don't hugs us much anymore, don't kiss us much anymore, even simple words like "I love you"s from parents also no longer exist. What we get is non-expressive ways of love, so we tend to look for outside people to get some physical attention. furthermore, boys being the supposed to be more independent kind loses the parental touches than girls, so may lead to more wanting to be touched by people, esp by girls.<br><br>Besides, experts say we need a healthy dose of 14 hugz each day on an average to be developed fully and psychologically satisfied even as an adult. Not saying you must find a gf/bf and hug. It's a sad thing that the sg doesn't have this practice, but even amongst guys and guys, it's considered a hug and is healthy, but passer-bys and the framework that we have in our minds had turn off that idea. the fault of society...<br><br>Talk too much liaoz. like written essays for my psych/soci exam.. hahaha~ sorryz if I have bored you.<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)

            <div class='col-md body'>haha ok... petting then say petting lah wah kao...  :p anyway, physical contact has to be gradually introduced as a r/ship proceeds... it's just like you don't go around kissing your normal friends straight on the mouth... the most important thing is for things to happen naturally, and for BOTH sides to be comfortable with it... i tink if you're not ready for anything, be it petting or sex, then just SPEAK UP! if the guy still forces the issue, then you'll have reason to doubt his sincerety...<br><br>anyway dun be too hard on us guys lah... any form of physical contact is just another way for us to show love you know... afterall if he pets you, you're the one who's supposed to be feeling good what... if he doesn't care, he'll just grab you for a bang and go to sleep after he's satisfied, leaving you high and dry...</div>

If you don't feel comfortable with something which your bf is doing just doing, just STOP him. RESPECT is IMPORTANT in a relationship.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.. overboard touches is it?? From what I know then is that you're likely to be a teenager... Don't get me wrong by saying that you will grow out of it when you become an adult.. No no.. I'm not saying that...<br><br>What I'm driving at is teenagers are in the process of maturing, and they are developing in their emtions, their physical self, faster than what their mind can control. This is true.. and so in a sudden impulse or the want to explore more about the physical body is very strong. This is especially in guys coz of the larger qty of testostrone, sexual hormones, in guys that causes this to happen, and also during puberty, the hormone glands and are more active. But basically the main thing is that the mind cannot catch up with the sudden growth of the body as quickly, and so this problem occurs.<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>Haha..erm..okiez..next time i'll make myself clearer..but..but..the word "petting"...im afraid of it lahhhhhh....<br>haha..dats why its kinda hard fer me to sae it out juz like dat! **grinz** ehh..now dat ive tried saying out..it seems kinda ez..petting..petting..petting!! haha..Oops..=p</strong><br><br>hey hey dun tell your bf i started you on it  :p<br><br><strong>Well..i ALWAYS haf the mentality dat if i go 2 his place..he wld wan more den juz kissing!! n its alwayyyyysss in my mind dat goes.."oh no..will he go further next?! will heeee.....?!" yah..dats wat alwaysssss went jiggling in my head..!! i think im sick! haha..am i..?? am i wrong 2 think soo much?!</strong><br><br>you're definitely wrong to think so much! you're adding unnecessary pressure to yourself as well as to him, when he hasn't even done anything yet! doesn't it feel terrible to be on the edge of your seat everytime he reaches over to hug you? it's all in your thinking, so it's up to you to quell it. have you tried to voice your concerns to your bf? if you tell him you dun wan to pet b4 he's got it into his mind, it should hurt less  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><strong>Tell u all frankly..ive not pet b4..nopez..never b4!</strong><br><br>so what's new... i haven pet b4 either...<br><br><strong>dats why the FIRST time seems really scary fer me..its like "PETTING" seems like such a BIG word to me..kinda pressurizing siahz..i dunnoe if im being all stoopid n idiotic 4 thinking dat way..but..but..im really scare wadddd...petting seems soo common n normal these daes! i dunnoe if im able to follow the norm..wat if im unable to do it?! Will he be like..." **Gosh** she's soo stoopid!"</strong><br><br>noooo why would he mind if you dunno anything? it juz proves that you've never done it with any other ppl b4, and that's good rite?<br><br><strong>I noe everione juz carry this sentence by the mouth dat goes.."if he forces u..it juz brings down to..he is juz after ur body" im capable of saying dat 2 frends too..im sure even my bf will saes dat.."Dun worry..im nt after ur body..soo i dun mind if ur nt ready" well..such thingies r ez to sae..but which guy wouldnt wan their ger to do "sumtin" wif them?! im sure there's this terrible feeling of disappointment in them..if given choices..they'll rather dump me ritez..??</strong><br><br>what?? no way! there may be lots of guys who would dump you if you dun let them get all touchy, but take a step back and see it properly, and you'll realise that these are the type of guys that you DON'T WANT. if they leave you bcos of this, be thankful that you found out that they're such jerks early.<br><br><strong>I noe guys within themselves haf guys tok ritez..?? which guy likes to mingle ard wif kinky topics like this without havin any opinion at all..cos they haf nuthin to sae..fer their gf did NOTHIN!! soon they'll start feeling odd..n starts havin doubts bout the r/s.. (Ehh..actually this part is wat i assume..heehee..i still need u guys to verify this 4 me if wat i saed is true...Hmm..seeee....!!</strong><br><br>again, there are guys who go around telling how loud their gfs shout in bed, but then these are the guys you want to keep away from. where's the respect here??? for my group of guy friends, when we talk kinky stuff, we NEVER bring our current gfs into the conversation. maybe ex gfs, or other friends' gfs, but never our current one. the things that happen in private are meant for the couple only... can you imagine what would happen if your bf's friend say in front of your friends "hey heard you dun like to pet leh. why huh?" won't you be embarrassed? so i say if your guy is sensitive to your feelings, he wont be giving a running commentary of your bedroom habits to his friends.<br><br><strong>ive always been pessimistic..everithing i juz assume n assume..and all these negative tots juz come flooding my mind..but..but..i cant help it oso mahhhhhh......**Sigh** )</strong><br><br>THAT'S why... you shouldn't assume or think so much... in fact i have the same problem as you, but from personal experience, this is very unhealthy... the beauty of a relationship is that you are living your life with a totally unique human being, with his own thoughts and feelings... dun u tink this spontaneous reaction (where u dunno wat he will do next bcos you can't read his mind) is so much better than you one person trying to plan out a tv drama-like journey? when you understand that somethings are beyond control, and no matter how much time you worry and sweat over it, you still can't affect it's outcome, then you'll know to relax and just enjoy what life has to offer now  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
