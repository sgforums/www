              <p>is the girl in your profile your girlfriend ? If not.. I see why your gf wants to break up with you.</p>
              <p>You are not mature enough for a committed relationship. I think she wants something more than just puppy love.</p>
              <p>First love.. second love.. 10th love... every failure is a lesson you can learn.. how many times you have to go through a broken relationship depends on what you learned out of the previous failed relationship.</p>

              <p>It can be a tough choice...</p>
              <p>Although I'm never a fan of someone who is willing to give up something more important to me like 'love' over money, i can understand that it is different for everyone. So if that's what your ex has choosen to do and has no intentions of compromise, then I guess it's up to you.</p>
              <p>If you r willing to go out of your way or change to satisfy the issues that she has raised because you are willing to do for the sake of staying/getting back 2gether, then that's up to you.....it could work out well at the end. If you don't, you might regret it later on....maybe.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, she could be overly materialistic and your better sense of judgement is currently clouded by 'love' atm, so if you stay apart and give it time, you might realise later on that you made a wise decision to let her go.</p>
              <p>First or tenth love....like the others said, you'll prob learn from them each. The first would always be a memorable experience though....</p>

              <p>Don't try to fit her criteria of a spouse. You will never make it, and even if you could you can never maintain it. And even if you can maintain it, she will always find some fault. Its a hopeless cause.</p>
              <p>Know who you are first. Then from there decide who you want to take care of for the rest of your life.</p>
              <p>The key word is discipline. How disciplined are you? How do you conduct yourself and your things?</p>

              <p>I disagree abit.</p>
              <p>I think compromising a little (by both) can be beneficial in such situations. Don't have to bow down to her every command, that way, yes it'll be a dead end. By compromising a little now to keep things going or to maintain the relationship, it may work out well later on.....which may be important now especially if u 'love' each other very much now. If these sort of challenges seem to continue again and again, then you might want to re-assess the situation and think how much more u r willing to compromise, if at all.</p>
              <p>If you simply just want 2 stick to your guns from the start and don't want to compromise, then that's fine.....be prepared to loose her then. I hope u can then find Mr/Mrs Perfect.</p>

              <p>Don't confuse her cry with wanting you to come back. She cry because she feels sorry for hurting you not because she still loves you. It is a straight hands down decision, she doesn't want you because she views that you are not capable of providing her needs. At least she is honest with that.</p>
              <p>She want security, that is her choice. You must move on, do not feel sorry for yourself nor feel that you are not secure enough. THat is her choice, her criteria.</p>
              <p>First love is painful but many many years you look back, you most likely laugh over it. Serious. There are a lot more worse things than a relationship breakup such as divorce. Good thing that you both can break up amicably instead of a marriage breakup. Learn to soak it up and move on. There are other fishes out there, it is not the end of the world.</p>

              <p>Thanks =) i finally understand this more then i think.</p>
              <p>she's is a nice girl and understand things well.i have faith that she's still love me but i'm sure that she wants hight demand and yet someone to love her and thats why she letting me go. not begin selfish to reach her criteria. even love will be so complicated and i always think last time that love is just a simple love. found someone that you love and just go ahead and love.</p>
              <p>come to think of it i have to change my mindset. character won't change. it is the person thoughts change. if a person is begin force to change and it is not yourself anymore. it is the person that wanted you to be inside the dream. every person got their own good and bad point that's why the life is much more intresting and challenging.</p>
              <p>From now onwards i will change for my family and my friends that when i was last time too hot temper and easily agitated. i have to endure this and give a warning sign before fire up.  i will forcus on study and career once i get enought savings.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For me and for all and always give someone a chance.</p>
              <p>1st chance is a lesson to learn<br><br>2nd chance is a test for what you have learn from a lesson<br><br>3rd chance is a exam you must pass no matter what, if fail, there's not such word as failure and it is who you wan to be after all and what you're going to do next path to keep going and going no matter how hard, how pressure, how stress, how tough, how people look at you, how people laught at you and always proud of yourself and confident.</p>
