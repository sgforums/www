              <p>how do i communicate with someone whom i don't really know too well, but ironically we have been on/off together for some time ?</p>
              <p>she is a pen-pal.  but also a gf... ? </p>
              <p>she uses nicknames and has multiple accounts and we communicate through an open forum.  i know it sounds crazy but this is true story.  most of the time, i have to guess if it is her sending me all these messages meant for me. </p>
              <p>how do i reply her without sounding hypocritical ?  she evades my questions and i don't see point of replying when i don't know if it is her at all ?  plus i don't like her evading my questions.  i don't know what to say.</p>

              <p><br>eh...fyi, i am abit crooked, not so straight, many gals only think of their own feeling, never think of a guy feeling, I am alway think of guy feeling, will not want to hurt them too, afterall, they also got parents like we do, aint not nice to hurt people feeling.</p>
              <p>I am crooked in a way to tell people in a less direct way, like it this guy show interest in me, I will not bluff him that I am attached like most gals did, I will just said, "I think we not intended for each other, love needs two hands to clap,  too bad i can't clap with you, you have to accept it, I apologise for rejecting you."</p>
              <p>The guy will get an initial shock, allow him to regain his composure, and wait fo him to say something, mostly they will say "So sad and disappointed, Angel, but at least you are frank and open, I really like to have you as my longlife partner, care for you for the rest of my life, but I know it is impossible now, it is a great honour to know you and learn alot from you, surprisely you look pure and innocent but you are so much mature than other gals I knew, let be friend or my sister then" then he will hang his down abit,</p>
              <p>I usually reply " sure, but dun be sad, I am alway around if you feel bore or need someone to talk to, by the way, i got many other gal frens who are more or less like me, some even more prettier, why not i intro them to you"</p>

              <p><br>eh...fyi, i am abit crooked, not so straight, many gals only think of their own feeling, never think of a guy feeling, I am alway think of guy feeling, will not want to hurt them too, afterall, they also got parents like we do, aint not nice to hurt people feeling.</p>
              <p>I am crooked in a way to tell people in a less direct way, like it this guy show interest in me, I will not bluff him that I am attached like most gals did, I will just said, "I think we not intended for each other, love needs two hands to clap,  too bad i can't clap with you, you have to accept it, I apologise for rejecting you."</p>
              <p>The guy will get an initial shock, allow him to regain his composure, and wait fo him to say something, mostly they will say "So sad and disappointed, Angel, but at least you are frank and open, I really like to have you as my longlife partner, care for you for the rest of my life, but I know it is impossible now, it is a great honour to know you and learn alot from you, surprisely you look pure and innocent but you are so much mature than other gals I knew, let be friend or my sister then" then he will hang his down abit,</p>
              <p>I usually reply " sure, but dun be sad, I am alway around if you feel bore or need someone to talk to, by the way, i got many other gal frens who are more or less like me, some even more prettier, why not i intro them to you"</p>

              <p>Wah true onot? You should give the guy the whole nine yards, Singapore style.</p>
              <p>I think in true life, you will say like tis:</p>
              <p>"I am a successful mamasan biznesswoman from Joo Chiat. Therefore I do not want to mix with low class Katong boys like you. I am 25, beautiful and have big butt, so I can produce lots of babies. Therefore I want the best of the best. I want my Man to be muscular, drive mercedes benz and lives in a luxury condo and earns more than $50,000 a month. You are poor Katong boy, I do not need to apologize to you. I outrightly reject you because you are not in my league, you are low class and you cannot serve my needs. Bye Bye."</p>
