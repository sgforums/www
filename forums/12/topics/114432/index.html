            <div class='col-md body'>3 years ago, i got to know this girl, "J". she was my friend de friend. During that past 3 years, we have been a very good friend, joke and tease with one another, and we often go out with a group of friend and majority i with her.<br>And in the late last year, i beginning to develop feelings for her and tell her that i like her and wondering should we give it a try on the relationship. And she agrees immediately after the message i send her. And now, it has been already 2 weeks i've been with her liao, and i dont feel her love 4 me, i ask her friend about her and they all say she like dont know how 2 express herself wan, and is more 2 a shy type. But that couldnt be wad, for already 3 years of friend and still shy? And each time i message her with lots of sentence like, "what are you doing now", "have you taken your dinner", "what time your lecture begin tml", "what time you sleeping tonight" and she always answer me the last sentence and only a short phrase like, "i sleep tonight at 11pm." that's all. the feelin is like very sianz. You guys have any idea on my problems? I really likes her but i'm afraid to hurt her in the meantime by confronting her.

Sigh~~</div></blockquote>Well, i had a experiance once like that, except that the girl replies on sms was darn fast. I must admit that It's quite a hard task to confront a girl, but it has to be done. But plz don't ask her question some how like this " How come everytime i sms you, your reply so slow de? " , this will sure make the opposite party feel worst. That will create a feeling of mistrust.<br><br>Since its been 2 weeks already, have a dinner date with her and just ask her how she feels about this relationship. Some times girls are just too shy to express themselves, even to their steady. They tend to worry over non-existence problems. Of course this is 2 sided, but girls tend to worry more.<br>So Maybe you should talk about this soon, not let it drag too long.<br>Gd luck man...<br><br>Regards<br>Sekundes AkA XEk</div>

Find out the cause of it, and eliminate it so that the two of you can progress...<br><br>A relationship stagnant at this stage will only deteoriate. Arrange for a meeting with her at a comfortable place to talk to, and of course make sure the both of you are not rushing for anything.<br><br>And if its possible, try not to sms so much but to call instead.

How she has been a friend to you back than.. Does not mean that she will be doing the same thing to you now.. There are some girls out there.. Whom take relationship and friendships as a totally 180 degree different thingy...<br><br>As her friend for 3 years.. I think you should know whats her character is like.. Like how she treats her friends and how she treats someone who is closer to her.. For her, maybe you should take longer time to give her the confidence that you really like her.. She may be hurt in some r/s back than.. She don't wish the same thing to repeat..<br><br>Take your time ya..

I'm a emotional guy, i could be hurt easily, and from what you nice people comments abt is more on to confront and sit down to have a nice chat wif her. I really afraid she might think that i dont trust her or giving her no freedom or wad. All right, i would prepare to face both positive &amp; negative at all cost.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Take it slowly, dude. Reading through your posts, I can only say that either you are taking it too fast or she is reacting too slowly. Whatever it is, refrain from SMS-ing her because you will never be able to convey your true feelings either way. Try to chat with her on the phone, at least for 15 mins every night. Just ask her how her day went, etc etc.<br><br>Good luck, dude. Even if a relationship is destined to be doomed, there will always be an opportunity for you to make it not happen. It all depends on what you do to make it work.</div>

You HAVE TO BE romantic or at least try to spice up the mood of your date. "gerrykoh" is right, you have to take the initiative since she is terribly shy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
