I'm a emotional guy, i could be hurt easily, and from what you nice people comments abt is more on to confront and sit down to have a nice chat wif her. I really afraid she might think that i dont trust her or giving her no freedom or wad. All right, i would prepare to face both positive &amp; negative at all cost.</div></blockquote>Its not really a 'confrontation'. More like a 'meeting', or a 'chat session' to find out what's holding her back.<br><br>Here, we can only speculate and think what exactly is the problem. But by asking, you will Know what the problem is. It'll be easier to tackle it then..<br><br>You're worried about not trusting her and giving her no freedom..? huh..?<br>The relationship isn't moving forward, and only by removing the obstacles that stands in the way, will you be able to progress..<br><br>Don't take a confrontational tone.
