            <div class='col-md body'>It's never been easy, that's why affairs of the heart is usually very difficult to solve and heal. Even if given time, some might not be able to pick themselves up from the fall. So the trick is to dwell in it for a few days, then try telling yourself everyday that each day is a challenge for me, I MUST forget what I've been through, I MUST 'punish' myself whenever I think of it again (e.g take up new hobby, make new friends etc.)<br><br>You are not the only one, maybe you could also read up relationship advices on the net/books/magazines. The more vulnerable a person is, the more he/she needs advices/assurance.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When faced with a  breakup one must learn the important lessons as to why it happen?<br><br>There are many breakups in the world and this shows that there is no such thing as nice fairy tales ending for any couple who will not fight hard for a relationship.<br><br>1) Breakups help you grow up and be more realistic to life.<br><br>2) It helps you to love the next one in a much better way.<br><br>3) It gives you another chance to fix mistakes which you had made in the pervious relationship.<br><br>4) It helps you to choose your next gf more wisely.<br><br>The formula I use to handle breakup is stated below.<br><br>1) understand that you have breakup with your gf and she has left you. Blaming her or you is really of no use. Accept that you have return to single life again.<br><br>2) Please do not waste time looking at hp for her call or sms. Her email, icq ,msn  has stopped coming and she have disappear from your life.<br><br>3) Burn up all photos or letters between you and her. Yes it helps. I have done it myself in order to stop myself from any more false hopes.<br><br>4) Slowly return to life. Remeber the days you had, when you are alone without her ? You are born alone into the world so it shows that you can make it alone without anyone.<br><br>5) Go out with friends and have fun. yes pure fun.<br><br>6) In time, you will look back and say hey " I wonder why I  never thought of leaving her earlier, she got so many bad habits that i never notice before."<br><br>Final thought :<br><br>Breakup are really hard on anyone and you are not alone. Everyone must go through breakups in order to treasure what they have in life..<br></div>
