              <p><br>well, trees is also a living thing, it bear fruit too, but first, it need to nurture and tender well, plant on a perfect enviroment with water and sunlight, its sure to bear good fruits, human are in a way similar, you need to be properly nurtured and guided, work hard and smart with a good heart and mind, you are sure to become a good person and live happily. But if you are rubbishly brought up, lazy and like to spent and parties, then you will end up with a problematic and unhealthy life.</p>
