              <p>If you never ever have to cross paths with your exes again, then good for you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sounds like the breakups that you have are all pretty bad? There are people who break up mutually though. These are the peeps who tend to become friends after. Perhaps better and closer than before.</p>

              <p>yeah most of them are really bad . but well thats why it`s called a break up right ?</p>

              <p>Be first a friend to yourself, be love to yourself, be happiness , be kindness, be compassionate - then u are in a position to share and partake of another person. U have become a king, so rich within and overflowing u can share - u are abundant. Here, one shares, flows</p>
              <p>However, if u lack <span style="text-decoration: underline;">within</span> all that i enumerated (which is,of course expansive) - u may love, u may be a friend, u may be ... - u will feel fearful that it may not come back or be reciprocated in some form or ways.  it is in the nature of existence that life is a flux, flowing and when things change and the person (or others) change - u are bound to feel anxious, unvalidated and so on so forth. Here, one seeks, chasing</p>
              <p>The only difference is that one who has it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">within</span> - will accept, the one that lacks within will suffer.</p>
              <p>It is a myth - an erroneous assumption that we get what  we want in life. The reality is we <span style="text-decoration: underline;">attract what we ARE</span>.</p>

              <p>after i broke off with my ex i tried to be friend with her.. but all the memories kept gushing back and before I realised I'm treating her like a girlfriend all over again..</p>
              <p>but after im attached again i find it alot more easier to show concern as a friend as compared.. but one thing for sure even as friend they will not be those "typical friends" hehe like some sort of friend with a special place..</p>

              <p>Please do not confuse 'friendship' and 'courtship'. There are differences. In friendship, there are limitations that you DO NOT CROSS THE LINE and interfere with another's life, and the choices she makes. It's her decision to make and never yours, even though  you MAY be asked for counsel.</p>
              <p>Respect her for who she is and what she wants, give counsel only when she asks of it. Other than that, you must remain a respectful distance if you want to maintain that friendship.</p>
              <p>I know it is difficult and tough, more so since she is ex, but that wall had already been built mutually, and it would be both's responsibility to maintain it if friendship is to be endured, unless both feel the wall should be torn down and exclusivity be renewed and enhanced.</p>
              <p>Think carefully, about each other. None is perfect. What was the reason for the breakup? Is there a possibility for change and compromise? If so, the chance remains for love to grow. If not, then that wall must be maintained, at all times, and you will find 'friendship' is possible and enduring.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>

              <p>depends on how it ended and what ur ex is like lah.</p>
              <p>imo, it usually works only when a strong friendship existed, way before the romance began.</p>

              <p>most of the time, this proposal for friendship acts as a security

              part of ur life suddenly gone. that imo, is just an act for their own interests.</p>

              <p>if breaking up was mutual (hardly ever) and there's a good level of honesty between the two, being friends is possible. in fact, it's an admirable but rare display of open heartedness.</p>
              <p>today break up - tomorrow be friends, is definitely impossible de lah. human beings are not machines, time is necessary for the pain &amp; sense of loss to subside.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>know the difference between feigning friendship and sincere understanding, be honest with urself when it comes to this.</p>
              <p>as long as either party is still bitter, the passion and longing still exists, and his / her lingering in ur life brings u unfathomable pain... trotting the friendship route serves no purpose &amp; provides no room for growth. at least, not for now.</p>
              <p>no need 2 change ur thinking lah.</p>

              <p>its actually depend on the both of u</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Be first a friend to yourself, be love to yourself, be happiness , be kindness, be compassionate - then u are in a position to share and partake of another person. U have become a king, so rich within and overflowing u can share - u are abundant. Here, one shares, flows</p>
              <p>However, if u lack <span style="text-decoration: underline;">within</span> all that i enumerated (which is,of course expansive) - u may love, u may be a friend, u may be ... - u will feel fearful that it may not come back or be reciprocated in some form or ways.  it is in the nature of existence that life is a flux, flowing and when things change and the person (or others) change - u are bound to feel anxious, unvalidated and so on so forth. Here, one seeks, chasing</p>
              <p>The only difference is that one who has it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">within</span> - will accept, the one that lacks within will suffer.</p>
              <p>It is a myth - an erroneous assumption that we get what  we want in life. The reality is we <span style="text-decoration: underline;">attract what we ARE</span>.</p>

              <p>But my ex used to say different things , cause she see`s my friends as loafers cause theie family are rich and have nothing better to do( which they really are ) . She keeps saying a person is who ur friend makes you .</p>
