            <div class='col-md body'>Why am I always plagued with such moodiness &amp; low self-worth at this time of the year. Year-end period are usually the happiest for the mass, Â‘normal pplÂ’--- festive seasons are near, exams are over, lots of gatherings, celebrations etc...<br>Maybe itÂ’s also an appraisal time for ur life. I used to have this Â“I have achieved nothing again this yearÂ” feeling. Think I beat the trap this year cause I had set personal goals to be achieved, eg. getting gd grades for my course, building a better physique (going to the gym, eatin more etc). My grades so far are still satisfactory..<br>Maybe IÂ’m overly self-critical &amp; pessimistic but emotionally, I still canÂ’t beat myself. As my remaining friends gets fewer, my ability to connect with new friends deteriorate &amp; each failed relationships adds to the burden of my painful memories, I actually feel worse with year..<br><br>*(edited for too much self-pity &amp; pathetic stuff..)<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ya i think everyone feels the same way from time to time; it only gets worse at this time of the year.<br>Like for me, my exams just ended but i don't feel that there's any big deal about it. And yes i used to organise some gathering or something but over the years i feel that i'm always the one doing it. Since no one else bothers, everyone's banking on me (assuming that they care in the first place), why should i always be the one doing it? People will like 'let's meet up blah blah' then expect u to go call everyone else up. Ya so just heck it, since everyone couldn't care less then so be it.</div>
