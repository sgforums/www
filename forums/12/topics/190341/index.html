Natural reaction and emotion so for awhile ok. But he has to be strong and don't give up if he really wants to carry on playing. Nothing wrong with quitting rugby. Does not necessarily makes him a loser in life, but if it becomes a habit to him, quitting whenever he failed in soemthing, then big capital L on the forehead to him. Just advice him that sometimes, people learn best through their experiences.</span> <span style="color: brown;">Whatever that does not kill you only makes you stronger.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </span></div>

You have study to focus on. There is up and down in life, world arnt over yet. Take a break from the game, take a step backward and think. If he really want to improve further, practice more.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>maybe thats the reason he doesnt get to play. cos hes not all that good. i'm just stating the highly possible here, and i play sports so i know that its unfair that not everyone gets to play but its a fact of life you have to get over as a sportsman. also if he knows he isnt as good, can be get over being selfish, and want whats best for the team? and if that time he didnt play well cos of a one-time "off-form", then PROVE himself during trainings or something. but somehow as a gf i dont think you should be talking about this to him. most probably he wont like it. cos its a blow to his ego. even stuff like "dont worry you'll do better next time" or "i'm sure you'll get another chance" can be quite irritating to a sports person.<br><br>his capt should takl to him.</div>
