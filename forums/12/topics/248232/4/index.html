It wasn't with direct reference to VK. But for one thing, I feel VK would would not get personal if the conversation didn't involve Devil. I did mention that in the earlier post. But if she does take the post, she should stop getting personal with people as well. I assume you know what I mean by 'personal' here.<br><br>As for MC Squareas mod, it seems lately that he has dissappeared. Maybe he's still around just reading, but I get the impression from others that he is not even on sgforums anymore these days, let alone performing the role of Mod. I may be wrong as this is not proven. So my understanding is based on the idea that Devil is the only active Mod now.<br><br>I don't feel how that statement overruled anything, I think maybe I wasn't clear enough.</div>
