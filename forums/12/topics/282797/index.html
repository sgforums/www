To employ dialogue and communication to alter her fundamental belief about love is as challenging as changing one's personality.<br><br>To understand your plight, we have to review the basic - our needs.<br><br>21 years old girl and a 26 years old guy: surely the age difference would suggest proportionate widening of expectation, due to segmenting of separate phases in our life. You can't expect a woman of her age to perceive love and relationship the way you do?<br><br>The theory of love needs are often logical to self, but illogical to others. Woman will never understand man's fascination about blowjob and boobs. And the problem is that they don't need to - they only need to know that it exist. Similarly, you don't need to understand why she is giving you trash because you will probably not know anyway - you just have to know the this is the woman you accepted as girlfriend three years back... this is your choice.

Such short-term 'needs' might be 'nonsensical', but certainly they do qualify as a need, don't they? (As mentioned in the above paragraph).<br><br>Some woman loves a man like you and they don't mind enduring that emotional sacrifice, knowing that whatever you are doing right now, it's for your future together and they so love a responsible man like yourself. But there are also a group of woman who cherish and appreciate spending quality time with their other half, much more than you telling them you are going to spent the next year working hard (likely to be at the expense of your relationship) for a better home (CloUdiSm Elemental theory - Earth vs Water)<br><br>And I can tell you they are both equally right - just that from where they are standing, they are looking at love from different angles.<br><br>I remember an old story in the papers, where this man worked his guts out because he always felt the importance of finance and the ability to provide for the family. Then he read, also in the papers, about the story of this man who regretted not showing affection to his significant other when she was alive and now he can only spent his time at her grave.<br><br>Inspired by this article, he drove to Malaysia, with a bouquet of flower - wanting to give his wife a surprise and he end up getting a bigger surprise.<br><br>He gave his wife the flower and told her that he loves her. She cried incessantly, not only just because she was touched by his action, but also, if he has arrive an hour later, she would have committed suicide because she thought that her husband no longer loved her. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Love and career are often mutually exclusive.

Getting attention from you in a negative way is better than getting no attentiion from you at all? Right now I see two problems,your job and your relationship but I am sure you are more worried about the first one.In the song 'Hard to say I am sorry'(Chicago) there is a line *Even Love needs a holiday.So maybe you need to take a break from this relationship for a while to sort things out.Be fair to yourself otherwise you could be the one ending up sorry.</div>
