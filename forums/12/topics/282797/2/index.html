            <div class='col-md body'>I think, as an almost 21 year old woman myself, that your gf is starting to miss you just that little bit too much when you go away for work. She is obviously getting jealous of your work, which is understandable. However, even though she is only 21, she should be mature minded enough to understand that what you do with your career now will affect how your future together is. You need to talk to her, seriously, and tell her you want her just to sit quietly and listen to you while you explain your positon and your feelings about her tantrums (that's what they are). Once you have fully explained everything to her, without getting angry, or seeming frustrated, then give her the chance to explain to you why she is like this, while you sit quietly and listen to everything she has to say. Once you have noth fully explained yourselves.then it will be easier for you both to decide what you need to do, as you will both know each others honest feelings.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>I hope I've helped.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello elindra and Tissot1853<br><br>Thanks for your reply and advice.<br><br>BadzMaro<br>Just being polite and courteous as people who posted here<br>did put in effort or thoughts. One must learn to appreciate the effort<br>of others.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I had some booze today, make it like 1am, at some pub. My senior<br>was telling me and informing lots of stuff which I have missed out and<br>I ought to do some relfection.<br><br>One thing is appreciation. If I can appreciate help from others, why can't I<br>appreciate the small things she do? Vice versa, I have never done small<br>things or favours, cos most of them is major issues.<br><br>I have missed out the importance of love. Love is not about being rigid and<br>regimental with life. Love does not need a partner to bark orders or give<br>commands. Sometimes, love just need a little verbal support from the<br>partner.<br><br>Crimes mentioned above regarding love is what I have committed. The<br>person who needs to do some soul searching is not her, but me.<br>Now that I am no longer at war with myself, I have made peace with<br>my GF and me.<br><br>I apologised thru sms for the neglect and over-protection towards her. Sometimes, people need to fall down to learn, and when they do,<br>a little verbal support will do. No need for barking commands or orders<br>so that she does not fall down. True, falling hurts, but once bitten twice<br>shy, twice bitten, never again.<br><br>If you are curious on what my friend told me, drop me a PM, as it is a little<br>long winded and not necessary here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>To all who had posted, thanks again for the effort and thoughts. It is now<br>I, who has to do a little more thoughts and soul searching. Off course, she<br>still have to grow a little more mature, for our future and relationship.<br><br>Have a nice weekend ahead!!!!<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
