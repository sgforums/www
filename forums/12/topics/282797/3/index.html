            <div class='col-md body'>Back In SG since yesterday, will be gone on wednesday...<br>She actually asked me about my flight, turned up at arrival hall.<br>The only thing I could do was to send her back after that, which in<br>a way it felt very sweet to have someone waiting back home.<br><br>Jojo, I normally do not shout at people. Never at colleagues.<br><br>The only people I bark at is those who ask dumb questons, or seriously<br>bad management people.<br><br>If they do not understand certain part, and ask me to repeat, I am<br>more than willing. That's bcos it is part of my job to assist and<br>guide.<br><br>But if they ask dumb questions before they understand anything, I will<br>100% bark at them. Example of stupid questions, how come the colour of<br>the button is red, and why not maroon?<br><br>These people either have 0 knowledge, little or no way of thinking<br>or their common sense is not common.<br><br>Yes, customers are always right, but at a certain level of engineering,<br>asking such questions only riducule themselves. I once asked the fella,<br>you sure you are engineer? A little rude, a little not tactical, but<br>seriously, if I do not ridicule them, it will just be an evil cycle.<br><br>Natalie, I know what I am doing and what I wish to achieve in the next<br>5 years. I am getting there. But regarding love/relationship matters,<br>I am totally lost, confused and no idea.....<br><br>soleachip, I do not really like pubs or discos. Hurt my ears and<br>body. Last time when smoking was allowed, I hate it more! It's<br>better now, but would like a quiet ones like lounge.<br><br>To the rest, I am not sure how long the split will be.... Seeing her<br>yesterday makes me wanna patch back, but on the other hand, I need<br>time. Time to be learn to be a little more human, and less mechanical.<br><br>Anyway, thanks to those who posted. Have a nice work week.</div>

Sent me off on my next flight.<br><br>I just got back at 10pm, lost a HP 6965 and 1 credit card. For the first time in<br>my life, I lost something so important... Mind you, it's not everyday nor fashion<br>of mine to lose things at all.<br><br>Technically, I lost my dear also.. So she was the most important part. Therefore<br>the first time should be her.....<br><br>She fetched me at the airport again today. I felt so sweet and warm. To have<br>someone who unconditionally loves me like that.<br><br>BUT!!!! Within 24 hours, or should I say 36, I need to F OFF from here and away I go.... AGAIN!!!!<br><br>This is really really tiring....<br><br>To those who think that working which requires lots of flight, think again.<br><br>Enjoy the weeks and happy holidays in advance.<br><br></div></blockquote>so u 2 are back together?</div>
