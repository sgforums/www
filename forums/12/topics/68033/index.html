            <div class='col-md body'>my 2 cents worth are that, the best way to defeat a crush ---- is to get to know him better. i think crushes are so because people admire other people from afar!! you don't see the bad side but only the good side. you don't see the kind of personality that you might not like because u don't know him. once u get to know him better... i think it'll just fade away because it's not that easy to <strong>find the right one.</strong> if it doesn't then, congrats, you've found the one. but u also have a bigger headache...... but that can wait  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
