My bonds with my friends are such that we can actually meet up as a group 2/3 times a week for movies, makan and so on. They brought me clubbing, to meet new people and I really felt that I've missed out on soooo many things in the past 3yrs of my life having lived in the micro environment which revolves around her.<br><br>I'm glad to have found a renewed meaning in life. Now when my friends ask me out, I will no longer be turning them down, but will agree straight away unless I've got something on. I will also take initiative to ask them out. Ha, I feel so blessed to have such a gd bunch of friends.<br><br>Also, I would like to thank those whom have given me a helping hand to recover from the bottomless pit which I've found myself to be trapped in.</div>

I really appreciate that!</div></blockquote>Yeah.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by dokono:</div><div class="quote_body">My memory is only filled with promises like that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>doko  </div></blockquote>I only remember small details... -_________-</div>

I'm actually fine with being single for now. haha, no commitments and i get to meet a variety of flowers. So why not? And no...i'm not taking revenge lah.

By being nice to everyone including her and her BF? This way you can market yourself as who you are and more than likely this will attract many girl's attention.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
