My bonds with my friends are such that we can actually meet up as a group 2/3 times a week for movies, makan and so on. They brought me clubbing, to meet new people and I really felt that I've missed out on soooo many things in the past 3yrs of my life having lived in the micro environment which revolves around her.<br><br>I'm glad to have found a renewed meaning in life. Now when my friends ask me out, I will no longer be turning them down, but will agree straight away unless I've got something on. I will also take initiative to ask them out.

Because I don't get it...why come whining to me when you've got probs. with your work, with your handsome? What am I? Does she expect me to like sayang her, boost her ego, make her feel wanted and then let her move on?
