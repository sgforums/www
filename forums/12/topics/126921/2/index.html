He has a lot of bad habits...like wasting water, making loud sounds when he spits, produces the most noises when he eats (so much so that I avoid any chance to share the dining table with him).<br><br>My mother can't stand him too! She also admitted to having the idea of stabbing him to death. He is so IRRITATING! The noises he makes gives us constant headaches. We tried communicating with him, but he just smiles at us, do not take us seriously, and shrugs it off.<br><br>I wonder why he can continue with his acts when he sees us in so much pain. You might think the things he does are trivial and we are making a big fuss. Try enduring that everyday, and be woken up by his din every single day. He is so stubborn! AHHH!!! He is driving me insane!<br><br>He is a good man, he raised us up, and he IS my father. But sometimes i just feel like bludgeoning him to death! My mom and I even made a pact to commit suicide if either of us kills him one day.<br><br>HELP!</div></blockquote>From I see here, your father is asking for attention..  I do not know how close you people are but when is the last time your family sit down to talk...  I mean really talk like how you feel for each other etc...  have you and your mum shown some concern to him.. you know, the list go on ....  killing him is not doing you and your  mum any good .. before killing him, try killing a chicken, it is not so easy taking a live... So I suggest you try to arrange for a gathering and speak your heart out ... it is not going to be easy but you can surely try... you do sound like you still love your dad ..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Why don't you raise the issues you have to him? You and your mom. If he doesn't want to admit or do anything, then just have to tolerate. No point kiling your father just because he irritates you. I don't think that warrants murdering him right? Think about all the consequences you'll have to face cos' of that. I think you just said that in a fit of anger and frustration.. relax and try to think of an alternative solution..</div>

Maybe, you shld juz try to talk nicely and find out wat the problem lies...<br><br>As for fogetting to turn off the tap, my mum is doing that everyday, and her explanation is: "I turn on the tap to fill up the pail. I dun know it got filled up so fast!"
