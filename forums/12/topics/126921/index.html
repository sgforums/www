I think that your father is more like a 'happy go lucky' kinda guy... Yeah.... Always happy and smiling away... Taking things easy... Though sometimes he can irritate people... (perhaps purposely?) But if you really know about it, quite alot of old folks would do that... In one way or another... Just to get attention...<br><br>And if you really wanna know...? Nope... You don't even have to kill your dad probably... As a person ages... And less people pay attention to them... It's just a slow way of leaving this world... Dying... Rotting away... Just like a person who has caught a particular type of disease... Waiting to die... They want people to talk to... Attention... To feel alive (at least while they still really are alive...?)...<br><br>My dad too.. Sometimes I feel that he's trying hard to communicate with us... Though his method is not 'right'...? I used to teach that he's very much of a nuisance only too... Always trying ways to REALLY BOTHER and DISTURB people... But indirectly, I must admit that though he's already old, he's still 'teaching' me things... Like... About 'communication'.... About 'tolerance'.... 'Understanding'...? Nope.. Though I don't really like him... And unlike you, I'm no fillial son... FAR from it.... But I understand that he has given me ALOT... And if he still can, probably would still want to....?<br><br>These days... He no longer bother me as much as before... Sometimes a few mild attempts... Perhaps he has thought of just to let his children live their own lives and for himself, his own.... A different phase in being an older person...? Well... All I can say is we are all learning throughout different phases of our lives....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

What have I done? I just suffer in silence for all these years...maybe I should say thank you to him huh?

If that's happens, go ahead and defence yourself and hack off his head.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>You know, there're some people who grew up without knowing and having their father beside them and how they wished they had one from hell. :p<br><br>Ignore him if you really dislike him that much and don't let him take up any memory space in your mind constantly. There're better things to think of, especially your own future. Your father is not going to be in your future till you die, and you're definitely going to outlive him. When that time comes, won't you be real sad and wished that he'll be alive again and irritate you? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Regardless of how terrible your father is right now, he is your father and you should look forward and remember the good and happy things that both of you have experienced.

I'm sure he'll gladly donate a kidney for you if he have to do so to save your life. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Some people became evil because they grew up without their father...for example, Dr. Evil from Austin Powers? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Ignore and Forget, for forgive is divine and forgiveness need to be earned. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

No one is perfect. At least you can count on a dad that been around to support you to give you a home, and does not have a mistress type of big bad habits.<br><br>Even you say he is a good man, maybe you and your mum should be struck by lighting for even having thoughts of killing a man just because he have some bad habits.</div>
