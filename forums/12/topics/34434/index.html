If you are hurt, you cry - Regardless of which chiobu is sitting opposite you. As you age - people tend to mask emotions. You are so badly hurt, yet you appear nothing has happen. You can't move from away from your past, yet you appear life goes on well for you, etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>The real world robbed the innocence away. Real sincerity to know and want to know someone is clouded by thoughts of false friends, liers, etc. Sometimes you wouldn't even want to appear you want to know even thought deep inside you are dying to - there is an image you kept and uphold.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>All this hinders your attempt to know people better.<br><br>To fall in love - you have to wait for you chance.
