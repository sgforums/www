Either way, u will still be hurt wor.<br><br>All I can say is, she dun need you in her life.  I can truely empathise with your feelings.. it hurts when you see the one who hurt u to be living happily.  But then, life goes on.  Take it as a lesson learnt.  You can be happy too.  I know it's hard.  But you definitely have a choice!  It took me 2 years to be happy again.<br><br>Perhaps time cannot erase the memories nor hurt.. but time can made u feel numb to the pain.  All you need to do is to be strong and face it, dun harp on it, dun cry over it, dun shed tears for someone who is not worthy of your love.  Move on.  Someday, somehow, you will be able to let go and meet someone who truly appreciates you.<br><br>All the best~!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sometimes i feel, when guys become so good in a relationship, it can actually backfire.<br><br>for example, during a quarrel, good guys will often be the one to apologise first no matter who is right, who is wrong or who is the unreasonable one; as they do not want to strain the relationship further and because the relationship is very important to them. Hence they are willing to make this 'first step' - sacrifice.<br><br>however, such attitude, if prolonged in a relationship, will somehow tend to portray the guy as 'soft' and easily manipulatable. Thus, the girl will feel that the guy is not a guy at all! Perhaps she will feel that the basic natural qualities of a man is missing - tough, strong, big, hard etc etc.<br><br>so i feel, sometimes it will actually help if guys in a relationship can be firm and say no, and i dare say sometimes you have to be able to scold your gf too. Of course the reason must be there lah..<br><br>perhaps that is why they say "nan ren bu huai, nu ren bu ai"<br><br></div>

You are 3 years her senior and yet she treat you like a dog. It's no wonder why she want to break up with you.<br>From the way you had typed, i can only say you are 95% at fault, and another 5% goes to her.

            <div class='col-md body'>to shevchenko: from what u just spoken, i feel that your ex is maybe just pure immature. the girls in my school too from 13-15 also desire to have handsome and rich guys to be their stead. some in my sch go for a relationship not because of true love but to enjoy the process of being loved, gifts being showered. from what i read, sadly but truly i think ur ex belongs to this group.<br>however, you needn't be sad. it's time to move on. anyway i am 18 just like you.</div>
