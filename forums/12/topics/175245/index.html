But those are his opinions about love and life, and there seems to be unhappiness and feelings of defeat accumulated over time.<br><br>I'm not sure as well what prompted him to write all that. It could be a reaction to a recent event, or it could be that he was just thinking about the past. Or it could be something else. He doesn't say and if I were him, I wouldn't feel like sharing after reading some of the above replies.<br><br>This is the forum people come for advice and support, not expecting to be judged and flippantly criticized...or am I wrong about this?</div>
