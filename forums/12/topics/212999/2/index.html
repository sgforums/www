            <div class='col-md body'>maths prelims are always harder than what you can expect for the o levels.<br>that being said it doesnt give you the excuse to be complacent . Start by trying to do EVERY single question in your TYS . Once you're at a decent level do the prelim papers of top schools like acsi , ri , chinese high , river valley etc . These have reputations for having exceptionally hard papers . If you can get 60 for any of these papers you're pretty much guaranteed a B for o levels . Anything is possible for O levels , you've got a month jsut focus and study . I got F9s from secondary 3 all the way till prelims for emath and i ended up with a B3 for my o levels ( has anyone else noticed so many people keep saying they got b3 ? ) . IF you can afford it get a tution teacher . Get ur school teachers numbers and call them from home as you do the work or ask a friend thats good to help you out. Dont waste time travelling to school and back , your bound to waste valuable study time in between<br><br>just work hard and good luck man <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>cheers</div>
