If you are not sure on which one to like, then you be better off not to pick anyone of them right now. The reason is because you don't like either A or B and nobody can give you the answer to your this question. You definitely know them more than we do. So until then, let things move at their own pace until one day you finally met or know who you really like. When that day comes, you won't even need to wonder who you like already. Because you already know.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
