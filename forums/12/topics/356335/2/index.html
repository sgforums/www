              <p>It is with grave concern that i post this. Not for those seeking help, but more for the kind hearted individuals here who opened up their hearts and shared experiences to help, and even revealed personal information and contacts.</p>
              <p>It is of course within each's personal right and preference on how they believe and act on the course of helpful action, but i would suggest to keep any propositions here on this site or if certain confidential information needs to be communicated, within the email system here.</p>
              <p>We must realize that there may be issues many are not trained to handle or experienced it before to be of better help, thus it would be better to keep it in the open here so that others may present better insights and perspectives, and not lead to misunderstandings, petty recriminations, or abuse in private.</p>
              <p>Most genuine cries for help seldom ask for personal contacts, let alone even bother to give a thank you reply. And ultimately, all us here have our limitations - we are not superman or superwoman. Should anyone come across issues that may seem bewildering, i would strongly recommend professional contact lines be made to, for references, such as social services or MPs.</p>
              <p>Hope my post may help, for both genuine help seekers and kind hearted individuals - which are precious to society - they are a rarity. </p>

              which i told him, no way n impossble, as i keeping it for
              marriage.<br>  <br> then he asked me to release it for him. i tried but jus cant do it.

              <p>not only that, 'he' said the same things to me too, it seemed genuine, until 'he' started talking abt wetting the bed</p>
              <p>i asked 'him' why he wet the bed, getting physical with bf shouldn't affect pee, then 'he' replied that it was not pee, not mens, but vaginal discharge<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"> (i was getting suspicious then, cos there's no such thing)</p>
              <p>Then I asked him y 'he' why he had such discharge, he replied that it was because 'he' feel horny at night, that's why he'll discharge fluid at night (by then i knew this person was a sick guy)</p>
              <p>i challenged 'him' further by saying how ridiculous it is that there will be discharge to the extent of wetting the bed. 'He' cheekily replied that 'he' sleep naked at night, so the fluid will flow and wet the bed<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/devil.png" alt="devil.png"> I was very pissed by then that I was chatting with a sick pervert and told him to f* off</p>
              <p>Knowing he was exposed, 'he' then kept harassing me and pestering me to on my webcam and show him my face</p>
              <p>eventually i just delete and block tis stupid guy forever my msn</p>
              <p>this is really worrying me, what's happening to singaporean guys, do they really need to be so desperate?</p>
