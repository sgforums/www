              <p>I know a guy from my school at the beginning of our school term. We became very good friend but recently he asked me to his girlfriend. I told him that we are still young and should not get into such relationship. He agreed, but recently I realised that he is keeping a distance away from me. I asked him why, he said he fallen in love with me, so either we are a pair or we end our friendship. After consideration, I agreed to be his girlfriend but I told him that there should not be any physical relationship as we are still schooling. He agreed.</p>
              <p>But he did not keep his promised. He asked me over to his home few days ago and start touching me.</p>
              <p>After what happened, I asked him why he did not keep his promise and continue even when I asked him to stop. He said it is normal for people who are in love to do all this things. I admits I do love him and also admit that I did not stop him. Is such reaction normal for beginner like us? Ignore me if you think I am asking silly questions.</p>

              <p>Anyway, did you tell him what you meant by physical relationship? sex, petting or hugging? You must make sure that you let him know wat you are refering too in the first place, if not you cant blame him..</p>

              <p>I wish schools would help introduce 'relationships' education to our young without dogmatic religiousity but practical peer reviewed theoratical comprehensions of male-female reactions.</p>
              <p>What you are experiencing and in confusion is and happened to every young child and growing adult on our planet since time began.</p>
              <p>The basic question right in front of you which you didnt realised is this - Why do you need him to be your friend?</p>
              <p>Is it because you are lonely? Is it because of peer pressure? Is it because you want to possess him as you would with a toy?</p>
              <p>Only in understanding your need can you determine the level of intimacy you would allow yourself with him - another human being who has not fully understand civilised ways and the need for it, and has yet animal instincts in him - no fault of him, for such traits are inborn in every male and has yet to be eradicated by science throuigh genetic manipulation.</p>
              <p>Do realize that in intimacy, you will be giving more than your physical self to him. You will be giving him your precious emotional self, which can either elevate you or bring you down to the worst depths you may not be prepared for should you quarel, have misunderstandings, jealousies, etc ( which are common in ANY relationships). </p>
              <p>No one can stop you and what you do behind close doors, or give you solid advices based on experiences, but experiences which you had not gone through to believe in.</p>
              <p>I am afraid that, unfortunately, only you alone can determine your own needs and how far you want to go. Each comes with a price you will have to pay later, best be prepared for it. Your life and well being is precious to yourself and humanity.</p>
