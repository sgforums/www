            <div class='col-md body'>it seems i keep getting blame for their screw-ups again and again.<br>this morning my mum scolded me for placing her phone number on the yahoo auctions website after she got a phone call frm a buyer.<br>the reason why i placed her number on the net is because she wanted me to reply the bidder with her number and asking him/her to call my mum for a fast deal. she specifically asked me to reply the buyer thru the yahoo auctions questions and answers to give him/her the number.<br><br>i taught her how to use the yahoo auctions since last year at least, if not earlier. after that (since late last year) i let her run the auctions on her own since it was registered under her name and used her credit card to verify the seller and she succesfully sold several things. she shld have known that by answering a question posted , yr replies and the question can be seen by anyone. i personally tested this myself. i logged in using my current yahoo account, her account and unlogged in. on all 3 occasions i can see her phone number. only using her account then i can see another question which was unanswered.<br><br>i called my dad and mum and they told me to immediately del the reply without even listening to my explanation. yes i know the privacy is impt but what i am afraid is that when i get home they will start scolding me all over again.<br><br>everytime something happens and i make my stand i get scolded for making noise etc.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>read what eutjin has writen slowly, he is very right. conflicts are inevitable in all families. the important thing to bear in mind is that they are your family, not enemy. from what you've writen, your parents are those very conservative and traditional kind of pple. but do not think of your problem as an isolated cases. ask any forumites here and i'm sure some of them have similar parents too.<br><br>i used to quarrel a lot with my parents too. i felt how you feel now, that they dun care a lot abt me. however, when i was struck by an acute appendicitis when i was 18, they are the ones who showed the most concern. but after i have recovered, they were back to their old selves. thus, it's not true that your parents do not care abt you. of cos, i really do not wish for something bad to happen to you in order for you to understand how noble parents are.<br><br>even when i was in uni, the quarrels still continue. the quarrels lessened (to almost nil) when i started working, exactly what eutjin has mentioned.  that's when your parents know that oyu've grown up. by often quarreling with them, you are not doing yourself any good in proving that you have matured. learn to settle quarrels in an amicable and matured manner. you shd see the difference in their behaviour<br><br>pls dun say things like staying in Melbourne and not coming back. that again shows certain degree of immaturity in you (no hard feelings ok). u dun run away from problem. face them and overcome them. in any case, i have stayed in Mel for 2 years, and while it can be fun, i feel that singapore is still the place to call home.<br><br>cheer up ok. do not be so stressed up because there are much bigger obstacles (and rewards) in life awaiting you. speak to professional counselor if you need to. wish you well mate.<br></div>

PLUS, i won't be matured enuff to think that way at that time ........ too many factors ...... just too many.  and trust me when i say i know what you feel.  afterall, all these things happened for me not too long ago.<br><br>and nowadays ..... "you going to penang?  want to take the car?  alright, drive safely and sms us when you get there.  the car has been serviced recently, so there shouldn't be any problems.  enjoy yourself."<br><br>just a short 3 yrs ago, the answer would have been, "you going to penang?  no need to ask us first is it?  no, cannot".  that would have been the end of the conversation.  my dad is not a person to argue with.  always the one with the last say.<br><br>in the recent yrs, he has learnt to change and he has acknowledged the changes in me too.  but, one thing i'm not too happy about ....... my younger sis is now reaping the benefits of the change in my dad!  he's not as strict with her as he was with me (flowing with the times  lolz)  just kidding!!  i luv my sis   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">   (though i used to hate her so much when i was young, but that's a totally diff story)</div>

Being able to communicate with your parents like an adult will solve your problem.

I'm pretty sure you'll be seeing more of 'injustice' in this society in the future...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>I believe what you're experiencing is a 'generation gap'.... Their form of mentality and thinking Vs yours....<br><br>You should understand that as much as it's hard for you to accept their kinda mentality, it's difficult for them to accept yours... No doubt, they could be outdated... In a world where parents command all respects and 'reasonings' are just secondary... Take a step backward... How many more years they'll get to have and enjoy as compared to your life? If it's difficult for you to accept their kinda thinking, I can only tell you it's probably much more difficult for them to accept yours.... Because they've been living on Earth much longer than you.. Not saying that they're much more experienced than you are... But probably they're suited longer with the mentality they're having now much longer than yours... It's kinda STUCK... Just kinda like stubborness... People who refuse to change their form of thinking... It's just that this is not exactly that... More of a subconscious thing....<br><br>You want better relationship with them? Give them good reasons to listen to you and believe in your words... Make them respect you and in turn respect them....<br><br>Regards...</div>
