              <p>Hi, I have made a thread regarding about this problem before: http://sgforums.com/forums/12/topics/485134 well, I have emailed to HDB to make a complaint about this problem and this is what they replied me:</p>

              <p>I believe that the neighbour have received the notice from HDB, but I guess they wasn't afraid and they allow their little kid to continue making the noise even louder such as running, jumping, playing with his scooter even at 10 pm to 1am (last night was 1 am), the kid make so much noise.</p>
              <p>I have tried talking to their parent before several times last year until the last one, they ignored me and continue to allow their kid to make so much noise. Last year on the November, it became quiet as I believe they go for oversea until the April of this year on the 3rd, they return and the kid starts to run and jump around.</p>
              <p>I doubt if I go to that mediation, it would not work, and I have also tired to use my tablet to record the noise the kid made during mid night last year, but it doesn't work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSBphVeS1nI so I do not know what to do anymore. Can anyone provide any other solution to this?</p>

              <p>tit for tat way? don't mind if you explain how does that work?</p>
              <p>Actually I have an idea, if I am one of the mp government, I would suggest that if the victim has sent an complaint email or receive complaint call to HDB, the neighbor would have receieved the first warning letter of not to disturb the residents staying below. If they ignored and allow their kids to make noises again, and if the victim send another complaint email or receive complaint call to HDB again, then HDB has the right to give the neighbor who create the noise nuisance by their kids a fine of $XXXXX amount of dollars. This could be a much better idea and problem is solved already. I doubt those noisy neighbor's kids above would not dare to make a single noise anymore</p>

              <p>Hi, two months ago, I am trying to capture the noises that the indian family's kid staying above my flat create using my tablet and I could not manage to capture them in my first attempt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSBphVeS1nI except if the kid is playing with his scooter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_QVWoxRVUY and what is worst, my parent doesn't allow me to make complaint to Town Council. I was pretty angry when they forbid me to make complaint.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>From time to time, I use two plastic medicine bottles to knock at my ceiling and it seems useless where the noises keeps on going, kid's jumping, running, stomping, playing with his scooter and even dragging chairs which is very annoying and disturbing,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the  7th of August 2015, the kid was ridding his scooter as usual. I 
              got fed up with the noise, so I would try using my bamboo pole to
               knocked at my ceiling hard. They could hear it as they asked their kid 
              to stop ridding the scooter and the sound of the scooter stop. It became
               quiet for the whole day until at 5 pm, the kid continues to run and 
              jump around for 15 minutes, so I use the bamboo pole to knocked at their
               ceiling again to stop the kid.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I did this whenever the Indian kid started to create noises such as 
              running, jumping and playing with his scooter for more than 15 minutes 
              and the kid kept on doing this everyday until I use my bamboo pole to 
              knock at my ceiling. Sometimes it will be very quiet for three 
              consecutive days and after that, it becomes noisy again and I have to 
              knock at their ceiling to shut them up.<br> <br> Till on the 24th of August 2015, the indian kid continues to make lots 
              of noise and I have to use my bamboo pole to knock at his ceiling again 
              to shut him up. However, he still continue to make so much noise and it 
              seems that they are not affected to it. <br> <br> What worries me is that I am not sure did his family use a recorder to 
              record the noise that I made when I was knocking at my ceiling on the 
              24th of August 2015, their kid even tries to make many noises during mid
               night as they are expecting that I might continue to use my bamboo pole
               to knock back at their floor so that they can record it to make a 
              complaint which I did not knocked during the mid night.<br> <br> Today, I have managed to capture the noises of the indian kid was making: <a href="https://youtu.be/Wd3UoYreouo?t=2m29s">https://youtu.be/Wd3UoYreouo?t=2m29s</a> and I did not use my bamboo pole to knock back at my ceiling, but here 
              is what I am worrying, I intend to secretly make a complaint to Town council and if I report the indian family and show 
              them the video of the indian kid was making the noise disturbing me, and
               if town council went to confront them, surprisingly the indian family 
              might have also recorded me on the 24th of August that I am using 
              something to knock at my ceiling, what will happen? will it be an 
              advantage or disadvantage to me?</p>
