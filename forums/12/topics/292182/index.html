While I was at univeristy I worked through a number of part-time jobs, making sure each one was different from the last, and for a short period after graduating I continued the strategy to widen my breadth of experience.  It's worked in my favour because the potential employers that I wanted to work with all had a focus on developing their staff, and because of their development focus, they recognised my strategy when reviewing my work history.  As such, it became a self-sorting process because I wasn't interested in working for someone who was going to pigeonhole me.</div>

If I go back to studies, I am giving away another 4 years of my prime time which can be invested in building career.<br><br>That is why I am in a dilemma.<br><br></div></blockquote>Just advice for you . I had a basic degree in nursing - nursing is all good and nice and caring but not where I see myself in. However I did not ditch the whole thing - a basic degree opens doors.<br><br>Instead of doing another bachelors, I choose to do a masters which will build on my nursing experience and then I specialised in a major . So now I have 2 sets of skills which can be used separately or together as value added qualifications.<br><br>You did an economics degree. Economics can be used everywhere. Health, finance , social etc. <strong>You have to think out of the box - economics does not mean you have to go into business or finance. </strong>Don't push your degree to the side. Use it as a base to build towards your interest. It is an investment and you build on that investment.<br><br>Tell me what is your field of interest and I might give you some pointers.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wah ...Studying freaks.. I used up 1 and half years for my degree..<br><br>Studying is juz about..getting it fast and quick..especially for a DEGREE..<br><br>Since you have been working as an admin for a few months and maybe a few year.. you know alot of candidates with a degree cant even find a job. This is so true. Almost everyone in the 20s and 30s are degree holders.<br><br>AND WHAT MAKES YOU DIFFERENT from others. ! is your experience and your hardworkingness.. your hardworkingness will WIN the day!<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>must say its interesting after some friends post their views that  provide insight into<br><br>this question -- yes , it still depends on what type of person ur -- ur the type whom dont want to<br><br>study  and force u to study is also futile (well ppl can view u as someone whom are not good these areas also in society  ) , n these are the ones (encountered many of them )  whom said :" ai yah , u ppl study so much ,now u dont have work<br><br>experiences or  "u sure cannot  contribute to my industry" ..on the contrary these are the ones whom think that they are good in their industry / with  "many" years of experience in the work force  , yah they are "experienced" , but they are the ones whom are lemon mind or  cant embraced the fact that they cant study;  they damn sure will be promoted with megre pay with so "many years of hard work" from the bottom ..( l eg. recent news about the 25 years  u grad whom got the CTO !! job just after having talk with the boss)  ; because u think u can feel the pulse of the area that u had started for so long, doesnt mean that ur a genius in your field ..while others had this in born capability that with brains also can contribute to the environment regardless of their inexperience as shown in above example ;<br><br>not to say those whom even study most of their 2/4 of life is deem a definite success in their environments /work ( there will be some minorities also ) , but<br><br>most importantly they can be more widely debated in their thinking , knowledge and philiosophy of the events/world , as compared to one whom decided<br>to work after "O " levels , and u noticed this is evident from the displayed maturity when u talk to them(the respect) .. so pursue your dream ulitmately<br><br></div>
