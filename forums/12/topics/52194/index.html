So if i got a biz rejection, i lose a biz. If she rejects me, i lose a friend. Sound bad now right... i noe i can still be friends with her, but the feeling wouldnt be the same anymore.. it would be somewhat awkward..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since u and ur buddy both like the ger, be frank with ur buddy u like her. DUn keep things fr him. If u do, he will hate u more. Though being frank tt u like the ger may cause u to lose ur buddy, it may also save u fr losing him. He may understand how u feel and since u be frank with him, i think if he understands he shld not be angry. So be frank.<br><br>As for the ger, if u like her, go after her. Let no one stop u fr doing it! I am sure u want to be with her and give her happiness.

Like MetalGear had said... If your buddy can't get her, doesn't mean other guys can't go for her... It could either be you or someone else... If your buddy is ok enough, you might let him know how you feel about the girl 1st before you take action...?<br><br>As for the risk you have to take between the chance of gaining a gf and the chance of losing a friend.... Nothing ventured, nothing gain... Ultimately the decision is still UP TO YOU....</div>

This is a scenario that could have happen, but not neccessary always.<br><br>5 years and still kept within your heart? Gosh, it must have felt really terrible deep inside you. The thing about expressing yourself is not about expressing for the sake of expressing - more importantly is what is your overall motive behind the declaring.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If getting it off your chest is the main thing - wait no further. You wouldn't wait until you die this lifetime and bring this regret with you to your grave. However, if your aim is to get her - stop hesitating and attempt. By remaining passive, yes - you wouldn't fail, however, you will never succeed either. By trying, you risk yourself to disapointment, but at least when you think back, you wouldn't regret not doing anything in the first place.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>OF COURSE, you attempt with plans and such - not hasty, anyhow, anti seductive chase. You move on steadily, hiding under cover as a friend to reach your goal - the capture of her heart.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Nobody says its easy. Nobody says its risk free. There is no best of both world many times in matters of the heart. You choose the best option and had to forego the rest - by calulating every single aspect and risk, you end up nothing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Everyone loves the pleasure and positive aspect of a relationship, remembers and even bear resentment over the negative areas, but hardly anyone bothers about this small, but critical point of a relationship.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Ok, lets come back to the basis of a aftermath relation. You figured out that one of your reasons of entering into a relationship was mainly due to the fact that you were afraid of being alone. The feeling of dependancy was the main attraction that lure you into one.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You mentioned that the last TWO were heart-breaking. If I were to say that the SECOND (Heart-breaking) one is just a relationship in trying to bring back the good-old stuff from the FIRST (heart-breaking) one - how well would you agree with me?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You are obsolutely right - Unstability is the one of the top few factor that one shouldn't even enter into a relationship even a potential draws near. For a fling, ONS, etc - it doesn't matter. If you long for a long fulfilling relationship - consider and ponder about your own love definition, expectations, experience, etc before making a decision. It helps you to gauge whether the girl is suitable for the YOU <strong>now</strong>, or it is just a repeat pattern of the past.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
