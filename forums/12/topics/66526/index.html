            <div class='col-md body'>That is why the guy should not have confessed or else this s-h-i-t will happen. That is the golden rule now, YOU NEVER EVER tell a girl you like her. At most you let your actions show it, because girls can never just isolate you based on your actions (unless your actions are really stupid ofcourse), they only isolate you based on what you said, since there is so much skepticalness about actions. Actions like smiling... pupils dilating and s-h-it like that.<br><br></div>

Simply, what makes the guy think that his caring is doing her any good?<br><br>Learn this: Respect personal space and allow time space to flow in and clarify the mind. The guy can like, but pressuring tactics won't work (Think why he failed twice). He can do the chase, but she can also reject - therefore the answer/problem lies on her part. The last thing he would want to do is to presume role like a bf (wah, she depressed must be first one to be there and comfort and tell me her sad tales, etc) - <strong>RESPECT PERSONAL SPACE</strong>. If she is comfortable to tell him, she would. He got worried, but then again, he is likely to be the source of her despair - in which she would rather calm down, think through and focus her attention on other issues. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Well... at least initially...<br><br>2 of us (me &amp; a friend of mine..) fell for this girl at the same time.... When the girl learnt about it, she was kinda miserable... 1st time being courted, she don't know what to do... She was like avoiding both of us... And much of the time I heard from her friend that she was miserable.... After some time I've finally decided to draw out from the situation... I thought of giving the guy (which was my friend) and the girl whom I was in love with a CHANCE... If she really loves him, I don't see why I should be stopping them... And if she's not interested in her, I'll go after her again...<br><br>Soon enough, they got together.... But that wasn't the sad thing... The sad thing was when I learnt that the guy already pulled alot of 'dirty tricks' on me... eg. like he threw away a drawing I did for her and left on her table for her birthday... I was PISSED... But in a way, I still took him as a 'friend'... So I actually asked him out together with our mutual friends for a meet up...<br><br>I told him that I've learnt about the things which he DID in order to win the heart of the girl... And how DESPICABLE I thought he was... He just kept mum... And guilty... He asked me how he could make up to me.... I told to take good care of the girl and never hurt her intentionally (I know that he's a flirt... Ok, I'm also a flirt... But that was years later lah...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) or I'll never forgive him....<br><br>Years later... I only got to see this girl a 2nd time. She was doing her U and outside her lecture threatre... I was with my poly friends, there for a project.... We didn't speak much... I was in a hurry....<br></div>

Well... at least initially...<br><br>2 of us (me &amp; a friend of mine..) fell for this girl at the same time.... When the girl learnt about it, she was kinda miserable... 1st time being courted, she don't know what to do... She was like avoiding both of us... And much of the time I heard from her friend that she was miserable.... After some time I've finally decided to draw out from the situation... I thought of giving the guy (which was my friend) and the girl whom I was in love with a CHANCE... If she really loves him, I don't see why I should be stopping them... And if she's not interested in her, I'll go after her again...<br><br>Soon enough, they got together.... But that wasn't the sad thing... The sad thing was when I learnt that the guy already pulled alot of 'dirty tricks' on me... eg. like he threw away a drawing I did for her and left on her table for her birthday... I was PISSED... But in a way, I still took him as a 'friend'... So I actually asked him out together with our mutual friends for a meet up...<br><br>I told him that I've learnt about the things which he DID in order to win the heart of the girl... And how DESPICABLE I thought he was... He just kept mum... And guilty... He asked me how he could make up to me.... I told to take good care of the girl and never hurt her intentionally (I know that he's a flirt... Ok, I'm also a flirt... But that was years later lah...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) or I'll never forgive him....<br><br>Years later... I only got to see this girl a 2nd time. She was doing her U and outside her lecture threatre... I was with my poly friends, there for a project.... We didn't speak much... I was in a hurry....<br></div></blockquote>Our Devil's sad past.<br><br>/me pat Devil  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
