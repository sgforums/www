              <p>Hey.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Guys/girls hopefully u all help me. U see, I recently got this job interview from this bar at clarke quay. My parents has been supporting me while I'm searching for my job and finally I got one which is in clarke quay. I'm really happy because out of all the job, this is the ONLY job that accept me to be part of their staff.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But when I told my parents the good news, they dont take it quite well. Because the time schedule is from 7pm - 3am. It got transportation for those who are going home after midnight though. And furthermore, its a bar. So my parents worried that I might turn into those "spoiled" son because I've been hanging out with my friends who were most of them quite a drinker but i didn't. But my parents are worried about me and showing me some ignorant/sad faces. I dont know whether i suppose to take this job or not. Pls guys help, are your parents sometimes like this?</p>

              <p>Ur parents' anxiety and concerns (though well-meant) is unhealthy in the sense that they are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">projecting their ideals</span> of what is 'good' and what is 'bad' on to u and i surmise that they expect u to conform.</p>
              <p>Be open and listen to their opinions/suggestions views but always<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> be aware</span>  n <span style="text-decoration: underline;">understand</span> this: they are not u and they cannot perceive or see 'things' as you see or would see.</p>
              <p>I would suggest be and do what u want to do with your life.

              <p>Being mature, Being responsible - u can be whatever u want to be and do with your life. It is nobody's business as long as it does not encroach or take away what another is or wants to be.</p>
              <p>In this instance, your parents concerns is understandable. However, by not letting u be they are not allowing u to evolve, to mature. Sure, u may mistakes or u may not. It is irrelevant.</p>
              <p> The point that i m trying to stress is that (even mine included) all suggestions/views/opinions proffered here having different perspectives: <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What matters is do they 'free' u . Do they resonate of u or with u?</strong></span></p>
              <p>Someone who cares for u will allow u to be and of course, by allowing u to be, they cannot assume responsiblity for what u are and do. That has to come from u.</p>
              <p>As long as u understand that you are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">being mature and being responsible</span> - u can b e whatever u want to. The maturity and the responsiblity of being oneself is more than enough to see u thru the course of everyday living. Things may be 'ok' and yet 'not be ok' - but u will manage!</p>
              <p>PS: What u were in the past or think u are or even what u want in your life is just thoughts, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">the real thing - <strong>what are u being now</strong></span>. Are u being mature, are u being responsible or even are u being kind, being ....</p>

              <p>Working in a bar is ok de... Even if u are female and u work as hostess, u're not stealing or commiting murder so it's ok...</p>
              <p>But do take note tat u lose alot of ur time when u work at night... It'll be very hard to meet up with ur frenz working in the day... Either they are working or u are working... Ur sleep timing is also disturpted... Do take note abt this when considering... Serious... Most people around ur age will think working in a bar is "Fun", "Cool", "Adult" etc... But actually it does comes with certain setbacks like i mentioned above...</p>
              <p>why not take a try? u can always work first and look for other jobs in the meantime... Btw u're only 18... Havent go in NS right? and are u going to study more? All this comes into consideration for ur future... I'm sure u're not going to work as a waiter in a bar for ur whole life...</p>

              <p>TS , are u the easily influence type?</p>
              <p>If u are. I suggest u not to work at bar. It is undeniable bar/pub area is complicated workplace.</p>
              <p>If u are clear mind and be quite sure what is right and wrong(Example: take drug under colleague influence). Go ahead for this job.</p>

              <p>Just prove your parents wrong and go for it.... It is just a part-time job anyway.</p>
              <p>Nothing wrong with working as a waitor at a bar man, it is still a job.</p>
              <p>Just like smoking and drinking, nothing wrong with those, but if you dont drink and smoke, dont pick them up. Keep a strong mind. If people there offer you to smoke, just say no politely. Learn to reject.</p>
              <p>I support you.... Good luck! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>

              <p>My concern for you is mainly health related....</p>
              <p>Bad environment (such as smoking, loud music) and also lack of sleep due to 3am work shift, which means maybe you sleep at 4am or more.</p>
              <p>I recommend you find a healthier one.</p>
