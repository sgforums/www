            <div class='col-md body'>A gal can definitely change her mind. However, in ur case,  u said she's a shy and friendly gal. That's the problem. A friendly gal will definitely be very nice to everyone ard her, sms/msn or meeting frequently don't really mean much. Furthermore, she has rejected u once. There may be a possibility that she thinks u have already taken the hint and move on, and hence lower her guard against u, not knowing u still like her.<br><br>But of course, I am not her so i don't know. All I can say is take things one at a time, try 2 find out from normal conversations if she's seeing anyone now, or if u are slowly becoming an impt part of her life.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by nanren4ever:</div><div class="quote_body">A gal can definitely change her mind. However, in ur case,  u said she's a shy and friendly gal. That's the problem. A friendly gal will definitely be very nice to everyone ard her, sms/msn or meeting frequently don't really mean much. Furthermore, she has rejected u once. There may be a possibility that she thinks u have already taken the hint and move on, and hence lower her guard against u, not knowing u still like her.<br><br>But of course, I am not her so i don't know. All I can say is take things one at a time, try 2 find out from normal conversations if she's seeing anyone now, or if u are slowly becoming an impt part of her life.</div></blockquote>ermm.. i did not remember saying she's a friendly girl.. she's the kind of gal who open up only after she felt comfortable knowing that person. Hmm.. ya she might lower her guard. but telling me about her schedule for the day without me asking. Isnt that too low?<br><br>No she is not seeing anyone now.<br><br>Another thing i notice recently is that she pass caring about ppl talking about us being to close compare to last time where she tend to avoid sitting beside during lesson or walking to the train station with me.</div>
