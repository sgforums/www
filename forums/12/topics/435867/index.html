            <div class='col-md body'><p>I am stucked in a relationship problem eventhough i am married but my marriage life isn't happy at all. I met this angmo guy whom has a thai gf, apparently not happy with her too. I met him last year and started off as friends, gradually we fell in love and dated for 6mths. During this 6mths, we spent alot of time together, travel together while he tries to break up with her and getting her to move out of her house. But she simply refused to accept the breakup and told him that I am a bad girl whom casted black magic on him. She wants him to leave me and then she will leave. of course apparently not the case. She threaten suicide by asking him to kill her with a knife and wanted to kill him too. She is with him for 7 years and living together, fully dependent on him. In this 6mths, i had happy times with him and we planned to move into another apartment together thinking that the thai girl will leave his old apartment when lease is up. On the day of moving, she threatened this time with taking sleeping pills and he soften seeing her almost died, i was waiting the whole nighht at the new apartment but he never appear. The next day he broke up with me. My whole life is shattered. I never expect that we worked so hard together for a relationship and in the end, he even allow that thai girl to move into the new apartment that is meant for us. He told me that he couldn't handle this anymore and he still love me but cannot take me for granted and be unfair to me anymore. I so believe in this relationship and so believe in a future with him. I am totally lost and don't know what to do now. I wanted to move on but its so difficult with a life without him. What is he thinking and is he actually truly serious about me? If he really does love me, why let go of me? Can someone please tell me what am i supposed to do?</p></div>

              <p>Precisely......no mention of where/how your husband comes into this if at all. I hope u know that for everyone else who reads this, u r cheating as much as the others u r mentioning.</p>
              <p>What r u supposed to do? Take a long hard look at yourself and make sure you know what you're doing, because there are other people involved.</p>
              <p>I sympathise for the Thai gal and your husb.</p>

              <p>Hi, I like your style of relationship, very open and bold. So sad that you lost your angmo bf, but nevermind, singapore got plenty of very cham ang mos, you can meet them anywhere, they just want to have someone to hold and do sex with them for free, look at how those foreign gals prosper under the ang mos, once this ang mos love it, how much they also paid, but they still prefer free ones, if there is any, so, i guess you fall into that kind of category, it should not be a problem for you to find another one.</p>
              <p>My advice to you is that you can mess with sg gal, pinoy gal, malaysia gal, PRC gal, india gal but never mess with thai or indo gal, you can end up sleeping in some mortuary. And also for ang mo, go for the German or Swiss, the rest are shit, and the eastern side, those poor ang mo are the worst. But what to do, typical sg aunties see ang mo only, water come out liao.

              The b iggest mistake is not loving him or falling in love with him.  Blaming him for your predicament is a cop out.  No one can save you. The archer who misses the target does not shift he target, he corrects his/aim or ... catch the drift?
              
              Beggarly love has nothing to share and offer excpeting using the word ''love'' but behind the curtain is all needs, expecations and worse is that of expecting that another fulfil you.
              Yes, it happens and look around, so many dead corpses like zombies.
              
              Bluntly put, it is a mutual benefit scheme. U look after me, i look after u . Love never hurts, one one thinks of oneself (not excluding needs, expectations all the undealt pysch baggage within oneself + what one has in terms of material ... ) is not one is. What one is not is one is. My standing in a garage does not make a car nor does my holding a book means I am reading it. 
              
              
              What is happening now is  a wake up call. Ang mo or Chinese or ... does not matter. What matters is what is becoming of you, the others are always an excuse, what u are matters.
              
              Circumstances dont make people - it is a veil of delusion. Circumstances reveal people.
              
              Only when one is self-honest (not to be confused with honesty) and has the courage to see within onself - ie, one's ..... and most importantly unlearning that aspect or reconciling to that polarizing, conflictual self can one ever be free. 
              
              Two impoverished beings (inner) cannot share cannot partake of one another. The only thing they can do is prop up with ''stuffs' or do things to prop up the relationship or marriage. It is nigh impossible to sustain this for long. The wise would strike a balance and understand that if one cannot relate to oneself, ie, one 'self'', it is not possible to relato another.

              <p>Hi, I like your style of relationship, very open and bold. So sad that you lost your angmo bf, but nevermind, singapore got plenty of very cham ang mos, you can meet them anywhere, they just want to have someone to hold and do sex with them for free, look at how those foreign gals prosper under the ang mos, once this ang mos love it, how much they also paid, but they still prefer free ones, if there is any, so, i guess you fall into that kind of category, it should not be a problem for you to find another one.</p>
              <p>My advice to you is that you can mess with sg gal, pinoy gal, malaysia gal, PRC gal, india gal but never mess with thai or indo gal, you can end up sleeping in some mortuary. And also for ang mo, go for the German or Swiss, the rest are shit, and the eastern side, those poor ang mo are the worst. But what to do, typical sg aunties see ang mo only, water come out liao.
