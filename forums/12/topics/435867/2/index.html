              <p>Hi, I like your style of relationship, very open and bold. So sad that you lost your angmo bf, but nevermind, singapore got plenty of very cham ang mos, you can meet them anywhere, they just want to have someone to hold and do sex with them for free, look at how those foreign gals prosper under the ang mos, once this ang mos love it, how much they also paid, but they still prefer free ones, if there is any, so, i guess you fall into that kind of category, it should not be a problem for you to find another one.</p>
              <p>My advice to you is that you can mess with sg gal, pinoy gal, malaysia gal, PRC gal, india gal but never mess with thai or indo gal, you can end up sleeping in some mortuary. And also for ang mo, go for the German or Swiss, the rest are shit, and the eastern side, those poor ang mo are the worst. But what to do, typical sg aunties see ang mo only, water come out liao.

              <p>I am stucked in a relationship problem eventhough i am married but my marriage life isn't happy at all. I met this angmo guy whom has a thai gf, apparently not happy with her too. I met him last year and started off as friends, gradually we fell in love and dated for 6mths. During this 6mths, we spent alot of time together, travel together while he tries to break up with her and getting her to move out of her house. But she simply refused to accept the breakup and told him that I am a bad girl whom casted black magic on him. She wants him to leave me and then she will leave. of course apparently not the case. She threaten suicide by asking him to kill her with a knife and wanted to kill him too. She is with him for 7 years and living together, fully dependent on him. In this 6mths, i had happy times with him and we planned to move into another apartment together thinking that the thai girl will leave his old apartment when lease is up. On the day of moving, she threatened this time with taking sleeping pills and he soften seeing her almost died, i was waiting the whole nighht at the new apartment but he never appear. The next day he broke up with me. My whole life is shattered. I never expect that we worked so hard together for a relationship and in the end, he even allow that thai girl to move into the new apartment that is meant for us. He told me that he couldn't handle this anymore and he still love me but cannot take me for granted and be unfair to me anymore. I so believe in this relationship and so believe in a future with him. I am totally lost and don't know what to do now. I wanted to move on but its so difficult with a life without him. What is he thinking and is he actually truly serious about me? If he really does love me, why let go of me? Can someone please tell me what am i supposed to do?</p>

              <p><br>I did not say ang mo are not faithful, they are faithful and responsible, but to many partners, if you want to love a ang mo, which typically asian women loves to have becos of their  manners, gracefulness and good looking, you must prepare to be shock that he still got other asian gfs.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;"><em>Y'know, every time in America some guy gets caught cheating, every media outlet does the same story: "Why Do Men Cheat?" Oh, take a wild fucking guess, would you? I think you're over-thinking this. They're not looking for fantasy, they're looking for...sex. That's it! They want sex. And not just sex; they want new sex. The way women want new shoes. Right? You have shoes, they're perfectly good shoes, you don't want those shoes, you want new shoes. - Bill Maher</em></span></p>
