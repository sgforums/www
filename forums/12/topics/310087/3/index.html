              <p>to those who kept asking if i'm les or not,</p>
              <p>it is for you to judge and not for me to care. seriously i don't care if i'm les or not. the most pressing problem here is about how i can control my feelings for my best friend and how not to ruin this extremely precious friendship bond.</p>
              <p>to <strong>Isis</strong></p>
              <p>i see. from what i have tried so far, is that i have already tried to talk to more of my friends recently instead of not contacting them. i make effort to msg them of what's happening in my life and i bother to chat with them on msn more often. i just hope that perhaps by socialising more, i can figure out what is my true feelings for my best friend.</p>
              <p>to <strong>VL</strong></p>
              <p>I don't see that there is a need for me to see a doctor, unless you are trying to say that i have mental problems or whatsoever. and about me being straight or not,  even i don't have the answer. and lastly, i didn't like more than 1 girl at a time. i said i had feelings for let's say 2-3 girls in the past. now my best friend is one of them and she is the one who i had the strongest feeling amongst the rest.</p>
              <p>to <strong>tinuviel07</strong></p>
              <p>not sure what ur comment towards VL means but somehow i tik u're thinking at the same wavelength as me.</p>
              <p>to <strong>CrabbyShaSha</strong></p>
              <p>haha thanks for ur support and encouragement, really appreciate it. and i can't distance myself away from her cos i really do hope to be friends with her for many many years to come. however, the only thing i can do is to try not to be overly-nice to her anymore.</p>
              <p>to <strong>Beyond religion</strong></p>
              <p>wow you're quite smart. yes i'm only 18 this year. i also wondered if other people of my age experience this issue the same way as i did. However i don't seem to find anyone else within my social circle. This of course makes me feel even worst, as if i'm doomed to be on the road to lesbianism. because i really hope to be straight as my family and friends will definitely not accept me being not straight. and thanks for reminding me that i'm still young and shouldn't bother myself too much about the future. But just to let u know that i've been like this for the past 3 years, so i don't know how much longer my feelings will start to fade.</p>

              <p>ANd will this affect your r/s?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many things to think about, sometimes u just need to go slow and see the situation. Since she has a bf, its best not to tell her bout this.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if u really need to tell, then just do it..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>why think so much, watever happen will happen later.. better than u seeking advice here when you already wanted to tell her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway, u should care if you are les or not.. its for u to think in future which way u want to go.</p>

              <p>Some people grow up from same sex love and take a ride back on the right track. <em>Maybe you are really gay for a moment.</em></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Though i don't think being gay is wrong but there is alot of consideration being someone who is different in this society. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I have a gay friend who has tried out a straight relationship but end up dwindling into the crooked path cos he does not find the kind of happiness he wants. I have a bestie from my sec school day who went back to conventional relationship, after few years of relationship with a butch. And i have another fren who has an off and on relationship with both sexes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, from i see, i think you are a lesbian-pro. Does not mean you are a lesbian for life. Happiness is determined, in my opinion, by being with the right person, regarding of their sexual orientation, though sexuality is an important factor. </p>

              <p>to angel7030,</p>
              <p>if u are trying to help me, sorry but i can't allow myself to simply just hang out with many girls in order to treat them as subsitutes to divert my attention from this girl..</p>

              <p>and hey Lorry, long time nv see u online..</p>
              <p>really, i din know that by her actions, she might know something..</p>
              <p>and yeah.. i understand that.. but i just felt like as if i disgraced myself in front of her n her bf.. it hurts alot though. like god is making me even worse right in front of them..</p>
              <p>and yesterday she msg me this , " hey if you're unhappy in anyway..i apologise.. "</p>
              <p>but i told her " it's okay just forget it.. "</p>
              <p>den she msg me back " but u still sounds unhappy..but i noe u'll react in that way..anyway sorry.. heard that u fell because of that. "</p>
              <p>so sad! she actually knew i fell.. but i didn't let her know that my back still hurts and my left elbow got bruised [ cos we went out as a clique today to celebrate someone's birthday ]</p>
              <p>sighs. i feel sad. i din really tok to her today when we went out as a clique..</p>

              <p>Hey, i can sympathise with u, cause im in a same situation myself. But i do know in my case, i would criticise the guy very badly whenever she meets one, hoping that she would not go out with him. Sadly, she did told me that she went out with this guy who was 3 yrs younger than her. I was crushed. </p>
              <p>What I did was just recently, I told her i was gay. She was quite acceptable about it, and even tried to push me into confessing which is the girl i like. I think im in a better situation den you cause she and the guy are no longer in contact and I have purposely gotten into the same sch so as to be close to her and "watch her surroundings", hence she is still single right now. =p</p>
              <p>So I wish you all the best, and hope the best for the 2 of us. btw, I love her since sec 1, till now in poly going on to yr 2, so dont be too discourage by the long period. </p>
