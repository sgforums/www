            <div class='col-md body'>Sigh. again, i think most forumer here give all sort of "TS already knew" answer. which is to break up and ignore that guy. if only so simple.<br><br>1) TS already mentioned some dark secret with that jerk, so confrontation and breakup with him is a less than clever move. u never know wad a jerk will do.<br><br>2) finding police? huh? okok, assuming police take charge of this case, still no point, he will still "revenge" and make hell for TS. Exposing her dark secret.<br><br>say for example, a video such as tammy's one. TS will be the one to end up dead first not that jerk.<br>TS is not an idiot btw.<br>The way she organises her post, lingo.. etc tells so.<br><br>I do not have any constructive advice for any sort of this situation though..<br>i'm thinking if you knew any of his brothers, who might be close to u enough to talk to him? or some of your "fierce" frds that he's scared of to confront..<br><br>i feel finding police is only the last alternative.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey people<br>Thank you for your advice<br>&amp; Scoldings, in hope of making me wake up to reality (Betty?)<br>I'm new here &amp; this is my first thread so I was glad that there was so many responses (:<br><br>Truth is.. Yes, I know that my relationship is bad for me &amp; I know I should end it. But it's a matter of whether I want to. However, I'm not here to complain to you guys about my unhealthy relationship. Instead, I asked (in the title) "What should I do to stand up for myself?"<br><br>He pointed a sharp razor at me &amp; I just stood there silently. Not because I didn't dare to agitate him, but instead, I sigh and just don't know what to do anymore.<br><br>I'm afraid that I will "get used" to his bullying. Because, as of today, I've been with him for a year already. Our ridiculous fights are becoming, sometimes, a little routine. I want to know what I can do to change him. How do you change someone like that? I know many of you will think "How should I know? You're his girlfriend!", but sometimes, I just wanna give up trying to change him.</div>
