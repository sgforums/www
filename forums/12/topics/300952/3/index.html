            <div class='col-md body'>What's the point of trying to change something that does not WANT to be changed?<br><br>It's like you're trying to push a wall. Does the wall want to move?<br><br>If the wall will move 1 cm for you, then maybe he will change.<br><br>(I mean a proper wall like the walls at a void deck)<br><br>Since it's obvious he doesn't want to change and doesn't care that you want him to change, it's a waste of your time to care about changing him.<br><br>If you really want to change him, leave him. If he loves you, he will change for you and come back for you.<br><br>At this point it's also obvious that he doesn't love you.<br><br>If you love someone, that person would be more important than yourself (like how you care about his future, his grades, his happiness etc.)<br><br>Does he care about what happens to you? Not really. He just wants to have you for his own happiness.<br><br>Oh and please do the break up in a public place with PEOPLE nearby. Not at his home, not at your home, not at a void deck.<br><br>I don't want you to get hurt - in the situation where he MAY decide to actually use the sharp object. If there are people around, he should not dare and even if he did, at least people will see.<br><br>Even without a sharp object, if he realises you are REALLY leaving him this time, he just might go crazy - oh and when he does, pls b strong n dont listen to whatever he says. do it, and go.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Yuki~!:<br><strong>Dear AA,<br>I'm 16 going on 17 this year and I've been attached to my bf for almost a year now<br>I think that he's no good for me but I just can't say no to him.<br><br>[b]1. He distracts me from my studies</strong><br>He doesn't really encourage me to study. Even when my very important O levels were nearing, we often quarrel because I wanted to study and he wouldn't let me because he didn't want to end our phone conversation. For that, my studies has gone down the drain. I just wish he could be a little more supportive. I hate to quarrel with him.<br><br><strong>2. He constantly spends my money</strong><br>He's always broke &amp; always asking me to pay for things, saying that "Money is meant to be spent". He would plead with me to lend him money &amp; I ALWAYS give it to him. &amp; He almost never returns the money I lend him. I spent more than a $1000 on him last year.<br><br><strong>3. He ABUSES me</strong><br>He verbally abuses me. When we fight, he would scold me vulgarities (eg: calling me a f***ing b****) and humiliate me, if he got the chance. When I told him I want to break up with him, he would threaten me, saying that "he would make my life hell". He also threatened to tell my dirty secrets to the world.<br><br><strong>4. He's ruining his own future</strong><br>He's retained in Secondary 3 for the 2nd time this year. I, as a girlfriend, feel a little ashamed when my friends asks me why my boyfriend is 17 and still in school. He constantly skips school (&amp; tells me to do so too, sometimes). I try to tuition him and wake him up every morning to make sure he goes to school but my efforts usually goes to waste when I get his report book. I mean, if he wants to marry me in the future (that's what he claims), how on earth can he support me?<br><br><strong>5. He's violent &amp; bad-tempered</strong><br>I'm afraid to make him really, very angry. I mean, he gets angry over the most ridiculous things. There was this one time, during a fight, he pushed me &amp; I fell backwards. I cried my eyes out but he didn't give a damn. Several times he used sharp objects to scare me so that I give in to our little argument, eg: Beer bottle &amp; razor<br><br>I feel very lost as I really have a lot of feelings for this guy. But he really bullies me. In short, he is a delinquent &amp; I know I have become one, too, under his influence. But I want to change because it's a new year &amp; I want to go to Poly to start things fresh.<br><br>How can I say no to this guy who's still is Sec 3 this year &amp; isn't at the same level of thinking as me? Is there any way I can turn him around? See the way I see things? I feel that if I break up with him, I'll regret because I love him a lot. He told me many times that he really loves me a lot. But why do I feel otherwise? Please help  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> [/b]</blockquote><span style="color: green;">he's still young.. if u don feel right jus break up..<br><br>and be with me then  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">If you feel that your partner's no longer fixated on you, its time for you to trash things out, and find someone else who is able to appreciate your undiscovered beauty. A relationship's supposed to be filled with lusciousness and utmost endearments. Love isn't all about relinquishments and sacrifices, instead, it should be an art of compromising and accepting each other. No point trying to hold back, or to keep something which you have a strong affection for. One sided relationships are frigid and only arouse more dejections. </span></div>
