Yes, I know that my relationship is bad for me &amp; I know I should end it. But it's a matter of whether I want to. However, I'm not here to complain to you guys about my unhealthy relationship.

Not because I didn't dare to agitate him, but instead, I sigh and just don't know what to do anymore.<br><br>I'm afraid that I will "get used" to his bullying. Because, as of today, I've been with him for a year already. Our ridiculous fights are becoming, sometimes, a little routine. I want to know what I can do to change him. How do you change someone like that? I know many of you will think "How should I know? You're his girlfriend!", but sometimes, I just wanna give up trying to change him.</div></blockquote>Scolding?

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Yuki,<br><br>I felt sorry for you that you are caught in this situation.<br><br>First of all, you have put it across clearly how lousy you can speak of your bf. In this case, since you have already made up your mind that he is not your Mr Right,  you should walk out out of your trapped area before anything else can take place.<br><br>You should know a little background of him before you even started off with him right?<br><br>Then why in the first place do you choose him over your studies? Yes, love is blind, but don't forget you are living in the modern world, human tends to be realistic over qualifications, money &amp; looks. &amp; I doubt you are any different.<br><br>You have to admit that you despised him in many ways, you felt ashamed of his education level due to his age, you look down on him because he is poor, you loathed him because his behavior is utterly a disappointment to you...and so on. I mean why do you still stick with him if you don't find anything you can feel proud in him?<br><br>I am a woman, but if I were your bf, I will be very sad to find out that my gf actually condemned me to this state.<br><br>If you really want to have your own life back and be happier, the only way is to leave him.<br><br>What for you continue this relationship just because you are afraid that he might hurt you or whatever? You have to be mature enough to think for yourself. There are many means of ending a relationship that doesn't work.<br>Your studies for O'level can be one of the most essential reason, your parents objection... you don't have to break up with him focusing on his flaws. Everyone has flaws, it's only whether you are able to accept or the other party is willing to change. It takes two hands to clap Yuki.<br><br>If only you allow this to continue, no one can stop you. It's not really about standing up for yourself, it's just that you are both living in a different world, maybe different family background, brought-up, circle of friends..etc.<br><br>No one can influence the negative impact of life unless you allow yourself to indulge in it and gets deeper.<br><br>If you let him go, one day he will too give you some space to breathe. &amp; who knows he may be able to find another person who can understand his plight and you are better off with some knowledgeable &amp; well-to-do guys! We'll never know.<br><br>Nonetheless, All the best to your O'level. Never let this affect your studies if not you will regret for your whole life like me. I have repeated my O levels too due to my relationship, but I can only blame myself for not being able to prioritize. We have to be fair to others at times. Sometimes we will naturally arrowed at others when things didn't turn out as expected.. we should reflect it on ourselves too. What have you been doing for yourself instead of blaming others?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by kiekie:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi Yuki,<br><br>I felt sorry for you that you are caught in this situation.<br><br>First of all, you have put it across clearly how lousy you can speak of your bf. In this case, since you have already made up your mind that he is not your Mr Right,  you should walk out out of your trapped area before anything else can take place.<br><br>You should know a little background of him before you even started off with him right?<br><br>Then why in the first place do you choose him over your studies? Yes, love is blind, but don't forget you are living in the modern world, human tends to be realistic over qualifications, money &amp; looks. &amp; I doubt you are any different.<br><br>You have to admit that you despised him in many ways, you felt ashamed of his education level due to his age, you look down on him because he is poor, you loathed him because his behavior is utterly a disappointment to you...and so on. I mean why do you still stick with him if you don't find anything you can feel proud in him?<br><br>I am a woman, but if I were your bf, I will be very sad to find out that my gf actually condemned me to this state.<br><br>If you really want to have your own life back and be happier, the only way is to leave him.<br><br>What for you continue this relationship just because you are afraid that he might hurt you or whatever? You have to be mature enough to think for yourself. There are many means of ending a relationship that doesn't work.<br>Your studies for O'level can be one of the most essential reason, your parents objection... you don't have to break up with him focusing on his flaws. Everyone has flaws, it's only whether you are able to accept or the other party is willing to change. It takes two hands to clap Yuki.<br><br>If only you allow this to continue, no one can stop you. It's not really about standing up for yourself, it's just that you are both living in a different world, maybe different family background, brought-up, circle of friends..etc.<br><br>No one can influence the negative impact of life unless you allow yourself to indulge in it and gets deeper.<br><br>If you let him go, one day he will too give you some space to breathe. &amp; who knows he may be able to find another person who can understand his plight and you are better off with some knowledgeable &amp; well-to-do guys! We'll never know.<br><br>Nonetheless, All the best to your O'level. Never let this affect your studies if not you will regret for your whole life like me. I have repeated my O levels too due to my relationship, but I can only blame myself for not being able to prioritize. We have to be fair to others at times. Sometimes we will naturally arrowed at others when things didn't turn out as expected.. we should reflect it on ourselves too. What have you been doing for yourself instead of blaming others?<br></div></blockquote>Ok, thanks for sharing <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
