              <p><br>go see a plastic surgeon lor,</p>
              <p>think they should have cream to reduce scarring.</p>
              <p>if it's burns you can use special plaster sold in Guardian</p>
              <p>the plaster doesn't come cheap</p>
              <p>one piece can cost up to hundred plus.</p>

              </p><p>use proactiv solution.</p>
              <p>I had been using it for 3 years now.</p>
              <p>The results is GREAT!</p>
              <p>But must use it everyday, twice a day, mask depend on yr sis's case.</p>
              <p>Cant see much results in one month, maybe two or three month will be obvious.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For scar, use</p>
              <strong>Mederma®. best use 3 to 4 times a day. but once the cream dry, it will like peeling off from your skin, so the best is apply when yr sis is sleeping.</strong><p></p>
              <p>Good luck</p>
