            <div class='col-md body'>Well..... as a friend you should let her know that the way she treat you and her Bf is not making both of you happy ... YOU as a FRIEND should let her know that ... whether she like it or not... you have to tell her... cos ... YOU are her friend.... YOu know true friends don't come easily so if you really treasure her... let her know her faults and ask her to IMPROVE on it... want her to change overnight it is impossible... but you try to let her know ... if she gets angry after you make known to her... tell her... "I TREAT you as a friend then i tell you loh... " but if she still don realise wat she do is making you upset.... well.... just remind her again.. don get piss off when she gets angry with you ... be patience with her... cos i guess she is still very imature in her thinking ... she is just like a small little gal... so... try to be patience loh... and always think of the good side of her...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well i think u have revealed the main of the problem. that is the pampering from her bf. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked">  i have to say its how her bf gave her that chance to change towards this sort of behaviour. my ex was once like that but i stood my ground cos i tot it was unreasonable and she said i didnt love her good enuff to do all that. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>however as friends, u may have talked to her but i think u have to let her know that u are concerned as friends and hope that she listens at least to wat u have to say. she may be thinking that u are insulting her in a way (cos of her "new" thinking) and not actually listen to you at all. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  U may need help from people ard her as well, esp her bf. but i think it may go seriously wrong if she sees it in the bad way, but do have a talk to her bf if u can and find out what he thinks. if he is okie about it then i think u may have a hard problem to solve cos it may be the main fuel towards her "new and improved" behaviour.<br><br>she is a lucky person to have u as friend.<br><br>Good luck and all the best in trying to talk to her. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

I think she is really lucky to have u as a best friend. I think she is only immature, but with this incident hope she can know tat she was wrong n willing to change for good to be a good best fren for u too.

            <div class='col-md body'>i admire your tolerence.<br><br>nobody likes to quarrel, let alone with one of your good friends. but it is important to note that friendship is about helping one another in life.<br><br>and what you are doing is not helping her at all. who knows, u might make her take everything even more for granted.<br><br>would anyone be bothered to find out it is like to be living in a war if he/she has been born in a all-peaceful environment?<br><br>similarly, not many are gifted with the initiative to realise what they have until they lose it. based on how your friend is behaving, do u think she has this ability?<br><br>sometimes, friends getting into serious conversation and argument is not a bad thing after all. it helps one another to learn what is expected of themselves.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hello,<br><br>well after reading wat u updated i have to say that u need a serious talk wh\ith her bf first. firstly, she knows that by initiating a break-up, the bf will go back to her and give in. she knows how to deal with the cards. Now she know that this deal will always work when she wants her way. If her bf really loves her and wanna be with her too, he has to change her approach and also make his stand. if she doesn't take soft, then he has to go hard. make his stand firmly but not angrily. he has to tell her himself that it cannot work like this anymore and she has to change.<br><br>ask the bf if he is willing to see her br like that for the rest of his life probably.?? treating not only him but every other person around like that as well. personally i would not.. esp towards my buddies. and that's wat i did, i made my stand to my ex and told her exactly wat i will do and not do for her...<br><br>the bf has to realise that its not about doing things for her but for himself. if he has to scold her then he should. if she doesnt listen or doesnt talk to him about it after he brings it up, i can be sure he doesnt stand a place in her heart anymore and probably showing off to other people about her "slave" bf. this relationship will never work deifinitely.<br><br>howvever, please do not give up hope. as the chinese saying goes, saving a person is more than building a seven storey pagoda.. nothing is ever more impt in helping others when u can, esp to those who matter to you.<br><br>please keep on trying.</div>
