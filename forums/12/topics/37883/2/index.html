            <div class='col-md body'>Its been some time liao... so how U feeling now, Blowy? OR Fishy? Or Blowj**.... sorry, out of context... ^^''''''<br><br>If things still never change or turned for da worst... Stop contacting her... for da moment... Take some time to reflect on wat U REALLY wan... who U happy wif, where is da place U r happy in, when it happened, how it happened &amp; WHY...<br><br>But U muz remember, no matter how unhappy U r, theres always some1 worse off... not bcoz of r/s but bcoz of simple lifestyle dat person or more yearned to have... Like in da current Iraqi war, how many wanted to end it? I dun wanna tok more abt dis... abit sensitive...<br><br>Point is: U r fortunate to have wat a normal person have &amp; wat worse off ppl would yearn to have. Cherish all things &amp; ppl U love &amp; care for ard U. U will be happy.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

I do really need u people advise....<br><br>It like this. I had a gf which i love her alot. But the problem is she do not like to communicate. She seldom call me (once a mth) and i sometimes feel no love from her. Why she wan me to be her bf when she don even try to find out how i feel....<br><br>I told her b4 that i dont feel much love from her but she never change even though she say she try. I hint her that my ex is much more caring than her and  blar balr.... but she had no reaction. She did not feel jeoloues or what!!!!<br><br>I did a lot for her, most romantic things everything, what i ask for is jus to show me her love ... is it too much to ask for? Guy still need love and care from the ladies....<br><br>I think am giving up this relationship for good. Love is just like onion, the deeper u peel, u only end up in tears.
