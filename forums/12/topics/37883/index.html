Hey, it takes 2 hands to clap. If you feel that you have tried ur very best and yet she doesn't respond to your pleas, then maybe it's time for you to break it up and move on. You can't be the one who's giving all the time. Come on, you're a man; it's time to show who's wearing the trousers. Women are picky abt being discriminated of being the weaker link themselves and now, they are having the best seats. Hey, they can't always take advantage of that, can they? Enough is enough. I'll say: Be the man!<blockquote>It is not fair to ask of others what you are not willing to do yourself.</blockquote></div>

BUT one thing u got to bear in mind.... U dun ask ppl to change for u or for ur benefit... when u are in a relationship with the person, u haf to accept who she is and how she is like.... if there is any changes needed, its by eac individual and not demanded by ur partner...<br><br>U haven even try to salvage the relationship and u wan to give up.. let me ask u: y did u be in a rls with her? do u love her? if u do, u got to try to make ur point clear to her.. mayb she dun feel tt u love her enuff... and worse come to worse if it doesnt work out, u still need to tell her... a silence walking away isnt too good of a thing for a guy to do.... it can hurt u more and hurt the ger as well....<br><br>so try ur best to communicate with her... if it doesnt relly work out, at least tell her and let her noe.. dun walk away without any sound...</div>

Its pretty strange eh, for a someone to be in a relationship and to remain so passive eh?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Its strange, but its not impossible and the only possible reason is that, sad to say, I suspect she accepted you for the sake of accepting, with her feelings remaining aloof. Call once a month? Ask any happy lasting couple around, they will tell you this is outrageous. You don't have to call every single minute, but once a month is certainly an issue you ought to look into and from this point, again, it shows how shallow her liking for you too. (Call also nvm, don't call also nvm.)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You said you did alot of romantic thing - but I guess you failed to achieve something; to fully grasp her heart, feeling, emotions and thoughts. She is treating you like a casual friend isn't it? (correct me if I am wrong)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>My advice is not give up without a proper fight; you came into this relationship and you did work hard to create a good relation, however you must alter your ways of doing. My suggestion is...<br><br>I) Stop hinting, speak from your heart. Don't presume that by hinting she will get the message. If she is inferior by nature and by mentioning how your ex treat you better than she is, she is going to mantain distance with you even further. Date her, find some suitable place and have a heart to heart communication with her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Four things you must Remember. <strong>Don't</strong>...<br><br>I) Raise your voice to get message across - it never work.<br>II) Speak round in bush or mention something not really that relevant between the both of you (e.g. You ex lar, etc)<br>III) Avoid eye contact; always look into her eye.<br>IV) Expect things will change, time is needed. Tell her you want to see her effort in trying to work for this relation (I said work for this relation, not as in change - alot of difference). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>II) After this talk with her. When she did try to do something for the relation, you must encourage and lead her on. She will feel better and would persist. Psychologically, this is called reinforcing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Always expect the worst, but tell yourself you gonna best your best.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Well pal, I have to comment that you did a great job to trying for a workable relationship. LIke what you have said... if she doesn't want to do anything about it - its time to review what are the options left for you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Look for someone who appreciate you and all your doings - you will live a better life. I got this feeling perhaps she doesn't want to be in the relationship already, just that she doesn't know or want to say the word 'breaking up'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers (Slap a pat on blowfish's back)<br></div>

Communication doesn't have to be verbal... Or maybe she is da quiet type? (psychic type???). U dun actually have to do romantic stuffs for her (maybe she dun buy dat...). Maybe all she needs is yr presence? Maybe she lacks human relationship skills or smth similar? Watever it is, take TIME to noe MORE abt her &amp; analyse da situation. Maybe U'll discover a quality she possess dat very few have &amp; will envy? But if U tink its juz a waste of time, clear out EVERYTHING face to face.<br>And remember 1 thing: "There are all kinds of people out there" (My trademark sig  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> )</div>
