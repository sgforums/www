That is not something people should avoid considering. You get married to have sex, (not just and not only, of course) to put it more crudely.<br><br>If one party have physical needs vastly more than their spouse... that spells trouble down the line.<br><br>As for the particular post I made... I am not suggesting that the girl is wild.<br><br>I am saying that while she is not willing to indulge in anything physical now, at this stage of the relationship... (she believes in maintaining pre-marital physical purity during courtship, for example)... the situation might change when she is married.<br><br>She might turn out to be "an animal", "wild" in bed <strong>after</strong> she is married...<br><br>How would anyone know unless you marry her and see for yourself? You can have the opinion that she is so shy now, she would be like that after marriage... people change... but you take the risk...  they might change when the circumstance change or they might NOT change....<br><br>TS is "into" physical relationships (as many guys are) and the girl is not so keen (as many girls are, not so keen).<br><br>I see people saying things like " u're not the man for her" suggesting that TS is at fault... I am trying to go beyond apportioning blame.<br><br>I am saying that one should not brush aside physical/sexual incompatibility... it can be very serious and make or break a marriage (can be, not absolute)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>that just sounds so wrong. what needs are we talking about here...it's a fact that a girlfriend and a boyfriend should at least be able to sit next to each other without feeling uncomfortable (esp after 3 months together). and if they cant even do that they should just slow down and go on as friends cos they're obviously not ready to date (at least not each other)<br><br>just my opinion...</div>

After all these months of being there for her, going out of my way to help her, showing her concern, always lending a listening ear,...  she doesn't seem to appreciate it.<br><br>For example, when I put my hand on her shoulder, she squirms. Or when I sit close to her, she keeps and inch. This is disturbing, as these subtle hints seem to say that she doesn't trust me? If that were the case, she should not have allowed us to be in a relationship in the first place. But everything else is fine.<br><br>It is tough for a guy to be in a relationship where there is hardly even the slightest contact. The relationship feels cold. Why do girls not understand this? And it is even harder for guys to explain this to the girl.<br><br>What's the best step forward now?</div></blockquote>to her you may not seem NEEDing to touch her etc... you simply seem WANTing to touch her only... for girls, alot of things connect to the heart... u gotta go to the heart 1st dude.</div>
