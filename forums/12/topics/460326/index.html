              <p>the older you get the less friends you have. sometimes they scold you out of goodwill. whether that's the case only you know.</p>
              <p>ocassionally you may also meet some people who have the need to put others down so that they feel better themselves.</p>

              <p>If you don't want to be lambasted.</p>
              <p>You need to learn to keep your mouth shut and stop moaning and complaining about every little setbacks in your life.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I get it that sometimes women especially... love to complain... it's just to get some support and agreement ..we use it as a tool to conversation. you don't really want them to solve the problem for you....becuase you think you are <strong>JUST sharing</strong>.</p>
              <p>BUT...when you constantly moan and complain... some friends may think you you are just WEAK and UNABLE to resolve issues on your own. Learned-self helplessness.</p>
              <p>They are not there to rip you down... they thought they were administering "TOUGH LOVE". They are teaching you how not to be a victim...</p>
              <p>But because you are just there to moan... you actually don't want to do what they tell you... so you act wishy washy as a form of rejection .... giving lame excuse after lame excuse... in the end.. your friends get frustrated and start to lambast you....</p>
              <p>I suggest you go read the book "</p>
              <h1 class="parseasinTitle "><span id="btAsinTitle">A Complaint Free World: How to Stop Complaining and Start Enjoying the Life You Always Wanted" - by Will Bowen.<br></span></h1>
              <p>However... i'm quite sure you are never gonna go read that book anyway.. because that's not what you want to hear...what you want is a pityfest...  you want us to support you and vilify your "friends"....so you feel <strong>validated</strong>.</p>
              <p>Your life will be a constant flow of complaining and moaning.. and how people don't want to understand you..... then you will eventually realise.. why is it you have less and less friends.. and your family start to stay away from you....the end is never a good one.</p>
              <p>So , it's up to you... blaming others will not help... you need to change yourself.</p>

              As you grow older you learned. There are people to you that may seemed cruel to you when they spoke to you straight forward. It is better for them to speak like that to you so you would get the picture and meaning clearly rather than for them going around the bush to let you know what you should know. Other people can see your situation better sometimes than your own self. There are many people outthere. Though they may have the same natural hair colour, their hearts are different. I feel that the closest person you should talk about this matter is your own husband first before you approach your own family members, friends and strangers. Welcome to the real world.

              <p>Firstly, your self-worth ideally should not be built on the opinions or approval of others. It should be anchored on yourself and what's best for you.</p>
              <p>Secondly, your friends may or may not have the best intentions for you when they scold you, and then admonish you for being 'soft'. I know there are some who believe in a harsher way of 'education' i.e. swim or sink method, but I think a nurturing and supportive environment is more conducive to building up a person, friend or family member.</p>
              <p>Third, it's natural to feel lousy after being caught in such a situation. I hope however that you are not in that 'lousy' mood for too long. Talk to your friend about how their actions make you feel lousy and that you prefer that they accept you for who you are, or at the very least explain how you can 'toughen' yourself up and not be too 'soft'.</p>
              <p>Cheers</p>
