Asking for help is not illegal... Actually there's quite a simple solution to this... That is to refer them to the police for assistance.. If your 'friendly' neighbourhood policemen are willign to look into matters and help... There'll probably be a record... And the same people simply can't be losing their wallet time and over again...? If that happens, then something's obviously quite fishy... The main loophole in what I've suggested is that most of the time policemen simply couldn't be bother....<br><br>Yes. I bet (have seen) people falling for such time and again too... But I shall not comment much on that as it's really their own money... Hence I have no rights in telling them how it should be spent...</div>
