            <div class='col-md body'>I lived in different parts of Singapore before. I think 'most' Yishun/Sembawang folks are more trusting than say city folks. Maybe the idyllic 'san bar' lifestyle makes one 'dumb and dumber'.  But I prefer these people, they are like forrest gump. Nevermind, if you lose a few coins to a trickster, just go down to the underpass connecting northpoint and the mrt, see those busker blind musicians with blaring karaoke fanfare, cymbals or organs, walk up there in the pretext of giving some money, but instead pick back a few coins from their tin. get back your money where you lost them - e.g. the professionals. you will just be a laughing stock going to the police, what can they do? remember how a woman doctor criticized huang na's donors, or how your monies go for an indian man's gold tap and toilet bowl? the bottom line is, singaporeans are too trusting and even a chinese speaker said that most singaporeans are stupid. I am a singaporean, and I actually agree. you see, it is not an insult, but the social conditioning that have blinded our judgement, it is imbued in our lifestyles. everyone needs help due to rising societal problems, so don't be guillbile. your gods won't even know and bless you if you were helping others and you merely get fleeting moments of feeling like a saint. why should one always be so submissive and trusting? do one always need to be told what to do? As long as one is in such an environment, one no longer needs to believe in good people because that is why you always fall victim to such ruse. welcome to the club of nonbelievers, no class requirements and membership is free.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by babymac13:</div><div class="quote_body">The descriptions about him to be quite similar to the guy i saw earlier.<br>He would ask in a pathetic and pityful tone asking for your sympathy.<br><br>To add on,<br>He's look like a typical malay ah beng, age between 22-26.<br><br>I think i saw him walking past while i finished running yesterday around the soccer field in Chong pang.

( I returned with a stern voice)<br><br>He reply: Can I ask a favour from you? (I remember it was exactly the same diagloue  that a malay guy asked me before last week while i was studying downstairs last week ago).<br><br>I sound more agitated and asked him: what you want?<br><br>He paused at least for a few question when he suddenly change his lines: I just need to know the time now?<br><br>Previously in the last incident, he said before: " I lost my wallet while playing soccer and I need some change to take bus to ang mo kio ....." something like this.<br><br>After that, he walk away, while i continue with my study with my mind wandering about the previous encountered with him.<br><br>It was about 10 min later, i saw the 2 malay guys walking opposite block and a man was walking towards their direction and that same malay guy began to approach him as seem the way he approach me.<br><br>From my past experiences, i'm not sure it's the identical guy that apporached me, but the diagloue used was the same on each occasion, it couldn't be just coincidental.<br><br>I thought of highlighting this case to my NPP tomoorow morning.<br><br>Asking or begging for money is nothing illegal so long there is physical or verbal abuses.<br><br>However, taking of people's kindness and sympathy isn't a right thing and I urge all the forumers who stay in yishuncan highlight this incident to your friends or relatives staying near Chong Pang.<br><br>Feel free to comment and you may refer to the links below for more related information.<br><br><a href="http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=171334&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">http://sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=171334&amp;page=1</a><br><br></div></blockquote>Thanks dude, i gonna go wack that guy now <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Joking NIa <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
