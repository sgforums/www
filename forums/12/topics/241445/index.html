Even when I have tat bottom sinking feeling in my stomach whenever I dont do things perfectly, I just try to ignore it..its like goin thru cold turkey..but eventually one day, this habit will perish..<br><br>Maybe theres someone here who has the same experience as me care to share their stories n how they deal with it?<br><br>Thanks for reading.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i was undergoing psychology module not long ago. came across this condition. there are basically different types of approach in treating psychiatric disorders.<br><br>after what i studied, my opinion is, medication does help in one way or another but ultimately the cure lies in the person himself/herself. thus i think its good that you are aware and taking the effort to reassure yourself that its ok and all. it will help. good luck!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you look at yourself very closely you would realised that we all have OCD except that the seriousness may not be too obvious.I check my car and front door to see if its really lock a few times after I lock it and it has become a ritual for me,I am  sure many people do that too and pressng your TV remote control for no apparent reason to change channels even when the program youre are watching is a good one isnt that OCD too? Seek therapy when it starts to get really bad whereby you lose total control of your behavior.<br><br></div>

They tend to make the adults goes thru certain motions before they can calm down themselves.<br><br>Like they need to flush the toliet themselves or others must conform to their idea of whats the actions is or what needs to be done.<br><br>And as children, when they dont see things happening as what they think it should be, they get very irritable &amp; tantrums ensues.<br><br>Its good that you do recognise your own problems and is seeking help.  That is itself a step away from the Disorder.<br><br>As adults surrounding such children, we can only try the best to cope and give in to the child.<br><br>Can you check with your parents your behaviours at home too when you were young?
