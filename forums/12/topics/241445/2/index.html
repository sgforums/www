            <div class='col-md body'>i have that too.<br><br>everytime i leave my home, i will keep thinking i didnt lock my door. to the extent that even if i reach ground floor, i will still take the lift back to check.<br>everytime i park my car, i wil check and check that i lock my car.<br><br>i think back on how this developed. it was my father who gave me excessive pressure in making sure the house is locked and ridiculous scoldings when things were not done correctly. My father's place have 2 padlocks in addition to the wooden door lock and gate lock. and at nite, we have to latch the door from inside. ALtogether there will be 5 locks. i always wonder, if there is a fire, it will be doomed for us to open so many locks.<br><br>i tried to overcome it by consciously and carefully checking once after i lock. and if i still keep worrying, i will remind myself i had already check.
