Again he "dumped" her to me. = / Woah..just to stay home for some games.. = /<br><br>Kinda disappointing though.<br><br>Being their fren, i sat and listened to their woes.<br><br>Ive tried hinting her to break up with him. Gave her tons of advices. Yet she choose to be with him. Ive decided to say no more already.<br><br>Ive tried encouraging roy to give up his gambling habits. But its quite obvious he didnt really wanna change. And since he really didnt wanna change, no point for me to add more words to him.<br><br>Somehow our frenship..me her n him has already been shakened. They both didnt wanna break up yet one doesnt wanna give up gambling and one couldnt accept gambling. Im quite pissed n tired of hearing their story le<br><br>I suggested them to break up since both wanna be stubborn. In the end, they sorta disliked me in some ways coz im like not encouraging them to be together anymore.<br><br>After telling them how i felt over the whole story of he n his gambling, we had a cold war. After tat they still come back to me with the same old story.<br><br>I really dont know how to tell them about this dumping ground thingy. how do i put things to her? hai<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>On one hand I think Clara is being rather stupid, but then again you could say she is the type who can really stick through thick and thin. Pros and cons.<br><br>Thus, the best way for you to go, is to hear her rants when you are feeling up to it, and decline when you are not. You don't owe either party any service. And I think you've already been really nice for a long time.<br><br>You are not a dumping ground, but you are a concerned friend. Nothing else.

Girl will not break up with him since she love him so much. So to them you are someone who they can vent their fustrations at. Poor guy why let them use you like that? Since when they ever treat you like a proper friend anyway?<br><br>Is up to you to keep advicing them. But if I were you I will not be borther with them anyway. Just go out to make new friends who are more worth my time.</div>
