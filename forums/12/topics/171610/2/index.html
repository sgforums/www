            <div class='col-md body'>I forgot to point out that I didn't consider myself as the dumping ground.<br><br>Why? I was more than glad to help her out - be her pillar of support and listening ear when she needs. After-all, she had always been my listening ear since God-knows-when.<br><br>She always comes to me for everything. But for once, I asked her to reconsider her position, because she says she feels secure with me. Why? If she is going to ask me to provide her with a sense of security while still going out with that jerk boyfriend, then forget it. The only person that I intend to make feel secure is my girl-friend. To provide her with that sense of security is over-stepping the line of friendship. To even ask me for it, is also over-stepping the line.</div>
