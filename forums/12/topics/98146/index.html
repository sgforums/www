            <div class='col-md body'>since she already said that... then i think you should leave.... cos if a ger can say that they really mean it... But if you really love her then no matter wat we say also no use... i know it's painful to let someone you love to go... but somethings things are just not right... ask yourself this question... is this girl the girl you want to be forever... once you got your answer... you will know wat to do... Anyway all the best to you.... Even you can't get her... one day the "one" you love will come out.... dun rush...</div>

You mentioned that she has mixed feelings and that she cannot decide whats best for her.. Is neglection the main cause of the break up or is it also due to other factors which leads up to it?<br><br>Relieve her of her pressure for the time being.. See how she is towards you.. If somehow, along the way, she has the feelings back for you.. I believe.. Both of you will be back together.. Relieve her pressure not till the extend of not talking or smsing her..

Think about what you have done in the past that causes to r/s to break. Solve the problems within yourself before you start to drag someone else with you.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by december:</div><div class="quote_body">I think the main problem is she scare the feeling will never be the same again. I know my mistakes and i know what i should do. I neglected her alot becos of my army obligation. But now i have ORD i am ready to commit. But she just say the feeling will never be the same again even if we get together. Anyway she is a very insecured ger.<br>I believe that when she says she is facing alot of pressure.<br>Could it be she want to patch back but she having mixed feeling cos she scare we will not be be the same again. She has no confidence </div></blockquote>You think that the problem is she scare the feeling will never be the same again? Did you confirm this with her? I hope that you are not puting what you thinking she is meaning into her mind.<br><br>You say that you have army obligations and so you neglected her, but now you are out of army you are ready to commit. Are you sure? Won't you have other commitments later in life? Job, studies? If so will you neglect her again?<br><br>As you said she is insercure, then you should know what is the thing she scares the most. The inability for you to commit in the past definitely has made her not wanting to get into a r/s with you again.<br><br>You say you can commit. Don't just say, do it and show it to her. You said she is insercure, so you need to prove it by action. But you said she is pressured by you. So just show her what you can do for her without persuading her to get back into a r/s with you again. Only ask her that when you think she is feeling more comfortable with you in the future.<br><br>You said you know your mistake, but from your reply, it seems that you have projected all your mistakes to other things beside yourself. The army, and your ex. Do pay attention to this.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by december:</div><div class="quote_body">When she said she doesnt have any confidence<br>She means she doesnt have any confidence that when we together, that type of feeling will go away. After so many bad experience in relationship, she didnt want to try. She has no confidence to try. When i tried telling her that i will make the efforts and i have the confidence that that so called feeling will go away and we will be happy in the end. She got so pressured by the things that i said she cried and insisted on me not to mention any patchup then. She cannot handle my constant persuasion. </div></blockquote>If she doesn't have any confidence in a r/s with you, you will want to make her have the confidence. So show it! Don't just talk... You having the confidence alone is of no point. She needs to have the confidence in it too and the source must come from you. Just show her what you can do for her and build the confidence in her. Do not mention about patchup at all.<br><br>However, if you think that all these are too much for you, you still have the second option... respect her decision and give up.<br></div>
