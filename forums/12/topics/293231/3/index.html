The fact is, if you regard insecurity to be a turn-off (which I do in the case of excessive insecurity), it is a turn-off regardless of your gender.<br><br>With regard to the threadstarter, the answer to your question has pretty much got to be in your own mind.

Evidently, shying away from the insecure isn't something exclusive to women. In fact, this quality isn't exclusive to relationships. Go to any job interviews and, given a choice, interviewers would plump for confident people over the insecure ones any day.<br><br>Anyway, my point about a girl who acts like a guy isn't exactly what you had in mind  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> - if anything, I was extolling the merits of confident, self-assured women who view themselves as every bit an equal to their male counterparts. Even in that context, I wouldn't go so far as to say confident spouses are tailor-made for everyone and ultimately, it's still down to the individuals to determine what's their best-fit.<br><br>On a sidenote, guess you must have had a pretty harrowing experience given the countless inepts you seem to have dated...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
