If it's purely a matter of security and confidence, why not? As a matter of fact, I personally find such women very attractive.<br><br>Look, the geist of the matter does not centre on gender stereotypes - insecurity plague both genders and just because insecure women have a higher tendency to exhibit qualities revealing their insecurity doesn't render them inferior to insecure guys (of course, insecure women are no better than insecure guys and it should hardly come as a surprise such people invariably end up with their kind). The fact is, if you regard insecurity to be a turn-off (which I do in the case of excessive insecurity), it is a turn-off regardless of your gender.<br><br>With regard to the threadstarter, the answer to your question has pretty much got to be in your own mind.
