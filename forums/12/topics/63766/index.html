I think she's just enjoying the company of a NICE CARING guy for now. For a relationship it's a bit too wide off, though I'm not in a position if she would accept you or not? (or even consider about it?) She seems like quite an 'easy go lucky' girl? If you're just caring for her out of genuine concern, I would not have much to add. But if you're looking out for a RELATIONSHIP with her.... Personal one. I would say don't pin too high a hope on it.... Especially when it's gonna be your 1st relationship? I'm sure you don't wanna be hurt too badly?</div>
