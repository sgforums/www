But in the real working world, there is so much interaction u would have to do. For example, i'll draw this case from an external auditor. He travels around the island frequently to interact with different companies eg, F&amp;N and TTSH. Over there he can meet many new pple and in the process largely expand his network. If u prove yrself to have a good interaction and analytical ability, u would most likely be sent overseas, esp if u work for an MNC. Basically I can assure u, there is no lack of life and interaction in accountancy at all. It is not at all routine! Dont tell me F&amp;N and TTSH are similar in nature? Straight from the horses mouth, in fact 2 horses.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm I agree very much as u do. I in no way resemble a workaholic, which is why I say I do not think I would be able to take to the lifestyle. But I guess the info we get sort of differs. My senior in his twenties started off as an auditor, and is still! But he told me he's paid much less than an accountant. But he's doing it for experience. Three others I spoke to also tell me the same thing leh. I'll try go confirm again. Thanks for sharing yr opinions!</div>
