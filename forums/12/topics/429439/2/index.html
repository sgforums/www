              <p>How she looks like, since u so sad and emo, maybe you come my pubs, hv a few drinks on me, i see if I can find one gal look alike to intro to you, but of course the character will be a bit out, but definitely better than the gal you mentioned.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a gal, i can only say something about our gal action. I might be in a way betray some of my sisters here, but let be frank, most guys still do not know that they are actually stepping stones, we gals love to be adored, get attended and certainly praised, some of us, like your gal are actually waiting for the right hero to come along in their life, you are just a stepping stone, a supporting actor in our venture of love, and once we find the one we truly love, you are release from your role, we do not need you anymore.

              <p>dude, relationships can breakup even after several years.. your 1 yr 3 months .. is nothing ok.</p>
              <p>You think relationship means spend money on her .. buy her gifts until you go broke ? That's a very wrong mindset dude.</p>
              <p>Love cannot be bought.. nor can it be forced.</p>
              <p>Women are emotional creatures.. while all the blings are a nice bonus.. you still need to satisfy her emotional needs.</p>
              <p>I think your gf is not as materialistic as you think... she  is probably high maintenance <strong>emotionally</strong>.</p>
              <p>Since this is your first love.. just learn the lesson and move on.</p>

              <p>Well She Help me some problems that i faced.. And my Appearance for me to look better.. she removed my pimples, moles, help me pluck my eyebrows and change my hairstyle.. she did treat me food when she i know i treat her a lot already.. she sometimes will fork out her own $$ for me.. she also did a double baked chocolate cake for my birthday and muffins.. yea she got surprise me .. but in the whole 1 yr 3 mths.. is about 20~30% she surprise me by some small things.. She Didn't Really Did GREAT GREAT things for me..</p>
              <p>2) How did the 2 of you start?</p>
              <p>We started calling each other and sms each other every single day after we know each other at a friend house.. then we got meet up sometimes.. after that decided to meet up sometimes.. then we went to work together.. and one day i send her home she slept on my shoulder while we are sitting tgt on her playground below her house.. then she kissed me lips .. and we went to east coast park for a night tgt and i pitched my tent there.. and she say she loved me... and i asked her to be my girlfriend and that's it..</p>
              <p>3) Was she unhappy with you in anyway?</p>
              <p>Yea .. she keeps demand more and more from me.. she wants me to be succuessful in life.. she keep wanted me to earn a lot of $$ and have a lot of $$ in my bank so that she will feel safe and secure but the problem is how ?? as i am still studying.. a girl should comfort their own guys whenever we feeling down.. like i did not reach a target that i wanted.. i will feel down.. when i was feeling down.. i need her right ?? but she didn't comfort me but instead she turned angry and no feelings.. like she just want me to get what i want.. just like poly.. i apply those 5 choices.. then i nv got success in those 5 choices.. as she keep wanted me to get into poly.. after she know it she was like angry and disappointed.. i know she want me to get into poly but did she put her shoes inside me ?? i am the victim and i am the one feeling damn low.. instead i need her most .. she was like 'emo' disappointing me.. wtf ?? she expect me to comfort her saying ' don't worry i will get into poly dun be angry ' she like ignored me ?? wt hell ?? i need her the most ?! the reason is because she lied to her parents that i am studying poly right now.. for the 1 whole year.. wt hell.. oh.. she keeps want freedom from me.. she wants to go club with her girl-friends.. and after 1 yr we tgt.. she started smoking.. i scold her and she said ' i want to  have freedom !!  Stop controlling me !! ' i was like.. wtf ? i just don't want u to go club and be a  smoker.. i just can't control her as she is too stubborn .. damn stubborn like a fucking rock..</p>
              <p>4) Did her parents know about the both of you?</p>
              <p>Yes.. but only her mother knows that we had sex tgt before.. and her mum likes me a lot..</p>
              <p>5) Have she given you any presents?</p>
              <p>Yes she did give me presents.. Last 2 yrs of my birthday.. and she bought me shirts.. and during our 6 month anniversary she bought me singlets, boxers, shirts, and a wallet.. she did a delicious double baked chocolate cake for my birthday last yr.. and she bought me 4-5 nugeno man facial wash.. and some small things.. i forgot.. but she said that our 1st year anniversary is very important.. guess what ? i was having exam near our anniversary and i told her 1 month earlier that i can't do a big surprise for u.. so i was hinting her to do some for me.. but she didn't do it.. after her 'O' levels.. she keeps playing mahjong with her friends.. when i ask her why u didn't do anything she said she dun have time.. wtf ? she nv do forget it.. but she nv bought me anything at all.. she just want that couple ring to be bought by me and give it to her she saw the other day at a shop.. i bought for her during our 1st yr.. i really was disappointed that she nv did anything for me that day.. yea.. that's all she give i guess..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i wanted to say was i actually knew i treat her very good.. all her friends likes me and say i am a good guy to her.. when her friends found out that she wants to break with me.. they don't even wanna tell me scared i am heartbroken.. all her friends told her dun DO IT.. he is a rare guy ! she said she slowly dun have feelings for me .. what can i say.. that time is i beg her which is a mistake.. and on that day i told her everything i wanted to say.. and finish it.. and goes to no contact till now.. hoping she will call me cause i did all i could.. that's why i am so hurt after she know that fucking guy from the it fair who she knows for 1 wk + and after we broke up 8 days later she is attached with that guy.. their 1 month anniversary .. she bought a BURBERRY wallet for him.. WTF ?! know each other for 1 month + .. but she is my first love.. although is hard but i still have feelings for her.. cause she changed my appearance and give me the 1st love.. i am her 1st too.. now i think is gone or nothing else..</p>
              <p> </p>

                      pluck my eyebrows and change my hairstyle.. she did treat me food
                      when she i know i treat her a lot already.. she sometimes will fork
                      out her own $$ for me.. she also did a double baked chocolate cake
                      for my birthday and muffins.. yea she got surprise me .. but in the
                      whole 1 yr 3 mths.. is about 20~30% she surprise me by some small
                      things.. She Didn't Really Did GREAT GREAT things for me..</p>
              <p>2) How did the 2 of you start?</p>
              <p>We started calling each other and sms each other every single
                      day after we know each other at a friend house.. then we got meet
                      up sometimes.. after that decided to meet up sometimes.. then we
                      went to work together.. and one day i send her home she slept on my
                      shoulder while we are sitting tgt on her playground below her
                      house.. then she kissed me lips .. and we went to east coast park
                      for a night tgt and i pitched my tent there.. and she say she loved
                      me... and i asked her to be my girlfriend and that's it..</p>
              <p>3) Was she unhappy with you in anyway?</p>
              <p>Yea .. she keeps demand more and more from me.. she wants me to
                      be succuessful in life.. she keep wanted me to earn a lot of $$ and
                      have a lot of $$ in my bank so that she will feel safe and secure
                      but the problem is how ?? as i am still studying.. a girl should
                      comfort their own guys whenever we feeling down.. like i did not
                      reach a target that i wanted.. i will feel down.. when i was
                      feeling down.. i need her right ?? but she didn't comfort me but
                      instead she turned angry and no feelings.. like she just want me to
                      get what i want.. just like poly.. i apply those 5 choices.. then i
                      nv got success in those 5 choices.. as she keep wanted me to get
                      into poly.. after she know it she was like angry and disappointed..
                      i know she want me to get into poly but did she put her shoes
                      inside me ?? i am the victim and i am the one feeling damn low..
                      instead i need her most .. she was like 'emo' disappointing me..
                      wtf ?? she expect me to comfort her saying ' don't worry i will get
                      into poly dun be angry ' she like ignored me ?? wt hell ?? i need
                      her the most ?! the reason is because she lied to her parents that
                      i am studying poly right now.. for the 1 whole year.. wt hell..
                      oh.. she keeps want freedom from me.. she wants to go club with her
                      girl-friends.. and after 1 yr we tgt.. she started smoking.. i
                      scold her and she said ' i want to  have freedom !!  Stop
                      controlling me !! ' i was like.. wtf ? i just don't want u to go
                      club and be a  smoker.. i just can't control her as she is too
                      stubborn .. damn stubborn like a fucking rock..</p>
              <p>4) Did her parents know about the both of you?</p>
              <p>Yes.. but only her mother knows that we had sex tgt before.. and
                      her mum likes me a lot..</p>
              <p>5) Have she given you any presents?</p>
              <p>Yes she did give me presents.. Last 2 yrs of my birthday.. and
                      she bought me shirts.. and during our 6 month anniversary she

                      important.. guess what ? i was having exam near our anniversary and
                      i told her 1 month earlier that i can't do a big surprise for u..

                      me that day.. yea.. that's all she give i guess..</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p> She is trying to bring out the BEST in you. Yet you treat her as an emotional dumping ground.</p>
              <p>In a relationship.. it's not about the BMWs you buy her..nor the Gucci/Chanel/LV stuff..... it's the frequent little bitty things she/he do for you that counts. Letting you know that she thinks about you every so often.</p>
              <p>I know your mother probably told you to marry someone who loves you for who you are... warts and all... but that's just mother talk. </p>
              <p>The reality is ...No woman wants to be with a LOSER.. that's why your gf keeps pushing you to excel. At her maturity level.. she probably don't even know how to do it properly.. or maybe that's how her own parents push her to excel in life. That's why you thinks she is being mean or superficial.</p>
              <p>Instead of pulling up your socks.. you gave her lame excuses after lame excuses for your failure.... no wonder she gave up on you.</p>
              <p>She had hope..she saw your potential.. but you pissed it all away.</p>
              <p>That IT guy is probably more accomplished than you..so quit the self pitying .....it's time you do some self reflection... and chart your path carefully.</p>
              <p>First love.. 10th love.. it doesn't matter... if she can't see a future with you after a period of time.. it's time for her to let go.</p>

              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">To TS</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Thanks for the time for your replies, I must say that you really love this gal very much and she loves you too in the first part of the relationship.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Reason I think on why she wants to break up,</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">1) She double baked chocolate cake and muffins for your birthday and you feel that is not a big deal for you. It is not easy to bake a cake it takes time and effort. Try this, since mother's day is coming try making you for your mum then you will understand her feelings</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">2) She wants you to be successful that’s why she wants you to go to poly. Even in her heart she knows that you could not make it, she lies to her parents for you for a year to make you look good. Ever wonder why she did that? She could have just told her parents and make them look down on you.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">3) "she keeps want freedom from me.. she wants to go club with her girl-friends.. and after 1 yr we tgt.. she started smoking.. i scold her and she said ' i want to  have freedom !!  Stop controlling me !! ' i was like.. wtf ? i just don't want u to go club and be a  smoker.. i just can't control her as she is too stubborn .. damn stubborn like a fucking rock."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Nobody likes to be stop from doing things that she or he likes. By scolding her only pushes you away from her. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">4) "but she said that our 1st year anniversary is very important.. guess what ? i was having exam near our anniversary and i told her 1 month earlier that i can't do a big surprise for u.."</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I too learnt this the hard way, when a girl says "our 1st year anniversary is very important.." she means that she wants to spent some time with you. No matter how short the time is, she will love you even more for remembering it. Just by asking her to plan for things for you makes her feel that you do not care for her. I finally learnt this after got dump by 3 ex.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">My advice for you</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">She has left you, I understand it is tough; rejection is something which no one wants to face but is a fact that sadly you have to accept. Questions on why she left and what have I done to deserve this will always be there but it is time to move on. You have done your best bro but is not enough for her. She wants more and it is also unfair for you to always try to reach her expectations. To understand what the mistakes that you make in this relationship will help you make a better bf in the future. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">My suggestion is to tell her that you are sorry for the things that you have done, thank her sincerely for all she had done for you and wish she would have a better life with someone that she really loves.</span></p>

              <p>Is she worth it ? You should answer this yourself.</p>
              <p>One man's wine is another man's venom.</p>
              <p>What's there for her to miss about you ?</p>
              <p>A man's true worth is in his actions.. NOT his words.</p>
              <p>What have you done so far.. to prove worthy ? Noble thoughts are worthless unless you make em happen.</p>
              <p>Do yourself a favor.. your success should be the result of your own ambitions.. not the want of another.</p>
              <p>Let the women judge your success.. and you be the one to choose.</p>

              <p>HI sorry to hear about that.  The best thing you can do is to live well and to do well and move on.</p>
              <p>Same thing happened to me in university.  I thought she was the one I would settle down with.  Did everything to be a good bf - studied with her, spent time with her, tried to solve all her problems etc.</p>
              <p>But like many girls, she was the type that was always looking to upgrade.  So along came a guy in her hall of residence who drove a car (not his, but his dad's) and he would chaffeur her around everywhere.  After a few days, she broke up with me and I found out that she hooked up immediately with that guy.  A trade up.</p>
              <p>I was devastated - I felt really low.  If I cannot even make an average girl like her happy I can forget about girls in general.  But I just picked myself up and went on with life.  Nothing is more unappealing than a whiner who's feeling sorry for himelf.</p>
              <p>Fast forward - I am now happily married to a great girl (prettier, nicer than the old one) and have a happy life.  The old girlfriend? The last I heard she broke up with that guy (maybe his dad sold the car), and she tried to contact me on facebook.  Basically I ignored her - why should I even waste time on someone who's always looking to trade up and upgrade? I am not a car!</p>

              <p>How she looks like, since u so sad and emo, maybe you come my pubs, hv a few drinks on me, i see if I can find one gal look alike to intro to you, but of course the character will be a bit out, but definitely better than the gal you mentioned.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As a gal, i can only say something about our gal action. I might be in a way betray some of my sisters here, but let be frank, most guys still do not know that they are actually stepping stones, we gals love to be adored, get attended and certainly praised, some of us, like your gal are actually waiting for the right hero to come along in their life, you are just a stepping stone, a supporting actor in our venture of love, and once we find the one we truly love, you are release from your role, we do not need you anymore. UNDERSTAND!</p>

              <p><br>Very true - thank for being so honest.  I think many girls are like what you described - always looking to upgrade their material circumstances or the people they are with.  Let's face it many people settle down with the best person they can get at that point in time. </p>
              <p>But not all girls are like that, not girls always looking for that marginal trade up.  Because if they were I would not have been able to got married cos when I started dating my current wife I really had nothing - no money, no car, no house etc... we clicked and got married and I worked hard and now we have a decent life together - private property, car, going to Europe for holiday etc.</p>
              <p>And in a funny way, if I had settled down with my first girlfriend I don't think I would be dong as well today.  I would not have had that shock, and I would not have figured out that women (most) are ultimately materialistic and I needed to be succesful in my career.</p>
              <p>I think one reason why my wife was willing to go out with a no-money, no-car fella like me in the past is because she herself came from a well-to-do family, so she already has all the nice trinklets and she was looking beyond the materialistic aspect of things and maybe she saw some subtance in me.</p>

              <p><br>Singapore guys got too much male egos and prides to hold on to, they have not reach the maturity of Love even at the age of 35yo, most think very narrowly and when they cannot get the sg gals they wanted, they would turn bad, blame all sg gals for being materialistic, bad, and unfaithful to them. Most never look at gal like me, the higher income group gal, to me, we are like tigeress and commanding, they feel belittled and unable to take the burden of going out with a gal richer or more capable then them, so end up, me being single and they go for foreign cheap gal who can be their night partner and maid at the same time, but these foreign gal also cheated them most of the time.</p>
              <p>So far, in my experiences, Sg guy can be the worst in term of romance, they are not sweet and also not steady, they just want to get thing done fast and quick, perhap the fast pace of the society had breeded such guys.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> Sometimes, I wondered if the reasons given are important to process the break up or the break up itself is a reason suffices to decide that probably this person is not really the one to begin with. You have two prominent issues; (1) you are grieving over the lost of your 1 year odd relationship, (2) you are angry over the fact that she ended up with someone else almost instantly after breaking up with you. <br> <br>To grief over a lost relationship is natural; the epiphany is almost as if a part of you died along with your divine soul and it can be witnessed in your daily functioning activities (e.g. mourning for the lost, no one to meet up over the weekends, nobody to hold hands, etc). Most people detest major changes because relationship often seek to maintain its homeostasis - simply refers to its 'natural balance' where status quo prevail over possible new changes, in which some level of uncomfortable adjustment has to be made and be accommodated. <br> <br>Your anger seemed justified; with facebook pictures depicting her new relationship in intimate poses; certainly it can be hard for anyone to accept it in a point-blank fashion. The additional frustration also adds weight as you relate how nicely you treated her, despite making personal sacrifices. The attempt was futile in saving the relationship though, but honestly, a part of me wonders how much of the relationship is <em>actually</em> salvageable in the first place. <br> <br>When someone is diagnosed with final stage pancreatic cancer (most fatal type of cancer); chances are, death is inevitable. The knowledge of being diagnosed as pancreatic cancer (category type) in its final stage (time frame) makes load of difference as compared to another who is only told that he is clinically suffering from cancer. If you know that you have no chance of be cured, you will probably try to improve the quality of your life because that is probably the only way you could end on a higher note given the same outcome.</p>
              <p>What I am trying to say is that for your case: ‘<em>death</em>’ has already occurred. Understandably, the reason of death means little to our emotional mind because it is as painful as it could get for anyone to lose someone they love. It is indeed a struggle to move along. However the question remains for you: what level of note would you want to end for yourself?</p>
              <p>If you know that the breakup is due to the absence of love; is this something that you perceive you could do ‘something’ about it to get it back?</p>
              <p>Could you force love out of someone who doesn’t have it anymore?</p>
              <p>Even if you could – will it turn out to be the same? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
