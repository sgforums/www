              <p>The best revenge is to be successful in life. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>
              <p>First love is always harder to let you and the memories associated with first love are very strong. Even after 10 or 20 years, you will still reminiscene the experience in first love. My advice to you is, move on. Find something productive to do to keep you busy. For a good start, you could volunteer yourself as charitable organisation. They need many people for the donation drives.</p>
              <p>I also experience a lot of breakup and patch back with the 1st girlfriend. Now she's still my gf, but the feeling is no more there. I suggest that you write down all your feelings, thoughts and love story into a journal, and keep that journal somewhere in your room. Once you've done it, a part of you containing the memories and love will be in the journal. Let it be a reminder that true love needs time to find and 1st love does not mean true love.</p>
              <p>It is a painful lesson for you, but I believe that it will be even more painful for your ex-girlfriend as she had committed into a rebound relationship; entering into a relationship with somebody whom you know not long enough would cause devastating harm.</p>
              <p>Move on, buddy.</p>

              <p>My brother i know it is sad. I can confirm that she having fun with his bf now perhaps in bed. She din think of u and wun give a damm for u. Her heart already change. Wake up la. There are so many girls in the world waiting for u to know them.</p>
              <p>OK. my advice to u is if you really aim for her is to be her friend again. Dun go touch her or hold her hand k. Just be one of her normal friends. Start back from friend. Sorry to say this. This bitch is not worth your love at all. She can do this to anyone. Bitch later turn into slut.</p>

              <p>The reason why they keep "I love you, you love me" posting mussy messages on facebook showed the fact that both of them are pretty insecure about their relationship. It could be also due to the honey-moon phenomenon (couple appearing extremely lovely) for a temporarily period. Once the honeymoon phase is over, committment phase kicks in.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I believe she will not be able to last long with her current boyfriend. Base on estimation, she will initiate contact with you roughly 5 months or 11 months later, which will be around her next breakup or birthday. At that time, she could be dump by her current boyfriend and thinking about you.</p>
              <p>What you should do now is to look forward adding meaning activities in your life. I can see that you are still hoping for her to return back to you. Please don't habour any hope... My only hope for you is for you to emerge stronger!</p>
