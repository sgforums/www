            <div class='col-md body'>In my opinion, I think she really likes you as a good friend, but is afraid that when she rejects you, you guys wouldn't be as good friends as before. It is possible that a few people have also told her their feelings before, and they weren't as good friends as before. So, she is sorta trying to make you give up on her, but still remain good friends.<br><br>But then...this is all my opinion. Maybe you could go out with one of her friends, and test her reaction. If it is like what I think, she will be a little jealous/not jealous, but relieved.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>^^ possible, but the guy needs to be daring enough.<br><br>And falling_stars, it seems to me that girl is testing you out. Go out with one of the girls she introduced. Make sure it's the prettiest. That would make her jealous if she's interested in you. If she begins to take some initative after you went out with the other girl, congratulations.<br><br>The birthday cake kind of mess things up a bit. Did she deliver the cake herself, or just bought the cake and asked smoeone else to bring it? If she did it herself, most likely she did it with the intentions of love. Because that way, you would know she was the one who bought it. That's what i feel.</div>
