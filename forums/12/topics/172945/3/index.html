Go out with one of the girls she introduced. Make sure it's the prettiest. That would make her jealous if she's interested in you. If she begins to take some initative after you went out with the other girl, congratulations.<br><br>The birthday cake kind of mess things up a bit. Did she deliver the cake herself, or just bought the cake and asked smoeone else to bring it? If she did it herself, most likely she did it with the intentions of love. Because that way, you would know she was the one who bought it. That's what i feel.</div></blockquote>no she did not deliver it... she gt someone else to do it... when i asked the person who was the one who made such a request he said dun noe...<br><br>so i called her straight away that day bt she denied...<br><br>bt by the end of the day she admitted it when i said i wanted to throw it away since i dun noe who is the sender and who noe's wat's inside the dake??</div>
