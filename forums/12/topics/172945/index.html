No harm meeting a new friend.<br><br>I agree with Sinicker with the possibilities he mentioned.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">She is not interested and is trying to cushion the impact.</span></strong><br><br>Since she enjoys being a pimp, you might as well oblige.<br><br>When the traffic light is red, you should make a U-turn and find the next green traffic light. It is better than waiting indefinitely.<br><br><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">She is running some sh!te tests on you </span></strong><br><br>The disturbing fact is that she is already 26 and still plays all these mind games and sh!t tests.<br><br><strong>I would be concerned about whether she can be a keeper in the long run!</strong> Do you want to spend your life entertaining a manipulative lady? Better think twiceÂ…<br><br>But DO call her on her bullsh!t anywaysÂ…cos itÂ’s fun to do so.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Meet that friend she wants to introduce to you. Show her a good time. This friend of hers obviously has a decent amount of interest in you. It shouldnÂ’t be difficult to impress her.<br><br>Cut down on your calls and emails. If your target is interested (and is just playing mind games) and she hears about how her friend enjoys the date, she will call and ask you why you are contacting her less often.<br><br>Just tell her you have your thing going. Busy with your job and a new hobby, etc.<br><br>If she teases you about changing your target so quicklyÂ…no staying power etcÂ…just tell her there is nothing wrong with meeting new people. She canÂ’t argue with that.<br><br>Continue to meet her one on one and have fun when she initiates it.<br><br>You left the ball in her court too early. But you can use this opportunity she has given you to win the ball back.<br><br>I donÂ’t think you should make another Â“formalÂ” confession again. She heard you loud and clear the first time.<br><br>So either wayÂ…meet that friend.<br></div>
