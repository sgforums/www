That means Yin (Femine side) and Yang (Man (masculine) side). The I Ching or Chi symbol is seen most of the time at the entrance of any Chinese Taoist front door. This is the balancing of life and energy from the world of the spirits and from the world of human beings. This energy is the form of knowledge that you may used to kind of make yourself happy with that kind of law and it really helps you to believe that your home is more quintessential with the balance of Yin and Yang after arranging the furnished homes according to the feng shui recommendations. Hindu has that theory too but it is more to perception for self realisation. Meditation is like attuning oneself to the world of the spirits with the mind and body of a physical body.<br><br>Whether there are spirits following us??<br><br>Well, if you die later, and then you sort of supposedly survived from the physical body death, who will you try to communicate to tell them that you are still alive and not dead. Think and contemplate like this. See what would you be and what would you do, when you die and live for Life as a humans and later as a soul or consciousness or as a mind within a mankind.<br><br>Myriad of philosophers from the past and the present had thought about it and most of them could only explained through metaphor reasonings and some of them even went to the extend of measuring their thoughts with scientific researched and studies pertaining to that most seek answers of Life After Death.<br><br>Read more books from the scientists like Dr. Raymond Moody and Dr. Stevenson; and last of all I would recommend that you read Elisabeth Kubler-Ross works on near death experiences. The vision of the dying may give you some insights to that mysteries of the spirit world.<br><br>Just of curiosity, are you by chance an atheist??<br><br>Best regards,<br>Joe<br><br></div>
