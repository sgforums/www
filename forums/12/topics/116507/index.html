Whenever i bathe and close my eyes i would imagine that something is behind me, feel very insecure. I couldn't solve it but outgrow it in a way. Maybe you can try talking or singing out loud to relieve your tensions. Even throwing your temper to empty space can help.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Good luck!</div>

I just joined them to see what they feel like when I am with them (LOL).<br><br>Yes, science is not the only way to explain things about the spiritual world. There are many cases whereby people really see and met ghosts but it is that person's personal experience and not other people experiences. So, only you will know it and maybe reading a little bit about scientist's reports pertaining to their investigations about the spiritual world would help you to understand more about your own experiences.<br><br>Are you afraid of ghosts or the unknown??<br><br>Joe</div>

You remember him in your heart and then you will remember his spoken words to you while he was still alive, and then in your mind you could see him again, smiling at you.<br><br>That is one way to see him.<br><br>Goodnight.<br><br>Joe</div>
