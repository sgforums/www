Hanging out in middle of nowhere, having dinner, blar blar blar, doesn't says ANYTHING at all. Really. Don't think too much into the events. However, I am not saying that she doesn't like you or whatsoever because its difficult to judge on my side. However. the bottomline is: you could be generating pure company and certain qualities that her bf may not have. This doesn't equate to love. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Seriously, since she is already attached - by right, <strong>she shouldn't and couldn't remain emotionally/physically close to you all the time</strong>. BY RIGHT, she will have a small little distance, regardless of how comfortable she is with you. Previous times, she didn't do that - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">doesn't mean </span>she has to behave in such intimate terms with you all the time for you ain't her bf ya? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: I do not disagree nor support chasing attached girls; however, please understand the package you are dealing with. By the way, before you do anything, please please please - always consider your status and position you are at to prevent foolish acts - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">You are just a friend</span>. Therefore many pleasurable events that have took place, is merely a bonus, not a must. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
