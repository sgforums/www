If you want to start a biz sort of entrepreneur thingy, you should go Poly and take up DBS(Dip. in Business Studies) or DBA(Dip. in Business Administration).<br><br>If you wanna work for a company, maybe you should continue studying and get a degree in Business Administration. That will take up more time.<br><br>Well you should weigth the pros and cons. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Right now he is working in a financial company and he's doing pretty well.<br><br>Take the extra year as your second chance to prove yourself. Be friendly and mingle with your new classmates. Be positive, work hard, and don't let your teachers and parents down.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Look, i think you have to acknowledge that you have a "facE" problem. You mention about having to face your CCA teacher, and that you felt JC1 newbies are giving u weird stares. Although I had not been retained before, but I know that when you are of a certain age, u got to be mature, especially if u go JC(not to say that those go Poly or ITE are childish). If they are going to be childish and talk behind ur back, or give u weird stares, then that's their problem.<br><br>But ask urself this: Are u really bothered by the fact that they are staring at u, or because you yourself are looking at urself at a different way? If you yourself do not mind the fact that u have retained, then what others say or feel will not bother u. Doing JC1 again may not be a bad thing, in fact, it may be the catalyst for u to do well, and get to a good Uni. I myself just scrapped through the barrel of JC1, and it didn't get me any way, because in the end, my foundation was too weak and even though I could get into NTU, I couldn't get the course I want, and so I had to go to a private school. Look at things in a positive way, and u will have a whole new perspective on things.<br><br>As for your CCA, I would suggest u join those type of CCA where membership is low, so that u can get a leadership position next year. No point joining a CCA which u like, but chances are that committee places will be hard to come by due to too many members. You, being the chairman of your CCA before, knows that having a leadership post will be more impressive than if u do not have. Sorry if I sound like the typical Singaporean-kiasu, but that's life, that's reality.<br><br>I will not suggest that u pursue whatever is in your heart, but to pursue something that u know that it will help u in ur future endearvours, be it poly or JC.</div>
