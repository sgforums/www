              <p>   Sorry madam , although i feel pity for you but please get this straight . No matter how highly educated young or old is , that does not make that person is a good man . I have seen some very highly educated morons or even beast . A person who is highly educated just means they studied more stuff in school but they may know nothing about moral and ethnics . I notice nowadays schools don't teach a person about moral ethnics , just how to excel in life perhaps .</p>
              <p>    And on a personal note ... please do not go for abortion ok , cherish your flesh and blood . I wish you success in your lawsuit against your husband .</p>

              <p>Hi Angrrry,</p>
              <p>I am sorry to hear about what you are going through, and you have my sympathy. Before looking for a PI, perhaps you will like to try getting him to admit that he is having an affair outside through a phone, and use a recorder to record it down. </p>
              <p>And if you are trying to file for divorce, it will be better for you to look for a good and experienced lawyer first, as he/she will have more ideas on how exactly to nail your unfaithful husband down.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>No matter how highly educated one is, there are bound to be mistakes made...</p>
              <p>China woman as we all know, are damn good in seducing man and their money. No matter what type of man, they will have the ability to hook him up. Guys on the other hand, always say that they would not cheat on their wife, but then again, guys think using the dick head and not his head.</p>
              <p>Some china woman, can be damn pretty and act until damn ke lian to attract sympathy and then start to prey on that poor guy. Many guy cannot resist a girl that is cute, and yet in a sorry state, and would most likely wanna care for them.</p>
              <p>I believe your husband fell for the china girl. He has already lost interest in you because he asked you to abort the child. Not because he cannot afford the child but abort the child due to the china woman. Your husband is bad, damn bad.</p>
              <p>You should divorce him asap and then when he is cheated off his money, then he will have learnt his lessons and come crying back for you. Then you should just kick him aside.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, just incase if he comes back in the future to fight for the custody of the child, maybe you should record down all that he said, when he says something like "go and abort the damn child, i dont not want him/her at all". Or you can ask him to sign a contract that states that the child is yours and he will not come back for him/her again.</p>
              <p>Fuck that man for disgracing all other men, fancy falling for a useless slutty china bitch.</p>

              <p>My meaning of prostituting oneself is that of compromising oneself (what one is or wants to be) to stay/enter into  a ... cos one gains $$$ or .... security.</p>
              <p>What happens when the other (another) can no longer provide $$$$ or security. The 'ends' are no longer there. One is bound to feel sore and cheated cos in the first place one was <em>using </em>the other as a means to his/her end. Hence the conflict(s) and blame game.</p>
              <p>As to whether it holds true - it depends on whether one is  compromising or reconciling oneself to one's choice of making the means as an end unto itself or making the means an end to ... Being self-honest one would know or one can simply ignore and be ...</p>

              <p>My co-worker from China also told me there's several "Mistress Village", in pockets of China.</p>
              <p>Affluent men keeps their young mistresses, much like Feudal China's concubine culture.</p>
              <p>Back in those days, rich men are able to provide for their primary family and keep a concubine.</p>
              <p>Singaporean men are a disgrace, they want to keep mistress but their primary wife had to suffer for it.</p>
              <p>Embarrasing difference between China men and Singaporean men with mistress...</p>
