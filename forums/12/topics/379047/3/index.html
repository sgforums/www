              <p>Hey TS,</p>
              <p>thanks for your story - can we know what attracted you to your husband in the 1st place and how it all started or how you got together? How on earth does he even have the brains to say share husband, and possibly think that you'll accept? He sounds like the ultimate MCP... was he always like that and that was probably what you fell for?</p>

              <p>Right now, i totally give up to reconcile with him anymore. I've a PI which I am trying to engage him to take up my case.</p>

              <p>If he  do not  deny having  a mistress, and  readily admit it, you can save your money. No need to hire a PI. Adultery or infidelity is not a criminal offence where you need proof. Divorce is a private pettition for the dissolution of a marriage on grounds of irretrieval break down of marriage. You only have  to tell the judge that you can't stand him  anymore. That's all that is required. A lawyer would do that best for you.</p>
              <p>The PI of course will not reject business, but if he is honest would advise you to save your money. You can take your own photographs, and give  your own testimony.</p>
              <p>Use the money for the lawyer.</p>

              <p>It is great of you as a mother to think so for your child. But I can assure you a single-parent family need not necessary be a bad one, especially when compared to a two-parent family where both parties are unhappy and the father frequently bring other women home and misconduct themselves in front of the "family".</p>
              <p>Anyway, why are you so persistent on getting a PI first? An experienced lawyer might actually be better at handling such stuffs for you.</p>
