              <p>TWE : Thanks for your advice.  I do know is my own flesh

              the child blame me during the growing stage that i choose to give

              <p>Hi Angrrry,</p>
              <p>Ultimately it is your own choice as to what you will want to do with your unborn child, but you may want to consider other alternatives such as putting him/her up for adoption instead of aborting him/her.</p>

              <p>I do not like pointing fingers at others as a general rule, but he is the one at fault here and he is just using this as an excuse. If he truly wants a child that badly, he could have seek the help of a surrogate mother.

              <p>Before you abort the child , please give it a second thought.</p>
              <p>After 2 miscarriages, have you consult a fertility doctor ?</p>
              <p>If you abort this child now, will you be able to conceive again in future ?</p>
              <p>A miscarriage is painful for a mother, it is also very depressing for a father.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you are going through natal depression ? 7 week pregnancy means you had sex with him bout 2 months ago .........</p>
              <p>Is he claiming he has china mistress just to spite you , perhaps over some unjust words you threw at him ???</p>

              Dear Angrry,
              
              I guess you got no choice but to let him go. This is coming from a man, who of course, very much wish that my wife will take me back if i had made a mistake. I even feel that you might be willing to forgive and forget.
              
              Although i had been very tempted, as you can see from my previous post. I want to be with her so much that i even employ the PRC girl PT in my company. We have not gone into any form of serious relationships yet, but i am trying to be as professional as possible in the work relationship, to slow down and put a stop to this.
              
              Anyway, please don't be angry no more. Since his heart is no longer with you, its best that you move on. Best of luck and you might want to remind your next partner that sharing him is totally unacceptable n will definitely lead to divorce.
              
              Thats what's my wife said to me some time and so far it has kept me very conscious of potential consequences.

              <p>I come to a conclusion if this one of the culture that they entertained their customers or their vendors entertained their customers....by bringing them to karoke and follow by social escort. It probably became a peer pressured by the vendors or customers to get into the relationship.</p>
              <p>That is probably a social issued that Singaporean woman need to bring it up openly in public to address to Singapore companies in China.</p>

              <p>I am sorry to hear that but i guess at this stage you have to ask yourself if you want to be with him or drop him. Of course having kids make it all the more difficult.

              <p>what you should do, is to start accumulating evidence that you have been contributing actively to the matrimonial assets, better yet, show that you've been contributing more than he did.</p>
              <p>start collecting things like household bills receipts, payments you made etc, build up a past history file. Check out the ownership of your assets like HDB flats, private apartments etc, many people just don't pay attention to such things until matrimonial cracks start appearing. What you want to do, is to show the court of any potential divorce proceedings that you have been at least an equal partner financially in the union. Then you'll have a better chance of keeping as much things as you can out of reach of the gold-digging whore on the make.</p>
