He told me that something in his heart that tells him that he will fall in love with me.Yet he says that he need to be finanically stable in r/s What does the guy want actually ? I know that career is impt to a guy. I am not forcing him to have a r/s with me. I just want a definite ans and not indecisive ans or inexplicable ans that is misleading. Then he told me he is coming to sg for awhile that was either ytd or today.Ytd he didn't call me. I assumed that he is most likely to be in sg today. It is an agony to wait for his phone call.

One thing I can be sure is that the preception of *YOU* liking and going head over heeds with is only your preception. I am confident to say that his love for you is different form from you - in other words, not like you. Therefore you cannot assume the same thing to you.<br><br>What do I mean by different form? Your case is a classic case of fundamental studies between man and woman. To a woman, who is a emotional, spirtual thinker - a call, a small kiss, a hug, a small note, simple I miss you - does wonders for your day. Love to a man (in general), tend to overlook such details because their mind and heart has another meaning of love - to protect, provide, security and enjoyment. This explain the part of his need to be financially stable and I bet you will be thinking 'does love cost a shit?

He said something in his heart will fall in love with you - he a small casual remark on a small liking on his part - which doesn't even represent touch of love. He said *WILL*, didn't say he has fallen in love and ask you to be together. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>My suggestion is that, pick yourself up first. If he doesn't call then forget it and lead your normal life. Come and think of this, if he is so irresponsible and hack care - even when he is with you - do you think that will change? We *NEED* a talk with him - you said it yourself, but before that happens, you have to pick yourself up and be stable. For a guy, if lets say a woman comes meeting me and spoke with such emotions - its difficult to communicate - I believe the same for your man.<br><br>What must you ask? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Intention...<br>Actions...<br>etc...<br>but most importantly... a DECISION.

One thing I can be sure is that the preception of *YOU* liking and going head over heeds with is only your preception. I am confident to say that his love for you is different form from you - in other words, not like you. Therefore you cannot assume the same thing to you.<br><br>What do I mean by different form? Your case is a classic case of fundamental studies between man and woman. To a woman, who is a emotional, spirtual thinker - a call, a small kiss, a hug, a small note, simple I miss you - does wonders for your day.
