              <p>Well, I'm no Sherlock Holmes. But the husband is the ç½ªé­�ç¥¸é¦– here.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What i can deduce is that the likely scenario would be the mother is still young and pretty.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She sees no future with this useless husband of hers and does not want to let her youth just fade away. Most probably some other guy is wooing her, she rather just pack up and leave. She regards the kids as a burden so leaves them for her husband. " They are your responsibility now ", something.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TS, the most important thing now is to get any relatives of the family to take care of these 2 poor children 1st. At least make sure the children dont starve and have a decent place to stay and sleep.</p>

              <p>Since the father is problematic and INCAPABLE of PROVIDING for his family.</p>
              <p>That means the money this woman took was earned by her in the first place. Get the connection ?</p>
              <p>She left to start up somewhere with someone else perhaps, and will come back for her children once she has settled down.</p>
              <p>The problem is.. if the father of the children are holding these children hostage as a mean to hold the mother back.. then it will be hard for the mother to claim her own children in the future.</p>
              <p>There's always two sides to a coin..and then there's the truth.</p>
              <p>You must be the relative on the father's side, yes ?</p>
              <p>For the benefit of the children.. please seek elders support and tell the father not to go it alone. The more family support the better the children will be. But it does not mean they replace the mother entirely.</p>
              <p>It is best to encourage CO-PARENTING , and not let hatred and spite ruin the life of these innocent children.</p>

              <p>I think the father must be brave here, nevermind if the wifey had ran away, my take is mostly, the mother is a foreigners, either thai, viet or pinoy or even indo who had formerly worked in some night spot, the father got to know her and then get married, at first everything was rosy, till the mother cannot withstand the poor state of the father or has had another lover who can care for her more with $$, so, she take whatever she could and neglect the family once and for all.</p>
              <p>So, the father must prove her wrong, I got a thai sing mix fren who work as chief stewardess at SIA, she was born by a thai gal, and her mother ran away since she was very young, but she grown up to be a beautiful sworn, father worked very hard, she is now married to a very rich guy, father also relax, no need to work anymore. Then the mother came back and wanting something from her, but she refused to acknowledge her. I hope the mother who neglected her 2 kids will live to regret one day.</p>

              <p>A lesson learnt from this to everybody, I mean men.</p>
              <p>Dont part all your saving, all your cash to your wife even though she is the most beautiful lady in the world. Save some for yourself. Hidden saving.</p>
