            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everybodyÂ… I got a problem to shareÂ….<br><br>I am an 18 year old girl and got a 23 year old guy for a boyfriendÂ…<br><br>I got a nice boyfriendÂ… the age gap between is 5 yearsÂ… to me is a little too bigÂ… to him I am childishÂ… whereas I could say that I knew lots of things which he doesnÂ’tÂ… he didnÂ’t know I have got someone to spy on him and from there I knew a lot about his past and present. The report I gotten was a beautiful oneÂ…to be frank, I admit that I am unscrupulous in certain other ways in handling people which he doesnÂ’t know at allÂ…<br><br>To him I am not that mature to make it sounds nice to me he said thatÂ… I was wondering if I am not matureÂ… whatÂ’s the point of him being with me in the first place... we knew each other earlier this year at our workplaceÂ…<br><br>He needs a girl that is able to talk to him about intellectual stuffÂ… but in some or another way I think I Â‘failedÂ’ because he said I should give myself a little bit more time. But I am able to support him emotionally and physically but not intellectuallyÂ… heÂ’s a currently studying a University whereas I am studying at ITE. The difference is rather bigÂ…but I know I will make it there some dayÂ…  I tried reading lots of newspaper and discuss with him some intellectual stuff but I find it very hard to keep on reading on and onÂ… I find it tiringÂ…<br><br>HeÂ’s the best that ever could happen to me but I just felt that we are out of range no doubt initially the chemistry between was all right but not fantastic.<br><br>I am trying real hard to be intellectually on par with him and I do lots of research in the subjects heÂ’s majoring in. I done all that all in the hope that I will be able to help him academically.<br><br>Nowadays I find it boring to go out with him and a hassle to call or message him, all bottoms to the fact that he donÂ’t like to message me or call me much but he wonÂ’t go MIA for sureÂ… sometimes heÂ’s really a mood spoilerÂ… I donÂ’t know what to sayÂ…<br><br>I got to say that heÂ’s a lot of different in other guys I knew, heÂ’s not a flirt and doesnÂ’t like to talk to girls except work stuff or school workÂ… but I am differentÂ… I am a big time flirt and a player. Find it rather hard to go out with himÂ… heÂ’s boring! Guys out there.. any idea to spice up this r/s?<br><br>At times, I felt he came at the wrong time and truth to be toldÂ… he came at the wrong place tooÂ… because of him I broke up with my guy whom I have been dating for the past 2 yearsÂ… sometimes I think back, I regretted my decision. But with my current bf, I learnt lots of things which I havenÂ’t with my ex.<br><br>Okay, I will write till hereÂ… any experienced ones do give me your two cents worthÂ… do write to meÂ… thxÂ… :&gt;<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Love and chemistry transcends all barriers.. be it age, status etc. Well tt's the ideal some pple would choose to believe.<br><br>Personally i dont. We humans have a certain degree of prejudice n steroetyping tendencies. Like ladies generally dun like younger men. In ur case.. he being older n of higher education being the obstacle.<br><br>The thing is.. yes.. it might irk him. But if he still likes u feel comfortable with u. I see no prob. But if he doesnt.. den let fate decide whether u two still can be tgt. Love may be able to be nurtured. But chemistry takes alot more.<br><br>No pt making urself miserable n tired trying to reach his so-called level. Differences may be a put off. But it can also be attractive. It could be ur differences tt attracted him to u in the 1st place. If it's not the case... surely there's some1 else out there who appreciates them.<br><br>Well.. there's this saying: Opposites attract. It doesnt work on all individuals but it does work.. sometimes..<br><br>Good luck..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
