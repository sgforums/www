Is this the kind of difference in appreciation and enjoyment in life or something else?<br><br>Some people find a quiet walk in the park is romantic. Others think it's the most boring thing. So, it really differs from people to people.<br><br>If you are really disturbed, maybe can try talking to him about how you feel. Then again, you have to decide if he is understanding or not, or whether it's a good time, for example, talking about this when his exams are coming is definitely not a good time.<br><br>Perhaps, the most important thing is not to try too hard.
