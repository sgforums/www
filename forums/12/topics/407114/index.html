              <p>last week, out of the blue, someone close scolded me non-stop for 30 min.  throughout, he scolded me stupid, idiot and ridiculed me as a person and my life, like i am the worst person on earth.  i just let him scold.  i am amazed at my calm. </p>
              <p>even though i was calm during the time he was scolding, his words stuck in my consciousness.  the next day the feelings of sadness and hurt started to creep in.  for the next three days i was depressed.  i could not study, concentrate and think clearly.  i was fidgety and restless.  whenever i sat down and tried to do my work, tears welled up in my eyes.  i felt the hurt strongly. </p>
              <p>coincidentally the three days were crucial period leading up to a project deadline.  so despite trying hard for 3 days to complete my part of the project, i could not come up with anything because i was blocked to write anything.  this caused delay and inconvenience to my teammates.  i feel bad but i know in my heart that i had tried my best.  they all thought that i was lazy and purposely delay, but i didn't. </p>
              <p>at work, my restlessness showed.  i had difficulty making up my mind.  i couldn't stick to plan. the hurtful words dwell in my mind all the time.</p>
              <p>in spite of what people say, to ignore and let go and move on when we meet unpleasant situations such as this, it is not easy.  unpleasant experiences do have an impact on us.  we get affected.  our work gets affected.  it is not so easy to "let go, stop blaming, move on, get a life".</p>
              <p>anyway i have decided to leave this hell hole.  i no longer want such people to entrap me in a negative cycle when i spent a big part of my life trying very hard to get out of it.</p>

              <p>Sometimes, one has to learn how to bo chup and turn a deaf ear to what others say, particularly if it was the scolding you had got and the things said were unjustified.</p>

              <p>First of all. What did that person say ? Is it just baseless flaming and random insulting ? I trust you can ignore that if thats the case.</p>

              <p>That's probably why you are finally feeling crushed from all these accumulative damages.</p>

              <p>Interesting. Instead of replying to the various constructive replies, you chose to reply to the one whom you feel that he/she resembles that friend of yours, and projected your anger towards him. Ask yourself - does it really make you feel any better?</p>
              <p>The reason why you're so emotionally affected by his words is that it came from a close friend, and not some madman on the street, so much that your self-esteem begins leaking away from you like air escaping a pierced balloon. You begin to struggle with the validity of what he said, whether there's any truth in his statements, and wondering you're really such an irksome person that a close friend has to say all that to you in your face. In order to escape those thoughts, you assume that your friend did that because he was hurt and was trying to make himself feel better by putting you down.</p>
              <p>However, because it's <em>your</em> assumption, you're never sure if that's the cause. So those thoughts continuously haunt you, draining your energy as you try to validate yourself and your capabilities in every thing you do in order to prove what he said was wrong. You would feel uncomfortable, or even paranoid, in your daily life because every little mistake you do might prove his statements true.</p>
              <p>All you have to do, is not to suppress those thoughts, but to go to him and calmly ask him why he had said all those things to you. Only when you know the reason, will you be able to put your mind at rest.</p>

              <p>Interesting. Instead of replying to the various constructive replies, you chose to reply to the one whom you feel that he/she resembles that friend of yours, and projected your anger towards him. Ask yourself - does it really make you feel any better?</p>
              <p>The reason why you're so emotionally affected by his words is that it came from a close friend, and not some madman on the street, so much that your self-esteem begins leaking away from you like air escaping a pierced balloon.

              <p><br>Precisely</p>
              <p>In fact TS, I seriously think you have to go for counselling.</p>
              <p>You can't seem to be able to control your emotions. And when people give you "feedback" you brush it off as them trying to boost their own egos or whatever. This is running away from the problem.</p>
              <p>Their feedback may not sound nice and all, but this does not mean that it has no merits. You should learn to sieve out the constructive criticisms from the "feedback".</p>
              <p>And if you can't, then go and find someone who can help you do so. Eg. counselors, therapists</p>
