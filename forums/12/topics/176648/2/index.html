Most of the time it's almost always like the guys gets rejected or dumped or hurt or confused. Now dun get me wrong, Im not trying to say it's the females' fault. No one's at fault. It differs from r/s to r/s. Every case is different.<br><br>There is a general trend that the guys complaining they are so nice to their gals yet it seems the gal does not appreciate it. And they are often confused by their gf's mixed signals. Can it be that being 'nice' backfires?<br><br>It's not that ending a r/s is a nice thing to do. But both parties have to have something common--they like each other mutually a lot. If one party doesnt, what's the point of continuing the r/s? It's hurting to the other party and a waste of time.</div>
