            <div class='col-md body'>Im a girl...Can say she's immature...if you keep showing that you allow yourself to take in such crap, it won't end. Look at me relationship. Same. One year plus and I did everything for him. Look what happened. Now everything is my fault, he must always get what he wants...blah blah blah. Same same la. Must be strong and be firm and tell her you won't take it. If she keeps threatening to stop the r/s because of her stupid attitude, might as well let her. She probably just threatening u to scare u to submission. My two cents worth.</div>

CURRENTLY!!! she's kinda flared up and threatened to uh, cease the relationship..<br><br>yeah, need some thoughts on this... maybe include why i keep giving and get nothing in return... =/</div></blockquote>What did you give? honestly?<br><br>If you really like a girl, giving her your best and getting nothing in return is normal.<br><br>There must be a reason for her to react like this.<br><br>Could this be one?<br><br>1) she stick too close to you?<br><br>2) cling to close to you and always want to be around you until you cannot breath.<br><br>3) you do not talk to her often until she got to call you? And when she calls you  you only talk to her around 10 mins only.<br></div>
