I bet u r quite young,it is still ok to move on without her and find a one that really cares for and understands u. A lot of times,people r afraid to move on and cling on to their old ones,cos they r afraid not able to find another one.Have confident on yrself.Breaking off is a loss to her and a gain for u.If u r gd(not in terms of look and wealth but character),u r able to another better one.</div>
