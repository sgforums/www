            <div class='col-md body'>hi silly&amp;dumb, there will always come a time where your relationship between you and your boyfriend is put to the test. now is the time. you must never forget the promises you made to each other when you both first started holding hands or when he looked you in the eyes and promised to look after you forever. sometimes, we end up having feelings for other people, but it might not turn out to be love afterall, but just temporarly infatuation. if you really love your boyfriend, then tell yourself that and everything will be fine, and i'm sure your colleague will understand as well. just don't let your decision be made upon haste, as that would be the worst form of judgement.<br><br>remember, if in doubt, stop and ask yourself, who do you really have feelings for? the guy who has stood by you for so long, selflessly caring for you, or a person you have just met not too long ago. it might not be worth jeopardizing your relationship over someone whom you aren't even sure of.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It can be lonely in a foreign land with no friends or love ones around especially those lonely unbearable nights. Not surprising if you develop an affection for another. Good news is you know it was just an infatuation. Try and make more friends if you can or join a health club so you have a place to head to for a good workout after work or maybe look up if there are any of your fellow countrymen working in that country or not. If they are then you can join them instead of directing your energy on your colleague. Guess your feelings for your bf is really being tested now and it's up to you to try and resist this temtptation to stray.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mmm....I think I have seen this problem from somewhere before. Anyway its common to have confusion in LDR cos lack of physical affection. To maintain the relationship will depend how the couple have to work it out. As some other have point out, mix with more colleague to dilute the feeling towards ur colleague so as to prevent from the awkwardness. Time will fade the feelings if u are firm enough.<br><br>Just curious what ur yunhaier reply?? Haha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>Anyway all the best to TS.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Can understand how you feel.  Afterall, I was once away for 2yrs studying while my wife is back in SG working.  That feeling ...is no fun.. and same case, there was some problem after I left.... we hardly talk and just kept to ourself.. that made it even worse.<br><br>Suddenly, there is no one for you and you have to fend for yourself in a strange land.  In fact, I was free to do anything I wanted except time to go home.  only got to chat with each other online anf that was in open forum where everybody was reading your post.. mostly about house, family, but nothing about ourself.. merely 30 min the most, most time 10min... long story after that.... but long distance really a test of each other's faith and real LOVE?<br><br>You really have to ask yourself.  If without this posting, will you still have the same feeling with yr b/f?  would the same thing happen when another guy comes by?  Probably only you can answer that.  If you are really not for each other, it will still happen and this working in foriegn country merely hasten the pace of the happening.  Talk to your b/f, may chat online and find out how each other's doing.... there is this thing as video chat.  If I can chat my my vendor in India, why not you?</div>

Take more time to communicate with him..<br><br>As for the guy u thk have infatuation, just be friends 1st.. u 'll never know some1's true colour if you  understand the person's lie.. Mayb hes cute, thats ok.. but control ur emotion... Do not trust anyone including that guy.. just remember this... Never judge ppl by their apperance.<br><br>And for your bf, right now, if you think something wrong, its either you or him to find out.. cmon man, its your r/s, anything u felt wrong just ask him or tell him... dun hide.. remember , u and him are already so far away, any need to hide anything ? Just tell him watever you don feel right, at least he knows bout it after you tell.<br><br>If you n him really hard to be together ,then let time tells,.. For the guy, relax, just be friends 1st.. dun rush on things like this.. just becareful cuz you're alone there.. u need to be smart and alert with the ppl around u there.. care of some1 out there to backstab you whenever possible.. Not im being pessimistic but this is the real world.. Always stay alert.. That guy is not your no.1 priority... remember..</div>
