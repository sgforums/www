              <p>I don't know if I had done the right thing, I am currently 14 and
              studying in a Secondary School of Singapore</p>
              <p>I used to have a group
              of four friend we were is a rather good relationship. One day I try
              to help one of the guy to complete his maths project he didn't do it
              but I did it. He wanted to copy mine but it will take very long as he
              had a lot of homework which he had yet to be done and I need to hand up
              the project on that day very same day so I got a piece of blank paper
              and copy down the work that I had done for him. After I done it he said
              thank you. Well I must say I was quite happy but then one of my
              friend say 'see this guy is so nice, yet you are unappreciative' as I
              was very bored I started to provoke him... I said words like '
              Absolutely' for fun of course, i didn't mean that obviously but I must
              say I didn't consider his feeling.</p>
              <p>After I said that he returned me
              the piece of paper I had copied specially for him. I didn't know what I
              was doing...I believe I was rather angry at that time, I was
              rather angry at that moment, so i said thing like ' Why? I
              copied for you trying to help you yet you rejected my offer '. He also started to argue with me
              although I can't remember.</p>
              <p>He soon disliked me and never had talk to
              me anymore.Because the guy I had quarrel with had a strong connection
              with the other 3 friends, although the 3 guys who i didn't quarrel with
              was not hating me or dislike me, it was only a matter of time when that
              will happen... I don't want to be out of friends and be so lonely,
              worst still the guy who I had quarreled sit right beside me and I knew
              in long term it will be a disadvantage to me.</p>
              <p>I want to get back my
              friendship with the guy sitting beside me but just how? I am trapped...
              I don't know how, I regretted my action and I need to be friend with
              him cause I don't have a choice as they are the smartest in class and
              sort of the most popular in class.</p>
              <p>I need them... if I don't have
              them, during project work, I won't be having a group and high chance
              that I will be getting a ZERO for the project work... which  no one would want right? </p>
              <p>Dear readers what should I do? Just what to do to get back a
              friendship with them? I believe they like me because I am helpful? All I need was just to get back a friendship with them probably a stable one, what should I do? Did I do anything very wrong? I am rather straight
              forward and I really need a answer.</p>
              <p>Any answer or reply from you
              readers will be greatly appreciated..</p>

              <p>Thank you brainerror your advise is appreciated, goe the same for youyayu. Indeed I really regretted what I had done and yes, brainerror you are right firstly, I should not have make a copy of my work for them but I hope as a 14 years old guy and not very popular in class I realised that if I lend them a work to copy, they will kind of talk to me so thats why I lend them my work or make a copy of them. But then, I shouldn't have lend them in the first place and I will try to avoid it. Thank you</p>
              <p>But the most important question is how do I actually regain a friendship with that guy?</p>
              <p>I appreciate ANY of the advise posted on this topic.</p>

              <p>being bored does not give you the right to provoke him dude .</p>
              <p>but after that , did you tell your friend "Hey Dude , just kidding okay ? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">"</p>
              <p>so now , you can choose to apologize ( whether you are in the wrong or otherwise )</p>
              <p>or you can seek another group of friends <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Just be humble, give in and apologize to the guy. This is not really a major issue so if you do apologize, its likely he will accept it.</p>
              <p>Just take note of your actions in future. Do not act too proud or high and mighty which makes people dislike you etc.</p>
              <p>You should be making friends not just because they are the smartest in class etc. Having a motive for making friends will never make you a true friend and somehow or other people can feel it.</p>
              <p>There is no way to get 0 for a project unless you didn't do it cos as long as group work is assigned by any teacher, they will ensure that everyone is in groups. The only thing that can happen is you are grouped with someone you dislike or people that dislike you.</p>
              <p>1 more thing, DON'T keep posting and asking people to come here help you in every single post you make. Its simply irritating and most of the people in bar and sex forums are just there to crap. You also should have better things to do than hanging out in those forums which are not too suitable for you age :p</p>

              <p>Friendship like any relationship takes time to build but takes a moment to destory. To win this friendship back if its really precious to you takes time.</p>
              <p>Your actions will show whether this friendship is important or insignificant. Not everything you do will be appreciated. It's bitter to swallow but then it does tell you how important you are to that person as a friend.</p>
