            <div class='col-md body'>Hi zombiefied, i'm in a somewhat similar situation as u...<br><br>I do not have any formal diagosis of my prob cos i've not seen any psychiatrists but one of the GREATEST prob of my life is my inability 2 connect to ppl...<br><br>Despite all my effort, i do not have a close circle of loyal frens nor a wide social network.... i'm a uni student, this is the best time of my life to have fun, i see most of my classmates/peers enjoying great relationships, either havin many frens or being attached ... i can't understand why i'm feelin so isolated &amp; miserable<br><br>I feel like a great LOSER at times... i dun know if i have any mental illness ( i doubt so cos i "function" normally in most aspects of my life &amp; have a good relationship with my parents) but i can basically streamlined my probs into 3 main factors:<br><br>Moon Swing (Bipolar disorder)<br>Low self esteem<br>Personality disorder<br><br>My misery is always magnified during the year-end festive seasons... last yr, i turned off my hp &amp; went into some kinda of self-imposed isolation... apart frm my parents &amp; leaving the hse 2 get food, i've not contact anyone for over 2 weeks...<br>it's not necessarily a sign of mental illness... i guess it's jus feelin the need to withdraw frm all the outside world (aft feelin so defeated) &amp; seekin to "find myself"<br><br>If the cause of ur probs has some biological root, which ur doc should hav diagnose, then maybe takin medications wld help...<br><br>I've not seen a doc cos i believe my probs is not caused by some chemical inbalance in the brain or other biological defect ( as in some depression cases), hence medications may not be helpful<br><br>I'm jus extremely unsatisfied by how my frens have treated me, how my relationships hav turned out, jus immensely frustrated at my inability to build deep &amp; enduring relationships socially...</div>

My life in Primary school wasn't that bad until when I'm in Sec 1 where the problem starts to surface.<br><br>When I got my PSLE result that time, I was given choice whether to choose between express stream or normal stream and pride got me and I end up choosing express stream.<br><br>When school started, for the first half year, I've got problems coping with secondary life and most important of all, classmates. The competition was strong and I slowly start to isolate myself from the rest of my classmates. Things got worse when I got into Sec 2. I couldn't get along with my classmates, to me, they are people who look for me when they needed my help and shun me when I'm no longer in use. That was when I completely shut myself out from everyone. I don't talk to anyone, don't eat with anyone. Everyone goes out together for movies and lunches and I'll roam the school canteen alone during recess time and eat alone, goes to movie alone and does everything alone.<br><br>I still remember one incident that shocked my form teacher. The class was given a project and everyone was to form groups to do the project. During class break, I approach the teacher and request to do the project alone. She was shocked by my request and tried to consult me but my mind was made up then. I told her it's either she give me permission to do the project alone or she can give me a zero straight on the spot. Reluctantly, she agreed.<br><br>For two whole years, I spend my days alone with no friends at all. I felt like I can't trust anyone and I don't want to trust anyone. To me, they came to me only when they need my help and left when it's done. I don't like that feeling. My only activities in school was badminton and NPCC which doesn't help much to open up my life.<br><br>It's only when I started my Sec 3 life that I slowly open up. I failed my sec 2 end year examination and was demoted to Normal stream which was a big blow to me. Maths to me was like an alien subject which I could never pass. During the beginning of Sec 3, my maths teacher was mean enough to pass remarks like "some people think they are in Express stream before but they can't even do well in their maths". Although no names mentioned but I knew she's referring to me as I'm the only one that is banished from Express stream to Normal stream. The demotion was already a hit to me and her remarks kicks out my pride. I swear to prove her wrong and I did. For the first half of the year, I buy almost all the ten years series maths books and practice again and again and my efforts were rewarded when I get my first distinction for the mid year exam. From a F9 to a distinction, it was my proudest moment and that shut my maths teacher up.<br><br>I started to have a few friends which we form a study group on our own. Each of us has our own strength in subjects. I'm good in Maths and the rest, Science and others. I stayed within this group and never wandered out. Other than studies time, I never really did go out with them. Most of the time I still keep to myself.<br><br>I wouldn't say I'm on depression those few years. Maybe I was but for sure I never really seek professional help cause I kept the from my family. In their eyes, I'm still the active child who stays clear of trouble and does not rebel but what they don't know is for all the things I've gone through, I never did tell them. What they saw was what I want them to see and not the real me.<br><br>During my last year in Secondary School, I was suffering from extensive gastric pain which landed me in hospital many times and skip school for couple of weeks. That prove fatel to my studies as it's badly affected and exterior pressure from my vice principle who threatens to expel me out of the school if I fail my mid year exam. Afterall the visits to the hospital, the only diagnosis that the doc gave was that I'm under extreme pressure which indirectly trigger the gastric pain. The warning from the vice principle never help much but thanks to a few kind teachers who volunteer to persuade the principle to let me stay.<br><br>I started my working life straight after O Levels as a sales person and that becomes another turning point in my life. Forced to talk, I slowly learn to communicate with people through all the strangers who walks in and out of the shop. My confidence level risen then and I start to know more people. But my depression doesn't stop there.<br><br>Since graduate till now, I've changed 5 jobs. In sales line, I worked hard to become acting supervisor and when my supervisor resign, I thought I'll be promoted to store supervisor but it came as a shock when the management promote another colleague instead on the account that he worked there longer than me although they admit I'm more capable than him. I resign. Things goes the same for the next job and the next job, and the next job...<br><br>I'm starting to feel that my world is tumbling down. No, my sky was never that high before. No matter what I do, I seemed to fail. Everytime I convince myself to stand up again, I'll fall badly again and each time worse than before.<br><br>Work life suc[k]s and my love life and friendship isn't any better. Betrayals were all the things I've faced. My heart, being stabbed again and again without mercy. Many times I almost surrender to death. I just want to end it all and end my sufferings and all the pain I'm going through. To me, this is an ugly world filled with masks and schemings.<br><br>But I'm a happy person now. Dont' ask me how I do it cause I'm still trying to be happy. I want to be happy. Recieve with open arms for all to come into my life, those who makes my life happy stays and those who give me hell, out they go. I realised one thing. What you want from others, give it to them first. I learn to trust people, love them and give as much help as I can. For those who appreciate will love me back. I don't demand that they must help me but I won't expect them to betray me in the end. For those who choose to betray me or use me, all I can say to them are that they don't deserve my friendship. For those who are nice to me and sees me as a friend, they'll recieve 100x more from me for what they have given me.<br><br>Lastly, sorry for the extremely long post and thanks for reading whoever made the effort to read till this line.</div>

It's more like I've no choice. Attempted suicides before and obviously failed. I gave up. I knew I can die if I really wanted to but something else was holding me back. Despite the constant quarrel with my mum and lack of understanding from her, I must still admit that I love her very much.<br><br>I wanted an easy way out to stop all my pain but the reluctant desire to be kept alive is too strong. I can't leave yet. There's something else I need to accomplish before I can leave.<br><br>Life now is already bad enough and I don't want to make it worse. If I have no choice but to stay alive then I would want to be as happy as I could. For years I've been trying to find ways to make my life more happy. I went drinking, dancing, enjoy my night out with friends but it never really make me that happy. It was until I start lending my ears to others problems and by helping them, it enlighten my life much and I learn from their mistake. I'm not a saint and I still err but I try to learn and practice as much as possible.<br><br>I still suffer setbacks now but am still trying hard to cope. I still fall and sometimes it takes me a bit more time to stand up again but I knew when I fall, I fell deep into darkness and sometimes almost couldn't pull myself up again. Darkness, such a familiar place to be in. Darkness is a place where you can't see anything, hear anything, feel anything. Emptiness filled the place.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear zombiefield, laosu &amp; weijan, it was heartening to read an autobiography acct of ur life  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>At least I know IÂ’m not alone in feeling the way I doÂ…<br><br>Over the past few yrs, IÂ’ve also dev a peculiar habit--- I wld change my hp number at the end of each yr; itÂ’s not meant 2 avoid anyoneÂ… in fact thereÂ’s no one in life which I nd 2 avoid cos most of my frens seldom ever contact me<br><br>ItÂ’s perhaps a ritual for me to start afresh &amp; put behind all my unhappiness.. IÂ’m constantly troubled by the fact that none of my frens ever contact meÂ… do they hate me, forgotten abt me or am I simply insignificant? Looking at my ever quiet hp, itÂ’s like a invisible burden to meÂ… by changing my number, it symbolize me choosing to forsake them, choosing to erase them from my lifeÂ…<br><br>Last week, however, a small bizarre incident occurredÂ… I accidentally drop my hp &amp; lost ALL the contacts in my in list. So from now till xmas &amp; new yr, even if I want to, I canÂ’t contact any of my frens. The only way is to wait for the ppl in my life to contactÂ… and as expected (sadly) none of my old frens/classmates/ex-gf ever contact meÂ….<br><br>In particular IÂ’m waiting for 2 close frens &amp; a gal which I like to contact meÂ… but chances are slim; IÂ’ve spoken to them abt how I feel towards them not contacting me. Apparently, they do not dislike me (we meet everytime I ask them out) nor find that IÂ’ve any big personality probÂ… but my life still inevitably returns to emptiness soon after cos none of them ever initiate any contact with me<br><br>Sometimes I wonderÂ… would any of these frens (ppl I considered Â‘closeÂ’ frens) know I if I died one dayÂ… the 2 close frens which I mentioned, we cld talk for hours when we meet &amp; they say IÂ’m their close frenÂ… but they hardly even sms me for yrs if I do not do so...<br></div>

For me playing in a heavy band is the ultimate stress relief. Maybe you can go for gigs or something, great way to meet like-minded people what. And the kind of music you play, yes it IS related to the dark side of life, but it shows you are able to stand up and face the unknown, face your fears (or at least talk about it through your music) yeah? MANY people out there in metal bands say their music is "a way to exorcise their inner demons" sounds cliched lah, but i have to agree, though not to the extent of exorcism lah.

I have thought of getting/borrowing books on romantic relationships(human psychology, conflicts, understanding emotional needs) but I'm not too sure. Any recommendations? Also, if you pple have an idea of how I can help myself, please do share with me and help me fight it. Thanks a hell lot.</div></blockquote></div>

My life in Primary school wasn't that bad until when I'm in Sec 1 where the problem starts to surface.<br><br>When I got my PSLE result that time, I was given choice whether to choose between express stream or normal stream and pride got me and I end up choosing express stream.<br><br>When school started, for the first half year, I've got problems coping with secondary life and most important of all, classmates. The competition was strong and I slowly start to isolate myself from the rest of my classmates. Things got worse when I got into Sec 2. I couldn't get along with my classmates, to me, they are people who look for me when they needed my help and shun me when I'm no longer in use. That was when I completely shut myself out from everyone. I don't talk to anyone, don't eat with anyone. Everyone goes out together for movies and lunches and I'll roam the school canteen alone during recess time and eat alone, goes to movie alone and does everything alone.<br><br>I still remember one incident that shocked my form teacher. The class was given a project and everyone was to form groups to do the project. During class break, I approach the teacher and request to do the project alone. She was shocked by my request and tried to consult me but my mind was made up then. I told her it's either she give me permission to do the project alone or she can give me a zero straight on the spot. Reluctantly, she agreed.<br><br>For two whole years, I spend my days alone with no friends at all. I felt like I can't trust anyone and I don't want to trust anyone. To me, they came to me only when they need my help and left when it's done. I don't like that feeling. My only activities in school was badminton and NPCC which doesn't help much to open up my life.<br><br>It's only when I started my Sec 3 life that I slowly open up. I failed my sec 2 end year examination and was demoted to Normal stream which was a big blow to me. Maths to me was like an alien subject which I could never pass. During the beginning of Sec 3, my maths teacher was mean enough to pass remarks like "some people think they are in Express stream before but they can't even do well in their maths". Although no names mentioned but I knew she's referring to me as I'm the only one that is banished from Express stream to Normal stream. The demotion was already a hit to me and her remarks kicks out my pride. I swear to prove her wrong and I did. For the first half of the year, I buy almost all the ten years series maths books and practice again and again and my efforts were rewarded when I get my first distinction for the mid year exam. From a F9 to a distinction, it was my proudest moment and that shut my maths teacher up.<br><br>I started to have a few friends which we form a study group on our own. Each of us has our own strength in subjects. I'm good in Maths and the rest, Science and others. I stayed within this group and never wandered out. Other than studies time, I never really did go out with them. Most of the time I still keep to myself.<br><br>I wouldn't say I'm on depression those few years. Maybe I was but for sure I never really seek professional help cause I kept the from my family. In their eyes, I'm still the active child who stays clear of trouble and does not rebel but what they don't know is for all the things I've gone through, I never did tell them. What they saw was what I want them to see and not the real me.<br><br>During my last year in Secondary School, I was suffering from extensive gastric pain which landed me in hospital many times and skip school for couple of weeks. That prove fatel to my studies as it's badly affected and exterior pressure from my vice principle who threatens to expel me out of the school if I fail my mid year exam. Afterall the visits to the hospital, the only diagnosis that the doc gave was that I'm under extreme pressure which indirectly trigger the gastric pain. The warning from the vice principle never help much but thanks to a few kind teachers who volunteer to persuade the principle to let me stay.<br><br>I started my working life straight after O Levels as a sales person and that becomes another turning point in my life. Forced to talk, I slowly learn to communicate with people through all the strangers who walks in and out of the shop. My confidence level risen then and I start to know more people. But my depression doesn't stop there.<br><br>Since graduate till now, I've changed 5 jobs. In sales line, I worked hard to become acting supervisor and when my supervisor resign, I thought I'll be promoted to store supervisor but it came as a shock when the management promote another colleague instead on the account that he worked there longer than me although they admit I'm more capable than him. I resign. Things goes the same for the next job and the next job, and the next job...<br><br>I'm starting to feel that my world is tumbling down. No, my sky was never that high before. No matter what I do, I seemed to fail. Everytime I convince myself to stand up again, I'll fall badly again and each time worse than before.<br><br>Work life suc[k]s and my love life and friendship isn't any better. Betrayals were all the things I've faced. My heart, being stabbed again and again without mercy. Many times I almost surrender to death. I just want to end it all and end my sufferings and all the pain I'm going through. To me, this is an ugly world filled with masks and schemings.<br><br>But I'm a happy person now. Dont' ask me how I do it cause I'm still trying to be happy. I want to be happy. Recieve with open arms for all to come into my life, those who makes my life happy stays and those who give me hell, out they go. I realised one thing. What you want from others, give it to them first. I learn to trust people, love them and give as much help as I can. For those who appreciate will love me back. I don't demand that they must help me but I won't expect them to betray me in the end. For those who choose to betray me or use me, all I can say to them are that they don't deserve my friendship. For those who are nice to me and sees me as a friend, they'll recieve 100x more from me for what they have given me.<br><br>Lastly, sorry for the extremely long post and thanks for reading whoever made the effort to read till this line.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey laosu, after reading your post, i was sad but puzzled at the same time. Why do people have to face those unfortunate events in their life? I had my share of problems in secondary school, but most turn out to have positive effects on myself.<br><br>Why did you choose to isolate yourself from your peers during your secondary school days? Your secondary school experience would have been much more memorable with them, provided that you have handled your friendship well.<br><br>In areas of your studies, you have shown that you are capable of doing well in your studies. But why didn't you put enough efforts into your studies before you were demoted to the normal stream?<br><br>I do not have the intention to make you feel bad or anything, im writing this because i feel that its really a pity that your life have turned this way. I felt that things could have turned out much better if you had done certain things back then.</div>
