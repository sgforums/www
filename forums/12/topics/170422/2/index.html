            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by Ray87:<br>[b]hey laosu, after reading your post, i was sad but puzzled at the same time. Why do people have to face those unfortunate events in their life? I had my share of problems in secondary school, but most turn out to have positive effects on myself.  <span style="color: blue;">- Fortunate or unfortunate events are programmed to our life till the end so that we can learn from it. One thing I can tell you for sure is, whether it's good or bad events, ultimately it's how you want the ending to be. You've said that it turn out most to have a positive effect on you is because you want it to turn out positively. Imagine if you met with an unfortunate event and you just let yourself sink deeper into depression, will it inflict a positive effect on you? I guess not.</span><br><br>Why did you choose to isolate yourself from your peers during your secondary school days? Your secondary school experience would have been much more memorable with them, provided that you have handled your friendship well.<br><br>In areas of your studies, you have shown that you are capable of doing well in your studies. But why didn't you put enough efforts into your studies before you were demoted to the normal stream? <span style="color: blue;">- Sorry, this is a question that till now I still can't offer an explaination. Not that I don't want to. But that's the past and I can't turn back the clock so no point dwelling over it. You might suggest that Im still able to upgrade myself now and Yes I do agree with you but till now I've yet discover anything that I want to study in. Ok, I do have a dream but it's a dream that is far beyond my reach due to family objection.</span><br><br>I do not have the intention to make you feel bad or anything, im writing this because i feel that its really a pity that your life have turned this way. I felt that things could have turned out much better if you had done certain things back then. <span style="color: blue;">- Haha, is ok, nothing about my past can make me feel bad now and I believe your good intentions when writing all these. Thinking back now, I have no regrets to my own history. I'm proud of who I am now. I don't deny that things might have turn out much better if I had done certain things back then but then I won't be who I am now. I could probably be another person busy earning money and forgot about feelings altogether. I might be even worse that who I am in the past and become worse due to the harsh reality of the working society. I will never see myself as a loser now even though I might not have achieve much but for the fact that I've survived it, nothing much can put me down now unlike for "some people" who love to call others loser, I pity them.[/</span>b]</blockquote>I won't deny the fact that I might have a totally different life experience if I learn to handle my friendship well and study well then. But as who I am now, I think back and I don't really regret.<br><br>First of all, if I had learn to handle the friendship well then, is that really friendship or again for the sake of studies and blah blah blah? I don't think any of them ever treated me as friend either. Not that I'm still sore about it now but I do admit that I'm sore at that moment and why let myself be make used of?<br><br>There's a lot of things in life we could have avoided and lead a more comfortable life. Now I'm already 28, in a way I do appreciate the fact that I've been through all that and survived. Unlike what I won't deny the fact that I might have a totally different life experience if I learn to handle my friendship well and study well then.

I've been through it and I survive. So what if I'm just an O Level grad? So what if I've isolate myself before? At least I've survived it and learn and from my past experience I'm willing to share the story with others who is going through it and set myself a good example for them to learn to be strong.<br><br>I may not earn $3-4K per month but I earn a honest living. With all the feelings that I've deprived myself from last time, I'm full of it now and in my earnest to help people to cope with it and find back the feelings that they lost.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey~ Cheer up~ At least you are better than someone who drinks dettol at home and post craps because they're already losers even in forums~<br><br>Anyway, here's my story. I've a similar case to you and I'm also feeling the same as you .. but I tried to make myself happy. Listening to music, playing MMORPG =P (make friends too) and learning guitar~<br><br>When I was young (Pri1 -4), I was quite a .. "popular" person in school. I was the top few students in the class. I excel in Maths, and Arts (I'm pursuing designing diploma now =D)<br>In school, people always looked for me to eat, for group works and such. I was very happy back then, also being a "smart kid" . (guai hai zi lolz)<br><br>Pri 5, my life changed. I turned out to be the worst in the class.. I went to EM2, being the only person, I had trouble coping with the new class. I got bullied, so lonely during recess ..<br>Then I got to know this friend. He's a very good friend. He always try to introduce me around since he's an "active" person in the class. Soon, I began to get comfortable in the new class. And those friends from my previous class NEVER EVER contacted me again.<br><br>However, I was very controlled by my parents. My mum actually.<br>Because this friend of mine, his mother is quite rich, my mother hate her (My father side family is wealthy last time and cocky.. so she hates rich brats) . So my mum dont allow me to go to his house, dont want me to be his friend etc. (childish ..)<br><br>Soon, I knew a group of kids who're more to inclined to playing than studying.<br>I like them actually. At least I dont have to study and study and study .. but what my mum did? Bring me away from them and isolate me .. in the end, I had no friends in the class ..<br><br>Sec 1-2. A new environment. New friends. Similar stuffs again .. Sec 2 know a group of basketball mates and we're together till Sec 3 when the tragic comes. Since most of them are good friends (better relationship than I was with them), I was not taken into regard in all the matches we play. I was basically an outcast. Asking me to defend a GIRL since I was short (wtf..). And during matches, even if someone is so called weaker than me gets a chance on the court. But I was not. I was asked to be a water boy...<br>Yea .. what friends were these .. soon I left the team and never touch basketball ever since ..<br>And also another reason was my mum wasnt approved of me playing basketball and want me to FUGGING STUDY!!!<br><br>Sec 3-4. The time when I slowly get worst in acadamic studies. A new class again since I chose a different class from my classmates. I get to know a group of friends, who're engaged in card games, computer games .. basically playing. How do I get to know them? Simple~ They were the ones who bullied me during the first day i get into the class.. and somehow we became "good friends" after a few days.<br><br>Now, the tragic comes again .. the group of "friends" were friends of people of the other class. And there's this rich man son who managed to get the whole class to outcast me, all because of a game. (duh..) He was flooding the chat window, and all I asked him to do was shut up for a minute ..<br><br>But this group of friends did not do so. They still continue to take me as a friend. But how good indeed are they? They're really "GOOD FRIENDS".<br>I wasn't asked to go for a movie even though they asked each other RIGHT AT MY FACE. I mean, I can't be that thick skin to ask "Eh! I want to GO also!!".<br>This crap happens for 2 yrs .. and as time passed, I slowly drift furthur from them. And after the O's .. we were never in contact .<br><br>------------------<br><br>So after all this shit these 17 years .. what did i get in return? Good grades? No. Good friends? Zero . I wasted my life for this 17 yrs ..<br>It may seem idiotic, but truely, I have no friends from my pri and sec currently. Seriously.. when people say Sec sch is a good time to make good friends, I got none.<br><br>I was only allowed a handphone this yr .. and I entered poly. How many contacts do I have ? less than 50. Sounds stupid but true. I never had my handphone touched by my polymates since I'm very scared that they'll laugh at me ..<br><br>At least some of you have good relationship with your parents. I dont have. I hate my mother. She is the one which cause so many hatred in me. Controlling my life, my friends .. I had NO SOCIAL LIFE ok .. if I get home at 5pm during secondary school , I get slapped ! Wtf.. I mean .. seriously, even while typing this, I feel so much hatred for her controlling my life .. wanting me to study and study ... in the end I ended up with totally nothing ..<br>No relationship till now since my mum always forbid me to.<br>And frankly, I never dare to chat to girls, and it only started this yr , when I entered poly (since most of my classmates are girls) and they're very matured in their thinking.. that's a fact I believed.<br><br>At least, now my poly mates are quite good. They won't leave out me.. since it's a 20 people class, we're quite united and we have gatherings once in a while if we dont have any projects to rush on. I never told anyone about my past except 4 of them, which are matured enough in that sense that they wont spread it around or make sacastic remarks.. they really listen, which I'm very happy .. not even my mum know anything about this, and she still thinks she's right..<br><br>To sum it up, what I'm trying to say is, no matter how bad your life is, never broad over it. I seldom smile, and it makes my relationship with people real bad .. But try not to think of unhappy things. They're lots of good people around. Try to speak up more~ I was not close to the class beside ours (poly), but after speaking up a few times for presentation and joking craps around, I got to know a new bunch of friends from the other class. =) So just speak up~ And if people are trying to be jerks, ignore them.<br><br>I'm still very introvert now .. and i understand how you all feel when nobody contacts you (me too.. even during christmas period. . not even a greeting ..)<br>but .. yea.. dont think so much into it~ You'll be happier~<br><br>Just be yourself~ If people dont like you, then just dont be with them~ Dont wear fake masks and try to accomadate people. Friends are only true if they accept the true you =)</div>
