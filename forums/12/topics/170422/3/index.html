I've a similar case to you and I'm also feeling the same as you .. but I tried to make myself happy. Listening to music, playing MMORPG =P (make friends too) and learning guitar~<br><br>When I was young (Pri1 -4), I was quite a .. "popular" person in school. I was the top few students in the class. I excel in Maths, and Arts (I'm pursuing designing diploma now =D)<br>In school, people always looked for me to eat, for group works and such. I was very happy back then, also being a "smart kid" . (guai hai zi lolz)<br><br>Pri 5, my life changed. I turned out to be the worst in the class.. I went to EM2, being the only person, I had trouble coping with the new class. I got bullied, so lonely during recess ..<br>Then I got to know this friend. He's a very good friend. He always try to introduce me around since he's an "active" person in the class. Soon, I began to get comfortable in the new class. And those friends from my previous class NEVER EVER contacted me again.<br><br>However, I was very controlled by my parents. My mum actually.<br>Because this friend of mine, his mother is quite rich, my mother hate her (My father side family is wealthy last time and cocky.. so she hates rich brats) . So my mum dont allow me to go to his house, dont want me to be his friend etc. (childish ..)<br><br>Soon, I knew a group of kids who're more to inclined to playing than studying.<br>I like them actually. At least I dont have to study and study and study .. but what my mum did? Bring me away from them and isolate me .. in the end, I had no friends in the class ..<br><br>Sec 1-2. A new environment. New friends. Similar stuffs again .. Sec 2 know a group of basketball mates and we're together till Sec 3 when the tragic comes. Since most of them are good friends (better relationship than I was with them), I was not taken into regard in all the matches we play. I was basically an outcast. Asking me to defend a GIRL since I was short (wtf..). And during matches, even if someone is so called weaker than me gets a chance on the court. But I was not. I was asked to be a water boy...<br>Yea .. what friends were these .. soon I left the team and never touch basketball ever since ..<br>And also another reason was my mum wasnt approved of me playing basketball and want me to FUGGING STUDY!!!<br><br>Sec 3-4. The time when I slowly get worst in acadamic studies. A new class again since I chose a different class from my classmates. I get to know a group of friends, who're engaged in card games, computer games .. basically playing. How do I get to know them? Simple~ They were the ones who bullied me during the first day i get into the class.. and somehow we became "good friends" after a few days.<br><br>Now, the tragic comes again .. the group of "friends" were friends of people of the other class. And there's this rich man son who managed to get the whole class to outcast me, all because of a game. (duh..) He was flooding the chat window, and all I asked him to do was shut up for a minute ..<br><br>But this group of friends did not do so. They still continue to take me as a friend. But how good indeed are they? They're really "GOOD FRIENDS".<br>I wasn't asked to go for a movie even though they asked each other RIGHT AT MY FACE. I mean, I can't be that thick skin to ask "Eh! I want to GO also!!".<br>This crap happens for 2 yrs .. and as time passed, I slowly drift furthur from them. And after the O's .. we were never in contact .<br><br>------------------<br><br>So after all this shit these 17 years .. what did i get in return? Good grades? No. Good friends? Zero . I wasted my life for this 17 yrs ..<br>It may seem idiotic, but truely, I have no friends from my pri and sec currently. Seriously.. when people say Sec sch is a good time to make good friends, I got none.<br><br>I was only allowed a handphone this yr .. and I entered poly. How many contacts do I have ? less than 50. Sounds stupid but true. I never had my handphone touched by my polymates since I'm very scared that they'll laugh at me ..<br><br>At least some of you have good relationship with your parents. I dont have. I hate my mother. She is the one which cause so many hatred in me. Controlling my life, my friends .. I had NO SOCIAL LIFE ok .. if I get home at 5pm during secondary school , I get slapped ! Wtf.. I mean .. seriously, even while typing this, I feel so much hatred for her controlling my life .. wanting me to study and study ... in the end I ended up with totally nothing ..<br>No relationship till now since my mum always forbid me to.<br>And frankly, I never dare to chat to girls, and it only started this yr , when I entered poly (since most of my classmates are girls) and they're very matured in their thinking.. that's a fact I believed.<br><br>At least, now my poly mates are quite good. They won't leave out me.. since it's a 20 people class, we're quite united and we have gatherings once in a while if we dont have any projects to rush on. I never told anyone about my past except 4 of them, which are matured enough in that sense that they wont spread it around or make sacastic remarks.. they really listen, which I'm very happy .. not even my mum know anything about this, and she still thinks she's right..<br><br>To sum it up, what I'm trying to say is, no matter how bad your life is, never broad over it. I seldom smile, and it makes my relationship with people real bad .. But try not to think of unhappy things. They're lots of good people around. Try to speak up more~ I was not close to the class beside ours (poly), but after speaking up a few times for presentation and joking craps around, I got to know a new bunch of friends from the other class. =) So just speak up~ And if people are trying to be jerks, ignore them.<br><br>I'm still very introvert now .. and i understand how you all feel when nobody contacts you (me too.. even during christmas period. . not even a greeting ..)<br>but .. yea.. dont think so much into it~ You'll be happier~<br><br>Just be yourself~ If people dont like you, then just dont be with them~ Dont wear fake masks and try to accomadate people. Friends are only true if they accept the true you =)</div></blockquote>You'll grow up one day and get to enjoy your deserved freedom...

My mum actually.<br>Because this friend of mine, his mother is quite rich, my mother hate her (My father side family is wealthy last time and cocky.. so she hates rich brats) . So my mum dont allow me to go to his house, dont want me to be his friend etc. (childish ..)<br><br>Soon, I knew a group of kids who're more to inclined to playing than studying.<br>I like them actually. At least I dont have to study and study and study .. but what my mum did? Bring me away from them and isolate me .. in the end, I had no friends in the class ..<br><br>Sec 1-2. A new environment. New friends. Similar stuffs again .. Sec 2 know a group of basketball mates and we're together till Sec 3 when the tragic comes. Since most of them are good friends (better relationship than I was with them), I was not taken into regard in all the matches we play. I was basically an outcast. Asking me to defend a GIRL since I was short (wtf..). And during matches, even if someone is so called weaker than me gets a chance on the court. But I was not. I was asked to be a water boy...<br>Yea .. what friends were these .. soon I left the team and never touch basketball ever since ..<br>And also another reason was my mum wasnt approved of me playing basketball and want me to FUGGING STUDY!!!<br><br>Sec 3-4. The time when I slowly get worst in acadamic studies. A new class again since I chose a different class from my classmates. I get to know a group of friends, who're engaged in card games, computer games .. basically playing. How do I get to know them? Simple~ They were the ones who bullied me during the first day i get into the class.. and somehow we became "good friends" after a few days.<br><br>Now, the tragic comes again .. the group of "friends" were friends of people of the other class. And there's this rich man son who managed to get the whole class to outcast me, all because of a game. (duh..) He was flooding the chat window, and all I asked him to do was shut up for a minute ..<br><br>But this group of friends did not do so. They still continue to take me as a friend. But how good indeed are they? They're really "GOOD FRIENDS".<br>I wasn't asked to go for a movie even though they asked each other RIGHT AT MY FACE. I mean, I can't be that thick skin to ask "Eh! I want to GO also!!".<br>This crap happens for 2 yrs .. and as time passed, I slowly drift furthur from them. And after the O's .. we were never in contact .<br><br>------------------<br><br>So after all this shit these 17 years .. what did i get in return? Good grades? No. Good friends? Zero . I wasted my life for this 17 yrs ..<br>It may seem idiotic, but truely, I have no friends from my pri and sec currently. Seriously.. when people say Sec sch is a good time to make good friends, I got none.<br><br>I was only allowed a handphone this yr .. and I entered poly. How many contacts do I have ? less than 50. Sounds stupid but true. I never had my handphone touched by my polymates since I'm very scared that they'll laugh at me ..<br><br>At least some of you have good relationship with your parents. I dont have. I hate my mother. She is the one which cause so many hatred in me. Controlling my life, my friends .. I had NO SOCIAL LIFE ok .. if I get home at 5pm during secondary school , I get slapped ! Wtf.. I mean .. seriously, even while typing this, I feel so much hatred for her controlling my life .. wanting me to study and study ... in the end I ended up with totally nothing ..<br>No relationship till now since my mum always forbid me to.<br>And frankly, I never dare to chat to girls, and it only started this yr , when I entered poly (since most of my classmates are girls) and they're very matured in their thinking.. that's a fact I believed.<br><br>At least, now my poly mates are quite good. They won't leave out me.. since it's a 20 people class, we're quite united and we have gatherings once in a while if we dont have any projects to rush on. I never told anyone about my past except 4 of them, which are matured enough in that sense that they wont spread it around or make sacastic remarks.. they really listen, which I'm very happy .. not even my mum know anything about this, and she still thinks she's right..<br><br>To sum it up, what I'm trying to say is, no matter how bad your life is, never broad over it. I seldom smile, and it makes my relationship with people real bad .. But try not to think of unhappy things. They're lots of good people around. Try to speak up more~ I was not close to the class beside ours (poly), but after speaking up a few times for presentation and joking craps around, I got to know a new bunch of friends from the other class. =) So just speak up~ And if people are trying to be jerks, ignore them.<br><br>I'm still very introvert now .. and i understand how you all feel when nobody contacts you (me too.. even during christmas period. . not even a greeting ..)<br>but .. yea.. dont think so much into it~ You'll be happier~<br><br>Just be yourself~ If people dont like you, then just dont be with them~ Dont wear fake masks and try to accomadate people. Friends are only true if they accept the true you =)</div></blockquote>nikeX are you a clone of mine? your story sounds almost exactly like mine. and i'm 17 this yr also.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>First of all, my salute for u guys to share pieces of ur lifestory here. Very courageous of u.<br><br>In my opinion, everyone have their ups and downs in their life. We laugh, we cry, we shout for joy and sometimes, we blow our temper. To me, we shld act brave, or rather be brave in every cicumstances that occur to us. Never look down on our fate, try our best to brave the storms.<br><br>Making new frenZ is part and parcel of our lives, we shld not keep to ourselves, and shld open our doors continuously to receive new frenZ, who some of them, i believe will be real and true frenZ that u will need in the future. Does'nt mean u have no good frenZ now will not conclude u wont have any in the future. Keep trying and never give up in seeking real friendship.<br><br>If u believe in fate, sometimes, it's fated when u r at lowest point in life, a fren may just come and offer his help. To me personally, i believe, although frenZ whom u contact frequently or hang out always may not even be ur real fren, as they stand with u only at ur happy times.<br><br>To me, although there are some frenZ whom i dun meet often(i havent see them for a yr or more till recently), but i believe their personality, who will stand by when i request their help.<br><br>My apologises if my topic is not co-related with this thread, but from i see and what i want to say is fren is all around us and they maybe the best way to bring us out of any depression and personality disorder. We shld start giving first just like what laosu has said earlier. Offer our first handshake and let them know u existed.<br><br>Maybe my suggestion is try make frenZ with people in this thread, as u share the common goals and problems and definitely easier to click together.<br><br>Maybe true frenZ stay and celebrate the joys and sorrow together.<br><br></div>

In reality, it's a fact that I do love her and to a stage whereby I'm more than willing to forgive her for a mistake she had done and shows repentance (pardon my spelling if I'm wrong). You call that running away from reality? Sir, I'm a human too and I make mistakes too and when I did, I sure do hope that the person will forgive me. So why can't I forgive her? I gave her my trust in hoping that she won't betrayed it but in the end she still did for the second time and since she claims that she don't love me, there isn't much I can do about it right? If I ever am running away from reality, then I probably won't be in another relationship now knowing that it'll open me from yet another injury. But think about it, my current gf never did anything wrong to me so why should I carry my hurt from the past and inflict it on her? It's not fair to either of us. </span></strong><br><br>You inflicted much more pain on yourself than anyone else did on you. FACT.<br><br><strong><span style="color: darkred;">Laosu: Oh yah, I do admit that I inflict more pain on myself more than anyone else did but that's because I don't want to hurt anyone. It's just not me to do that. At least that's the difference between what I am now and what I am then. When I'm younger, I admit that in order for me not to feel hurt anymore, I don't go near anyone. That way no one can hurt me. But now I gave everyone elses and myself a chance for a new friendship. So is that running away? If I'm really running away, I probably won't even be coming to this forum and post my past stories. I share my stories with anyone in hope to give them new hopes in life which I've found and still practicing it. At least I've done it and still doing it. You just need the faith and constant reminders that things can be better still.

Why use my past to condemn me now when it's already over for me? I've got plenty of friends who turn to me for a listening ear and seeks opinions from me now. I've got friends who I call them buddies and I've got friends who let go of their pride and cry in front of me. I've got friends who goes bowling with me and fight side by side with me to win the league. I've got friends who stretches out their hands for me to hold on to when I fall. I have a gf who loves me and she's also a soulmate even before we are together. So is that same as what I am before? Is that a sign of running away? No. I'm a blessed person and I have everything in the world. I wanna share that with everyone. I'm a sign myself, a sign of new hopes. But be reminded again, I'm still human and I'm still bound by emotions.

This is the last time I hijack the post.<br><br><strong>PS: Paiseh Devil, despite your warnings I cannot resist. This will be my last post here.<br><br>Laosu, if you want to continue debating, start another thread or PM me.</strong><br>[/b]</blockquote></div>

No two humans are identical.<br><br>Actually I could have ignored what curiousorange said but I supposed that I have the obligation to defend my own efforts all these years to be a better person and like what you say, to appreciate the finer things in life instead of just looking at things from the ugly angle.<br><br>Sometimes I do still inflict pain on myself but that's to trying to understand the pain that others are going through. Again, I'm not trying to sound great here. But who am I to give opinions or advises to others if I have 0% understandings of their pain?
