            <div class='col-md body'>Dear laosu<br><br>I feel so sad upon reading your story.. and I really wish to curse your stupid maths teacher for passing such a stupid and harsh comment. Instead of encouraging you, instead of believing and helping you, say something like that. I hate this kind of teacher, but they still exist in this world.. If i am parent and my child tell me that, I will complain to the school, write to forum, complain to moe..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyway, sometimes I also isolate myself and switch off handphone.. but 2 weeks being a bit too long..<br><br>I also have been to depression around late teenage. During secondary school first 2 years i also don't have friends, then till later 2 years manage to find friends, but I realised also those I found are not true friends. I have to be hurt again and again by their wierd and hot temper. But because of this, my tolerance level for people are better than others. Now when people do bad things to me, I get hurt and angry and cursed, but when I calm down after a few hours, I will remember of the good things they do, say to others, altho not me, but I appreciate the efforts they made for others, so I think afterall they may not be that bad ! It is wierd.. haha<br><br>Depression can be cure and so does all types of personalities disorder. It is better to discover it early and do something. Had it not been for depression, and low self esteem I may not have to repeat year during poly and how i try also never really do well in school. I cannot tell u how it happen, but it is a very sick case of low self esteem. I cannot even leave my house, i need a few hours to prepare myself. And to make things worst, it worsen when a classmate pass a very evil remark and depression goes on for a few years, after that simple remark, maybe it was more than once.. hurt a pretty more times.. haha.. now i no longer hate that person because the scar have healed. Time really heals the heart..but sometimes, is not days or months, for this thing, it took me entirely 4-5 years.. but initial symptoms happened when i was in childhood and to primary school and to secondary school. Because i was not aware this is not normal and thus no action taken and thus when discovered, it can come as a big setback..<br><br>Actually, life can be good. Now, i although hold a job i don like and stress me alot, but i appreciate it is still a job and give me an income and money to slowly save money for my dream. So to me, i really try to focus on the good points in those tricky situations. Now i may not have many friends, but i have a true and good friend. I really enjoy meeting nice people and being helpful to people. When i meet bad people.. i really wish they will die faster.. haha.. but come to think of it, should i really be angry over them? damage my health and make more wrinkles on my face? I don't bother about them ! At least i know, there are truely good people in this world, so life is still good, at least there are good people to neutralise the evil people...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I hope to all those troubled by personalities disorder or depression to be able to overcome the crisis and continue to improve their life.. I understand how u all feel because i also have a similar life. I would encourage people with problems to take multi vitamins, like B and etc... I take them frequently.. I believe that vitamins can help to improve the feelings of depression. It can help abit, but you must also try to think positive, and slowly slowly look at the world with different angles.. and I believe with determination, life slowly improves.. Seeing a psychiatrist or counsellor or telling a really good friend helps to lighten the burdens. ultimately it takes time to feel better and free from it..<br><br>Believe and it will happen. Don't believe and it won't happen !<br><br>Hugs,<br>hamster<br><br></div>

Don't believe and it won't happen !<br><br>Hugs,<br>hamster<br><br></div></blockquote>Nah...dun curse her. In fact I should thanks her instead. If not for her harsh words, I probably would have ended my studies when I'm in Sec 3 and never even complete my N Levels. I do admit that I really do hate her during my first half of my sec 3 when she starts teaching me but when I got my first ever A1 for my mid year exams, I really feel gratitude towards her.<br><br>I can't remember her full name but I do remember her as Ms Chong and she continue to be my maths teacher for the next two years till O Levels. It was her who reminds me that in life, nothing is impossible if you make an effort and believe in yourself. Although she's a bit bitchy, she's really a very good teacher who won't hestitate to teach you till you know how to do it.<br><br>Now to think back, I actually am quite lucky to have a few really good teachers around to help me pull through my secondary school life and they really taught me a lot more than the books can teach. Full salute to them!!</div>

Instead of encouraging you, instead of believing and helping you, say something like that. I hate this kind of teacher, but they still exist in this world.. If i am parent and my child tell me that, I will complain to the school, write to forum, complain to moe..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyway, sometimes I also isolate myself and switch off handphone.. but 2 weeks being a bit too long..<br><br><span style="color: red;">Haha...I isolate myself for two years. Come to think of it, it's actually a big experience but I don't think I can do that now. </span><br><br>I also have been to depression around late teenage. During secondary school first 2 years i also don't have friends, then till later 2 years manage to find friends, but I realised also those I found are not true friends. I have to be hurt again and again by their wierd and hot temper. But because of this, my tolerance level for people are better than others. Now when people do bad things to me, I get hurt and angry and cursed, but when I calm down after a few hours, I will remember of the good things they do, say to others, altho not me, but I appreciate the efforts they made for others, so I think afterall they may not be that bad ! It is wierd.. haha<br><br><span style="color: red;">Believe it or not, I find it hard to hate anyone now. Angry yes but not hate and even anger is just for a short moment (ok..blame it on my short temper but I cool down fast). </span><br><br>Depression can be cure and so does all types of personalities disorder. It is better to discover it early and do something. Had it not been for depression, and low self esteem I may not have to repeat year during poly and how i try also never really do well in school. I cannot tell u how it happen, but it is a very sick case of low self esteem. I cannot even leave my house, i need a few hours to prepare myself. And to make things worst, it worsen when a classmate pass a very evil remark and depression goes on for a few years, after that simple remark, maybe it was more than once.. hurt a pretty more times.. haha.. now i no longer hate that person because the scar have healed. Time really heals the heart..but sometimes, is not days or months, for this thing, it took me entirely 4-5 years.. but initial symptoms happened when i was in childhood and to primary school and to secondary school. Because i was not aware this is not normal and thus no action taken and thus when discovered, it can come as a big setback..<br><br><span style="color: red;">Sad to say, usually people don't realised that they are under depression. Only the people around there will sense the changes. Low self esteem is something we build up inside us as times goes by. I used to have very low self esteem but at the same time I have extremely high pride which kinda compensate for my LSE. We got to learn to believe in ourselves. You need to strike a balance in everything you do in life. Easier to say then done and I'm still constantly practicing it.<br><br>What I experience in my Sec sch life is just one of the setbacks I've been through and there's several other more and trust me, it's almost enough to kill me then. But I'm glad I've survived.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></span><br><br>Actually, life can be good. Now, i although hold a job i don like and stress me alot, but i appreciate it is still a job and give me an income and money to slowly save money for my dream. So to me, i really try to focus on the good points in those tricky situations. Now i may not have many friends, but i have a true and good friend. I really enjoy meeting nice people and being helpful to people. When i meet bad people.. i really wish they will die faster.. haha.. but come to think of it, should i really be angry over them? damage my health and make more wrinkles on my face? I don't bother about them ! At least i know, there are truely good people in this world, so life is still good, at least there are good people to neutralise the evil people...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>I hope to all those troubled by personalities disorder or depression to be able to overcome the crisis and continue to improve their life.. I understand how u all feel because i also have a similar life. I would encourage people with problems to take multi vitamins, like B and etc... I take them frequently.. I believe that vitamins can help to improve the feelings of depression. It can help abit, but you must also try to think positive, and slowly slowly look at the world with different angles.. and I believe with determination, life slowly improves.. Seeing a psychiatrist or counsellor or telling a really good friend helps to lighten the burdens. ultimately it takes time to feel better and free from it..<br><br><span style="color: red;">I'm not god and neither am I a saint but if my past experience and my survival story can become a motivation for those experiencing similar situations, I'm more than willing to share but honestly, for one to survive the ordeal, that person has to believe in themselves and wanted to get out of the mess.</span><br><br>Believe and it will happen. Don't believe and it won't happen !<br><br><span style="color: red;">TOTALLY AGREE!!!</span><br><br>Hugs,<br>hamster<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

I keep to myself and the doctor will always encourage me to speak up, but if I insist they leave me alone.<br><br>on the 5th day, a friend brough me a book name : "Traveling Light" by the author Max Lucado. the next day I started to eat small meal.<br><br>10 days later, I am out of IMH.<br>I went back twice as out-patient. But I don't think the doctor there help me much as most of the time they listen to you, give you a few word of encouragement and there is no close relationship. well I shouldn't expect much from them.<br><br>6 month later - today, I still work as usual, but other then that I resemble a hermit crap. Read book, watch TV, watch movie on my own, jogging... mostly leisure activities which can be done along. I have no problem with others - only in my job as i am in sales. but personal life, I just keep to myself.<br><br>Conclusion -- end of the drama, I realised who I am (how many of you know yourself?) I admit to myself that I am who I am, I am not a superman, I am not a hero, I am not a new age sensivtive guy. I can ony do this much and I will do this much. and I understand that I can never live up to others expectation or actually I don't have to live up to others expectation. I do my best and I feel great if I did it, I will fell sad if I failed. But I never think it is anthing shame to fail. Failure and rejection is just part of life, just like sunrise and sunset.<br><br>You will know who you are when you are not bothered with how others judge you or profile you.<br><br>Once again, since we are all here in this forum, that is something worth to celerbrate. cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>
