But if you continue dwell on this malcontent of yours, you might jolly well be on track to becoming one pretty soon.<br><br>Be thankful for what you have at the moment. Since when is the last time you stopped doing what you are doing at the moment and be THANKFUL for what you have right now?<br><br>For all you know, your mum worked hard for you and your sister. She could really have done worse you know? And whatever military past, ex-gals, current wife suspected affairs that you're trying to get a gripe on...they all could have turned out a lot worse than what you had experienced. &lt;- Did that ever occurred to you before?<br><br>From what I've read, you're having a good life at the moment. So brush out those negative thoughts and purged the past from your thoughts. Remember, they are past and in past tenses. So nothing that you're going to do now is going to get them back to the way which they should be in the first place. I probably forgotten to tell you that you're actually supposed to learn something from those situations when it happens. But it seems that you certainly took the easy way out of those situations, and now you're complaining of sufferings because of something which you happened to recall?<br><br>You must realise that at this point onwards, you should not look back at what should've happened and what should've been done. It's already been so long, so just let them be a sad memories to you and look forward to create happier memories with your wife and family from now on. The key is to Let Go.<br><br>Do think for once that there are plenty more unfortunate people out there who doesn't have the luxuries of painful recollections. I'm sure everyone out there is carrying a pain of their own and moving on with their everyday lives. And it's fair to say that everyone has their own tolerance of the amount of pain which they can withstand, and nobody carries the equal amount of pain with them. Some just deal with their own pains in their own way or simply grind through life together with their pain for the sake of their loved ones and people who loved them.<br><br>It's true that society plays a major part of our working lives and thanks to those living bastards out there for distributing their pain onto others. But at the end of the everyday, we have a choice of choosing either happiness or sadness. So I implored you to think positively...think positively on your current strengths, wealth, domestic securities, and future plans. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Be grateful to people who are nice to you and do not seek out revenge on your enemies unless they happened to cross your path again. If they are so unfortunate to cross path with you again, be sure to bring them pain to them without mercy as mercy is for saints.<br><br>Be positive and thankful to your life and I'm sure that you'll do more than just fine. Seek happiness and happiness will come your way, seek anger and all you'll get is sadness and miseries.<br><br>So, good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
