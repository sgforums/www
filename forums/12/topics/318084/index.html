              <p>My wife to be and me are planning to get married. Rom this year and chinese wedding in 09. Both of us are fresh grads and don't really have much savings. Before I carry on further, my wife to be is someone who wants everything to be perfect and of high quality.</p>
              <p>Few weeks ago, we went to look at some rings because I insist on buying her a solitaire as proposal ring because its a once in a lifetime thing and I want her to have it.  We walked around and she saw the Destinee daimonds. True enough, Destinee diamonds are nice, but the price is even nicer. My friend recommended me a shop in orchard which also sells quality diamonds but at half the price... when I told her that I am considering buying from that shop, I can see the disappointment in her eyes. After I communicated with her and promised that I'll choose her a nice diamond, she slowly recovers and things got back to normal.</p>
              <p>Today, she was flipping style wedding magazine and she saw this nice ROM, poolside or garden package from Sheraton Singapore. Sweat broke out as I was thinking if my savings (not alot), after paying for bridal package and buying the solitaire and wedding bands can handle that. She did mention that she has some savings as well and <br>she can pay for somethings too. I told her that maybe ROM at that place will not be such a good idea as we can always have our ROM and fort canning or a restaurant and invite the JP over. I again see that disappointment in her eyes. I know that she wants everything to be dreamy and princessy but from my point of view, I thought I would rather save the fancy stuff and put the money to better use since we, or rather I am running on a tight budget. I still have the flat and chinese wedding to handle in the near future.</p>
              <p>Suddenly I am feeling the strain from wedding plans. I have never bothered about how much I had in my bank until now. I do not want to disappoint my wife to be but at the same time, I want to remain sensible work within out budget... How....</p>

              <p>haha I am preparing for my ROM and banquet too, so maybe I can share some insights here ;)</p>
              <p>yes, it is true that most girls see this event as a once in a lifetime occasion and don't mind splurging on it. But must also set aside a budget and try not to go against the budget. What I can suggest is bring her to look at a few ROM venues, especially those not so expensive ones and hope she might find one that she likes.</p>
              <p>Remember that you can't give in to her every whims and dreams. She needs to realize that this is not a fairytale wedding, unless both of you come from an uber rich family who can help to contribute to the expenses. Otherwise, be happy to settle for a simpler event.</p>
              <p>From the way I see it, what's the point of stressing so much for just one day? Yes, it is once in a lifetime, but it is just one day. Don't pressure yourself too much just because you don't want to disappoint her. If she keeps having fairytale dreams inside her mind, she is going to have her bubbles burst one day anyway...</p>

              <p>Haha, she knows we are not rich... and that eat grass part I already told her when she was tempted by that destinee.</p>
              <p><br>I guess its just her, she hopes all to be perfect... so at each phase, she will give me a scare and its up to me to pull her back to reality and she will realise that and be disappointed again haha... well I guess she is still young thats why she has all that dreams and ideas in her mind... well, I guess its up to me to burst her bubbles again and again and again...</p>

              <p>Hmmm, perfect.. during wedding everyone and everything seems perfect. Next day you will start worry about the bread and butter. is the practical side of life.</p>
              <p>many couples are very happy during marriage, but years later when they separate, they will not think about thethick and thin they been through.</p>
              <p>Sorry i very pessimistic..</p>
