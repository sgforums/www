              <p>i always feel  that the "once in a lifetime" is just a marketing gimmick hyped up my commercial interest to boost their profit margins and revenue. what does "once in a lifetime" actually mean? isn't everyday also "once in a lifetime"? today is the 20 may 2008 and doesn't it also happen once in a lifetime? shall we then pop the champagne to celebrate?</p>
              <p>personally i think your "would be" wife is still living in a fairy tale and has not woken up to the real world yet. everyone should know that our resources are finite and limited. sure you can overstretch yourselves silly and get everything she wants. but as you may know, everyone wants everything but someone has to pay the price. in the end someone (that is most prob u) will pay the ultimate price and carry the financial burden for a long time. is this price worth it for a memory of a perfect wedding that happens "once in a lifetime"?</p>
              <p>from your post, you seem to be a sensible young guy. think like you are the head of the organisation (you are the head of the family after all) and decide on the best course of action.</p>

              <p>R/S is all abt managinge expectations. We all want the best but we can't have all of them at the same time. ( I would love to have the new S350 but I have digressed...)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1] List down all the big tickets items - wedding bands, proposal ring, dinner, ROM luncheon, ROM fee (?), suits and gowns, transport, etc...separately into a small pieces of papers.</p>
              <p>2] Fold them and put into a tin.</p>
              <p>3] Let her pick and arrange in chronological order.</p>
              <p>4] Show her your bank book and tell her you can only afford one at a time.</p>
              <p>5] Talk to her parents and tell them that they did a great job bring her up! (kidding)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The real trick is managing expectations. YOu can do everything but must lower standards. OR you can rob a 7/11 but make sure you dun get locked in!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A personal tip, I make sure that behind every 'hardship', there is a gem/jewel/treasure box waiting...write an IOU and share with her....I dunno what you do, but manage her expectations....THIS IS THE FIRST LESSON OF A LIFELONG MARRIAGE CONTRACT!!!</p>

              <p>R/S is all abt managinge expectations. We all want the best but we can't have all of them at the same time. ( I would love to have the new S350 but I have digressed...)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1] List down all the big tickets items - wedding bands, proposal ring, dinner, ROM luncheon, ROM fee (?), suits and gowns, transport, etc...separately into a small pieces of papers.</p>
              <p>2] Fold them and put into a tin.</p>
              <p>3] Let her pick and arrange in chronological order.</p>
              <p>4] Show her your bank book and tell her you can only afford one at a time.</p>
              <p>5] Talk to her parents and tell them that they did a great job bring her up! (kidding)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The real trick is managing expectations. YOu can do everything but must lower standards. OR you can rob a 7/11 but make sure you dun get locked in!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A personal tip, I make sure that behind every 'hardship', there is a gem/jewel/treasure box waiting...write an IOU and share with her....I dunno what you do, but manage her expectations....THIS IS THE FIRST LESSON OF A LIFELONG MARRIAGE CONTRACT!!!</p>

              <p>i always feel  that the "once in a lifetime" is just a
              marketing gimmick hyped up my commercial interest to boost their
              profit margins and revenue. what does "once in a lifetime" actually
              mean? isn't everyday also "once in a lifetime"? today is the 20 may
              2008 and doesn't it also happen once in a lifetime? shall we then
              pop the champagne to celebrate?</p>
              <p>personally i think your "would be" wife is still living in a
              fairy tale and has not woken up to the real world yet. everyone
              should know that our resources are finite and limited. sure you can
              overstretch yourselves silly and get everything she wants. but as
              you may know, everyone wants everything but someone has to pay the
              price. in the end someone (that is most prob u) will pay the
              ultimate price and carry the financial burden for a long time. is
              this price worth it for a memory of a perfect wedding that happens
              "once in a lifetime"?</p>
              <p>from your post, you seem to be a sensible young guy. think like
              you are the head of the organisation (you are the head of the
              family after all) and decide on the best course of action.</p>

              <p>But i agree in the once a lifetime and how some things are extremely overpriced. But then again..  we try not to get married more then once. Its best if only once. lol!</p>
