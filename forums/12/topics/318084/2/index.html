              <p>My wife to be and me are planning to get married. Rom this year and chinese wedding in 09. Both of us are fresh grads and don't really have much savings. Before I carry on further, my wife to be is someone who wants everything to be perfect and of high quality.</p>
              <p>Few weeks ago, we went to look at some rings because I insist on buying her a solitaire as proposal ring because its a once in a lifetime thing and I want her to have it.Â  We walked around and she saw the Destinee daimonds. True enough, Destinee diamonds are nice, but the price is even nicer. My friend recommended me a shop in orchard which also sells quality diamonds but at half the price... when I told her that I am considering buying from that shop, I can see the disappointment in her eyes. After I communicated with her and promised that I'll choose her a nice diamond, she slowly recovers and things got back to normal.</p>
              <p>Today, she was flipping style wedding magazine and she saw this nice ROM, poolside or garden package from Sheraton Singapore. Sweat broke out as I was thinking if my savings (not alot), after paying for bridal package and buying the solitaire and wedding bands can handle that. She did mention that she has some savings as well and<br>she can pay for somethings too. I told her that maybe ROM at that place will not be such a good idea as we can always have our ROM and fort canning or a restaurant and invite the JP over. I again see that disappointment in her eyes. I know that she wants everything to be dreamy and princessy but from my point of view, I thought I would rather save the fancy stuff and put the money to better use since we, or rather I am running on a tight budget. I still have the flat and chinese wedding to handle in the near future.</p>
              <p>Suddenly I am feeling the strain from wedding plans. I have never bothered about how much I had in my bank until now. I do not want to disappoint my wife to be but at the same time, I want to remain sensible work within out budget... How....</p>

              <p>haha thanks for all the inputs. The reason why we are getting married now is because we are both mentally ready for it. As for money in the future, I am not too worried. We have both secured well paid and stable jobs. In 3 years time, I'll be getting a lump sum from my fixed deposit, which i plan to save it for our baby funds.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>We'll be alright. We were talking just now and she herself brought up the topic... she asked for a simple ROM meal... which I am glad that she realised it after thinking through on her own.</p>

              <p>I have seen a few genuine cases where the person gets ruin by their wedding event.Â Â </p>
              <p>1) Wanted a perfect/nice/grand wedding. So finds ways and means to get the ideal wedding...needless to say it cost $$$. All credit cards was used. The wedding went through nice.Â </p>
              <p>And she is now in debts of $35,000/- from all the credit cards she used for the wedding...including interest whuch is snowing balling non-stop. Husband tied down by renovation loan. The ideal wedding...the road to bankruptcy...</p>
              <p>2) Wanted to be the most happiest woman in the world with the ultimate wedding. Ultimate wedding went though.Â End up in debts as no wayÂ the ang bao can recover the cost. BothÂ ends up quarreling asÂ accuses each otherÂ of not being to earn more. BothÂ working only to make ends meet to pay wedding event debts. Both ends up clubbing seperately to forget troubles...nowÂ divorced.</p>
              <p>3) Nice wedding, everything wife wants also can. After wedding, tells wife cannot tahan the expenses. Wife calls him useless and walks out on him. Divorced now.</p>
              <p>3)Â AlsoÂ a grand wedding to make meetÂ wife and her parents requirements. Now paying minimum payment for his credit cards...with outstanding $10,000/-++. Â </p>
              <p>Anymore you guys knows?</p>
