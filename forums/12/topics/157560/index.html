            <div class='col-md body'>since you asked for tips, i will not harp on the fact many have told you (have confidence in wadever you have), the following are rough guidelines.<br><br>1) keep yourself neat and tidy.<br>2) smell good<br>3) clean nails (dirt filled nails are a huge turnoff)<br>4) slightly gelled hair (too much gel is really... disgusting)<br>5) wear a smile most of the time (and dun look like an idiot in it.)<br>6) press your clothes (look civilised and not just-out-of-bed)<br>7) shave<br>8 )wear clothes that suit you. (for more tips, you will have to describe your build, skin tone etc)<br>9) get a nice hair cut. as a rule of thumb, short hair always looks decent, IMO<br>10) other assessories (they should go with your clothes and personality</div>
