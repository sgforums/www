              <p>1. what makes you think that you can escape from the authorities for a long 25 years before you get caught?</p>
              <p>Maybe you conduct a scam and 1 week later you get caught already leh?</p>
              <p>2. If you scam people of so much money, what makes you think that 1 day you will not get robbed or kidnapped and than when the kidnappers get your money they kill you?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I will choose to live the clear conscious life because those luxury days you're living from the scam, every day you're wondering if you will be caught, and that's not living... that's merely existing. Let me ask a simple question instead that everyone can relate to, suppose you have lots of work and your boss is chasing after you, and your wife insists you go on a holiday so you went... are you the type of person who during that vacation, will still worries about work because you know your boss is chasing after you, breathing down your neck? There are people who won't worry so they are perfect for the scam career, lol.</p></div>

              <p>Gracious me. Calling me an ignoramous when you are ignorant of your ownself.</p>
              <p>You ask if you are a racist and then ask us to hang out with our own kind? Hello!! How ridiculous are you to ask someone to hang out with their own kind. Due to my race and nationality I am not allowed to hang out with my Aussie and French mates at the local pub. Huh? Makes absolutely no sense. Sorry, I had travelled and I work with colleagues from across the globe - I play at the global scale, like it or not.</p>
              <p>Not Indiaforum? Presumptuous again or is this just an unintelligent, not well thought out, comeback? What makes you think I am from India. Whatever it is - unless Sgforum came up with a rule for no foreigners allowed to write comments here, I am still welcome here. Ha ha ha. After all, wouldn't it be nice to have foreigners coming in to offer intelligent words instead of having to hear what an Ah Beng had to type out here, ;)</p>
              <p>Oh btw, neither is this forum, called AhBengforum.</p>

              <p>You ask if you are a racist and then ask us to hang out with our
              own kind? Hello!! How ridiculous are you to ask someone to hang out
              with their own kind. Due to my race and nationality I am not
              allowed to hang out with my Aussie and French mates at the local
              pub. Huh? Makes absolutely no sense. Sorry, I had travelled and I
              work with colleagues from across the globe - I play at the global
              scale, like it or not.</p>
              <p>Not Indiaforum? Presumptuous again or is this just an
              unintelligent, not well thought out, comeback? What makes you think
              I am from India. Whatever it is - unless Sgforum came up with a
              rule for no foreigners allowed to write comments here, I am still
              welcome here. Ha ha ha. After all, wouldn't it be nice to have

              <p>Yawn.......I have no idea what you are talking about dude. Like seriously.......do you just keep going blah blah blah blah just to win a debate? I am pretty sure you were never picked to debate in school and neither must you be a lawyer, let alone a professional of any skill. But very likely you will state here you are of someone of importance in status in Singapore simply cause most like yourself would do so to get away with other refutations.</p>
              <p>Your arguments are groundless, and over the last number of posts you just seem to be making judgements and insinuations based simply on something you imagined.</p>
              <p>Well one way of looking at someone who travels and works on a global scale is either he is a refugee or he is wanted to in other places for his skills. Seems like you had never been picked upon and selected by anyone overseas for travel plans, ha ha. Are you 'red' over not being selected?</p>
              <p>Yeah I travel and I enjoy it. Btw, if you ask the average Singaporean what is her/his hobby - they would say travelling. So they are refugees too?</p>
              <p>Yeah, I am not invited to the parties and I am ashamed of my race. Hmm you would know this because????? You woke up one day, imagine this guy doesn't get invited to parties and has no friends, he wished he was born of another race and just decided to make a statement, simply because you imagined it?</p>
              <p>I guess whatever you imagine of this world makes it true?</p>
              <p>Btw, I had never battered on anyone's race, let alone my own. And being color blind, I never exactly choose a race or nationality to hang out with. I just meet 'humans' and share a jug with em. So I hardly see the point nor purpose of arguing about race back and forth.</p>

              <p>A thread starting with scam ending in India vs China race qns.</p>
              <p>@jojo: AFAIK Indians are the only people with history who hasn't conquered, fought, killed, or had a genocide for the last 10,000 years unlike Chinese history full of these. I have not found any one aggressive or dangerous also turns out to be the most helpful kind IMHO.</p>
              <p>Come to China, forget the pollution and govt. killing, the trickeries played on each other, cheatings and exploitation of each other by the classes of society they were quite touching even for a foreigner. No wonder all the educated intelligent chinese I know wants to get away from that country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just because the guy who knocked you up married you and transferred you to US does not give the right to make fun/look down or be a racist. That's it I have spoken and no more to you.</p>

              <p><br>Lol...........yeah we should............anyways, let's forget the above and get back to the question and purpose of the initial post. This isn't a post about US vs China vs India vs Singapore nor a post about Mexicans vs Africans vs Indians, etc.</p>
              <p>PS: I am not planning on any scams, mind you. It was supposed to be a riddle type of question of the trade off between freedom and luxuries.</p>
              <p>Have fun yoh. Anyone has tissues to wipe my tears.........slowly hating my life and birth race after the revelations of the above posts..............:)</p>

              <p>Well well well, what do we have here?</p>
              <p>A thread starting with scam ending in India vs China race
                      qns.</p>
              <p>@jojo: AFAIK Indians are the only people with history who hasn't
                      conquered, fought, killed, or had a genocide for the last 10,000
                      years unlike Chinese history full of these. I have not found any
                      one aggressive or dangerous also turns out to be the most helpful
                      kind IMHO.</p>
              <p>Come to China, forget the pollution and govt. killing, the
                      trickeries played on each other, cheatings and exploitation of each
                      other by the classes of society they were quite touching even for a
                      foreigner. No wonder all the educated intelligent chinese I know
                      wants to get away from that country.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just because the guy who knocked you up married you and
                      transferred you to US does not give the right to make fun/look down
                      or be a racist. That's it I have spoken and no more to you.</p>

              <p>The same problems you see in China is worst in India.</p>
              <p>At least in China, there's only the rich poor divide. In India, there's still the caste system AND rich poor divide.</p>

              <p>We are back at this again? Oh well..............looking forward to more 'the world doesn't love me' remarks.</p>
              <p>Hey Bio-Hawk, let me summarize it for you, on behalf of JoJo on his/her incoming comments - your race is hated and the future generations of your race will be ridiculed, disrespected and segregated due to the misdeeds of your ancestors, you do not get invited to parties and no one loves you (suppose your parents and friends as well - correct me if I am wrong here JoJo), you shouldn't be in this forum, and you are embarassed by your birth and disassociate from your own kind.</p>
              <p>Hmm.........to sum it all up - you hate yourself and everyone hates you.</p>
              <p>Did I get that right thus far?</p>
              <p>Let's move on from here?</p>
