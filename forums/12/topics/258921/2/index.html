            <div class='col-md body'>No generalisation here, thank you... You may have to eat your word if you continue being adamant gals are "insertword" here.<br><br>Use "A number of gals I met" instead. More diplomatic.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Besides, you are still very young. Sure you may argue that being attached or being in love can really give you the morale boosting and stats boost. BUT imagine losing them or being out of love. You get morale debuffed and stats reduction! Its all a matter of relativity!<br><br>Build up on your character and personality, as well as your studies. The last thing a gal of your age wants is a 'wuss'. Be a man... YOUNG man. Be independant. Be tough. (Not those itching for fight dat tough but more of tough when exams come or when going for camp or when got BIG decisions to make in life...) Be yourself while you are learning more.<br><br>BTW, congrats on your puberty sprouting. You are now entering a phase where your hormones are super raging and very rebelious.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Ah... how I missed the juvenile days~  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
