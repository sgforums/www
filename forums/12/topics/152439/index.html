            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Here the story goes:<br><br>This parasite has not been working regularly for past 3 years.  She could not stay long for each temp job, and complains about her boss or colleagues.  She has 2 old parents to care for but she prefer for her parents to feed her.  At age 31, she is still without a lifelong partner.  Despite times of her sister's calls to find job for her, she rejects the jobs and never takes the innitiatives to call.  What does she have?  She has A levels, brains, hands and legs BUT she GOT NO discipline.  She will not work even if the job is a clerk because it is too lowly for her.  She would rather her sister fork out monthly sums to her parents and pay everything for the family bills.  Her father also have to buy lunch for her before she wakes up.  She eats free meals without feeling shy.  And one day, she got a cheek to ask for a gold supp card from her sis (just to show off).  BUT SHE IS JOBLESS.<br><br>Another time, she blew her internet phone bills at $600 and her father yelled at her.  And so she managed to settle herself.  How did she do it? She must have borrowed!  She lost her IC once and took more than half a year to finally go and personally replace it at the immigration.  When her mum needs money, the mother will go to her sister instead of her.  Now she is looking for jobs BUT only jobs SHE LIKES.  She is spending money on cheap sales but one wonder how the hell she got the money.  Shoes, bags and clothings are her favorite.  How did her friends fare?  All have jobs and most of them married.<br>Her sister has tried to push her to find any job and be less picky because she was then preggo with no.2.  She would be very unhappy and argued with her sister.  She would challenge her sis that her sister got so work up and threw things at her.<br><br>Her Hobbies?  Oh she love to meet up drink coffee, go out at night, sleep at 5am, wakes up for lunch to be served, then go back to sleep or so.  Phone call rings, then go out again.  sometimes she stays at home doing nothing EXCEPT chat online or play games.  Laundry? Her mum does it for her when she is back at home (her mum stays with her sis on certain days to take care of 2 babies).  The washing machine breaks down and she does nothing to arrange to fix it.  Windows rivets need to be changed but she waited this month for her mum to act on it.  Oh yeah, she smokes too, despite being jobless, how did she get the money to buy cigarettes?<br><br>And she has no responsibility using her computer.  Its the 3rd computer her sis gave her and each time it is down with virus and problems.<br><br>I am her sister.  Tell me, what should I do?? I have a family myself.  I have 2 young kids and I have been paying for my parents housing and family bills for past 10 years.  But I have stop working since I have my first kid.  I have no savings at all!!!  Tell me.  This parasite still needs my dad and mum to take care of her, instead of the other way round.  My mum's health is failing too because of old age.  Dad is working parttime in a factory to earn some cash.  Why doesn;t she feel shameful???  Why doesn't she feels bad that her father have to work at his age??  I don't know how long she is going to lead this life this way.  I have had enough.  I feel she should share a load of this burden off me.  She doesn't even bother to bring my mum for checkups.  Sometimes I wish I am better off dead.  So that she will seriously start to work and support herself and family.<br><br>She is so impractical and unrealistic.  She wanted to go for short trips but could not afford to.  I don't know why she still does not realise the urgency of our family to need someone to work to help bring in the income for the expenses.  How???? Can someone tell me????????<br><br>Sometimes, I feel like going out to work and earn more money.  But thats not going to solve the problem.  Earn more money, so she will feel its alright, its ok, bills will always be paid for.<br>And yes, I wonder how she pays for her broadband fee of $58 mthly and handphone bills.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The computers are used by me and my husband over the years and gave it to her because she says she needs it to look for job, and print resumes.  Recently, she did it again to spoil her 2nd used computer and has been pestering her cousin to help her fix it or buy new one.  The 3rd used computer was given to her, her last chance to use it properly.  Computers were given to her to save money.  Appprarently, many times I visit my mum's place, I will find out that she uses the computer for chatting and onling gaming purposes, contrary to what she should be using for.  I have decided to give her an ultimatum that if she does not find a job in a month.  I will sell the computer and at least the money can pay for many other family expenses.  I am just so stressed out.  I was earning a considerable 4 figure pay when I was younger and she thought I will be there to hold the sky if it falls.  Because of this problem, I had post natal depression after my 2nd baby.  Was very grunchy, scolded anyone for the most trivial matter and very paranoid easily.  I almost go hysterical each time when mum explains how we should understand this parasite could not find job and give her some time.</div>

She is HAOCHI LANZUO, she thinks she is right all the time, she upholds her own "principles" and has attitude problem.  She would argue at the slightest remark and always insist she is right.  I even thought about getting a social worker or councilor to talk to her, but where to get help?  and who would help such parasite who is physically capable?<br><br>Now me and my mum are at loggerheads.

            <div class='col-md body'>My dear, in life, people always react to two ways, that is the way THEY WANT, and the way THEY NEED.. Your sister WANTS to spend like a taitai, wants to buy stuffs in sales, want to have a carefree life with no form of responsibities or obligation to herself, her parents, you, let alone society. She wants money, things to be always so easy and readymade, but the reason for her being this way, is cos there is NO NEED on her part. You and all the rest have been spoonfeeding her all these years and fulfilling every single aspect of her needs, regardless of how unnecessary or extravagant those may be. Given a choice between opening her mouth and asking for favours, and working her socks off, of course she would choose the former. You have to understand, that not everybody is born with a sensiblity that its the duty of the children to provide for their parents, as singaporeans to do their part for society and the less fortunate. Your sister is not being realistic. She's living in her own world, where she gets things done her way, and always procrastinating cos there's no goals in her life, no ideals, no direction. Have you ever had a talk with her, and ask her what she exactly wants to do with her life? Does she want a specific career? Talk to your parents, and tell them that she is on her path to ruins if she doesnt change herself for the better, cos they wouldnt be around forever to take care of her. Lastly, i think you're a fantastic sister, and you certainly have done your part as a sibling. We all admire and respect you for your efforts, dedication and responsility, so please do without those guilt. Its certainly no fault of yours that she turn out this way. Most importantly, you have to remember that your PRIORITIES lies with your IMMEDIATE FAMIILY, and please, do some savings on your own, cos when the time comes for your kids to pursue their education, your retirement, medical expenses, you know jolly well that you have only yourself and your husband for support, cos that worthless sister of yours cannot be rely upon. Take care and God Bless !<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for your advice.  I think we have given her way too much.  Taking all away immediately means we are seriously.  And I'm shock that there are suggestions she is possibility a freelance pro.  But I can't believe and imagine she will stoop to so low!!!!  No, I don't think so, I had checked some of her chat logs, she had been borrowing money.  Well, she rather borrow to survive than work.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Saint`:</div><div class="quote_body">31 yrs old n still behaving like some one who is still in early teens ?? pls wake her up from the slumber ... y don u start by asking ur parents nt to get her food every lunch .. n slowly let her learn the word RESPONSIBILITY .. teach her through the basic ... no $ = no food .. tats simple .. she doesnt wan to get her own food .. then so be it .. slowly withdraw the strings ur family n u had given her these years .. seriously .. if all of a sudden u take everything away from her .. i dunno hw drastic it might b ... better to take a step at a time ..<br><br>as for the moving hse suggestion .. mayb it is a good idea .. let her take care of the bills herself n see hw it works .. as for hw she managed to support some bills herself .. i think free lancing as pro could be possible .. y not check her chat logs ( i koe this is invading one's privacy ) to find out wth she had been doing all these years ..<br><br>lastly .. i believed u had done all u could as a elder sis .. it is up to her to realised what is good n bad for her .. </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>She was a writer, she only wants to work in media related industry, and never want to work such as a Borders sales assistant.  Without jobs for a long time now.  She stll refuses to get lower paid jobs, after several unsuccessful interviews with her dream jobs.  We could not discuss this problem calmly.  Each time I try to talk to her, she will become defensive, and flare up.  Her dream? What dream career at age 31??  I am 33.  I have already enjoyed my top career days.  People who have been working for many years and at my age usually move on to bettter position at this time or quit to do own business or become homemakers.  It dosen't look good on her resume too-long absence of employment history takes her chances away from the potential job.  Yes, I may sue her for not being responsible and not supporting my parents.  I'll have to find out how to do that.  Thks for your message.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Chief_SittingBull:</div><div class="quote_body">My dear, in life, people always react to two ways, that is the way THEY WANT, and the way THEY NEED.. Your sister WANTS to spend like a taitai, wants to buy stuffs in sales, want to have a carefree life with no form of responsibities or obligation to herself, her parents, you, let alone society. She wants money, things to be always so easy and readymade, but the reason for her being this way, is cos there is NO NEED on her part. You and all the rest have been spoonfeeding her all these years and fulfilling every single aspect of her needs, regardless of how unnecessary or extravagant those may be. Given a choice between opening her mouth and asking for favours, and working her socks off, of course she would choose the former. You have to understand, that not everybody is born with a sensiblity that its the duty of the children to provide for their parents, as singaporeans to do their part for society and the less fortunate. Your sister is not being realistic. She's living in her own world, where she gets things done her way, and always procrastinating cos there's no goals in her life, no ideals, no direction. Have you ever had a talk with her, and ask her what she exactly wants to do with her life? Does she want a specific career? Talk to your parents, and tell them that she is on her path to ruins if she doesnt change herself for the better, cos they wouldnt be around forever to take care of her. Lastly, i think you're a fantastic sister, and you certainly have done your part as a sibling. We all admire and respect you for your efforts, dedication and responsility, so please do without those guilt. Its certainly no fault of yours that she turn out this way. Most importantly, you have to remember that your PRIORITIES lies with your IMMEDIATE FAMIILY, and please, do some savings on your own, cos when the time comes for your kids to pursue their education, your retirement, medical expenses, you know jolly well that you have only yourself and your husband for support, cos that worthless sister of yours cannot be rely upon. Take care and God Bless !<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Cut all ties n connection. Its because you all are still being NICE and UNDERSTANDING. Time to stop. Be prepared for the worst. She has become a liability that you cannot afford too. Publicly denouce her as your sister and as your parents daughter. My friends parents did that to thier no good daughter. Now she has to fend for herself and know the hardships of life.. THE HARD WAY. There can be no sympathy for people like this. Even if its your own flesh and blood. They are like CANCER.. if you dont cut it out.. it will spread. N u will all fall.. thanks to her.,</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi<br><br>I am touched to know you are really a very good sister. I believe you have already done all you can to help your little parasite sis..<br><br>She is acting very poorly and childish. Who did she go out with? MAybe you can check that out. I am quite surprised she can always find someone to go out with everyday at this age, because I assumed someone that age already busy with family and career.<br><br>Do you know why she stopped schooling at A level? That is why she can't find a proper job with that. And having said that, perhaps, in her heart, she feel inferior that her sister you is so much well better than her, with her inferiority complex, she stopped motivating herself, and thus decided to start "parasiting" on her family.<br><br>I still agreee with the other people who mentioned to be cruel to her. I think it is the only way to let her learn. But also, make sure she doesn't do anything illegal when you all cut off connections so she find a proper job..that is the only thing I am worried because no one knows what her "outside friends" are..<br><br>I think she seriously need some counselling to get her life back properly. I believe there is something hindering her in her heart that she doesn't say.. or else maybe it is because she takes life too much for granted.<br><br>What is her interests? What else does she find joys doing beside smoking and shopping? Does she care for others?? Is there any way to help her find a job that she is interested in? so that way she can keep the job long. Or else maybe let your parents stay with you for awhile, sell the flat to overcome the financial turmoil and let your parasite sis know temporily what is going to happen. Let her know she don't have a choice now, and except find a job and work. When you don provide money to her, I guess she got no choice and will work already. Humans act only under forced situation whereby they got simply no choice.<br><br>I hope your sis  very soon will realise her mistake and start living again! Good Luck !  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi mumof2,<br><br>I have a suggestion. Please bring ur sis to a psychiatrist. She might have negative schizophrenia. This is a condition where someone loses motivation, is withdrawn, loses schedules/ structures, etc. I think it's quite possible ur sis might be suffering this illness. Especially all ur descriptions, how she stayed up until 5am, seldom able to hold work, etc.<br><br>I disagree with the suggestion to make her move out, cut support, etc like that. Becoz I think it's not productive. If u cut support, she might not be able to stand on her 2 own feet. Just get her checked first. If she's indeed having this illness, cutting support is not gonna work coz she's not like other normal people who can stand on 2 own feet when forced.<br><br>As a sister I think u are having a big pressure but ultimately u still love ur sis and please just get her checked first instead of cutting support or anything like that, coz I think it will ruin ur family ties for the future. Ultimately u want to save ur sis and ur family and I think u should think of the best solution and be wise.<br><br>Ur sis will never agree to go to hospital on her own accord. You have to think of a creative way, or persuade her somehow. Then, accompany her there, u and ur mum. You and ur mum should talk to the psychiatrist as well.<br><br>If neccessary, ask for a test, a written test. That will be more accurate. But the psychiatrist might be able to tell without any tests. And then, ur sis will take medication for at least 1 year. But believe me, ur sis will change. From then on she will really do change.<br><br>I think this is one way u can really save her and get her back as ur sis, and save ur family/ parents, urself, without ruining family ties for the future.<br><br>Trust me.<br><br>Just get her checked first. Ok?</div>
