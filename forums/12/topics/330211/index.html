              <p>For example, we're supposed to do this CAD drawing and assembly.

              <p>Been in your shoes be4. Had to do almost all of the 3 man job for the entire semester. It really sucks with all the tight schedules and other projects. However, why not  try letting the matter pass? Take it as a revision. I'm sure doing most of the project sure makes u understand the subject more. Teaching ur 'partner' is another issue. Personally, I won't mind teaching if he's willing to learn since it serves as another revision for myself. On the other hand, I won't bother to waste my breathe if he's just there for the marks. The lecturer will definitely know who puts in more effort in the project. Even if he gets good grades because of your efforts, take it as if you are doing a good deed as a human being. There are enough worries in life so stay cheerful man, that's the most important thing.</p>

              <p>Been in your shoes be4. Had to do almost all of the 3 man job
              for the entire semester. It really sucks with all the tight
              schedules and other projects. However, why not  try letting
              the matter pass? Take it as a revision. I'm sure doing most of the
              project sure makes u understand the subject more. Teaching ur
              'partner' is another issue. Personally, I won't mind teaching if
              he's willing to learn since it serves as another revision for
              myself. On the other hand, I won't bother to waste my breathe if
              he's just there for the marks. The lecturer will definitely know
              who puts in more effort in the project. Even if he gets good grades
              because of your efforts, take it as if you are doing a good deed as
              a human being. There are enough worries in life so stay cheerful
              man, that's the most important thing.</p>

              <p>erm hey. seems to me that whatever that guy does, it will never seem to match up with your standard and you're afraid by using 'his work', the grades will drop. so you decide to take everything into your own hands <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>
              <p>i mean well at least he does make the effort to meet up with you if you ask him to right? not tt he disappeared and had fun while you're working your ass off. (you didn't mention all these facts so i'm just assuming over here) <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"> think twice before you backstab. was he really in the wrong for not doing anything? or was it you who didn't trust him.</p>
