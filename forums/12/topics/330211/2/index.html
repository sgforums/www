              <p><br>since the dateline is drawing so close, i suggest you should assign a task for him. it could be anything related to your work. if he still insist that he doesn't know and doesn't do and can't be bothered, than just tell him straight in the face you'll report to your lecturer that he didn't even contribute to the project.</p>

              <p>to backstab, or not to backstab? .... that's not the question.</p>
              <p> the real question is what knife to use?</p>
              <p>hunter's knife? rapier? icepick? chopsticks? forks?</p>
              <p>now, that's a tough question..... let me ponder for awhile more, before i reply again.</p>

              <p>he most likely will fail the rest of the exams and stuff. so not much difference if you backstab him.</p>
              <p>At least your grp mate looks genuinely inept. BAD, but could be worse.</p>
              <p>Actually, the worst people are those who have the ability to do the group project but fuck care all with excuses like busy with other work, etc and depend on others to help them do everything while taking all credit THEN will mug for the exams.</p>

              <p>I don't consider this as backstabbing. Backstabbing is more like he contributed to the project, but you negated those contributions and said he did nothing. IMO, if he flunk this project as a result of you telling the lecturer, it is the mark he deserves entirely.</p>
              <p>However, talking about compassion, I would then evaluate to what extent did he try to put in effort.</p>
              <p>For eg,</p>
              <p>• If his failure to help stems from his <strong>inherent lack of knowledge</strong>, and you feel <strong>genuine</strong> sense of guilt from him, I would choose to pity him instead and choose the nicer path. However, I will throw him some work to do regardless of what happens.</p>
              <p>• If his failure to help stems from laziness/slacking, then forget it. Just tell the lecturer and dont think about it, because you didnt do anything wrong anyway.</p>
              <p>Your method of "Just enough so he will tip the scale by
                                      himself in the final exam or somethin." is quite appropiate, IMO.</p>
              <p>Cheers. :)</p>
