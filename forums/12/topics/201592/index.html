            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone..<br>I am new here and would appreciate some advise and opinion..<br><br>Am going out with this guy for the last one and a half months. He treats me very well, we connect very well and enjoy each others company. Last 2 weeks, he brought me to meet his close friends and people he hang out with. Finally after so long from my last relationship I think that I may have met someone that I can click with, and may be possible to have a relationship with.<br><br>Last weekend, we made arrangements to meet up this weekend. During the whole of this week, we did not manage to meet up, I suppose we were both busy with work. But for this weekend's meeting last minute, he cancelled..This whole week/weekend, he feels very much more withdrawn. He usually texts me everyday, if we do not meet to ask me how I am doing and let me know where he is, but this weekend, silence, except for the sms to cancel..<br><br>It feels funny because for the last couple of weeks, we were seeing each other every weekend, and some weekdays as well. Hence this sudden absence is making me feel very uncomfortable.<br><br>Maybe its the female oversensitivity..do you think that he has suddenly lost interest in me? or has changed "target"? But he does not seem like that sort that will change target, he seems very sincere and decent..for the last one and a half months that we have been seeing each other, he has been an absolute gentlement..<br><br>Or is it that I am being oversensitive and have too many thoughts going through my head?<br><br>I do not want to appear like a needy person, hence do not want to question what he is doing..afterall, we are not officially an item. We are still getting to know each other.. And anyway, I am not a needy person, its just that it has become such a routine of seeing him, that suddenly not seeing him makes me feel very uncomfortable..or perhaps past dating experiences is making me paranoid? Does all this thoughts/insecurities mean that I like him more than I think?<br><br>What do u think..and what do u think i should do..<br><br>Thanks for reading the long post..and i appreciate any advise u can give<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>So my question is..... you like him? But do the guy knows you like him?<br><br>Everyone has a life you know. Take me for an example. I got to know a friend. We close at the first few weeks of our friendship. But after that, he was like keeping away from me. Or so that is what I thought.<br><br>But then again i realise it is just me being paranoid.<br><br>In your case maybe because its a beginning of a new friendship. That is why he bonded with you in the beginning. But maybe he is busy. That is why he is acting this way. I think you are being paranoid..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
