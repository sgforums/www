Nope... I don't think it's really such a good idea unless you're a 'Tom Cruise look alike' or something... But 'technically' speaking, it's just another way of getting to know another person.... Whatever happens from there on can be quite limitless.. Though it definitely doesn't give you much chance to know each other well compared to most of other methods in getting to know a person.... In a way that can be a handicap for some but yet 'advantage' for some others....<br><br>Well... If you feel that you're really uncomfortable with the idea, don't do it then? You'll probably just look very awkward with quite a low chance of success (unless you're a 'Tom Cruise look alike'...  &lt;<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">&gt; )... Are you desperate? If you're not, use other methods you're more comfotrable with to know more members of the opposite gender....<br><br>Did tried such things before... But often I just didn't stay in contact... Most of them I don't even call or sms back...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> But yeah..

If you sincerely want to find out more about the person I guess the person can feel your interest in her. The person might respond actively or not, depends on your luck.<br><br>There's no right or wrong. It takes guts to approach a stranger but it can be exciting. Again it depends from person to person. Remember, it's usually a guy's job to do the approaching so I dun think there's anything wrong. If you don't try, you have zero percent chance...but if u try u have at least 50% chance. Just remember to ask for contact number of course.<br><br>The downside is that the stranger might not trust you enough to form a long term r/s. Hey but at least you had the guts! Even a Takeshi Kaneshiro look-alike might not have the guts.<br><br>Good luck!</div>
