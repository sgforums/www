Same goes for your BF. There have to be certain sacrifices of freedom, limitation of choices and selective associations. It all binds to responsibility and commitment to each other. Remember you are going into a relationship that lasts and it may be a marriage. If any of you can't sacrifice anything for each other, you may not be in love, you are just enjoying each other presence.<br><br>Perharps you love him but for him, you need to find out.</div>
