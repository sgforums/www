            <div class='col-md body'>It's a perfect opportunity to stand back and observe his reaction... does he flirt along?  if so, how outrageously?  ... or does he reject all advances politely?  ... Observe his response and it will give you a pretty accurate view of the man himself.<br><br>I seriously wouldn't bother to do anything in this case.  Sure, I'll feel a tad... I don't know... threatened?  jealous?  It will be normal to experience those feelings.  But I'd also welcome the great opportunity for him to be tested.  Afterall, if he's gonna be a flirt, flitting from girl to girl, wrapping them around his fingers and all, with no respect at all for me, then I'd like to know as soon as possible so I can say goodbye and sashay off, kicking the dust off my stiletto heels as I do so!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>A boyfriend should never pride himself on being able to pick just any girl he wanted, right in front of his girlfriend!  I mean, what is he trying to prove?  That he can still play the field and ditch her anytime because he's so very desired by other women?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   And a real gentleman, when he falls in love, would make sure his girl was so assured of his steadfast love and dedication to her that even when she knows he'll be thronged with sexy women, she KNOWS that he will remain faithful to her because he loves her and cherishes the relationship that they have.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i do feel honored in this sense dat girls come up to him. N yes, he does handle the situation quite well. Girls asked for his number, he jus rejected nicely with 'I have a gf'. So i guess dats something i should be happy abt.  IT took a lot of time for me to make do with this fact. Cos he does get quite a lot of attention when he goes drinking. N yes, girls pay for his drinks and if some guys get jealous, blame yourself for not being as attractive.  But at least i am not bothered by it now.  LIke what some people in the forum said, 'If he wanna stray, would have done so.' N well, jus giving him the trust that i feel he should deserve for now.  If anything happens, i will keep you people updated.</div>
