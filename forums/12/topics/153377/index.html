            <div class='col-md body'>damned. your father sounds like my father... and i can absolutely identify with you.. are you a guy or girl??<br><br>anyway, personally, i just let my dad do wadever he wants with his life, as long as he doesnt jeopardise the family's welfare. recently he was about to do that and i told him if he really did it, he cant expect me to call him father anymore. and that means i wun be feeding him when he retires. other than that, i dun bother too much about him. i concentrate on upholding my mum and brothers. save up for the future, in case that smart *#&amp; does something funny...<br><br>if you're a guy, try to get financially independent. that always helps, when you need to keep your dad in check. but if he's not doing anything too bad, respect him as best as you can. he is still your father. *though you may resent it as much as i do. lolz.*</div>
