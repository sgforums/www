              <p>To think that one knows another is very, very ungrateful. How can you know another? How can you know the man/woman? <span style="text-decoration: underline;">They are processes, they are not things</span>. The woman/man that you knew yesterday is not there today. So much water has gone down the River; he/she is somebody else, totally different. <br>And the man that you slept with or ... last night, look at his face again in the morning. He is no more the same person, so much has changed. So much, incalculably much has changed. That is the difference between a thing and a person. The furniture in the room is the same, but the man and the woman, they are no more the same.</p>
              <p>And you want to choose love - man, love cannot be possessed - it can be shared appreciated - unless one feels alrite holding on do a dead thing - a plastic flower,</p>

              <p>hmmm.. as superficial as this advice may sound, but I think, ultimately, the decision to choose is as  good as tossing a coin.</p>
              <p>another suggestion would to stay away from both for a period of time.. for this time, who will you think of more, and who will you miss most. you will miss both but who u miss more?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Harlow TS,<br><br>Although I dunno u or the real story behind it but i do understand how terrible u feel and how FUBAR the thing can turn out. Since we are in a monogamy society, things will not turn out quite the way u want it to be. Of cos there's a few questions u can ask urself in order to make a better decision.<br><br>To have both of them is not impossible but I can see only 2 ways:<br><br>1) Both ladies know the existence of each other and are willing to compromise and share u.<br><br>2) Lie to both of them telling each of them that u had broken up with the other party.<br><br>Let me state that although point No.2 seems attractive but u will have to live every single day as a lie. You cannot fall sick or celebrate holidays. It is not a recommended solution as one day, u will face the same problem as u have today.<br><br>I can only guess how FUBAR the situation is as below:<br><br>1) <strong>BAD</strong>: main dish knows u r eating side dish.<br><br>2) <strong>Very BAD</strong>: main dish knows u r eating side dish and side dish knows u got main dish.<br><br>3) <strong>Extremely BAD</strong>: sex is involved with side dish.<br><br>4) <strong>Horrendiously BAD</strong>: main dish and side dish are best frens.<br><br>5) <strong>FUBAR</strong>: point no.2 + no.3 + no.4 of the above<br><br>Possible solutions and likely outcome based on above:<br><br>Based on above point <strong>no.1</strong>:<br><br>If you choose main dish, apologise to main dish and promise never to do it again. must keep ur word and love her. break off nicely with side dish. Outcome: depending on main dish character. if this is ur 1st offence, u may get away.<br><br>If you choose side dish, break off with main dish. start fresh with side dish since side dish does not know anything with main dish. Outcome: well, since u get away scott free, high chance u may do it again. must treat side dish faithful ya.<br><br>Based on above point <strong>no.2</strong>:<br>This is neck deep, deep shit. The solutions are the same as above. However, there is a risk that both will not trust ever again and you will stand to lose the both of them. Lying to each of them telling each of them u had broken with the other party is possible and you can give both. However u will be living everyday as a lie, ur lies must be consistence, u r not allowed to have MCs or holidays. No MCs and holidays is bcos both will look for u at the same time. time management is crucial. same goes for ur financial.<br><br>Based on above point <strong>no.3</strong>:<br>It is much worse than point 1 and 2 becos u had done something close and intimate with a lady. The damage and whatever collaterial damage will cause much more repercussion... u know wat i mean and u cannot get away so easily. The solutions and the outcomes are most likely the same as point 1 and 2, except they are much harder to execute. the situation is much stickier.<br><br>Based on above point <strong>no. 4 </strong>and point <strong>no.5</strong>:<br>Welcome to my situation. No solution. This is the part where god can't really hear u scream cos u r so far deep down in hell. I reserved a seat for u next to me if this is ur situation. :)<br><br>Watever the outcome maybe ah bert, u can have one and only one. BE faithful, true and sincere and love her all u can. Decide on the one u feel strongly for and the one who love u most. in this case i can only feel sorry for the side dish and support the main dish. the main dish is not a main dish if she had not love and stand by u for so long liao.</p></div>

              <p>It is possible, although there will be slight variation in the love towards both parties.</p>
              <p>However, i will like to stress that it is not recommendable to be a 2-timer, in fact strongly discourage. Cos it will mess up ur time, financial and didi management.</p>
