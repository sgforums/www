            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Riff,<br><br>It may Not be because she intends to keep it from you forever, or that she doesn't trust you.  Have you thought of the fact that this matter could cause her so much pain that she doesn't want to bring it up because it'll hurt her again?<br><br>There're times when I don't tell my guy what bothers me straightaway, &amp; only do it after some time has pssed &amp; I've fully gotten over it.  I don't wish to tell him when I'm already upset, have him get worried &amp; upset, AND I end up having to comfort him when I myself need the comforting &amp; reassurance.<br><br>My guy &amp; I have worked out an understanding regarding this.  He No longer expects me to tell him things that bother me unless I start getting irritable &amp; snappy.  But if I'm just moody &amp; need to get over something, he'll let me tell him in time, &amp; in the meantime, give me all the support I need.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by riff:</div><div class="quote_body">I guess im just insecure.

Sometimes, trying to understand someone (be it gal or guy) all you need to do is be a bit more sensitive and more observant. Especially towards your own partner.<br><br>My gf has a more reserve character in which most of the time she will keep her own feelings and problems to herself especially if she's feeling sad or down. Maybe I'm a more sensitive person and for a good reason that I love my gf very much, it comes to me naturally that I'll sense her differences in mood almost immediately. But I have to do my part as a partner. Will still ask her if something is bothering her. If she start saying things like "it's ok, I'll deal with it" or "it's ok, it's over, I don't wanna talk about it" or "nothing lah" then I definitely got the answer that she's not ok but doesn't wish to talk about it AT THAT MOMENT. Just let her be but keep assuring her that if she ever need you around to talk..you are available. Be always supportive.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>a story to share with you people<br>take note of the sentence in <strong>bold</strong><br><br>Is quite touching and in fact not much people can do it and most of the time anger will take up everything...<br><br>A boy was born to a couple after eleven years of marriage. They were a loving couple and the boy was the gem of their eyes. When the boy was around two years old, one morning the husband saw a medicine bottle open. He was late for office so he asked his wife to cap the bottle and keep it in the cupboard. His wife, preoccupied in the kitchen totally forgot the matter. The boy saw the bottle and playfully went to the bottle fascinated by its color and drank it all. It happened to be a poisonous medicine meant for adults in small dosages. When the child collapsed the mother hurried him to the hospital. He died. The mother was stunned. She was terrified how she was going to face her husband.<br><br>When the distraught father came to the hospital and saw the dead child, he looked at his wife and uttered just five words.<br><br>QUESTIONS :<br><br>1. What were the five words ?<br><br>2. What is the implication of this<br>story?<br><br>ANSWER :<br>The husband just said "I am with you<br>Darling".<br>The husband's totally unexpected reaction is a proactive behavior. The child is dead. He can never be brought back to life. There is no point in finding fault with the mother. Besides, if only he had taken time to keep the bottle away, this would not have happened. No one is to be blamed. She had also lost her only child. What she needed at that moment was consolation and sympathy from the husband. That is what he gave her. If everyone can look at life with this kind of perspective, there would be much fewer problems in the world. "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step." <strong>Take off all your envies, jealousies, unforgiveness, selfishness, and fears. And you will find things are actually not as difficult as you think.</strong><br><br>MORAL OF THE STORY<br><br>This story is really worth reading.<br>Sometimes we spend time in asking who is responsible or whom to blame, whether in a relationship, in a job or with the people we know. By this way we miss out some warmth in human relationship.<br></div>
