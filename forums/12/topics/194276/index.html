Tells her that he is bored with her? How would your friend feel.<br><br>Clearly she have not put any effort in the relationship thats why she is feeling bored.<br><br>Ask your friend if she had done anything for the guy this past 3 years?<br><br>I believed that the guy had pampered her very well but why does the girl not feel anything for it ? Reason is simple she is the receiver not the giver. She may be pretty or young for now but when she grows old, things will change.<br><br>Ask your friend to treasure what she has or else when the time comes she will not have anything in the end.<br></div>

Even though they aren't romantic enough compared to their ang moh counterparts. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Well, actually it's both at fault here in this common situation. Girls will always have some sort of complaints here and then....some expectations that they  would like guys to match. Guys on the other hand are extremely clueless when dealing with the complaints/suggestions/nagging, they would want to find the fastest and easiest solution to resolve it...usually by giving it to girls' demand.<br>But is that what the girl really wanted? Were the complaints valid enough to the guy that they have to change? Love is indeed powerful isn't it? People change for one another without even thinking if it is really necessary at all. And eventually they don't realised that they've changed into someone else different who isn't the one which they were loved initially. That's what happen when both guy and girl tries to change each other and giving in to each other's demands...be it win or lose, it's pure silly behaviour of a child inside both of them.<br><br>In fact, I wished guys here would behave more like guys if only they thought carefully before giving in to their girlfriends. Demands that will affect the future happiness of the relationship shouldn't be easily given in to their girlfriends. Hehehe...girls sometimes demanded alot of nonsense from guys, only the silly ones will give in without second thoughts. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I'm not asking guys out there to tell their girlfriends to shut up ok? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>Just suggesting that it's always best get hold of your rational mind and don't allow your emotional mind to take over the way you run your relationship.<br><br>No matter what happens, guys will always love girls and girls will make them feel like wanna die but cannot live without them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
