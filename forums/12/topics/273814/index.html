She seems to be fine and we always talked to each other in the phone.<br><br>Im confused if my subconsious mind giving me hope to get together with her back or what?<br><br>I guess she's kinda knw if i still have feeling to her..but i cant tell her for sure that i still have the feeling cuz i myself not sure. So i ended up saying "Dont knw... maybe.."<br><br>Then, she'll shes like wanna let things go by itself, naturally and telling something like we should get to know each other more. Im confused by what she said...<br><br><strong>TO conclude:</strong><br>a) Confused whether i wan to b together with her again<br><br>b) Confused what had she say bout letting it be natural and we should get to know each other more<br><br>c) Confused if i just wanna talk to her cuz it feels comfortable<br><br>d) Confused if im jus trying to improve my skills on how to talk to gal to attract them and she's just an experimental rat.. (oh gosh, i hope i never said that)<br><br>e) What will she do if she's interested in talking to me back? Any signs? She did call me sometimes but due to its high cost n shes still studying, she rarely call me. And she calls all her best frens n parents.<br><br>Appreciate any help and comment. Thanks for your time. Let me know if u guys need more details. Will get back to your comment asap.<br><br>Chiouz, Zarks<br><br>[/b]</blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> It's all about being logical - a stronger emphasis on the mental faculty.

Life goes on...<br><br>U knw , whn u guys helping me here, its kinda open up my subconscious mind..<br><br>Now i dont call her again... i just have to go on and forget bout her.. Let GoD busy with His job on this... as for me, i'll do wat it takes to be a better man , to be successful in life.. I'll just put aside any relationship for now..</div>
