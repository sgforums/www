            <div class='col-md body'>First thing first who initiated the break up??<br><br>She may be angry becoz she could haf recalled how u haf hurt her badly. Or maybe she is still confused inside her becoz she still loves u, but becoz u hurt thatt's y u turn her all upside down. It could also be that she's afraid of facing the same senario a second time, that's y she reject u. Gers are pple u cannot hurt them, becoz they are more emotional than most guys. and normally in a relationship, chances is that they contribute more to it. Having to haf dumped by u once, would mean she return to her protective self. As the saying goes... once beaten twice shy.<br><br>If it's u then I think u haf to explain to her how u r feeling at that time, and y the thing she say or did made u real fed-up. Be totally honest to her. Dun get aggitated when she rejects u again. Dun get angry, becoz gers needs to be pampered especially in this kind of situation. all of us are humans, we will be touched, and be soften when we see true sincerity. Even for guys as well. Well, let her slowly trust u again... once u gain her trust then dun ever break it agin, becoz a slightest wrong move from u will make her recall the whole thing and ur standing will be shaken. Main thing is to be totally sincere in all ur words and actions.<br><br>but one thing I haf to comment. U mentioned that she has always made u angry, wun this patch up gonna make u 2 going back to square one?? Can u bear wif her making u angry?? If it's going to be a repetition and u r going to be angry over the same thing again, I advise let both of u cool down first. Make sure u r certain that she is going to be the one for u. Chance is that, now u r feeling loss, and needed someone to to fill up the hole in ur life. It wun be love that u will be, but more of companionship. then it's going to hurt u and her in the end.<br><br>sorry for being so direct, and may haf even hurt u.<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ahhhh...i'm back....<br>okiez, wat i was going to say has basically been covered by our dear BEEG Bear here. =) hahaha<br>but i just hope to emphasize one point. THINK it thru' clearly. have a HEART to MIND talk with urself. ask urself clearly wat do u wan. dun get angry so easily, it's easier to think with a CLEAR head/mind.<br>finally, after having the mind-heart talk, if u finally decide to still go after ur ex, locate the problems that was present previously. think of ways u are going to solve these problems.<br>then have a heart to heart talk with ur ex. bare ur heart n soul to her. not exactly la, just exaggerating abit. but basically, asure her that u won't break her heart again, and identify the problems with her. DISCUSS with her how the TWO of u are going to solve it TOGETHER. okiez? =) dun make it all UR decision. =) democracy, let her have her say in this, coz the relationship concerns the both of u.<br>talk in peace. dun flare up so easily. =) calm down, and when u feel a surge of temper rising, force it down, take deep breaths. look at her and remember how much u love her. =)))<br><br>u noe.......everytime a couple quarrels, or more so in a case where the bf gets angry at the gf, the gf hurts alot......of coz a relationship does have it's ups n downs, but it hurts to have ur bf scolding u and flaring up at u lo...and whenever there are arguements, i believe both parties won't feel nice lo.......there's alotta hurt done here la....so, he mu gong chu is still da best!<br><br>PEACE!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Zap: how's things wif u now??<br><br>T|red: Told you that I have no life liaoz.. From morning till night sit in front of the computer. Chances is that I will spot a post earlier than you.. sorryz...<br><br>Anyway... I was just reading your earlier post. It brings to mind my idea of a quarrel. In a argument, there is no wrong party, because both have their own ways of thinking (assuming all are logical ideas). It's just that neither can accept or understand each other at that point of time, hence resulted in the quarrel. And it's because of self-pride that rises the heated atmoshtere. He mu gong chu seems the best, but to achieve is very difficult. Well, even when one party always gives in, there will be a time when the party gets fed-up, breaks it.<br><br>From experience, I expect a couple to spark off a quarrel within the first 6 mths of their relationship. It's good, because it shows whether they can handle the first down turn of their relationship. The longer it takes for the first quarrel to occur, the chances of the relationship breaking up is higher. During this 6 mths, both sides will start to show the hidden character of themselves. If they dun quarrel, that means they are keeping their feelings in silence. If the load is let out all at one go after a while, it will not be good for the relationship. Don't know how u guys think??<br><br>Think typical relationships happen this way... there are exceptions of course.<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>
