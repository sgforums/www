My guess is MOST women prefer love over career. But some women dun mind being single. All I noe is <strong>many</strong> guys prefer career to women (sad fact... stereotyped...)<br><br>All I can sae is these women need to find wat they really want in their heart... &amp; I tink "career" is not da ultimate answer... Dat women U noe of... who in her 30s... all I can sae is its TIME for her to make a choice... either stay dat wae OR sacrifice her career to try to seek an answer for "lonelyness"...<br><br>How U wan me to address U? call U <span style="color: blue;">bunzy</span>, U feel weird, call U <span style="color: red;">honey</span> U oso got comment, I too lazy to call U "Honeybunz"... too long... Then call U <span style="color: violet;">HB</span> lah!

It's not that they don't need love or to get a life but more like they're somehow stuck 'comfortably' to the lifestyle they're adapting now... Changes ain't easy, both psychologically and situationally....<br><br>Some of them DO go for the CHANGE at a latter stage of their life, meaning they might go for an 'easier on them' job or just do investments with the amount of cash they have and starts to enjoy life.... But on my mind AT LEAST 2 MAIN issues they would have to face...<br><br>1. Adapting to the CHANGE of lifestyle... Being very much conditioned for the kinda life-style they're having, it's not easy for them to adapt for a CHANGE... Some of them not being willing to give up on the 'luxury' (or more like used-to life-style &lt;- not a simple topic to be elaborated here in details, basically it also affect your social circle and many other things..) would plan on 'retirement' only when they think they've earned enough to maintain their current life-style, which is often not met or met only at a VERY LATE STAGE of life.... Being at the age they would then be at also doesn't help much in their ability to 'explore' new aspects of life.... Male generally have a slight advantage over this because they're more of the 'exploring' type... Females generally are the more commited especially in the related field and generation. Of course, there can be exceptions found in the females too... But RARE I should say to expect them to come from the PROFESSIONALs... In the earlier generation they probably not have stay long enough in their field if they're the 'rare female' breeds... But you can EXPECT more of those people as the society begin to MODERNISE.<br><br>2. 2nd issue mainly related to LOVE. One can expect that the 1st few relatoinships not to be much of a successful match to be a common thing. Having a LATE START for love ain't exactly a good thing ESPECIALLY in your friend's case where LOVE is LONGED FOR. Not including the fact that there could be some low-grades out there waiting to take advantage of this opportunity, the chances for naturally failed relationship is equally high. Being lonesome for too long and the fact that one's youth is no longer there (especially a true belief for many females at your friend's age) only make the bitterness of failure worse. Tension and frustrations can easily comes in when the females' (this is mainly what they'll be looking for by their professionalism and age) hope for an ESTABLISHED relationship seems diminished as the years go by. Result could be either a rush into an incompatible relationship or even marriage. Not forgetting the fact ladies would be reaching their err... Can't remember the term for that...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  The age where your PMS days are over?

That's life !<br>I also face the same prob. ( I am a guy thou.) . I above 30 now &amp; hoping to find a soulmate soon, &amp; wld like to hv a simple family life. Used to be hv may preference abt the dream girl but  now, just want one that's pleasant to my eye &amp; able to communicate with me. U know - guys also can feel lonley not just girls. I am open to match-making by friends or relatives. recently, my uni. close friend's parents have made great effort to introduce a girl to me. I was quite touched &amp; moved by their sincere effort &amp; concerns . I am now working on this .Actually, I think this mtd is not bad in  this modern era, ask your friends to open up more avenues to find a soulmates - sometimes you never know may be you can find a gem along the way. Happy searching to all of us . <span class="large"><span style="color: red;">" Life is like a Box of Chocolates - u never what you'll get until you open it --------"</span></span></div>
