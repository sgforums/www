But i thought he would have chose someone as i expected better than me....But in any way i dont mean any harm too..Just that m feeling now is hard to ddesscribe as myself i dont know how i feeling.</div></blockquote>Ok...time for apologies if I've hurt your feelings, but I won't take back what I've said.<br><br>It happens in my relationship with my gf. She always think that she's not good enough for me and there's always others who's better, more pretty than her. But ultimately, all I can tell her is I love no one other than her. I agreed with her that there's thousands and millions of girls out there who are smarter and more prettier than her but she's the only one that I set my eyes on and I love only her. It's who she is that lets me decide that she's the one in my life.<br><br>So what if there's other girls smarter and more pretty than her? Does that means I have to change gf everytime I met one who is smarter and prettier than the current one? I don't think so I'll ever do that.<br><br>I'm clear headed with the fact that during my darkest hours she's always there for me and support me since the first day I know her and all these while no matter how bad I've treated her before she never left my side and tolorate all my nonsenses even till now. I don't think I'll ever met someone like her again and even if I do it won't change my feelings for my gf.<br><br>Jasmine, I really do hope that you'll start thinking otherwise before you end up being alone for the rest of your life cause what a guy seeks in his lifetime companion isn't just how good she is in bed or how pretty she is or how smart she is. Love definitely can be defined in much more other ways.</div>

Should one day either of us decide to end this relationship, we make a pact to each other that we shall remain soulmates to each other even after that. We were soulmates before we were together and that shall not change. It's difficult to explain the situation me and my gf are facing but all I can say is it's not a problem that can be solved easily and my gf is facing pressures because of this. I have no problem with this but I must be strong enough to stand by her but I know in a way I'm preparing for the day that she decide to end this relationship should she think that she can't bear the pressure anymore.<br><br>But despite all these, I know we love each other very deeply with no doubts. We just have to fight on and hope to win. The road ahead is full of obstacles and I don't mind being the one to carry her across as long as she has faith in me. I just don't wanna surrender even without a good fight. Before we were together, I already know the things we'll both be facing but I don't want to give out without trying cause I'll know I'll eventually regret. At least with a good fight for our happiness, even if we fail we won't regret.</div></blockquote></div>

Been planning for our future and working hard trying to make more money so that she won't have to slog her whole life. Even if we ended up in separate ways, I don't think I'll ever regret giving her my heart.<br><br>As for our problems, I guess I just have to learn the harshness of reality but like I say before, I'm not going to give up. I'll wait even if it means 10yrs..20yrs..30yrs. She definitely worth me making the effort. Probably the only thing that breaks my heart now is that she's the one facing the pressures more than I did. At times I do give a thought if I should just end it all and end her misery. Tough. Take it I'm selfish but I really do love her.</div>
