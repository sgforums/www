              <p>Day in day out keep hearing this obnoxious old woman preaching and preaching non stop.   Irritating.      For goodness' sake we are working not in for any religious stuff.    </p>
              <p>Preach and preach but her actions and words show otherwise.     She is a typical fault finder.    Lecture me for saying I don't like the circle line.   She was furious and told me off "who are you to say you don't like and blah blah blah" .     She is not happy when people bring up real life issues like rising costs.      To her this is negative.    Like as if what we say have to be approved by her.</p>
              <p>Nice to her she went on to say things to show her unkindness.   Eg, she was around KK doing her shopping.   Told her there is a Sheng Siong there she can go to.   She sounded unhappy and told me off " as if I don't know".</p>
              <p>During work, she is using the office resources to do her christian stuff.    Using SMS often during office hours.  At the same time, she is pinpointing my colleague who love to talk a lot.    She would tell her to work and talk at the same time.   What a hypocrite! Her work quality is bad.    Observe that she puts in her heart and soul doing her christian stuff at work more than work.    </p>
              <p>With all the crap from her she dare have the cheek to ask me go for Good Friday events and experience God's love.</p>
              <p>To me, actions and words tell it all if a person is nice or nasty, there is no need for preaching.</p>
              <p>One more thing, she is from the church whereby many of my friends stop attending coz majority there are nasty people.   She is one of them, hahahahah.    I went to the church before and also find that the people there mostly are unpleasant.</p>
              <p>There are definitely good and bad christians.    This one really damn, a damn bad one.  Pui!    Ugly shorty old woman who goes round finding out about others' marital status.</p>

              <p>You are complaining about how a christian auntie is affecting you and how envious you are at her.</p>
              <p>Are you too free is it? YOu got so much time to observe her. Are you attracted to her physically? If not then why you waste your productivity watching her and getting so ticked off by her behaviour? If I am your boss - I would surely sack you.</p>
              <p>Sounds really pathetic. why are you so kepo? Mind your own biz lah. And go about your own biz. You are like a time bomb waiting to explode. Every minor issue irritates you. You cannot get along with anybody. Epic fail. NO wonder you never advance in life. You will always be an epic fail. Grow up...</p>
