You are not a loser. It takes courage and wisdom to express your feelings to the girl you like and in a way that is not perceived as aggressive or offensive to her.<br><br>I too have my doubts as to whether the girl should accept your ring and as result, half-knowingly or unknowingly gave you false hope of some form of acceptance of your courtship.<br><br>It is your decision indeed to make as to how to interpret her reactions and whether to continue with your courtship.<br><br>All the best, TS. ^_^<br><br></div>
