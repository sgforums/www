Converting to another religion is very difficult. I know from personal experience ( I didn't convert at the end ) . Might be cold feet , might be something else.<br><br>As from what I understand , once you convert to Islam - there is no turning back  . So it is a major decision for her to make. Maybe you should sit down and have a chat why she does not want to convert and let her tell you her reasons. Let her find her way into Islam by her own volition, don't pressure her.<br><br>Better that she starts to have doubts now rather than later when you both are married with kids. You want a solid relationship , not one where everyday she blames you for her predicament down the road.<br><br>All the best.<br></div>

Islam states very specifically that there is no way you can reconvert out of it. Once a muslim always a muslim until death. It is very strict.<br><br>We are dealing with two people from different religions and culture. They have to work things out for themselves and make their own decisions.
