However, deep within her psyche, her desire and inferiority nature actually crave for security. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I mentioned before in my previous post that the previous guys (sad to say) didn't deliver enough impact to impress and shake off her negative reinforcing into the mind.

Agree with me?</strong></blockquote>What she meant by not liking romance is related to the link of romance with deception. A big however, she would appreciate down-to-earth pratical, simple and sweet gesture like cooking for partner. BTW, romantic novels contributes certain percentage to the above points as well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: As mentioned, the solution lies with the guy and his way to chase her.

            <div class='col-md body'>I personally feel that what she need is TIME to help herself (no one can really help her by the way) to cure her Psuchological problems before she can accept a guy.<br><br>Given the current situation, no matter who the guy is, she will reject all guys who are nice to her due to her FEAR to FALL IN LOVE (mentioned by Yunhaier). I agree with U totally.<br><br>My friend suggested that no rushing/pushing of her as this will worsen the situation and she will like a hermit, keep hiding in her shell and will not come out again. My friend also suggested that since I get along well with her in such a short time and what she need is someone who is understanding and can talk to and Some suggested things that can be done currently.<br><br>1. Keep in contact with her - maintain it.<br>2. Show more concern about her, let her know someone out there is sincere about her and NOT CHEATING her.<br>3. In the long run, she will more or less appreciate and well, she is human beings after all and sure have feeling by the way.<br><br>I did ask her what type of movie she last watched, she told me about romance!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>U see, her heart tells her that she actually desire to be loved but in actually fact, she is shutting love at the moment.... really sad to tell U all.<br><br>I know a gal will take a long time to heal her "wound" but it is sooo long liao and she seems cannot abandon the burden....maybe due to her characters... she is a Virgo by the way. (very serious in Relationship and those committed type, too bad those bad eggs did such things to her... more or less ruining her and don;t tell me I am given the task of "rescuing her in this life???"<br><br></div>
