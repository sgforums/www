Young lovers walked arm in arm amidst flowers of every color and a fine view of the city skyline could be seen in the distance.<br><br>As the man by the window described all this in exquisite details, the man on the other side of the room would close his eyes and imagine this picturesque scene.<br><br>One warm afternoon, the man by the window described a parade passing by.<br><br>Although the other man could not hear the band - he could see it in his mind ' s eye as the gentleman by the window portrayed it with descriptive words.<br><br>Days, weeks and months passed.<br><br>One morning, the day nurse arrived to bring water for their baths only to find the lifeless body of the man by the window, who had died peacefully in his sleep.<br><br>She was saddened and called the hospital attendants to take the body away.<br><br>As soon as it seemed appropriate, the other man asked if he could be moved next to the window. The nurse was happy to make the switch, and after making sure he was comfortable, she left him alone.<br><br>Slowly, painfully, he propped himself up on one elbow to take his first look at the real world outside.<br><br>He strained to slowly turn to look out the window besides the bed.<br><br>It faced a blank wall.<br><br>The man asked the nurse what could have compelled his deceased roommate who had described such wonderful things outside this window.<br><br>The nurse responded that the man was blind and could not even see the wall.<br><br>She said, "Perhaps he just wanted to encourage you." </span><br></div><div class="quote_body"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Epilogue:</span><br><br><span style="color: blue;">There is tremendous happiness in making others happy, despite our own situations.<br><br>Shared grief is half the sorrow, but happiness when shared, is doubled.<br><br>If you want to feel rich, just count all the things you have that money can ' t buy.<br><br><strong><span class="large">"Today is a gift, that is why it is called The Present ."</span></strong></span></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Stories serve to inspire. For some, it is crap cos they can't see it. For some, no meaning until they experience it. For some, aiya don't care.For some lame and happy-go-lucky. Most of the time, when we help others, we become less- concerned over our own problems. Our perspective widen and discover life isn't only about u, urself. Our views determine our perspective and our perspective determine how we live our life. And this view changes as we grow.<br><br>When one is optimist, one takes life in the present. For one who is sad, one usually, has not let go of the past and choose to live in the past.
