For a girl a "relationship" is an ongoing affair.<br><br>Therefore it is possible for a guy to have many girlfriends because these girlfriends are girlfriends in name only. The girl agrees to be his girlfriend and so, she is his girlfriend even if he does not see her regularly.<br><br>So it is better to ask a guy, "Do you want to spend as much of your time with me as possible, in asking me to be your girlfriend or do you want me to confirm that I am your girlfriend so you can tell all your friends that you have a girlfriend?"<br><br>Don't take it for granted.</div>
