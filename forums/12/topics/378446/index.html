              <p>Hi Leeying,</p>
              <p>I will prefer a guy who will make choices such as where to eat or go out for the both of us, but I will ask that he gives me the freedom of choice as to choose for myself what to wear and such. But then again, if my other half says that I look nice or beautiful in something, I will definitely try to wear that often when the two of us go out. I hope that this answers your question.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>Normally, i would decide where to have meal at, but if she does have craving then oh okay we will go to her ideal place.</p>
              <p>Yes i do restrict if my gf would want to wear miniskirts or low cut..</p>
              <p>but it will be depending on situation.</p>

              <p>but NO NEED to make my decisions FOR me. I mean, if a girl needs a guy to make decisions FOR her, then the assumption is the guy probably thinks she is either very helpless or very brainless.</p>
              <p> If he disagree with my decision, then discuss it.</p>

              <p>Hi Leeying,</p>
              <p>Maybe it is because your bf wants to let you have a greater sense of autonomy as to where you wish to go to. Tell him nicely that he will have to decide where the two of you will go before asking you out next time.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Frankly it boils down to individual...for me i wouldn't care less what my girlfriend want to wear.....i don't even mind if she wants to go and and party alone with ur friends or khakis......reason is simply i am confident of myself and where i stands in the social ladder.....if she wants to go let it be....it is pointless if u restrict her this and that....if u have what it takes in this society...it is girls chasing after u and not u chasing after girls.....</p>
              <p>As for places to go and eat...i would usually ask the girl if she got any place she prefers to go...if not i would then proceed to suggest where to go and such....</p>
              <p>so all in all it depends on the individual...</p>

              <p>Guys will always try to restrict their gf from exposing too much, but will always hope that every other pretty girl on the street wear cleavage-exposing clothes so that their eyes can eat ice-cream. But for me, own girlfriend wear figure hugging clothes is acceptable la. Bring her out will also feel proud. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Guys got to decide for their own thing. But if you're asking about where to go for dinner, I've got a conclusion after going out with <em>her</em> for years. You have to give in to her craving while making it seem like you're making your own decision. Sounds impossible to achieve right?</p>
              <p>Girl: So go where eat?<br>Me: Ding Tai Fung?<br>Girl: Long queue leh.<br>Me: Burger King?<br>Girl: Fastfood! Fattening!<br>Me: Ok lor, eat sushi.<br>Girl: Here the restaurant very exp. leh..</p>
              <p><em>After suggesting a loooong list and she's still not satisfied, the girl will either start telling you what she has cravings for, or you can lan lan suck thumb and continue suggesting.</em></p>
              <p>Me: How about Pepper Lunch?<br>Girl: Wait clothes get stinky leh!<br>Me: Sigh.. Ok lor, eat subway, fastfood that isn't fattening..<br>Girl: We've been eating subway all week long already leh..</p>
              <p><em>If you've suggested every restaurant/places within the vicinity/shopping centre that you can eat at, then tell her...</em></p>
              <p>Me: No more places you can go to le leh.. You wanna reconsider? I don't mind going hungry if you don't wanna eat.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> The point is not to flare up at her. Else you might not get to have dinner in peace. Worst still, she might not let you have "post-dinner activity" with her. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Agree wif superlibra. Ask her wats her craving, then make it seem like u have the same craving and u both go to tat restaurant. Try to give in to ur gf, but dun too overbored until henpecked la.</p>
              <p>I can be demanding at times, esp when it comes to her clothes. The freedom part must control. Not too much, not too little. *Imagine u flying a kite la*</p>
              <p>During dates usually i planned an itenary, ask her if is ok. The meals i let her cravings decide. If she cant, just bring her to a food court, order wat u noe is her fav etc. Sounds cheap, but the large variety of food can really make her hungry. Of course, restraunts is a must to make her smile la. Hahas. The best is u intro her to a restaurant or a new dish she never tried and when she likes it, TADA...good job for u. Expect much better treatment from her le, "post dinner-activities" etc etc.</p>
