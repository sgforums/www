            <div class='col-md body'>It really depends on the christian that u r with.  Some of them r so "devoted", they will force their partners to convert or join christian.<br><br>I've got a good fren (a buddhist) who's ex-gf was a christian.  They almost got married until the girl's mom said u my fren must convert to christian if he wanted to married her daughter.  So my fren (who is also devoted to his own religion) said that if their relation is to be interfere by religion, then might as well they just part before more damage is done in the future.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>seriously, most true-christians would want to marry christians. simply because they share the same faith and same beliefs.<br><br>secondly, about the malay part, yes you can marry a malay, but you have got to convert yourself to islam first.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone,  I think most of u pple got your facts wrong, for all the religions in singapore, only Muslim strictly requires that when wed, both male and female must be muslim. Simply meaning, a muslim can only marry a muslim. if he/she wishes to get married to a person of diff faith. There are 2 alternatives: Convert the other party to islam or he/she renounces his/her religion of islam. Its that way cause i am chinese, my uncle is a malay but my aunt is a catholic. They married by my uncle renouncing his islam faith and converted to catholism. Still together after 20 plus yrs, son is a catholic. but my uncle slowly still went back ti being a muslim but he is not officially registered as a muslim cause he didn't bother to officially register his faith. He believed in what he wanted.<br>The children issues on what religion he should take up? its a mutual agreement betw parents. But i feel its best if the child is introduced to both faiths to know more and finally decides on his own when he is older.<br>Most of u are blurred with the definition of Christianity. I am a christian too, but more specifically, i am a Catholic. Most of the pple treat christianity and catholicism as 2 diff religions. Its somewhat related. The so called 'christians' used to know? its actually Protestanism. Its not a nice name, but yeah thats their actual religion, they juz prefer to call themselves christians cause it sounds nicer. So branched under Christianity is catholics and protestants. And branched under Protestants: haha, u go do that math... there are too many of them. Dominatant ones are the Anglicans, Baptists, presbyterian, evangelist, etc etc.. many many more with more diff classes being created everyday. Recently in the papers about the Abu Sayaf beheading of 2 protestents? they are Jehova Witnsesses, again thats a branch of protestanism. Each having their own diff beliefs. Hope this gives u all a clearer pic.<br>Somewhere in the threads, i read about someone saying the christians wun like it if u go and woo some girl in their church esp if u are a diff religion? Well, i like to make it clear that this is to a minimal effect in the catholic church. We take a very much more softer approach in evangelisation than the protestants. Although the catholic church and like all religions would recommend marrying within the same faith, its a very subtle hint and encouragement on my side, i wun know about how the protestants would deal with such matters and wun comment.<br>So i hope what i have said would aid u all in differentiating the diff betw catholics and protestants, but we are still brothers in christ under the branch Christianity. of course we each have diff marrying cultures. but its good to get your facts clear. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Thanx!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi eagle,<br><br>I'm a Christian also.<br><br>God does not allow Christian to marry an unbeliever because the possibility of Christian giving in to their love one(non believer) is very high. That is to say that the Christian may do something against the will of God because of their love one. Also, if both of them are Christians, they won't end up in divorce because the Bible said God forbid divorce except adultery case. True Christian will understand that when they are married, they become one body and must not be separated.<br><br>Going to church every sunday, tithing, being baptised doesn't make you a Christian. A Christian should love God. Whatever you do, God comes first. When you have something to rejoice or have problems, share with God. Christian should not look for God only when he got problems.<br><br>So friend, don't worry about whether you have to convert to Christian to be with your girlfriend. If your girlfriend is a true Christian, she should worry more than you. You can convert to Christian but your heart is not with God, it don't serve any purpose. What you should do is let things go as it is. If you are touch by the love of God, read up the Bible to know more about Him. Faith only comes by the hearing of the Word, that is written in the Bible. God knows your heart, He knows whether you are suitable for His children.<br><br>My 2 cents worth.<br><br>Jesus Loves<br>Raymond Chua<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Just out of curiosity, maybe some christians can point out to me, if God is the creator of man, does that mean he create all living things (including dinosaurs) as well? Notwithstanding, then who is the creator of god? And if there is god or creator of god, then where does Darwin's theory of evolution stands?<br><br>I happen to be a free thinker, and I am happy with that. I believe in scientific facts, so my "god" will have to be big bang. I believe in man evolved from mouselike creatures eons ago and that came from tiny single cell organisms that existed further back when earth was newly created. However according to the bible, god created earth and all living things in 6 days. Kind of hard to believe that birds and animals will pop out of nowhere in 6 days. And is anyone able to convince me that the man god created was able to speak and communicate within a shortwhile after he was created when there is scientific proof that the human brain took a long time to become substantially developed to enable speech.<br><br>My point of view is that one's belief in his/her religion is entirely his own business. There is no point in forcing another person to follow his spouse-to-be religion. Think of it in another way, maybe we all believe in the same "god", just that it is in different forms. Perhaps it will be wiser to let the individuals believe in what they chose to believe in.<br><br>Big Bang loves mfscrewu.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

And if there is god or creator of god, then where does Darwin's theory of evolution stands?<br><br>I happen to be a free thinker, and I am happy with that. I believe in scientific facts, so my "god" will have to be big bang. I believe in man evolved from mouselike creatures eons ago and that came from tiny single cell organisms that existed further back when earth was newly created. However according to the bible, god created earth and all living things in 6 days. Kind of hard to believe that birds and animals will pop out of nowhere in 6 days. And is anyone able to convince me that the man god created was able to speak and communicate within a shortwhile after he was created when there is scientific proof that the human brain took a long time to become substantially developed to enable speech.<br><br>My point of view is that one's belief in his/her religion is entirely his own business. There is no point in forcing another person to follow his spouse-to-be religion. Think of it in another way, maybe we all believe in the same "god", just that it is in different forms.

I do not have any intention to force people to accept my belief, neither do I tends to belittle other religion. Religion can also be share, right?<br><br>So you are an atheist? Do you believe in devils or ghost etc then? With regards Darwin's theory of evolution, Charles Darwin in the later years saw the error of his ways. In his final days, Darwin returned to his faith in the Bible. At his deathbed, he made this confession to his companions:<br><br>" I was a young man with unformed ideas. I threw out queries, suggestions, wondering all the time about everything. To my astonishment, the ideas took like wild fire. People made a religion of them".<br><br>You can find this quote in the book "Meyers, Voices From the Edge of Eternity, page 239-240.<br><br>To believe in Christianity, one must first believe the first verse of the Bible.

            <div class='col-md body'>Deu65<br><br>Yes, to that first question of you forcing people to accept Christ (that's in my opinion, sorry that I sound blunt). Religion can be shared, but it is up to the individual to choose whether if he/she would like to do so.<br><br>As to being an atheist, maybe I am. I don't believe in devil nor ghosts either. As a person inclining towards science, I seek the truth through facts that can be backed up by scientific explaination. Even if Darwin went back to his faith, then how do you explain evolution then? There is no denying that evolution did take place and is still constantly happening, can you?<br><br>You are right that in saying that to believe in christanity, that one must first believe the first verse of the Bible. So I chose not to believe it. You are not the first person whom I have posted the question of who created god. Like you and many others before you, no one has been able to give me a satisfactory answer. To answer that in a more scientific way, law of conservation states that no energy can be created or destroyed. So assuming that god is a source of energy, so there must be something in the universe that changes from an alternate form to that energy which create god or gave it the power. So I seek that truth behind in what is that alternate energy/thing that does that.<br><br>I am not here to argue about christanity and other religions. What I am putting before you is that each of us have his/her own faith/belief and his/her own "god". Just as yours have a name, mine belief happens to be known as Big Bang and Evolution. I respect others' right to their faith and perhaps they will do the same for my belief.<br><br>Have a nice day and believe in what you think you should. Cheers.<br><br>p/s: To the person who posted this topic, love your spouse for who he/she is and not for what he/she believe in.

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi mfscrewu<br><br>I apologised if I give you that kind of feeling.<br><br>Yes, evolution did takes place, but it is the kind of evolution we see everyday: hair color, rose color, dog size, finches' beaks. But they do not change the sort of thing the organism is: the person remains a person, the rose a rose, the dog a dog, and the finch a finch. No matter how it change, the dog cannot change to a man.<br><br>Read this:<br><br>(((Evolution, as it is commonly referred to, demands much more than this. It demands that there have been enough directional mutations, one added to another, through the ages, to change what was once a unicellular organism into the variety of life we see today. This kind of evolution is lacking a mechanism, however, as mutations are not known to do this. We see single mutations, such as antibiotic resistance, malarial resistance (which, in its homozygous form, confers the deadly sickle cell disease), and such, but we do not see mutations adding up anywhere to produce a new form or function. Instead, the vast majority of mutations we do see are negative, harming the organism involved. Those that do not harm, such as antibiotic resistance changes, have the effect of weakening the organism in any environment except the specific one in which that change helped it survive. Change the environment and the original form, if it still exists, proves strongest and takes over again. What we see, what we can work with, and what we see as the results of tests, is called biological stasis. No matter how many generations of E.coli bacteria are worked with, they remain....E.coli. No matter how many generations of fruit flies are subjects of forced mutations, they remain.... fruit flies. We can get different types of mice for our lab experiments until we run out of names for them. They remain mice. This is biological stasis. Variation seems to exist within what Genesis refers to as the "kind," and that is all. Does the scientific consensus overwhelmingly support evolution? Yes, it does. The question is, Why? First of all, most areas of science don't concern themselves with evolution or creation. Science tends to be so incredibly technical today that it is the science philosophers who have taken over the arguments concerning evolution and creation. The scientists in the labs and in the field are, with the exception of some geologists and paleontologists, not thinking about evolution. But that is what they were taught in university as true. And so they accept it. And they accept that anything else is some kind of weird religious doctrine. But if you ask the scientist to point to something in his own field which verifies the type of evolution that turns bacteria to bears, or even supports it, you will get mostly silence. He may point to another field, but very few are willing to point to something in their own field of study which supports evolution especially if you ask them to support evolution to the exclusion of creation.<br>Thus, to say that the majority of scientists accept evolution may be true on the surface, but that is about as far as their acceptance goes anyway. If a person wants to really find out which is true, it is best to dig into the evidence and read what has been written on both sides. When one meets those who have done so, one just might find a few more creationists than one expected to find. And an even greater number of anti-evolutionists. *Scientifically*, evolution is not something that has been shown to work. Yes, plants and animals change. They can vary in some possibly startling ways. But no breeder of horses, or dogs, or cattle, and no parent, when they hear, "there seems to be a mutation..." is going to excitedly ask, "Is it a good one?". It has not been proven in thousands upon thousands of generations of E.coli, nor has it been proven anywhere else. Remember we are not talking about simple variations within kind, or type, but actual change away from that type -- the type of change on which another change, or mutation, can build so that something new is produced. We have never seen that happen.)))<br><br>Whatever the case, discussion between Creation vs Evolution will never end. You need faith to believe in creation. It is the same as for evolution cos it also cannot be proven.<br><br>Something for you to ponder over. Why is it that man always go to their god for help if they are desperate and helpless? My view is that all man are created by God and all man belong to God. There is a link between man and God. The spirit of man knows that there is an existence of a God in the world, only thing is that they do not know who is this God. In Christianity, God is our loving Father and we turn to our Father when we need help and comfort from Him. You may not believe now that there is a God, but your spirit will  search for it, if not now, maybe in future, whether Christianity, buddhism or Islam.<br><br>I am also not here to argue but to share if there is an opportunity. I respect other faith and religions, if not, I would have said that all gods are devils who come to deceive, right?.<br><br>Do you burn joss stick and pray to the dead at the wake? Just curious how an atheist show respect to the dead at the wake. No hard feelings, friend.<br><br>Anyway, have a nice day to you also.<br><br>Peace  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Raymond Chua<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Deu65<br><br>Apologies accepted. Anyway, no hard feelings on my part too.<br><br>The evolution which you posted are more in a class of mutation and not the classical ones first conceived by Darwin. Take for eg. a mouse was not a mouse in the first place. It evolved from single celled organism (similar to planktons in the oceans) into mouse millions of years later. The original starting point was a cell and not a mouse. Another eg, will perhaps be the primates. Primates came from mouse like creatures walking on all fours before evolving into bipedal primates which we see today. And of course from my point of view, human evolved from primates and not created out of nowhere.<br><br>You are right that it will be an endless debate between creation and evolution. Let's just hope that one day the truth will be discovered. Keep your faith and I will continue to uphold my scientific belief.<br><br>I am not too sure why man go to their god when they are desperate and helpless. Through my years of education and thirst for knowledge, I have come upon to rely on myself for answer when I am down in the dumps. I ask myself the usual things, who, what, when, where, why and how. From these, I then proceed to find a remedy for the situation I am in.<br><br>I do burn joss stick at a wake. Not praying though, rather more as a mark of respect, just trying to remember the things that in a way brought the deceased and I together. Also the burning of joss stick can be thought of as a form of respect for the deceased immediate family. Just like respecting the tradition of others. Nothing more nothing less. When a person passed away, the only thing that remains will be the memories and not afterlife as the majority of the people will be obssessed with.<br><br>Hope that answer part of your questions.
