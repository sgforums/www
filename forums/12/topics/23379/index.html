From Abraham onwards, he instructed his servant to find a wife for Isaac from his tribe. The servant found Rebecca. Then Jacob was told to go back to find a wife from his own tribe. He married Rachel. (But after being tricked into marrying Rachel's sister) All inside the book of Genesis.<br><br>The most famous verse in the New Testament that most Christians will use now is 2 Cor. 6:14 "Do not yoke with unbelievers..." The whole context is actually verses 13 to 15.<br><br>But we all know that God is not a God of rules but a God of grace. So naturally you will ask why? A lot of Christians leaders will just say obey the Word. But it's difficult to obey right? Well, you are not alone. But now if I tell you the rationale behind it, so that you can understand why God want it to be so for your own good. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> It will make it easier to obey Him. But to be truthful, obedient means without questioning.<br><br>- Unbelievers and believers do not have something in common. Verses 15. It is like a duck talking to a chicken. Misunderstanding usually bring about quarrel and to some cases, separation. You see value in going to church meetings, you see value in tithing to God, you see value in serving in ministry. They see you don't love or cherish them enough to want to spend time with them. They see you throwing money down the drain instead of spending on them.<br><br>- Unbelievers do not know agape love. "We love because he first loved us..." 1 John 4:19. But what is agape love, The highest form of love? Look at 1 Cor. 13:4-7 "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast. It is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. ... It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres." Now, do you want to be loved like this? To the unbelievers, they do not understand this kind of love that you know and can give. They will be surprised and shocked. I know. Now this kind of love never fails (verse <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">. So do you want to accept anything short of the love that never fails? You decide for yourself.<br><br>- The best foundation in a relationship is not to put your partner in the 1st place. Strange? But true! Nobody is perfect and everyone will fail. It's not fair to demand your partner to always not fail. They can't even if they wanted to. The same goes to you, it's unfair of you. The only perfect person to be in the 1st place is Jesus. They don't understand it.<br><br>- Believers undergo Satanic/spiritual attacks. Come on. If God is real, Satan is also real. But even if we do go thru' these attacks. We know who is the greater one. So we are not afraid. But for unbelievers, they are helpless. They can't call on the name of Jesus Christ to deliver them. Think of it. Like it or not, they are going to be different. They are going to get defeated. We live by faith. To believe in Him is already faith. We walk by faith. They can't. They give up.<br><br>- If you are a believer and you want your partner to be saved, you have to show them your firm stand. If you can compromise your God, they might even look down on you. But if you don't compromise, they began to wonder and may want to find out more about your God. So do not hinder their salvation.<br><br>So am I saying believers should not be with unbelievers? No. Everything is permissible but not everything is beneficial. The bible talks about it in 2 places. 1 Cor. 6:12 and 1 Cor. 10:23.<br><br>When you grow in Him and understand more about His grace, He will bless you and your family. Noah was the only righteous man but God spared his family in the great flood. Abraham was credited by God to be righteous and his family was blessed by God. Jacob was blessed by God, Rachael worship idols. But God didn't count it against her. Problem is not a lot of believers really grow in Him fast enough.<br><br>Christianity is not a religion. It's a relationship with God.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well said.... on humans relation with GOD.<br>But is the source of the Christian bible verified ?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> By who ? I am not doubting your Faith but the source<br>needs to be interrogated first.<br><br>We ,humans can regulate and then write them out too....<br><br><span style="color: darkblue;">Then y the break off from Roman Catholics in the 1st place?<br>Wasn't this the origins of Christianity's belief ?</span><br><br>It is written in the bible in a few places.<br><br>In the Old Testament, there are specific rules not to marry outside of the tribe. From Abraham onwards, he instructed his servant to find a wife for Isaac from his tribe. The servant found Rebecca. Then Jacob was told to go back to find a wife from his own tribe. He married Rachel. (But after being tricked into marrying Rachel's sister) All inside the book of Genesis.<br><span style="color: blue;"><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> is that y Christian leaders R allowed to get a wife ?</span><br><br>The most famous verse in the New Testament that most Christians will use now is 2 Cor. 6:14 "Do not yoke with unbelievers..." The whole context is actually verses 13 to 15.<br><br>But we all know that God is not a God of rules but a God of grace. So naturally you will ask why? A lot of Christians leaders will just say obey the Word. But it's difficult to obey right? Well, you are not alone. But now if I tell you the rationale behind it, so that you can understand why God want it to be so for your own good. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> It will make it easier to obey Him. But to be truthful, obedient means without questioning.<br><br>- Unbelievers and believers do not have something in common. Verses 15. It is like a duck talking to a chicken. Misunderstanding usually bring about quarrel and to some cases, separation. You see value in going to church meetings, you see value in tithing to God, you see value in serving in ministry. They see you don't love or cherish them enough to want to spend time with them. They see you throwing money down the drain instead of spending on them.<br><br>- Unbelievers do not know agape love.
