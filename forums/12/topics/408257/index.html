              <p>Get married lor.</p>
              <p>abuthen?</p>
              <p>Look on the bright side, below article has nothing whatsoever to do with you:</p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 29px; font-size: 18.3333px; color: #333333;">This newspaper story refers once again to "marriage rates dipping over the last decade" and "singles will be urged once again not to leave it to fate to find that special partner". Really I find these efforts hard to believe. Do they really think that anyone, including the super obedient compliant Singaporeans, would marry simply because the government wants them to!<br><br>And then there is even more astonishing stuff. It says "a new campaign will encourage people to be proactive about expanding their social circle- it's OK to do it though an agency- as well as moderate their expectations of Mr. or Miss Right". Believe it or not, the Singapore government is asking people to get married regardless of whether you fancy the woman or man! What will they say next, go marry a one-eyed woman because Lee Kuan Yew wants you to do it!<br><br>There is even more rubbish in it. There is even going to be a televised dating program. I don't know what surprises they have in mind this time; perhaps you chose a woman on the screen, and meet her the next day at MacRitchie Park. <br><br>I remember last time, they had another similarly idiotic matrimonial exercise. This was about a year ago, when men and women were lined up at Singapore subway rail station platforms who would spend a few minutes with the opposite sex inside the arriving trains with the Minister Iswaran standing on the platform to persuade them to propose and fall in love instantly. What was more shocking was that each man or woman was given only about 5 minutes to decide on his life partner! You could call it "Love at first sight on Singapore Rail", with the minster officiating as some sort of an instant matchmaker!<br><br>Obviously, it simply didn't work and like every other of these dictatorships harebrained ideas, was never heard of again. <br><br>And now this new nonsense. <br><br>The Singapore government has to understand, which I don't think they will, is this. Unless you permit citizen participation and dissenting voices in the island, Singaporeans are simply going to withdraw into their cocoons, where thy now are. They are not going to listen to you, not cooperate with you, not have babies, not marry and they will leave your island, and ultimately you will simply fail. <br><br>As long as you think you can talk down to your people and order them to do this and that and bully them into submission, you simply cannot earn their respect. And not earning their respect, you will have a disengaged population. And a disengaged population means that none of your policies would ever be successful. It is as simple as that. <br><br>And each time you write this nonsense in the Singapore press, Gopalan Nair and numerous other like minded Gopalan Nairs will criticize you, and Singaporeans will read it, and even more Singaporeans would decouple and completely refuse to have anything to do with you or your policies. <br><br>In the end, you will be left talking to yourself. And no one will hear. </span></p>
