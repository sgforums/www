              <p>Hi users,</p>
              <p>i just want to ask how do i confront my own people - Executive Student Councilors,  to stop trying to win over the post i am in; President. there are a total of <strong>11 Executive Student councilors</strong> which i need to handle and amongst many one always wants to have a higher post than she/he is because she/he is cadged from being in the top 3 which is the President, Vice-President, General Secretary. <strong>She is 23 years old </strong>carrying a post of Secretary while <strong>i am 17 years old</strong> carrying the position of President through an election in our school. Even though the position are officially entitled to us respectively. i can see in way or another she is trying to have a sole title of President in everyone's mind. How? - she stood up talking without stage fears even though i am there trying to talk when she intercepts. I was the one we made all rules clearly with no doubt and <strong>she ask me "Do you know what you are suppose to do?"</strong> Deep in my heart i know this girl is trying to act as a big shot. <strong>I said "Yes"</strong>. And i couldn't believe it when <strong>she replied back "good"</strong>. I was liek are you <strong>trying to act big in here?</strong> As a president i couldn't do anything to her because all 11 Executive Student Councilors are very close to each another thanks to team bonding activities organised by me and my VP. The question now is, she is 23 years old and i know she regretted 2 times in her life by repeating the same school. while i am just consistent throughout. <strong>so should i tell her right in the face if she should stop trying to act as a president or just be quiet and make even better commitments until she loses?</strong></p>

              <p>You should have said "of course!" and then counter: "what about you?". Put the ball in her court and you should always be in control, even if you're 6 years her junior. Having allies and trusted aides in the council is also very important.</p>
              <p>Anyway, you are the president and a high level of tolerance is paramount. There will be those few who are envious or unhappy about your position. Welcome to the game :)</p>

              <p>LOL good point. Just tell her to wait till you're gone then she can be the next president. She waited so long anyway, plus when she goes out to the society to work she can't expect to be president.</p>
              <p>The way you said ' executive student counsellors ' you made it sound like you're in jc (?). She retain until she now 23 years old? smlj. I go in army come out, go in come out 2 times already. </p>

              <p>As a President, you should have at least the aptitude to see her questions positively as nothing more than a mere concern.</p>
              <p>Unless you are suffering from fears and lack of security/confidence in your position, then I can understand where you are coming from.</p>
              <p>Either way, if you really need to address this concern and take it personal against your own secretary, then you should have her replaced as soon as possible or you should step down because you are lacking the required leadership capabilities to lead the Student Council.</p>
              <p>You can listen to what she have to say, but if you need to do what she tells you, then you are just digging a hole for yourself in the Student Council.</p>
              <p>Anything you don't understand, just ask. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>TS, how long were you or the rest be in that position? Till you graduate right? So, dont take it in heart. Let her be. You will be graduating soon...and working world is more important that this.</p>
              <p>And good thing you learn more than her in terms of bonding, team working, preparation. etc....that will come in handly when you start working.</p>
