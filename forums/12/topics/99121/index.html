            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Friends,<br><br>Please help me out with this problem I have. Last week I finally asked a girl out. I liked her for the past year. She is very popular in school, and is part of the student union. She is very friendly to everyone, and always has a smile on her face. When she agreed to go out with me, I was overjoyed. No words can describe that feeling.<br><br>We went out, and she asked me questions like.. If i had anyone I like right now. (Which I did not answer and tried to change topic). She was also very interested in finding out with kinda of girl I liked. She also told me about her personal life, and her experiences with her bf and why they broke up. She even made a joke about how she was going to marry me so that I can get a work permit in Taiwan, but I would have to pay her money for it. I believe that the date went extreamly well. She even called me 15 mins after I sent her home to check if I was all right.<br><br>I was over the moon. I thought that I might actually have a chance with this girl. My dreams were dashed these few days though. And i have no idea why. I went out with her last Saturday. On Monday she had to goto the doc's for a check up. I decided to give her a call to see how she was. This was the first call I made after that date. No one answered the phone, no one called me back. I send an SMS, and that wasn't replied either. I called her again on tuesday, and the same thing happened. No one answered the call. She didn't even call me back. I saw her on MSN later that day, and asked her out for dinner. She told me she don't feel comfortable going out on a weekday, and she had a test the next day. I said "okies, maybe the weekend then". She replied. "Yah.. proberly weekend la." Today, I sat on the bench near her class as i did for the past 2 months, waiting for her to pass by. She always passes by that corridor. But today, I saw her talking another route. I don't know if she is avoiding me.<br><br>Please help guys. I'm 22, never had a girlfriend, never had any experience chasing girls, and I really do not know how girls think. I mean. I thought that the date went pretty well, what happned!? not answering my calls and such. I'm so confused. Please help me and share your views! thx! I always have this naive dream that I will wait for a girl I truely love and give her my all. I have rejected alot of girls who are wonderful people, but I do not feel strongly for because of my dream. Is this really an impossible dream? I'm really so tired...  I know its a long read, and thanks for being patient enough to go through it.</div>

Why dunch you just talk to her and ask her how's she has been and that you were worried that she wasn't returning your calls. Just say it in a friendly manner... DUN BE DEMANDING, DUN BE ABUSIVE!<br><br>Ask her if she has watch any movies lately and maybe you can catch a movie over the weekend... *leave some hints* Be subtle... girls understand our body language very very well and pick up the hints very very easily.<br><br>I think its still quite uncertain whether she likes you after only 1 date... so give it time... dun be so anxious abt it... play it cool! = ) Unless, you want to take the fast track way of getting send her flowers? But, too fast lah... take it slow!<br><br>sk</div>

I wud suggest u go ask her. i know it is hard, but better to get it off as soon as possible. otherwise it wud torture u endlessly..<br><br>this happened to me too. in my case, it is the reverse. i m a girl. and i find it even difficult to ask him. in the end i tortured myself with more and more questions until i became so overwhelmed that I had to see counselling.<br><br>so yea, my advice is...ask. fast.<br><br>i.c.y</div>

Don't be anxious.. if you really want to find out wat really happen.. why not approach her directly.. true love are hard to come by.. You never been in r/s before.. be calm.. and steady.. She avoiding you.. maybe there might be a reason why.. You keep questioning yourself and you cant find any answers.. why not try asking her..<br><br>Like wat sk says.. be careful of the usage of words.. and the tone while talking to her... She's not your gf.. Now.. to her.. you may be jus a friend.. so out of concern.. you asking her how have she been these days.. Busy with school work?? Or is there any problems goin on.. maybe you could help.. this and that..<br><br>You should maybe try to understand and know more about her.. Dreams are not mostly impossible.. is whether you have the capital.. the determination.. the motivation.. the spirit to go for it anot.. If now you are already thinking of giving up jus because a small obstacles then you'll never ever get what you wan.. what you dream for.. Strive for it.. But of cos.. I'm not saying banging your head against without any planning or thinking ahead...<br><br>Right now.. you have to solve the current problem and break the barrier.. Take it easy.. It doesn't matter whether you are 22 or not.. got girlfriend before or not.. Jus move slow.. and find out what happen..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I'm think this student union is something like an activity or a club right?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Cyrel:</div><div class="quote_body">Dear Friends,<br><br>Please help me out with this problem I have. Last week I finally asked a girl out. I liked her for the past year. She is very popular in school, and is part of the student union. She is very friendly to everyone, and always has a smile on her face. When she agreed to go out with me, I was overjoyed. No words can describe that feeling.<br><br>We went out, and she asked me questions like.. If i had anyone I like right now. (Which I did not answer and tried to change topic). She was also very interested in finding out with kinda of girl I liked. She also told me about her personal life, and her experiences with her bf and why they broke up. She even made a joke about how she was going to marry me so that I can get a work permit in Taiwan, but I would have to pay her money for it. I believe that the date went extreamly well. She even called me 15 mins after I sent her home to check if I was all right.<br><br>I was over the moon. I thought that I might actually have a chance with this girl. My dreams were dashed these few days though. And i have no idea why. I went out with her last Saturday. On Monday she had to goto the doc's for a check up. I decided to give her a call to see how she was. This was the first call I made after that date. No one answered the phone, no one called me back. I send an SMS, and that wasn't replied either. I called her again on tuesday, and the same thing happened. No one answered the call. She didn't even call me back. I saw her on MSN later that day, and asked her out for dinner. She told me she don't feel comfortable going out on a weekday, and she had a test the next day. I said "okies, maybe the weekend then". She replied. "Yah.. proberly weekend la." Today, I sat on the bench near her class as i did for the past 2 months, waiting for her to pass by. She always passes by that corridor. But today, I saw her talking another route. I don't know if she is avoiding me.<br><br>Please help guys. I'm 22, never had a girlfriend, never had any experience chasing girls, and I really do not know how girls think. I mean. I thought that the date went pretty well, what happned!? not answering my calls and such. I'm so confused. Please help me and share your views! thx! I always have this naive dream that I will wait for a girl I truely love and give her my all. I have rejected alot of girls who are wonderful people, but I do not feel strongly for because of my dream. Is this really an impossible dream? I'm really so tired...  I know its a long read, and thanks for being patient enough to go through it. </div></blockquote>I think you need to get some thing straight first.. Going out on <strong>a </strong> "date" does not mean that you have "the chance" thingy.. DO NOT have a wrong impression when a girl agrees to go out with you.. To her.. YOU ARE JUST A FRIEND sort of thingy.. So don't be "too overjoyed" when she agreed to go out with you..<br><br>Telling you her life experience abt her ex and things, does not mean much also.. Did it not hit you that she may just feel comfortable talking that to you?? No more no less?? Its good that you called her after her appointment to see how she is.. A good way to show that you are concerned.. In my point of view, by not picking up your call and avoiding you even when in school, have 2 factors:<br><br>1) You are at the wrong place, the wrong time and she prefer to walk the other direction that day.. or<br>2) Someone whom you have told a secret have told her abt ur secret and she is avoiding you..<br><br>Don't be too sensitive in your thinking and feelings.. You are 22.. not 82.. You still have many chances to get yourself a bf.. Cheer up ya?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

And learn 2 important phrases from Men_@_arms guide to being a man 3rd edition;<br><br>1. "I am never dissappointed nor will i ever be"<br>2. "Shit happens"<br><br>Once u have grasped these 2 disciplines.. u will find it easy to not give a **** about girls with their weird behaviour, and u can concentrate on more productive activities.. like chasing other girls <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> AND u can take every relationship SLOW.<br><br>Because relationships are a matter of tug of war, just like the cold war. Think of Girls as the USSR or CCP, think of guys as the USA and its sphere of influence <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> that should make it easier.. go slow and think about each action and think about what they mean and think of possible counter actions..

But if you wan to step further into a relationship with her.. then i still think is better not to voice out your feelings for her first... You wan her to keep avoiding you.. and instead she might find you a "pest" to her?? Absolutely no!<br><br>You can move on with your life..
