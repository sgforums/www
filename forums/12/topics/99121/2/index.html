            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>being a member of the student union means that she gets to meet *alot* more people than you do. i can guarantee you that she has already seen every kind of guy. (ie. desperate guys, hot guys, cute guys, ugly guys, nice guys, shy guys, arseholes, idiots, etc.) <strong>do not</strong> bother to try pick-up lines, because someone has already tried that before you.<br><br>like i said, she has already seen every kind of guy in school. so if you want her to notice you, you have to make sure that you stand out from the crowd.<br><br>how do you do that? here are some tips:<br><br><span style="color: red;">#1 Confidence!</span><br><br>confidence is the essence of a man. the first thing you have to do is to like yourself as the person you are.<br><br>the best way to develop confidence is to put some effort into yourself. spend time building up the things that make you a unique person. what makes you stand-out from the rest of the world? why would she choose you over millions of other losers out there? focus on your strong points and support it at all times.<br><br><span style="color: red;">#2 Grooming!</span><br><br>it may sound unrelated, but it's the basic thing you should do. dress up and spend some time to pamper yourself on facial &amp; body care products. besides, when you look good, your confidence level will increase and more girls will pay attention to you. isn't that killing two birds with one stone? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> remember to be confident of your looks!<br><br>although girls may say that they don't care about looks, they actually do. who would like to go out with a guy who looks like a barbarian?<br><br><span style="color: red;">#3 Humor!</span><br><br>EVERY girl loves a humorous guy. that's something you can't change. And if you're a humorous, you're definitely an interesting guy.<br><br><span style="color: red;">#4 Dominance!</span><br><br>dominance is a reflection of self-confidence. dominance also means that you have control over yourself. don't be full of uncertainty and 'blurness' all the time! an example of dominance:<br><br>you: the Earth is round.<br><br>friend: IT IS FLAT. HOW CAN IT BE ROUND WHEN THE GROUND IS FLAT!!!<br><br>you: the textbook said so. the Earth is round!<br><br>friend: IT IS FLAT! I SAY FLAT MEANS FLAT!<br><br>you: want me to show you the text book? *shows paragraph from the text book*<br><br>friend: ......ok lor. you win.<br><br>don't let your friends take over your mind! your friends are not always right, YOU HAVE YOUR OWN BRAINS! remember, <strong>if you cannot command respect, you will never attract love.</strong><br><br><span style="color: red;">#5 Ambition!</span><br><br>as a man, you should not place your girlfriend as the top priority in life. there are other things in life that you should aim and achieve for! set a goal and work hard for it! believe me, she'll put this as one of the reasons as to why she likes you.<br><br>guys often think they need a girlfriend to have their life 'complete'. such men will only exude a great sense of desperation.<br><br>if you need other tips, you can try reading my other posts in AA. hope that helps! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thx guys for all ur replies!! I found them really informative!.. Well, soemthing else happened a few days ago. She is working part time at a food store in the student union too... I decided to get a sandwich from there one afternoon. She was the one who served me. Well I decided to try my luck again and asked her if she was busy this weekend. She replied that she has 2 midterms the following monday. After saying that, she also added that she is pretty nervous... Can't make the sandwich well.. I asked her for the reason why she was nervous, after smiling to me, she said that she added "ai xin" aka Love? i guess? into making the bread. I was smiling feeling really good... I saw her later in the day and comment that the sandwich was really good.. haha...<br><br>Now what puzzle me is that the next day she will act totally cool!~ cold... Its like bring me to heaven then dropping me back in hell again.. Literary!.. Can't really figure her out...<br><br>Question girls and guys... Will a girl flirt with a guy even though she knows that he is interested in her? I mean if she don't like the guy will she still do that!? I am very sure that she knows I'm intersted..

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Cyrel:</div><div class="quote_body">Dear Friends,<br><br>Please help me out with this problem I have. Last week I finally asked a girl out. I liked her for the past year. She is very popular in school, and is part of the student union. She is very friendly to everyone, and always has a smile on her face. When she agreed to go out with me, I was overjoyed. No words can describe that feeling.<br><br>We went out, and she asked me questions like.. If i had anyone I like right now. (Which I did not answer and tried to change topic). She was also very interested in finding out with kinda of girl I liked. She also told me about her personal life, and her experiences with her bf and why they broke up. She even made a joke about how she was going to marry me so that I can get a work permit in Taiwan, but I would have to pay her money for it. I believe that the date went extreamly well. She even called me 15 mins after I sent her home to check if I was all right.<br><br>I was over the moon. I thought that I might actually have a chance with this girl. My dreams were dashed these few days though. And i have no idea why. I went out with her last Saturday. On Monday she had to goto the doc's for a check up. I decided to give her a call to see how she was. This was the first call I made after that date. No one answered the phone, no one called me back. I send an SMS, and that wasn't replied either. I called her again on tuesday, and the same thing happened. No one answered the call. She didn't even call me back. I saw her on MSN later that day, and asked her out for dinner. She told me she don't feel comfortable going out on a weekday, and she had a test the next day. I said "okies, maybe the weekend then". She replied. "Yah.. proberly weekend la." Today, I sat on the bench near her class as i did for the past 2 months, waiting for her to pass by. She always passes by that corridor. But today, I saw her talking another route. I don't know if she is avoiding me.<br><br>Please help guys. I'm 22, never had a girlfriend, never had any experience chasing girls, and I really do not know how girls think. I mean. I thought that the date went pretty well, what happned!? not answering my calls and such. I'm so confused. Please help me and share your views! thx! I always have this naive dream that I will wait for a girl I truely love and give her my all. I have rejected alot of girls who are wonderful people, but I do not feel strongly for because of my dream. Is this really an impossible dream? I'm really so tired...  I know its a long read, and thanks for being patient enough to go through it. </div></blockquote>Girls are difficult to understand but you must not give up so easily. A guy need to have tactics and think-skin to win a girl's heart. Remember, Faint Hearts Does Not Win Fair Ladies. For your case, ask her directly. see if she got any problem that you can help? Erm... How come she avoided you after she went to see the doc?</div>
