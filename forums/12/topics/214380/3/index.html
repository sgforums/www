            <div class='col-md body'>On one drinks session with Tiffany.  Tiffany mentions that her marriage is on the rocks.  She was unhappy with her hubby on several issues (not realted to china woman).<br><br>I told her a bit on my story to make her feel better.<br><br>On a subsequent drink session, with some new guys.  I overheard Tiffany tells them that her marriage is on rocks.....But the reasons is  because of China Woman.<br><br>Now...I gave her the benefit of the doubt that she might have found out the China Woman problem within the 2 weeks from our earlier drinking session.<br><br>So I manage to check with her hubby. And her hubby replies is consistent.  Not China Woman problem.<br><br>While Tiffany has merely used my story to accentuate her problems, incoporating my stories to her life and trying to gain attention, pity and respect from others.<br><br>I cooled off from Tiffany a bit then, cos I was busy with work.  Next I know, she finally work out her frustrations with herself and has gone back with her hubby and now live happier.</div>
