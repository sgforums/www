            <div class='col-md body'>met one particular girl online... always as a guy trail her when she goes pub but claims to be a nice girl who likes to stay home type (yeah right - everyone can tell she's one cheongster). Then she attempted to get involved with a couple of the people she met. One of them she told the story she has a daughter and she is a single mother, the other she claimed to be pure/innocent never had r/s, and blah blah blah. Each person who be given a different story. After entanglements with some girls/guys, this mess of a person got involed with an Aussie. All I can say is good riddance to bad rubbish. Thank god there is a dumping ground in white country for women like this...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
