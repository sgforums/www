              <div class="content">I've been a hardcore gamer for as long as I can remember, and 
              I'm surrounded by a gaming community. (Right now, it's World of 
              Warcraft.)<br><br>Recently, I've been wanting to do some more meaningful stuff, 
              but it's just so hard; it's like starting life afresh. All the people I'm close 
              to now are avid gamers. <br><br>The rest of my friends from my school days, I've 
              lost contact with, since I was in a different 'clique' from them. My current 
              'clique' have been with me since secondary school, and they are by no means bad 
              people, but I just want to try living life differently. <br><br>Whenever I ask 
              them if they wanna hang out somewhere (or do something else in town or whatever), they just outright reject me and 
              question why I rather not join them for their raid, during which, I just give in and decide 
              to hang out with them online.<br><br>I liken this dilemma to a mid-life career 
              switch. What can I do to make this change easier? What can I do to maybe make 
              some new friends? What can I do to fix up my life? <br><br>Whatever I do, it's 
              probably going to be nearly impossible to find a group of friends whom I can 
              feel as close to as the people I mentioned earlier. They're really great mates, but I simply want to enter a new phase of life, and I don't know how or where to 
              start.</div>

              <p>I could've stopped gaming long ago. In fact, last year, I did try to stop. And I succeeded. But I soon discovered I had nothing much else to do, so I just started it up again. Simply put, I game when I get bored. And I get bored quite often indeed when I'm not gaming.</p>
              <p>Perhaps it's due in part to the community I'm in. Perhaps it's just that not much else interests me. I don't know.</p>

              <p>You should find a job, cuz once you have a job, it will take your attention away from gaming, and plus you also earn yourself money for things you can buy with your own money, and also contribute to family.</p>
              <p>You can still hang out with your friends in the weekends to catch up. But in weekdays, it would be more time spent on productive work, cuz in working in a job, you also learn more life experience, how to socialize with your colleagues and widen your circle of friends. :)</p>

              <p>Being a tutor doesn't mean you need know everything and get everything correct all the time. I myself been teaching tuition for over 2 yrs and there are times i am unsure or even provide the wrong answers at times but as long as its not too frequent and you do try your best, it shouldn't be too big an issue.</p>
              <p>Regarding student's results, tuition teachers are not always able to create miracles. The student also has to work hard etc so its good to maybe communicate with the parents so they know how their child is faring and some do understand that not doing well is their own child's fault for not practicing etc. Don't always put the blame on yourself.</p>
              <p>Trying everything for the 1st time is always hard but if you let that stop you, you will never try. The first time is always the hardest but not impossible. You just need to push yourself to do it.</p>
              <p>If you worry about army, i know of many NSF who gives tuition especially stayout personnels and none of them have been caught yet so don't worry about that.</p>
