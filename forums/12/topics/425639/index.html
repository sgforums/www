              <p>As a teenager during my secondary school days.. 1994, my classmates ganged up to bully me. I was the only person in my class from my primary school, I had no friends whatsoever. During the second week, the bullying began. It was not physical, but psychological.</p>
              <p>As we were going through puberty then, I was very sensitive already because I do not know what it meant when I had my first strand of pubic hair before entering Sec 1. Then my classmates started calling each other funny names, for me, they called me "Erector". i WAS VERY HURT, because when I asked around what the word meant, a female classmate told me it meant I had a big dick. I thought it was something shameful and disparaging, I did not know until NS that it was actually a compliment.</p>
              <p>But still, for the 3-4 years, I lived through sec school with that horrible nickname, and I had lots of problems coping with studies because of my classmates who would joke about my nickname, and shout loud at me across the corridor this name.</p>
              <p>Many years have passed, this year I am 29, and I still have phobia getting a girlfriend because I do not understand the giggles of some girl classmates and the nonchalance and ambivalance of other girl classmates back then... almost 15 years ago. Did they really believe what my male classmates teased me about? Will the name prevent me from having a girlfriend in future? A lot of uncertainty followed through me over the years. I had erection problems too, though in no uncertain fashion.</p>
              <p>I was most amused, when only in Jan 2011 that is two months ago, I went to visit a professional counsellor who, also a male few years older than me, I confided my history in. He did not urge me to see a psychiatrist, to him, it was a bad episode, but still, life goes on, and I am strong enough to do it.</p>
              <p>Well, since we have identified the problem, let's deal with it. We could work together.</p>
              <p>I would not like to reveal this to you, but the bloke who started this nickname for me almost 15 years ago, is now working at a gay pub, the last I heard, and he wears makeup and lipstick to work.</p>
              <p>Perhaps I will leave this post as it is, here, and let it be said that I mean no malice towards my classmates.. I just see myself and everybody as victims of .. I dunno what. Growing pains? Peer pressure?</p>
              <p>Biting the bullet sure sounds good, but if I have a fond piece of advice like today, find somebody to talk to. I was sure happy I talked to somebody two months ago, although nobody can untie our emotional problems other than myself.</p>

              <p>Hmm....</p>
              <p>So your problem is not having enough courage to get a girlfriend?</p>
              <p>Do not worry unclerexy, nicknames for your age are no big deal anymore, they may even be considered as childish especially...judging from the name you had. Furthermore, it is already so looong ago.</p>
              <p>I wouldnt not befriend someone just because his nickname is " Erector " or any variation of it.</p>
              <p>Ultimately it is the person's character which count.</p>
              <p>Gather your courage, let bygones be bygones, time to start getting your girlfriend!</p>
              <p>Good Luck :).</p>

              <p>I am a bit surprised that you still remember such school episodes and you assign them as the primary reason for you being unable to relate to females up until now when you are 29 years old.</p>
              <p>I think maybe they are not the reason. It may be a series of reasons, a series of small things which accumulate.</p>
              <p>If you feel good in talking and opening up, this is a good first step.</p>
              <p>The next step I urge you is to forget about the past and make small incremental changes now, such as talking more and befriending more females. Just start small and make gradual changes.</p>
              <p>After all, you are not 15 years old anymore so it's time to write another story for your current life.</p>
