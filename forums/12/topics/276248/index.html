Over of trust for his wife, he always didn't really check up the bill for the 3 cards.  As she always claim to have settled the bills already.<br><br>But around April this year, my cousin receive a call from 1 of the bank telling him about the bursting and unclear bills.  So now he found out he own the bank about 40k.  The wife did all this due to some hatred for him, and all this happen after a big row last year according to him.  (Some marital woes between them, which i am not sure)  Only know his wife and him plus family isn't in talking terms.<br><br>His wife didn't make any effort all this months to clear the bills.  Until recently she start to pay some of it.<br><br>Now my cousin do not trust her, but we are not very good in financial games. So need some advice to protect my cousin.  Can she do anything to my cousin like get him into bigger financial problem ?  Scare she might use his credit or name to loan $.. humh.. But my cousin has took back the sub-card already.<br><br>Anyone know of any risk ? </div></blockquote>That's what happens when men don't settle marital problems with the wifeys.<br><br>Anyway, your cousin is already doing damage control by taking back sub card.<br>Too bad it will only be temporary.<br><br>If she is bent on seeking revenge on your cousin.<br>Financially is only one way to skin the cat.<br><br>My suggestion is that your cousin try to settle the family dispute amicably with his wifey ASAP. No other way around it.<br><br>For a woman to exact such damages, she must have a lot of grievance in her right now.<br><br>I hope your cousin and his family didn't bully her.<br><br>As much as you want to help your cousin.<br>You really shouldn't play a part in his family drama.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The morale of story is very simple: Neither a lender or a borrower be.<br>Even between spouses. If both are working, keep financials separate - credit cards, bank accounts, personal property (priceless collections), etc.<br>The only thing spouses should share, apart from living under the same roof are: bed, toilets, sofas, mirrors, utensils!<br>Even handphone and laptop - don't share, hahahha!</div>
