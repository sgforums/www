              <p>I'm a fifteen year old teenager who recently moved here a few months ago from Dubai.</p>
              <p>Since then it's been quite obnoxious and absurd trying to adapt here, people are different from where I come from. Not trying to be racist or biased but people here disgust me, especially in school. A silly little error or misunderstanding can turn into a tremendous outbreak of fear and chaos that engulfed me to the point where I had to seek refuge in the counsellors room to prevent 'gangs' from mugging me or physically harming me.</p>
              <p>Plus not to mention how difficult it is to communicate to people in my school. Quite often I get a hang of 'Singlish' and easily decipher it. But, one instance that appalled me was when I was confronted by a Secondary 4 student that spoke in a horrified english where simple communication in asking him to speak clearly placed him into a flit of rage. Plus others are quite full of themselves that I'd rather not make much friends in school with the exception of students like me.</p>
              <p>I would just like a plethora of tips and advice to help me cope with school and people here. Especially with 'gangs' going on that I'd wish to avoid as greatly as possible. From others I've heard that life will adjust and go up once you're in Poly or JC? Especially when you're doing NS?</p>
              <p>P.s                                                                                                                                                     Not trying to be racist here especially Biased.</p>

              <p>Hi Frozenchocolate,</p>
              <p>I can totally understand how you feel. Although I'm local born but I do have my fair share of gangsterism.</p>
              <p>When I was in school, I was always bullied by the ''elite'' gang. Their parants are rich F and they got the money to buy all the good stuffs. They could buy air jordan shoes and nike bags while I could only afford china brands. My school bag was bot from the local wet market. Sorri but that was in the late 80s to mid 90s.</p>
              <p>Then came my NS(try it, its quite fun really), my platoon was divided into the the poly gang, Air level gang and the hokkien pengs gangs.</p>
              <p>Then when I work outside also got gang like the msian PR gang.</p>
              <p>Now, I work out in the gym. There, we also have old man gangs, pino gangs, msian beng gang, Singapore poly gang, etc, etc, the list could go on and on.</p>
              <p>The thing is you can choose to come here, and you must bear with those gangs or tell your parents to settle elsewhere. For me, I just F care those gangs and go gym do my workout. No gangsters there would dare mess around with me now becaused I'm now quited jacked.</p>
              <p>Hang around and see how you like it. I admit we dun really welcome foreigners now bcause our country is too crowded, just stay low be courteous and nothing much will happen.</p>
              <p>Good luck.</p>
