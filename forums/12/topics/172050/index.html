            <div class='col-md body'>first, i think both of you shld be quite young right? Are both of you going to the same country to study?<br>Anyway, if she really insists on breaking, i think you shld give her some breathing space first, and takes things slower. Of cse not totally give her up, but not to rush her, if you know what i mean. Stop pressuring her, and give her more problems besides her family and whatever.<br><br>If you can, take this 2006 to build up a strong foundations, so that she will realise distant might not be a problem. But if she really wans to break, then i think you shld look for other trees. Loving a person, can be making he/she happy in whatever he/she does.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IMHO, those things u've said are really childish. It does not equate to love. It is plain stalking. U know u've gone deep cause there are things you would do for her only her. But doing things without thinking is another story altogether. neither is suicide e deepest love. its e dumbest it can ever be. life still goes on with or without you. its e how much u are willing give and risk for a person. i guess.</div>
