            <div class='col-md body'>A friend of mine is in trouble. Hope anyone who knows anything with regards to the topic can help me out a bit... Even advices also can... 'Dark', obvious or anything... Just wish to gather more information...<br><br>This friend of mine is from Malaysian. She works in Singapore. She mentioned that there were routine 'urine-testing' at the causeway and she had been for some of them...<br><br>Recently, the authority has decided to charge her for 'drug-taking' from their 'urine check'. But the somehow funny part is... Why only 3 months after the incident? Though she holds a past record, but she firmly insisted that she no longer take drugs... There wasn't much of any opportunity for appeal, and she suspect it might be a 'set up'.<br><br>Any sober and more well-informed being would like to add some 'light' to this?<br><br>Thanks in advance..</div>
