              <p><br> It is not important. I am just setting a challenge for myself.</p>
              <p>Otherwise my life feels pretty empty. I do tutor children in the
              afternoon at times, and less often in the evening, but I just feel
              that something is missing.</p>
              <p>Well, I don't crap in every threads, I spam "legally" mostly in
              leonard's thread, which should be obvious in the chit chat
              forum.</p>

              <p>You won't gain friends by staying at home and waiting to be asked out. When you start your course, try to find a CCA of interest and join it to increase your social circle. Learn to take initiative as well if not how get girlfriend?</p>

              <p>Sounds abit introvert sort of personality which is rather surprising that you would choose a teaching job since that involves alot of interaction with your students as well as other teachers to get your work done.</p>
              <p>Everyone will have their small circle of close friends but most will still have a larger circle of normal chit chat, hang out friends to pass time etc.</p>
              <p>Don't always wait for people, if you know where the problem in you lies, why not try to change and improve your social skills? 4 yrs in NIE would be damn boring if you don't intend to mix around and just stick to yourself</p>

              <p>I choosen a teaching career because I want to try to change the next generation, and I can get along well with others, just that for some reasons I am not as free to hang out with others like most people are.</p>
              <p>I am very happy to have found this place for me to crap about, and I don't like bothering others unnecessarily.</p>
              <p>I am not interested in turning myself into those over-friendly guys who will say hi around the place, and will much prefer to keep it to myself.</p>
              <p>Btw, it is 2 years in NIE, and another 2 in NTU. Don't worry about me getting bored, if I can easily amuse myself by boosting post count, there is very little which I cannot do to entertain myself.</p>
