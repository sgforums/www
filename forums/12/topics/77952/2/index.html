Well real men refrain from vulgarities. It proves nothing except make others think poorly of you.<br><br>Well take it as a lesson learnt in life and you have to move on from there. Women don't want a man who sprews vulgarities and obnoxious remarks all day. If they stick with a man like this, its more for sentimental value rather than love.</div>

(when you are very confused)<br>you farking suck! (to show the seriousness of something, in this case you suckiness)<br>go and fark yourself! (if you want someone to leave you alone)<br>I'm farked!

Don't get me wrong: nobody is saying that you shouldn't do what a decent boyfriend should do - but <strong>are we and should we be expecting anything from what we have done</strong>?<br><br>Your anger is trigger because she has indirectly hurt and strip bare the vulnerable side of yourself and your ego. You got defensive and hurl words that you didn't bother to fine-tune, not knowing that the more you do that - it speaks more about your emotional picture - a badly burn person trying to shun out aids and hids himself in a corner.<br><br>Why anger? Why blood boiling? You think love is like studying - When I know I am did my studying, I am sure to pass?
