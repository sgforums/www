            <div class='col-md body'><p>I am a 2nd year poly student and I am soo sad of my life like I just feel soo lonely. I do have friends in my small poly class of my own but they often talked among themselves cause we dont share the same interest and common tongue( I am not singaporean). I started joining two ccas this year while I join none in year 1 cause I followed my poly frens. In one of my cca is when I found really nice friends but we are still yet to be close and another cca which I have passion in it. Many gurls compliment my looks and say things like I am like one of those popular girls u see on instagram in which I am like the complete opposite. I envy those pretty gurls with great social life, take nice pictures and post on instagram. In my entire life, I only had one best friend whom I known in primary school and whom I stay in touch almost everday and thats about it. I had dramas in secondary school which has a lot of back-stabbing and I am always unlucky at friends where I meet the wrong type of people. My parents are strict on my social media and refused to let me use twitter n instagram till I was 18. Even during holidays I worked my ass off and rarely hang out at all, my relatives are also not in singapore. I am turning 19 and I really want to go out there and live life, hanging out with genuine people, partying and having fun. I just feel like my life is grey , dark and hollow . I recently broke up with my 7 months boyfriend whom failed me deeply by not treating me right and causing me to lose my friends.  I am looking to dance classes and photography so if u guys have any ideas? I really want to know where to meet friends- real friends.</p></div>
