            <div class='col-md body'>I feel that my parents are going to divorce each other soon.. they always had quarrels and my mum had given up on my dad.. My dad cheated on my mum 4 times or maybe more with women outside.. mostly are china sluts (i hate them now and my dad) And whenever my dad is facing money woes, he'll exert his authorities on the family.. all kids and mum will be scolded for nothing.. he pratically brings out anything to nag then scold.. it's damn fking lame.. and he will say why not i(my dad) die, then everything will be settled.. and he sometimes can say things like when i die, i'll not allow anyone of us to live, we'll all die together.. 'Hello, u want to die is ur own business, u dun own my life!' He's the kind of not educated person and a rough person, think he might really do stupid things.. And my family is facing bankruptcy soon, so mum told dad: "after this(bankruptcy), we're over also. But u have to promise me u'll comple the kid's education".. and my dad is somehow a very irresponsible guy, he said if my mum dun care abt the family already, he also gives up.. Now, i'm damn sad already la.. I hate my dad.. My mum suffered too long already, i think divorcing that guy would be better too.. About the threatening of dieing and killing stuffs, can he be convicted by law making these remarks?</div>

At most given some warnings?<br><br>Should your family finds it threatening from him, maybe can proceeding with separation 1st?<br><br>How old are you by the way? Your parents? What are they working as? How about your occupation? Any siblings?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Roxy<br><br>My advise is to get yourself a government family counsel.  I believe there are some government family counsel that will able to help you in your sitution.  By doing so, you are also putting you and your family one step closer to safety.  And get ready for any possible violents.  Once you sense one, tell your counsel about it, that way they may able to put some legal action on your father.<br><br>Regards<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Roxy_Gurl:</div><div class="quote_body">I feel that my parents are going to divorce each other soon.. they always had quarrels and my mum had given up on my dad..
