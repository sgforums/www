              <p>Calling her everyday is too much lah. You are too predictable, so this is a very boring long distance relationship.</p>
              <p>Call her on random days lah. </p>
              <p>Sometimes send her a small present in the mail. But don't do it too often lah. A small surprise is better than always a ritual.</p>
              <p>Long distance relationship what's there to fight about ?</p>
              <p>You are a guy, even if you think you are right, you don't have to force her to accept you are right. So what if you are always right ?.. you are indirectly telling her that she very stupid that's why she is always wrong lah !!</p>
              <p>Would you rather be right or do you prefer to still have a gf ?</p>
              <p>A relationship needs something to look forward to. You got plan to go visit her or not ? What are your plans in the next one year ? If you got no plans no idea, then a long distance relationship loses it's purpose.</p>

              <p>Everyone will have a bad day now and then. She has a bad day already, and there is nowhere for her to vent her frustration. That is why when you called her, she is noticably irritated, as she is trying to keep her cool and stop herself from directing her anger at you.</p>

              <p>You trying too hard to be a mystery man lah. Mystery at moderation is romantic. Mystery overdone is IRRITATING.</p>
              <p>Surprise visit and overseas holiday ? That means she don't know you will be visiting lah, then how is she suppose to plan for it and look forward to it ?</p>
              <p>She can start the fight, but you don't have to join the argument. Women are sensitive creatures, the more senseless things you say, the more reason for her to get upset with you. Learn to stay out of the line of fire.</p>
              <p>Next year is next year.. many months away. Relationship must be worked on today, not tomorrow, not next year.</p>
              <p>Woman's love is like a flower that needs constant nurturing ( to grow) and admiration ( to feel wanted).</p>
              <p>Do you water your flower every half a year ?</p>

              <p>I had a long dist. for 5 years before getting married - now have 2 kids with her. There were ups and down, 300-400 dollar phone bills every month, once a year come back, half a year she would fly over, once broke up, once tried seeing other people, in the end we got back together and we got married. Nowadays you have Skype which is so much easier and cheaper.</p>
              <p>LDR only works out on a few conditions - low level social life - ie.. she only goes out with girls - I only hang out out with guys. And staying with parents or family. They keep you kind of accountable. It easily falls apart if someone is staying in a hostel or constantly hanging out with all sorts of people.</p>

              <p>i guess it must happen at the right place and a right time. imagine if you are a teenager, i dun think one is able to afford the 300 - 400 dollar bill every month &gt;.&lt;</p>
              <p>it's difficult but it's possible coz it happens to some people.</p>
              <p>I agree with jojobeach. woman's love is like a flower need constand nurturing and admiration to grow and feel wanted. long distance relationship sometimes is hard to provide that.</p>

              <p>that one day early surprise is nothing short of a rude gesture.</p>
              <p>Do you expect her to drop everything she is doing on 12 dec to receive your sudden arrival ? She may be your gf, but she also has a life other than waiting at home for you everyday. If my bf do this to me, I will be irritated as hell.</p>
              <p>Don't ruin a good reunion with your thoughtlessness.</p>
              <p>Indonesia is only 1 hour flight away. Why do you have to wait so many months to go visit her ? Are you a miser of some sort ?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Skype is very cheap... you can buy any headset with a microphone piece and start chatting. You can call their phone directly, or even cheaper is to talk free just over IP, ie. without phone charges. Depending on the speed of the internet in her town, sometimes the connection is not so good, but you'll learn to adopt to the pace of conversation. However, the important question is can't she come over to join you or vice versa? Is it career, education or whatever is stopping both from being with each other? Do consider this... how long have you known each other? if it is already a long time, perhaps you'd consider marriage?</p></div>
