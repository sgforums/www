              <p>The most important factor in a long-term relationship is commitment.</p>
              <p>If the two of you are not committed to each other, small arguments can easily turn into big ones, and eventually ruin your relationship.</p>
              <p>Putting that aside, maybe one of you should take a step back. When it comes to relationships, there is rarely right or wrong things, it is just about how each of you look at the same matter.</p>
              <p>Positive communication is a must in a long distance relationship, it is the only thing that bridges the two of you together. If you let it breaks down, so will your relationship.</p>

              <p>You treat it the same way you would a normal relationship. It's normal for people to multitask these days. Perhaps what's needed is a fraction more space, or otherwise assurance that you're still interested.</p>
              <p>If gestures and words feel empty or routine to you, they will definitely come across that way to the other party. Do you use the webcam sometimes?It helps when you can see each other and when your body language is visible.</p>

              <p>Then you need to keep your frustration in check. Six months may not be such an important milestone to her, or she may even be as expressive or romantic as you hope she is.</p>

              <p>Do you have any ideas what she would be interested to talk with you about?</p>
              <p>You can't just call her and randomly pop out a topic, neither should you call her every night just to ask how she is. She might find you annoying this way, especially if she already has a bad day.</p>
              <p>When you call her, be patient and listen to all her complaints and the things which she has to say. Sometimes the best thing to do is to do nothing but to listen.</p>

              <p>Calling her everyday is too much lah. You are too predictable, so this is a very boring long distance relationship.</p>
              <p>Call her on random days lah. </p>
              <p>Sometimes send her a small present in the mail. But don't do it too often lah. A small surprise is better than always a ritual.</p>
              <p>Long distance relationship what's there to fight about ?</p>
              <p>You are a guy, even if you think you are right, you don't have to force her to accept you are right. So what if you are always right ?.. you are indirectly telling her that she very stupid that's why she is always wrong lah !!</p>
              <p>Would you rather be right or do you prefer to still have a gf ?</p>
              <p>A relationship needs something to look forward to. You got plan to go visit her or not ? What are your plans in the next one year ? If you got no plans no idea, then a long distance relationship loses it's purpose.</p>
