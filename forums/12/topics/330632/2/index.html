              <p><br> Oh pls.... I am no Bitch like you... You have not even been reading
                  properly...</p>
              <p>1st of all, my bro will not just go and bang anyone before
                  marriage and it's NOT HIS choice to be married, it's my MUM's... Y?
                  Cause my mum despo my bro over 30 havent married... My bro has
                  been hinting that he doesnt wanna get married, but due to his guilt
                  for his past mistakes, he just didnt persist when my mum dismisses
                  it... Yea it's his choice all right...</p>
              <p>And since you have not been reading properly, since when did I
                  bitch around about her? You said I did... i mentioned to my mum
                  that I DIDNT LIKE LISTENING to my mum talking about that indo bitch
                  talking bad behind her own mum's back...</p>
              <p>Your situation and mine are different... For you your situation
                  is bad, since it is YOUR fault, for me, there's nothing really I
                  could do...</p>
              <p>Choosing that Indo Bitch over me is wrong, not because of
                  kinship because wat she is doing is wrong... It's about loyalty...
                  If that Indo Bitch can talk behind her own mum that way, when she
                  marries into the family, hell knows what she could do...</p>
              <p>You dont even know what's going on and you linking my case to
                  your own sad story? How dumb can you be?</p>
              <p>so buzz off and find someone else to rid your guilt bitch...</p>
              </div>

              <p>Sure.. you're not a bitch ? Or its just everyone else are bitch except you ?</p>
              <p>OK. Good to know there's really not much you can do except to come to SGF and bitch about that bitch.</p>
              <p>So you think your mother should side with you just because you're her dotter ? LOL..how lame.</p>
              <p>And what do you expect your mother to do if she DO side with you ?</p>
              <p>Kick that bitch out of the family ? That's what you really want don't ya ?</p>
              <p>And in the end.. will you finally be happy ?</p>
              <p>If all you care about is YOUR own happiness. then.. sad to say.. you're nothing but a pathetic bitch yourself.. no ?</p>
              <p>I feel sorry for your brother to have such a selfish little brat sister. My sincerest condolence.</p>

              <p>Yes I also feel sorry for my dead nephew/niece. That was really regretful. I wished I wasn't so wilful back then. If I had known earlier I woulda kept my mouth shut. After all it's his future and his family.</p>
              <p>I don't see why you need to make her complaining about her family such a big deal. I suppose you must be so deperate to find some fault in that woman.. so you can cause a rift.</p>
              <p>Every family has it's own problem.. maybe that woman couldn't get along with her own family. But it does not means she will not get along with your family.</p>
              <p>Maybe she feels your mother is a understanding person , thus she feels that she can be open about her family problem to your mother.</p>
              <p>Using her weakness to stab her in the back is already ethically wrong on your part.</p>
              <p>2 wrong does not make one right.</p>
              <p>I think it's time you live and let live.</p>
              <p>After all .. she will be the one sleeping beside your brother.. and she will be the one to carry your brother's baby.</p>
              <p>She has done you no wrong. So it's time to let bygone be bygone.</p>
              <p>A family rift is one that is hard to be undone.</p>

              <p>Yes I also feel sorry for my dead nephew/niece. That was really regretful. I wished I wasn't so wilful back then. If I had known earlier I woulda kept my mouth shut. After all it's his future and his family.</p>
              <p>I don't see why you need to make her complaining about her family such a big deal. I suppose you must be so deperate to find some fault in that woman.. so you can cause a rift.</p>
              <p>Every family has it's own problem.. maybe that woman couldn't get along with her own family. But it does not means she will not get along with your family.</p>
              <p>Maybe she feels your mother is a understanding person , thus she feels that she can be open about her family problem to your mother.</p>
              <p>Using her weakness to stab her in the back is already ethically wrong on your part.</p>
              <p>2 wrong does not make one right.</p>
              <p>I think it's time you live and let live.</p>
              <p>After all .. she will be the one sleeping beside your brother.. and she will be the one to carry your brother's baby.</p>
              <p>She has done you no wrong. So it's time to let bygone be bygone.</p>
              <p>A family rift is one that is hard to be undone.</p>

              <p>This is family we are talking about... It's not like my bro and her meet and date each other first than wanna get married...

              <p>What family problems is she talking about with my mum... It's not like she fought with her mum and seek some consolement in my my mum... It's practically bitching about her own mum... Look at what my mum's wearing, so old nia nia nia...</p>
              <p>Why would I want to cause a rift? Doesnt make any sense...</p>
              <p>Since you have not been reading the 1st post, let me assure you that bitching about her mum is not the only bad factor she has... GO read up the 1st post before you anyhow pin point fingers at others...</p>
              <p>I hope she doesnt get married into the family... For my family's sake and her sake... For my family, I dont want any indo drama(since her family is very dramatic), and for her sake, hope that my brother doesnt physically abuse her since he is now already verbally abusing her...

              <p>Actually I did read through your 1st post.</p>
              <p>Other than childish nick picking.. there's really not much substance to your complains about this woman.</p>
              <p>The first impression I get.. was you are resentful towards that woman and blames her for your demotion in your family standing.</p>
              <p>Falling out of favor has nothing to do with her behavior.. rather .. it has much to do about how you handle or react towards your family.</p>
              <p>Your brother is already 32.. if he fails to find another woman , are you going to remain single and take care of him until he dies ?</p>
              <p>Your mother is probably not young either.. she has dreams and hopes to become a grandmother soon. If she cannot fulfill her dreams through your brother. are you going to give her grandchildren on your own ?</p>
              <p>Both family must consent to a marriage arrangement. If your brother and parents don't agree to this union.. no matter how hard they push.. it will not happen.</p>
              <p>Please stop insulting your brother's intellect and integrity with your wilful thoughts. He is old enough to make his own life decision.</p>
              <p>If one day you decides to marry a guy.. and your family objects, are you going to dump him for your family sake ?</p>
