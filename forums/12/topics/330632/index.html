            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>the story from beginning:</p>
              <p>My bro is engaged to this indonesia girl which was match maked my my mum... My bro was engaged once with another sg girl but broke off... My bro always accidentally call this indo girl his sg girlfriend name... He hinted that he got sg gf... But my mum would be angry and say pity this indo girl, she did so much for us... When I mean did so much, it means that she always buy stuff for us... But I feel it's like bribing us to like her...</p>
              <p>Initially, I liked this indo girl... Now, I hate her to the core... Here's why:</p>
              <p>1. She framed my godsister of trying to break up my bro and her... Initially I believed her, then suddenly her whole family starts to get involved and say unkind stuff about my god sister like sms never reply, avoiding etc... One thing that gave it away was when this indo girl tried to gain sympathy vote from me by saying my god sister is so mean to her in the most 'baby-like' way... I did ask my god sister of this matter and she was in total shocked... My god sister did sms her, but she never replied back...</p>
              <p>2. BTW, she's in m'sia... When my mum ask her to buy clothes for me and my sis in Indo(which we will pay), instead of saying "I'll see if have" she will say "Oh, don't have anymore"... How would she know? Is she the inventory manager of the whole clothing line in indonesia?</p>
              <p>3. My sister and I are genetically prettier than her... She would look at us a weird way...</p>
              <p>4. She always claimed that ppl are jealous of her beauty... And that m'sia and sg in jealous of Indonesia? for real?</p>
              <p>5. One time she called me up just to see if my bro is at home... Talk about trust issues... </p>
              <p>6. When my bro ignores her msg es, she would complain to my mum that my bro ignore her and that he has changed... She would expect my mum to tell my bro that and hopefully that he would change because my mum talked to him about the matter... If you are in his place, what would you feel...</p>
              <p>7. She loves to exagerate... One time, I merely mentioned that I would love to get a belly button pierce as we passed a piece shop... The next week, I seeked my mum's approval for it... Being very conservative, my mum said no... Of course I pleaded but to no avail...</p>
              <p>This was witness by my sis... My mum then say "You see, ****** wants to get a belly button piercing"... She replied that the week before I was also begging her to get a belly button pierce... WTF!!!</p>
              <p>8. This is the most that I hate about her... Yes, her mum's a b!tch... But everytime she fought with her mum about something, she would complain to my mum... Not just that, she talks behind her mum's back! Her mum does like wearing 20 yr old clothing and her character sucks big time... Even so, that's her mother... Her own mother, how can she talk behind her mother to my mother in a way of no respect? Such loyalty?</p>
              <p>9. One more thing, I hate going to JB... It's freaking hot there and there's nothing much to do... When I didnt come for a long time, that Foreign B!tch would ask, "you don't like me is it?"...</p>
              <p>10. When ANY guy tries and flirt, she flirts back... Even the really fugly ones... Talk about being cheap...</p>
              <p>The one thing i feel betrayed is about is my mum... She is like in love with this foreign B!tch!!! When my bro JUST met her, my mum said it was love at 1st sight...</p>
              <p>I told my mum that I didn't like this indo B!tch... But I told her it's because of reason no.8... Didnt mention the rest... but I did told her there's more, just didnt explore it in detail...</p>
              <p>A few days back, she kept mentioning her name... And esp. about that indo B!tch complaining to my mum about her mother... I hate it when such trust between mother and daughter is exploited... I confronted her about such attitute... She said that she has no one to turn to... Oh please, she has her aunts who also hates her mum... She has my bro... Of all ppl, my mum?</p>
              <p>And then my mum starts muttering and gave me the cold shoulder(feels like kana stab in the heart)... And I confronted again and say that she's being like this because I don't like that Indo B!tch... And thus with such un agreement, how can she stay with me? What bull? She always likes to play the 'I don't want to live with you' card... And I finally said, 'OK'...</p>
              <p>Then she started to 'bring back' old promises such as when I was 14, which I promised to take care for the house in JB... I am 23 now, of course I have different commitment and goals now than when I was 14... Still wanna play that card???</p>
              <p>Till now, I feel that i cannot forgive her... It really shows her loyalty... She would prefer taking the side of some outsider than her own daughter? And mind you, I don't like the Indo B!tch, not in conflict and my mum's already like this...</p>
              <p>I really feel betrayed and damned pissed!!!</p>
              <p>And my mum did mention to that Indo B!tch if it would be ok if my parents live with them after her marriage to my bro, and she said yes, but her face like don't want like that...</p>

              <p>It appears u have sufficient reasons with facts to think that she is not a good addition into the family, however, u just seem to have no weight, Why not discuss with ur bro , the last thing u want is hell on earth.. and in ur house.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately parents will always bring up the old shit because they remember. My parents also always bring it up. Something i promised when real young but those things can be solved with alternative means of achieving ur goals and still stay commited.</p>
              <p>Anyways , feel better liaw after writing it all out ? lol! <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Blue/satisfied.png" alt="satisfied.png"></p>

              <p>How old is your brother, if you don't mind me asking?  I believe your brother should really think twice before marrying this girl.  Loving your mum is one thing but certain things he shouldn't let others to decide for him.  He will be the one who has to spend the rest of his life with her, not you or your mum. </p>

              <p>At the end of the day, it's your brother's own decision.  If he doesn't want to stand up to your mum himself, there's nothing you can do about it.</p>

              <p>You can only do so much and make yourself heard.  If your brother and mum still want to go ahead with that decision, just stay away from it and move forward with your own life. </p>
              <p>At the end of the day, it's your brother's own decision.  If he doesn't want to stand up to your mum himself, there's nothing you can do about it.</p>

              <p>That indo bitch  bitches about her mum with someone that her mum knows, a close friend, just to gain a little sympathy to push the wedding date closer...</p>
              <p>I 'bitch' about my mum? really? I feel betrayed by her since she choose and outsider over me, her own daughter... Is that bitching about my mother? That indo bitch, really talk back behind her own mother's back and it is not just complaining about her mum...</p>
              <p>I thought that a bitch like you would understand the difference... Oh well...</p>
              <p>and no, we are not a bunch of bitches... If you declare and demean yourself as a bitch, then go ahead... I have self-respect in myself not to put myself in such a low position as you have...</p>
              <p>Why are you so worked up on this case? Unless you are in the same position as that Indo bitch... What should I say, real bitches think alike...</p>

              <p>No bitch.. because I was a bitch like you before.</p>
              <p>I bitched about my older brother's choice of partners. I was a trouble maker and caused his breakup with his love one.</p>
              <p>Then after that I found out that woman was pregnant with his child.. and had to abort the baby because the marriage fell through.</p>
              <p>I'm just telling you.. you need to keep your nose out of his relationship. Because it's his life and if your mother supports his choice.. then so be it.</p>
              <p>Your bitching only brand you as the trouble maker. so why should anyone listen to you ?</p>
              <p>Just because you are the daughter doesn't mean your mother should side with you.</p>
              <p>No, his life is not your life. And your meddling with his life is uncalled for.</p>

              <p><br>Oh pls.... I am no Bitch like you... You have not even been reading properly...</p>
              <p>1st of all, my bro will not just go and bang anyone before marriage and it's NOT HIS choice to be married, it's my MUM's... Y? Cause my mum despo my bro over 30 havent married... My bro has been hinting that he doesnt wanna get married, but due to his guilt for his past mistakes, he just didnt persist when my mum dismisses it... Yea it's his choice all right...</p>
              <p>And since you have not been reading properly, since when did I bitch around about her? You said I did... i mentioned to my mum that I DIDNT LIKE LISTENING to my mum talking about that indo bitch talking bad behind her own mum's back...</p>
              <p>Your situation and mine are different... For you your situation is bad, since it is YOUR fault, for me, there's nothing really I could do...</p>
              <p>Choosing that Indo Bitch over me is wrong, not because of kinship because wat she is doing is wrong... It's about loyalty... If that Indo Bitch can talk behind her own mum that way, when she marries into the family, hell knows what she could do...</p>
              <p>You dont even know what's going on and you linking my case to your own sad story? How dumb can you be?</p>
              <p>so buzz off and find someone else to rid your guilt bitch...</p>

              <p>Nuts. If we are all bitches then you should change ur name to "<span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>jojoBITCH</strong></span>"</p>
              <p>edit: everytime a thread starts its inevitable to expect more bitching from other people rather than the useful advice you're looking for.</p>
