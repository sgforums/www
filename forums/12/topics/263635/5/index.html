Hell its not even possible unless he himself wants to. I smoked since 13 till 24. I just quit cigarette since last december n havent smoked ever since... except.. the good shiet.<br><br>My point is... for those that say he dun love u if he doesnt quit , or why he quit and now smoke again , its simple. When a guy wants a girl , he will do whatever it is to please her e.g stop smoking. N most of them time after they got the girl..  they smoke again due to stress la..etc etc n tries to bring in an understanding of why he smokes. hell i did it..  when i wanted to chase my this ex.<br><br>In my circle of ppls that drink , happy, clubs , pubs whatever.. as long as its legal illegal n involves drugs n alchohol.. i only know of 1 person who doesnt smoke. ...1 only.... since the day he was born.<br><br>Amen.<br><br></div>

Sometimes when we woo girls , come on.. we are not exactly truthful. Of course we show u girls what u want to see. I bet u most guys do it.. how u think we can manage to woo you girls ar.. But there are some cases which they are sincere.. very n extremely sincere. So thats why for ur case , its like that ah.Or he may be trying to convey the rebellious attitude to you through smoking cigarettes and letting u know he stress or not happy lo. It can be anything. N smoetimes its sub-conscious . So best think maybe u talk to him n try to understand why he did it lo. N having him explain n say it out he may even think about wat he said , if not now.. years later how stupid it was lo.<br><br>Some ppl make respond different to situations differently. For me ,  i just suddenly stopped smoking i dunno why. Maybe because one day i was so sick.. never been so sick in my entire life.. bed ridden.. i have always able to work even sick off my nuts, n that was so bad that i could only lie in the bed and think about what i have done , n that how smoking has really almost killed me.<br><br>Maybe if his mum or dad suddenly dies of lung cancer because of smoke or second smoke then he will change. So for everyone it may be a different case and a different reason. Just be there n slowly guide him. Just dont force the issue too much lo. If he u marry him , make sure he buy health n life insurance. U be claiming the moolah sooner then u think.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
