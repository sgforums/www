            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Rau, I can understand how you feel and sometimes it feels like there's nothing wrong with loving someone. It's good that you can think that you are rushing into anything. As everyone has been trying to put the point across to you, take your time and know what you are getting yourself into.<br><br>In my point of view, this situation can be broken down into 2 different parts. His marriage/divorce (with his wife) and his relationship (with you).<br><br><strong>His marriage/divorce (with his wife)</strong><br>Do you know FOR SURE that they are really saperated? And if he is really seperated and going to be divorced, be prepared for the entire process to take about 3 yrs or so. Don't forget the dangers for him if he is seen having a girlfriend (adultery) - the damages to him can be devastating. Womans Charter in SGP will fight for a woman.<br><br>So also remember that the divorce is not the end of his and his wife relationship. After divorce and all the settlements have been made, he may still have to pay alimony to his wife monthly for the rest of HER LIFE or until she remarries. Think carefully and ask yourself if you can accept that.<br><br><strong>His relationship (with you)</strong><br>Being with a divorced man has it's hazards, like his past. A persons character is moulded by the storms he has riden through life. Has he become a better or worse person after his 1st marriage? Do you know what he was like during his first marriage to make any comparisons? Will he change further for better or worse once he's full time with you?<br><br>As for the psycological point of view, are you able to accept him for who he is now, and for the rest of your life together? Are you able to put the image of him being once married and sharing a house and bed with another woman before away?

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mushigen:</div><div class="quote_body">Some men become very bitter with women after a relationship failure. Some men come out of it learning how to be better men. Some men get devastated by the failure and end up being the proverbial jerks.<br><br>My feeling is you know what you are supposed to do. However, you don't want to be viewed as a fair-weather lover, and you want to let him know you are one who stays by her man. What you should do and what you want to be are two very contradicting things. No wonder you are confused.<br><br>Your dad detests him - and he has yet to know his situation. When he finds out eventually, how will your dad feel? I can't think of a suitable word strong enough to descibe how your dad will feel. Devastated? Vomit blood?</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> My dad only like the 1st bf of mine which is a basturd who knows how to buy good books. Then my dad detest my 2nd bf cos he is too mystery at times and the freak has demolished my freedom, even from my family... Then now, my dad got short terms memory lapse and tends to forget what people tell him and he assume things himself and halucinated alot.... My family suspected that he is suffering from menopause but what can we do about it?<br><br>Since young, I know that my dad is useless as he always doesn't want to work.. Then my poor mum would always go and get cartons of wire and earn as much as $5.50 per carton.. Till now he is still jobless and full of sickness too... I believe he didn't exercise enough and drink occasionally... But all of us respect him cos he our dad...<br></div>
