[/b]</blockquote>Hmm... but you've already told him how you feel. There's nothing you can do loh. Is he under a period of stress or something? That would make him clam up.<br><br>Yeah i know, it is really bad when you cannot talk to your boyfriend. Maybe he is really hiding something. I used to see someone that clammed up all the time. I found that he had funny smses in his phone, and he lies a lot. Just weird dodgy stuff from him. But worst of all it was so boring going out with him. I'd rather watch crappy tv.<br><br>Anyway as i said, he could be under stress at school/work. But he should really be able to speak to you about it. When my partner is stressed, the first person he talks to about his problems is always me.</div>
