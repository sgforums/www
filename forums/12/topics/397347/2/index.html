              <p>When a girl says she dont want something, and you feel that she really wants it, 1st thing is to see who is with you. If you are with other people, like friends, rivals, co-workers or whatnots, you better get it for her. This is to put her on a pedestral and become the focus of attention. Girls need that. It makes them feel special, loved, got face... Always butter her in front of others.</p>
              <p>When alone with her, you can play a silly game. Act act den give her as a present. Best to do an upgrade or put some condiments to the dish. Surprises is VERY IMPT. But dont do it too often until it becomes an expectation... </p>
              <p>Girls need many things de la! Sex, compliments, security(a whole range of it most impt is financial security), freedom, trust, promises, surprises, romance, dreams and more and more.</p>
              <p>But then again for all the talk of true love, substance, soul and all, which is romantic to write and read. But the surest way $. Its both the door to a woman and the lifeline of the relationship. Without it, you are out of contention, cut it off, and you will lose her.</p>
              <p>The girls nowadays are IMHO alittle delusional. They keep talking about equality yet complain that chivalry is dead. Chivalry in this context was created to protect the vulnerability of medieval women. To even the scales, you need to remove the advantages and disadvantages of both genders. Including but not limited to, the so called "traditional responsibilities".</p>
