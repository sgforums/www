            <div class='col-md body'>the world isn't fair. and when the world treats u unfairly, irrational thoughts like "only girls are victims" comes to play. i'm not about to say guys rule and gals suck here, but obviously it is possible to be a victim irregardless of ur gender.<br><br>one of the worst things to feel is that of being unfairly treated. especially about something that is really dear to our hearts. mostly, time heals, but not without the help of a logical clear mind. at least KNOW what you have to do to recover from your pain. however long u wanna take is up to u. it'll be most tragic if you just don't have a clue what you SHOULD be doing, as opposed to HOW you should be feeling. you cannot control your feelings, but u sure can control your actions. want some concrete examples?<br><br>i'm sure u've heard of the usual: like go out and meet ur frens, take up a new hobby (join us at sentosa on weekends!!), spend time playing games and watching vcds that u never had time to since u were with him, take a holiday, concentrate on school/work, join community centre and take up volunteer work or an enrichment course, etc etc etc! these are steps, ACTIONS, that will get your mind off things. during this time, the healing process will take place naturally.<br><br>the other thing is your view towards future or impending relationships. you can either choose to close ur heart and never trust a guy again, or you can tell yourself that u will not be beaten down and that every pain and hurt u have been thru has made u stronger and more well-equipped and well-informed should u need to make another decision to get hitched again. basically it's a choice of whether u wanna learn from, or succumb to, a bad experience.<br><br>above all, all these takes time. never at any point of time ask urself, why am i still feeling so sh[/i]it? no one knows how long it takes, but everyone knows WHERE they need to go. well i hope so anyway.<br><br>in such situations, while emotions are raging, always keep ur rational mind within reach, never let it fade. when i was down in the utter sh[/i]its and couldn't think straight to save my life you know wat i did? i just about told myself, i can't think, i'm gonna let MY FRIENDS and FAMILY decide wat i should do. since i can't think, i'll let those that love me think on my behalf becos i know they only want the best for me. in other words, i really relied on my friends and family and listened to them to the best of my ability. so now, u see a new me! recovered from the wound, and i might say the scar is rather faint now too! try listening to those that are close to u. they only mean well for u even tho u may not see it now.<br><br>take care~~  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

You do not need to go through the bad stuff to grow up.  The much less painful way is to learn from others.  Other make the mistake &amp; you learn from it.  So if you encounter the same problem in the future, you'll know how to handle it &amp; you'll know what to expect.  Like now, I'm also learning from you.<br><br>But this is not the best way to learn.  Cos you'll never really know how it feels to get hurt.  The lesson learnt from self experience will hit us with a much greater impact &amp; also hurt much more.<br><br>Lastly, pls dun say "y gals must b the victim."  Don't condemn all the male species just because of a bad experience from one.  You have no idea how many guys out there are worse off than you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi sherlynn, just a few golden advices for u. Dun feel sad coz someone doesn't appreciate u, instead be glad tat someone else will appreciate u more than ur bf. Pain and agony are part n parcel of life, without it, we won't grow mature n sensible. Especially in a relationship, falling in love is sweet, but pain when freedom is lost n worst of all, the relationship doesn't work out. Just forget the troubles n move ahead, believe tat someone out there is waiting for a nice girl like u.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey sherlynn, not only girls are the ones everytime be heartbroken one, guys also sometimes get  betrayed by girls too... but that's not the point... the point here is betrayal, hurt, pain etc.. all these feelings are part of growing up... everyone sure has experienced these feelings one time or other... but it's thru these experiences that we become a better person... u may learn to treasure yr next relationship more, or u might be more cautious abt yr next bf and makes sure he really cares for you b4 u all start a relationship..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> time is a great healer of everything... just forget abt it and move on and soon you'll feel alrite! take care! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
