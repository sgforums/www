(i still need to convince myself though, so we're all working hard in growing up hehe.)<br><br>dun think too much on the issue, the more you feel affected, the more reasons she will gloat over you. just screw them and enjoy your life, den maybe laugh at her when u feel like it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

That's why she doing all these.. she doesn't wan to be left out.. she wants to have all the friends.. She's jealous of you.. she feels that you are always the limelight.. the main "actress" where as she's always the supporting "actress"..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Now that she wanna step above you.. but doing such things to hurt your friendship between you and your friends.. this is the DOG-EAT-DOG world.. from here you can know what kind of person she is... her real character.. her real personality.. If she can do this to you.. she will do it again on another friend..<br><br>However.. if your friends chose to believe her.. let them go.. you know how much they actually treaaure the friendship you all have.. you know how much trust they have in you.. They listen to only one side of her story and not yours.. These kind of friends i rather u dun wan oso no lost! If they are your true friends.. they will listen to your side of story.. and see if there's anythin they can help.. or solve for you.. Afterall.. everyone is still friends..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Jus continue your life.. no matter how much she torture you.. or make a nuisance out of herself.. jus don't bother... Your conscience is clear.. not HER! she's always living in fear.. cos one day ppl.. will knw that she's actually out to do such things.. jus to get rid of you.. Live as per normal everyday.. SHow her that you aren't afraid of her.. The more you become more coward and frightened.. the more she will eat you up.. and thinks that she won!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>DUn ever let her feel that.. brace up yourself.. stand on your both feet.. be firm.. be agressive.. but no VIOLENT!! Be sure and confidence that you never do such things to your friends.. Make known to them that all these isn't true.. If they still chose to believe on the rumours.. let them be.. One day they will suffer the same fate as you.. Warn them and give advices to them if possible.. had them watch out for this girl.. she can do anything within her means..<br><br>Lastly.. this rather kind of childish... to play such a game.. in my opinion.. i guess only pri sch kids will ever do that.. if both of you are old enough.. then see how immature both are... *sorry if i offend* this is a small problem.. you still can get your friends.. out of school.. join outside activities you definitely make friends.. then she cant interfere oso.. cos.. she no longer know your friends..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Dump those friends if they ever despise you after being influenced by your friend.<br><br>Stay happy and be confident in yourself. Once your friend know that she cannot piss you off, she will stop it eventually. Never allow your peace to be disturbed by anyone and you must be firm in your mind and heart to achieve this.<br><br>I know it will not be easy for you, so I wish you all the best and good luck to maintain your peace and self confident and find happiness within yourself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey i really empathise with you. I kena the same thing when i was in primary one! There was really a shitty thing to happen.<br><br>Doooooooooooooooooon't get bother with such people. The more you get bothered, the more you are letting her succeed in her schemes. If you know you have nothing to fear or hide, no matter how much she bad-mouthing can't really affect you in the long-run. In the end, people will know the truth.<br><br>You can try explaining this problem with your friends and tell them what really happen. I don't think it's wise to make enemies with your classmates openly if you think you are at the losing ground. Do it discreetly! watch mean girl liao?<br>See how those girls bitch!! Don't be afraid of her k. Sometime you need to stand up on your own when you are being attacked.<br><br>I really pity your that friend. she is a loser! But why she has to do this to you?<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>damn this happened to me before. it didnt turn out well for me though. loss all my close friends because tt sltu went about telling shit about me.<br><br>i feel for you. all i think u shld do is go up to her and give her a real tight slap .<br><br>sorry.. got a bit emotionally uptight.. still cant forget what happened to me... but ignoring or not bothering about her is the last thing you should do. because even if you ignore her, it doesnt mean your friends will. and if she goes around saying shit about you to your friends, one day you'll lose all your friends like what happened to me.<br><br>good luck to u. all the best and best for you.</div>
