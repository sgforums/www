Currently I've been offered a job offer, but the only con is that the working location is very far from my home. The journey takes about 1hr20min. As for the working environment, I can't say much about it because I have not meet all the collegues there.<br><br>I have other job interviews coming, but I have yet gone through them. As such, I can't say that I will be employed by them. So the decision now, is do I sign up for the job offered, or do I take the risk and wait till I gone through the other job interviews? </div></blockquote>Do the hopping dance, job hop... read here on what other and me had wrote <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=82499" rel="nofollow">http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=82499</a><br><br>Btw 80min is nothing, ever try 180min or 3hours travelling time, 1hours or so in MRT, 30 min in bus and another 45min in ferry + the waiting time. haha 80min is really nothing man.</div>
