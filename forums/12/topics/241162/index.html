            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Amber20:</div><div class="quote_body">My Past Story ..<br>(hello.. this the first time i had started my own topic here..<br>2 months ago.. i knew a guy who is serving ns now.. Although we never meet and chat on e phone before, i feel he is special and honest guy.. I started to like him.. I hinted him alOT and he knew it.. He oso say he like me.. after we meet, not so long, few weeks later, we get together already. Then e problem had came. WE seldom meet coz both of us are busy. As I am working from day to night and He is in Ns. his duty is like first day 2pm to second day 5pm k Book out. Third day he has to Book in at 2pm. And for me, I working from morning 8.30Am to night 12am, as I am holding two jobs. One Full time office job and one full time at The Pub. He don mind that me working pub. Only hope I know wat I am doing. But until now we Never chat on e phone coz he don like to talk on e Phone.He doesnÂ’t seems to Care 4 Me as time goes by. We even meet once in two week. When he book Out he only will spend his time on his doyta and sleeping. He will never spend<br>Time with me even not trying to understand me more. I am very vexed. Does he love me? Is it I have no time to acc him? ) by mE!!!!<br><br>Although finally we are broke off liao..<br>but now we are back but things had changed..<br><br>Good Things<br>1) he has reply me most of the time..<br>2) we are closer and even k communicate well<br>3) he is not cold towards to me anymore..<br>4) he had date me out with his frenz<br>5) he will tell me how he feel<br><br>Bad Things<br>1) When i am free, we always meet at his house.. Pei him and NOT DOING OTHER THINGS ELSE<br>2) he never show that he really love me..<br>3) He k don msg for days.. but maybe because he is busy in camp or because his hp kana confiscate...<br><br>Haizzzzzzz.... Wat should i do?<br>Give him some times?</div></blockquote>Good things: number 5. Since he'll tell you how he feel, why not try asking him the 'Bad Things' 1~3?<br><br>Well I think most guys here play dota.. I personally dont play de. MAybe becox of his NS, he is very tired and need more rest.<br><br>I suggest you get back to him bah.. Try to tell him how you feel. Couple must share trouble and good things de... Have a heart to heart talk with him.<br><br>Most ppl have this case where bf go NS and gf gets neglected and broke off..<br><br>gf must understand this ok? Hugging, holding hands and kissing maybe is the best way to closer your bond. Let him know that you REALLY love her, always there for him..<br><br>Good luck to you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
