            <div class='col-md body'>Hey TS.. This is life.. At some point of life u will realised that people do changed.. Frens for 10 years could become strangers due to some misunderstanding.. I am actually facing the same situation with u with ex sec sch frens.. They are one lot they r so called my buddies but imagne they going out on outing nv call me along.. I realised that frens do change after all i have known them for like 9 years but u r lucky only mayb a few years. Initially i just wondering why they didnt call me but no point, i dun wanna probe and make myself more miserable so i hang out with other frens. Once a while if they call me i will just reply but i knw the buddies relation bond has been broken. Dun blame urself it take both hands to clap so if u did ur part the other party needs to do the same too. God bless u!</div>
