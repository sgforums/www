You are here today because ur forefathers survived, proved themselves and mated to produce a better set of offspring. The fundamental law of nature is still in effect today - The strong live, the weak perish. If you are weak, you can die off. But if you are strong, N i believe you are strong because u question, then start getting ur act together, lift ur head up n starting fighting in life.<br><br>We are here today from the days of our ape ancestors not only because of evolution but also because of the survival of the fittest law being in effect. You can achieve success and prove urself worthy and strong, and even produce a stronger set of offspring when its time. If you think it's only about education or money, then u are wrong. Start with urself. What can u do? What are u good in? Dun worry n think so big of the world. Think of urself first.<br><br>"The result of ur life today is because of your decisions made yesterday. The result of your future will be because of the your decisions made today."<br><br>Be a real man/woman. Be the alpha one!</div>
