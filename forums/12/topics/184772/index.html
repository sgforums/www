See your friends smile at your presence? there you've made an impact on their lifes. thats how i make myself feel important, making people around me smile and laugh, to be a blessing to others.</div>

For the fact is certainly not that...<br><br>It's true and I would agree with you that I'm not the best in this world...<br><br>How special you are is just how special you make yourself out to be...<br><br>There shouldn't be any much doubt if you're a person needed in this world...

            <div class='col-md body'>I too had such feeling when I was in secondary school and to poly. Keep wondering why were I here. Its was a time when I mostly kept to myself, in sec sch, was very quiet in class, dun really have much to talk to others, although I was with a big group of friends. When we went out, if the ppl who were there are more then 4 ppl, I will be very quiet de. But slowly I moved out of the circle. Its all part and parcel of life, you have to go through it before you can walk out of it.
