But its just that, i don't find someone i like deeply and easily and i treat love as an important factor in my life. This girl made me fall deeply in love with her. A feeling i thought i have lost long ago. So along the way, i carried all the sadness feeling in me while showing a smiley and strong front for her just to make her feel happy. Thinking of ways to console her, give her surprises, listening to her problems. But it seems that despite the 150% effort i put in this time.. She just dint felt it. Maybe the problem just lie in me, myself.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When you first enter love, I believe you should always use your head more than your heart.  If you give love so freely, you should expect to have your heart crushed a thousand times before someone will reciprocate.  The other party has to feel like she has to, and wants to, work for your love and she's not ready to do that.. so why should you entertain that?  I'm not saying you should be calculative.. just abit more guarded in matters of the heart.<br><br>Let's put it this way - if you were a limitless water tap, people would probably just leave u on day and night.  But if you placed a limit on how much water you gave out, people would suddenly realise how valuable you are and treat you accordingly.<br><br>I would think it's best to retreat a little, show her that you're no interim boyfriend replacement but at the same time show her you've got the potential to be so much more.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Yup, u guys are right. I seem to have just rush things too much. I cant deny that the whole problem could have been mostly caused by me. i thought about the whole situation these few days. I slowly realize that instead of helping, i just might really be causing her stress. So u guys can go ahead flaming me, cos i know i am in the wrong this time. So, I have made up my mind to just start a new page with her, not as a lover, but as a friend. Knowing her and understanding her more this time round and hopefully slowly progressing this time round. Really hope so. By the way, she didnt just broke up with her bf these few weeks, its been already near 1 year. But yup, different people require different amount of time to recover, me, myself has the same problem yet i failed to realize that myself and even rush things out. Perhaps i am really not ready yet.<br><br>To Spinsugar: thanks for ur reply, i get what you mean. I realise that i have been really giving out water without a limit. Till an extend, i have to act that i am alright in front of her when i am not. I will heed your advice on those words you said.<br><br>To mancha: Maybe you are right, i seems to have do things to my style, neglecting her as her ownself. About the dump the girl part, i highly doubt so though, cos it really takes me a long time to begin liking someone, not to say loving someone. But well.. I really might not know what love is for now, but i really hope i am able to find out soon. Thanks for your reply too.</div>

Why is that some people hunger so much for it yet able to get none while others just abuse it when they have it. Life just isnt fair.<br><br>I met this girl. In her life, theres always been so much problems, love, friendship, family. I am always with her facing the problems with her. I knew that i love her.. and through time, i know she loves me too.<br><br>We became a sweet couple. But things dint last long. The thing is that, she still can't get over her ex. No matter what i did for her, how much she care for her, she cant repay my love by loving me back. She says she feels tired, not because of me, but because she dont want to be in a r/s. I am devastated. Why cant she let me help her get over it slowly. I promise her to give her time. But slowly it seems that time itself just isnt enough. I just cant be the one for her despite the effort i put in. I don't understand why. She just couldnt trust me and believe things can work out. She dint wanna try anymore. Or maybe.. She dint even try at all. I don't mind slowly waiting for her to slowly putting little tiny bits of efforts into this r/s but why is it that, no matter what i do, i just cant touched her heart. I love her deeply and i want her to be happy but I am sad with myself. Maybe I am just not suitable for love. Everytime i fell in love with someone, instead of feeling happy, i will get double the sadness. I feel like giving up in love. Life just sucks.. At least for me.. Life sucks.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote>u jz need to give her time n space... as long as u give ur true love she wun forget abt u...</div>
