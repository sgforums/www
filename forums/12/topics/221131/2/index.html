            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>I believe its more of the culture in Singapore. I also believe other countries have such problems, but because Singapore is small its more "obvious". </blockquote>other problems do have similar problems if not more but not based on the size alone.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">why so many problems which are negative in nature?</span><br>what's the first house that comes to your mind when you just started working supporting yourself?<br><br>9/10 will say a HDB - either 3 or 4 room flat<br>why is this so?<br>just take a look around you.<br>every mrt/bus stop, 95% we see all are HDBs, we are bought up in a HDB mind-set, until we really are exposed to what money can bring us, than will our mind open up more to go view condos, terrance house, semi-detach or every better stuffs.<br><br>you go to schools, what do the teachers, facilitators, lecturers tell you?<br>Get Good Results, After Graduation, Find a Good Job and Work!!<br>Then Save Up Money and gain experinece earn more money.<br>Ever since stepping into school, this is the negative environment we are being exposed in.<br><br>Ask yourself, why is it that the rich do things so different?<br>the rich also have 2 eyes, 1 nose, 1 mouth and 2 ears, what's so different between them and us?<br><br>answer is - the way they THINK and HANDLE PROBLEMS, average joe looks at things negatively, the rich/millionaire mind-set person will look at the problem and try to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">come up with a solution to solve it instead of waiting for answers to appear by itself.</span><br><br>main difference -<br>rich mind-set = problem-solvers<br>poor mind-set = promblem-makers (complain and blame these and that, but don't do some soul-researching on themselves at all)<br><br><blockquote>Come to think of it, I believe its more than financial education the general public need to know. The whole culture needs to be reset. Kiasuism, kiaseeism, family bonding, generousity, courtesy, smile, kapoism, etc, etc... </blockquote><strong>kiasui </strong>- everything in Singapore is going up, while salary which average joe looks forward to every month isn't increase, under such circumstances, we can't really say we are kiasui - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">it's the survival of the fittest</span>, even kiasui also needs to fight well other average people if not how to get the cheapest stuff?<br><br><strong>kiasee </strong>- many don't dare or refuse to take more more responsiblites, thus they are afraid of more work-load, if do wrongly than off they go = retrenchment<br><br>from a rich-mindset, by accepting something difficult, you are taking on a leadership role, when you take up the role, take up the challenge of doing something difficult, the next time you do something average, it will be much simpler. it's just practising more and more until you know it at the back of your hand.<br><br>the successful business owners all failed dozens of times, because they know reasons contributing to failures at the back of their hand. only when you know it inside out, than can you do a task faster than others.<br><br><strong>family bonding</strong> - how many families can really afford the time to have quality time with their own kids?<br>all struggling for monetary terms already, if they no income, much the less say family bonding, can't satisfy kids' needs, then kids complain say parents don't love them for they dun get what other kids can get, so what you gonna do?<br>earn more money la.<br><br><strong>generousity</strong>- how can we expect to be generous when the majority are already suffering trying to meet month end's needs?<br>the only time a lot of ppl are generous is when charity drive with celebrities than we donate. other than that, no way man.<br><br>courtesy &amp; smile- in the work place, no such thing already, it's not like the past when there is still the bonding between colleauges. now everything goes in the search of opportunity to get pay-increment.<br><br>when you smile at people, inside their heart, they feel 'this person is up to no good, must be caution of him/her if not will be back-stab, have to protect my job.<br><br><strong>kapoism</strong>- if you don't know what the peers are saying of you, or be it in fashion, you'll be marked "out-dated" and no-one (those materalistic character) will want to mix with you. you have got to be on the same frequency with them to speak their language there's a saying  that's why you have to be K.P.O unless you are 100% confident you are earn more than them, climb the corporate ladder faster without being stabbed or you do a 100% confirm profit business, by you need not be K.P.O.<br><br>but in business, also have to be kapo - better term will be Market-Research/Survery to know the demand and need before you go into the market<br><br><blockquote>All those need to be reviewed and re-improvised. No matter how much the govt wanted to help, by putting up banners, videos, speeches and such, they will not get much result. </blockquote>"core-values"<br><br>in the past 1980s tv shows, most are about helping one another, thinking and help neighbours, promoting friendly ties, which is why old aunties can get to know more auties and chat up easily. coz they are in that era!! if you were to watch 'Tofu Street' the show, although it's kind of old-fashion show, but it's meaniful in a way or another.<br><br>whereas we are not!! what the tv shows currently is what I personally view as "rubbish" (no offence but just my own thinking)<br>why i say "rubbish" coz if you look at the shows currently, it's either fighting for a better life, spending future money, over-use of credit cards, if not showing marriage failures, bankrupt etc, or even worse fighting. now i rather read newspapers or use the net read channel news asia webby or watch CNA channel unless got comedies than i watch<br><br>most tv shows are what i termed as "clouding our reality, making us idolize a person, even when they wins the competion, what do you get from them wining - money? will you get a few days off from work just because u support them? no-matter how successful they are, also none-of-our-BUSINESS!!<br>(No-Offence, but I was one of those going after idols when i was young, thus I understand the satisfaction of getting up close with idols. but lets be REALISTIC!!)<br><br>they win they got share their income with you anot?<br>wake up la.<br><br><strong>unless our standard of living increase if not the cost of living decrease </strong>(which is impossible) than we can be generous and go back to the 1980s-1990s that year range to be even happy although we aren't rich, that's the bonding, but as the society develops, everything needs money, the price that we paid are our relationship as in bonding, opening up chatting with strangers.<br><br>in the past, its amazing to see strangers willing to talk, now you want to find this breed of people, they view you as ailen already.<br><br><blockquote>The "core" values have to be tackled, but how to actually start that... Well... I saw this in a certain episode of the Justice League: To impose the big laws, you have to enforce the small ones. </blockquote>enforce small ones doesn't start with the govt, it's based on individual assessment of how they want to start with their core values.<br><br>not up to the govt, it's the brain that controls our attitude, our behaviour, our mentaily. Unless we do something about how we think - Must be Positive la, if not what will be like now - bad Core Values will always still remain as it is.<br><br><blockquote>Incentives and punishments has got their uses and flaws. At least not everybody are robbing or murdering... but we are still littering, spitting and showing no courtesy everywhere. </blockquote>how much are these courtesy worth these days?<br>how many people will really hold on to a litter and dump it into the litter-bin?<br>i myself do, but when i cant spot a litter-bin within my 100m radius, i also dump it elsewhere.<br><br>little ppl have integrity as compared to before already.<br><br>govt wants to prevent terroist bombing, but why keep so many rubbish bin away causing a lot of ppl to litter?<br><br>murdering or robbing, under Singapore Law so strict, they will be a fool to do  unless they seeking death than i got nothing to say.<br><br><blockquote>Why I get da feeling dis post I put is better off in Speaker's corner than here har...? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></blockquote>no comments</div>
