Gals are like that, for those younger generation, if your age group already in working society, then i give u another solution ba<br><br>if your pirority isn't to get a steady, nvm, just still play basketball, get healthy and be fit, go be a part-time model, earn some extra bucks to solve your problem no 3)<br><br>2) learn to open up more, ladies are generally attracted to ladies who are tall (more sense of security) so if you are tall, train to build up your body mass, not horizontally, but in built, more muscles.<br><br>3) try to work to help lessen parents' work load. than it will be better.<br>than parents will start to look at your from another perspective - saying our son has grown up, more independent.<br><br>Note: It's only when you really experience how hard it is to earn money, than you will realize that you need to spend only on the required stuffs, and not buy things and throw it at a corner.
