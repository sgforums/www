              <p>Time to learn how to move on , dude. but u can still wait for her though, i have a fren who attached back with his ex after 4 years , dude. Nothing is impossible. If u wanna wait, then its all up to u. But u need to bear the torture lor.. and prepared if she already find a guy.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But honestly, to me, when a gal said she doesnt love u anymore, thats it. It shows how terrible u had been previously and u didnt give more to be understanding till its too late. Theres no one to blame but u. If u somehow be together with her again, there's already a scar inside her. No matter how many times u swear that u changed, the scar is still there. So, i would normally just move on and changed for a better person and be better bf for my future gf. To me, i see no point torturing myself when i can still see other more important roads for me to drive rather than just wait at a place hoping for the best when u hardly know whether it will be the best or worst. Life is too short, remember that. Dont waste it hoping things to get better when it doesnt. Nothing will changed if u do nothing now. Life is never meant for anyone to wait for some miracles to happen.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Be positive and learn this experience to make a better u.</p>

              <p>Hi Zarks,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>thx for the encouragement, 4 years is a long time but it`s a happy ending,</p>
              <p>i`m not doing nothing while waiting for her to come back..</p>
              <p>i`m finding a job, upgrading myself so that when she comes back, i`ll be ready.. i`m not doing anything more to show my desperation for her love, if she wants to come back, she will...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i`m not torturing myself, i`m just giving the r/s another chance...</p>
              <p>i agree that the scar will be there even if she comes back,</p>
              <p>but it`ll not be for her to remind me of my bad,</p>
              <p>but to consistantly remind me that i need to be even better than b4 to be worth her love..</p>

              <p>i`ll just be a cushion just in case she needs me, i`ll be there for her. i know it`s just crazy, but that`s the least i could do for her now.. Move on? i`ll try, but tink will be hard. i know it sounds fake, but my love for her is becoming my life now.. loving her akins to breathing.. wo it, i cant survive. i know she still cares, i know she still loves, but for whatever reasons she have to leave me, i`ll still be here for her.. i`m a willing party..</p>

              <p><br>point taken. advices plenty by everyone. I think can stop the emphasis on love.</p>
              <p>" i know it sounds fake, but my love for her is becoming my life now.. loving her akins to breathing.. wo it, i cant survive." like these kind of description, no need.</p>
              <p>two conclusions from all</p>
              <p>1. wait all you want. end topic</p>
              <p>2. move on with your own live. end topic</p>
              <p>since you've apparently chosen to wait for her. good for you. take good care.</p>
