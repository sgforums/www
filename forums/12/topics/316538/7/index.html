              that`s character, try til u get what u want,
              nv never say never.... 
              
              things only end when u give up
              i`m trying, and i failed...

              <p>many are the times i`ve tried to win her back to my side,<br>but many times was i rejected badly,<br>hurt as i am, i was hurt even more deeply.</p>

              <p>yesterday, i went to her place to find her<br>although i could not see her<br>i finally got the chance to hear a voice so nice and familar<br>i apologized, but it was too late she says<br>she told me that she didnt love me anymore,</p>

              <p>thou there had been offers to help me<br>there could be no help<br>for non compares to her</p>
              <p>for this relationshio,<br>i thought i gave 100% n i thought she gave 101%<br>but i was wrong, i gave 102%</p>
              <p>even if i know she still loves me, she`s still angry w me...<br>perhaps the words is fear. for fear i`ll not be able to protect her<br>she wanted to be alone.</p>
              <p>there was nothing else i could had done to make her stay.<br>so i shall set her free...</p>

              at times like now,
              it`s sad, i`ve tried w words and tears, but it won bring her back now. for she have someone in the heart that took my place. little would i expect it to be so fast. indeed a wounded heart needs the most attention, 
              
              was it real or was it meant to make me leave, she knew what would happen to me if she found someone better to take care of her. or did she knew me too well to have use this to make me leave? i just hope she really could be much happier without me, and leaving, once again, would really make her happy, i`ll just love her like a shadow, from afar and silently... 
              
              guess it`s really true, when u really love someone enough, u only want the best for her, even when u know u`re not the best thing, u`re willing to leave her into better hands. at least that`s the most i can do for now...

              thx for understanding me..
              i guess what u said is true
              time just streches to infinity...
              loneliness makes it feels like eternity
              it`s the love for her, the regard for her happiness that she`ll ever have if she had to live w/o, that makes me so unwillingly let her go from my heart.. 
              
              true enuff, i`ve been feeling slightly better knowing she`s happy finally. afterall it`s her happiness, her future that made me wanna go back so much to her, in hope that i can make her happy.. but now, there`s someone to take care of her, and if she`s happy, at least i know leaving her is the better choice.. 
              i`m no saint, nor i wanna make myself look good, but the process of letting go really hurts...
