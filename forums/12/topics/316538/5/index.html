              <p><br>You said one hor, be a man hor, what said cannot go back and regret ya, set a motto like whenever you think of her, you tell yourself "I have erase her from my life"  and hope you think of me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And erase means delete all the way out of recycle bin ya, dun use liquid paper or rubber, the stain still remain.</p>

              <p>Finally, if you still cannot get over it, date me, i think i better than her.</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>How are you doing (Bar this issue)? Sry I skipped da WHOLE thing because I am lazy lol! <span style="color: #ffffff;">Actually I skipped da whole thing because I don't really believe in letting you make sense of what happened through this medium. I have a friend who broke up with his GF as well and I did not offer him any advice. I just keep him company.</span></p>
              <p><br>Maybe you wanna go on some outing?</p>

              <p>i`ve always hated to say this, and i don really know if i`m on the right track, but i always believed that we all have a choice, a choice to choose the happiness that we want to live, and the special person that could had shared all the gd times w us...</p>
              <p>why would that be so hard? was it cuz nothing was done or not enuff was done?? so what if we had given our best? i know results are not how much hard work we put in, but at least wont it account for anything at all??</p>
              <p>been feeling super emo now, wth am i doing w my life?? just silently watching as the time goes by, fading aimlessly into eternity and nv come back...</p>
