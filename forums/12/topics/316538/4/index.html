              <p>for me, if i`ve not hope of being there for her if she ever ever needs me at all, there seems to be nothing much i can really fight for? i seek no fame nor wealth, but happiness which i`ve lost by my own hands. regrets abundent, apologies too late, actions too far and feelings too faint..</p>

              <p>Oh BaByBoy, you might not agree with me but I think you should start getting a new gf. Life is great because there are so many girls everywhere. Everyday, a new girl is born. No, im not saying you be a paedophile. Im saying it's very unhealthy of you to be obssessed over a girl who has lost her feelings for you.</p>
              <p>And no, it's seriously not your friggin fault. I believe you gave enough. It's just that many singapore girls in general, demand a lot out of their partners, to the point of sapping off their energies? I don't see this happening during our parents' era. This could be due to the shows we watch in the media as many girls want the perfect bf. As we know there's no perfect bf or perfect man. There's no perfect girl either. I remember speaking to a beautiful girl but somehow the way she talks turns me off. Don't ask me why. Just accept the way you are and be okay with it.</p>
              <p>I can tell you are a good person. If you need to talk you can talk to me privately. You know me personally.</p>

              <p>i know where u all are coming from, i know it`s for my own gd.. u all my say i`m stubborn or what, but this r/s really meant a lot to me, so much that it had consumed me.. i`m a willing party, crazy as it may sound, but there seems to be nothing else i can or want to do, loving another is impossible, my heart is filled to the brim, letting go would be impossible because it`s become permanent. i will not say it`s not my fault, i`ve done the things i did, excuses will not cover my deeds no matter how things were then. my fault lies w how i could had better handled the situation, and not just my deeds alone.. if i could had been more patient and give in even more, nothing would had happened like it was now, having said that, things done could not ever been undone, the only assurance i can give to her my myself is that i`ll nv let it happen again. i only need a chance to prove myself, whatever time, effort or sacrifice it takes, i`m willing to pay the price for it..</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>See it in this way: Career, relationships, friendships comes and goes. No doubt some relationships last longer than others but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">eventually all will have an ending. </span>All things are of transistory nature, including you and me.Life is very short and is shorter than lifespan of a piece of paper. Why do you have to zi zuo and make yourself miserable, for all that it is worth. Have some love for yourself, friend.</p>

              <p>Some relationship ended because the affinity is finished. It is just like that. Maybe whatever karmic deth you have owed her in the past life has been paid off. You are freed from debt :D</p>
              <p>Don't waste your life over it le. Life is so short. Still have plenty of things to look forward to and other opportunities in other relationship.</p>
