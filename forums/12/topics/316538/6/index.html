              <p>Listen. We all here ( or maybe just I ) have no idea, how much you both have been through and shared together. It is only natural that the more one person has gone through with the other, it is harder yet to forget the other person. However, I somehow do encourage you crying and letting all your emotions out. Rather than suppressing it and running away from it. But one day you will have to wake up and realize that its all close to useless, but that's really up to you.</p>
              <p>You have every reason to be upset. We won't know things are a mistake till it causes us some sort of detriment. So meet up and get closure. If not, then carry on with life. You're smart enough. You'll figure it out.</p>

              <p>Read somewhere that trying to forget someone is like euthanasia.</p>
              <p>It’s a condition, like a disease. You ache for that person, want that person to live on in your heart, dream of her, and dream of bliss. You can’t breathe, torn between having to let go and not wanting to. <br><br>Not as if there is a choice anyway, because being apart forces you to cut it loose. So you try throwing that person off your mind because you know the relationship has run it’s course. That’s the hardest part to understand. <br><br>My advice to TS is, go travel, for as long as you can. Gain new perspectives.<br><br>Then when you come back, inevitably, you’ll realise that all memories collapse in time. Like splinters of ember. <br><br></p>

              <p>Don't give up on yourself. If you really still love her so much, then you have to regain the confidence in yourself. I believe that she wouldn't want to see you this way too.

              <p>She is gone... she move on 4 mths ago but you din realise it.</p>
              <p>Her heart is dead that's y she left you.</p>
              <p>She gives you a lot of chances but you din cherish it.</p>
              <p>She forgives and forget .. you took it for granted.</p>
              <p>When she feels tired abt the relationship, she find reasons to carry on....</p>
              <p>When the reasons run out; she felt it time to move on.</p>
              <p>Then you realise you cant live without her ...... it is too late.</p>
              <p>She realise she deserve someone better than  you.</p>
              <p>Forgive is generous but forget is divine.</p>
              <p>Even you have the courage to commit suicide , like the hints you left in the post.</p>
              <p>Do you think she will come back becos you want to died.</p>
              <p>Even she come back to you now, it maybe becos she pity you , wanted to do her last effort to let you move on.</p>
              <p>It is no longer love.</p>
              <p>Maybe I am wrong....</p>
              <p>Anyway it just a thought...</p>

              <p>I don not know how i shall start with,</p>
              <p>recently, i broke up w my gf of 3 years,<br> i`ve to admit that i`ve had the greatest time in my life all these
              time<br> regrettbly, i wasnt such a good bf<br> many times had i taken our love for granted and that it`ll always
              be there.</p>
              <p>i`ve been feeling very terrible and helpless ever since i
              couldnt see her or hear her.<br> someone that was once so intimate in our lives were just gone out
              of a sudden<br> i couldnt take it,<br> i knew what happened today was a result of my faults.<br> had i been more understanding, i would not have been like i was
              today..<br> yes, many times had i abused our love. i took the word of break up
              too easily.<br> i nv knew it`s real consequences.... til now.</p>
              <p>many are the times i`ve tried to win her back to my side,<br> but many times was i rejected badly,<br> hurt as i am, i was hurt even more deeply.</p>
              <p>ppl had all asked me to move on,<br> but if i could had moved an inch, i would<br> the more i try to forget her, the more i`ll love her<br> and the harder it`ll be to move on...</p>
              <p>yesterday, i went to her place to find her<br> although i could not see her<br> i finally got the chance to hear a voice so nice and familar<br> i apologized, but it was too late she says<br> she told me that she didnt love me anymore,</p>
              <p>but havin known her for so long, i know she still does...</p>
              <p>all that i could had done, i did<br> i cried my hearts out...</p>
              <p>thou there had been offers to help me<br> there could be no help<br> for non compares to her</p>
              <p>for this relationshio,<br> i thought i gave 100% n i thought she gave 101%<br> but i was wrong, i gave 102%</p>
              <p>even if i know she still loves me, she`s still angry w
              me...<br> perhaps the words is fear. for fear i`ll not be able to protect
              her<br> she wanted to be alone.</p>
              <p>there was nothing else i could had done to make her stay.<br> so i shall set her free...</p>

              I always believe that in order for others to give u a chance
              1st u must give urself a chance,
              i`ve thought it really through, 
              n i`ve decided to forgive myself, while still responsible..
              
              i will ask for her forgiveness..
              n i will give myself and this love another chance..
              we all went through so much together, 
              i believe that when there`s love, there`ll be hope
              and that will be the hope of my life
              
              for her i will.
