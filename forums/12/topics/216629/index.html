            <div class='col-md body'>hey, bigdeal <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>Ask yourself what you see in her in the beginning, after knowing her what sort of person she is and what do you really go for when you look for a gal.  However, before you can think clearly you need to have a calm mind.  I see that you are confused, sad and fearful now.  Both of you need to be frank to each other to sort things out to see if you both want the relationship to go on or not.<br><br>I believe she likes the other guy, too.  May be you would like to give her a little while to sort her feelings and thoughts and then let her tell you what she wants.  Remember, it takes two to clap and you can't hurry love.<br><br>Good luck!</div>

"is ur heart still wif me?" "do u still want me?" she answer yes for both. but when i ask her "do u miss him?" she kept quiet..<br><br>i know i need to give her time. but i'm scared i lose her again.. wats meant to be, is meant to be... i know..<br><br>i'm not sure what i'll do next.. but i know, i will still be going after her, till the day i'm gone..<br><br>love hurts</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> She changed you and went with another guy.<br><br>Then she changed the other guy and went for a newer one?<br><br>Tragic follows when you see people getting too involved with a player. To a player, commitment ranked last on her list, contrary to yours being the first. In the end, you stubbornly chose to allow her to fool with your emotions and that's probably what keeps you going and unable to break this chain of obsession.<br><br>You are scared to lose her again? What are you so scared about? You have already LOST her - what do you mean by 'again'?<br><br>Delusion fills your mind - you kept thinking that you have never lost her entirely and this will fuel your suffering. Your cosmic lesson is about releasing, not retaining.<br><br>P.S: Sometimes, it appears stronger to let go, than holding on. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Love doesn't hurt - you are just hurting yourself.</strong></span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
