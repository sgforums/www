My dream in life is to see the world with my love one</div></blockquote>does he think its very important to go and pray? is it his custom or SOP, did he already make an appointment with his friends long ago for this month even if the date not fixed? if so then he probably included that when he said he was not free.<br><br>and also does he share your love for holiday? for all your know its like the typical shopping scenario, the girl drags the guy along and he absolutely hates it and tries all ways to get out.</div>

I know it's hard when the heart is involved. Are you too clingy ? Are your interests different ? Is he getting tired of this relationship ? Is he finding space apart ? It's better to take a hard look at where both of you are going and decide if it is time to talk it out together or time to cool off.  </div></blockquote>dont think i am too clingy, and we have similar interests and mutual frenz too. is he getting tired of the relationship or finding space apart? i dont think so.<br><br>my take is, it is just him, he wants to go pray with his frenz and so he will be going, since it is not convenient to bring me along, he will not do it without considering that i am on leave and i really love to go for holiday. as for why he can go with them for holiday but not me? guess he only have that slot of time left and it is allocated to that pray pray trip with his frenz.<br><br>after these 6 months of being together, i do find him chauvinistic or insensitive. many things he treats me well, he will treat me well with his own way, rather than find out what i like. eg, that day he bought me some food, but those are his favourite and i dont like those food. this is just a very small eg. but this pretty much extend to many things including intimacy between him and me.</div>
