              <p>Here are 2 anecdotes I want each of everyone of yall to read. Please give your take after reading.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Adult</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are in your prime. Your career's smooth sailing. Everyone looks at you in such divine light. Things seem to be going your way. All along, you had no premonition of D-day: the day when things crumble and your world falls apart. Your boss always pats you on the back for a job well done. Triumphant, you strut around, thinking you are the greatest, the happiest man on Earth. However, your work performance suddenly plunged. You tried your best, pumped in your best efforts but somehow everything doesn't seem the way it was before. Now everyone casts a totally different look at you. They treat you as though you are nothing, but a <em>piece of trash</em>.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The Kid</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A studious kid you are. Exemplary in conduct and eminent in status. You snagged remarkable grades, and are always the envy of your classmates. However, you knew you put in tremedous efforts to get to where you are today. You knew you deserved that recognition. So you walked around, head up high, knowing full well that this is the harvest of hard work. You were almost flawless in your work. However one day, you flunk one of your tests. Everyone, friends and teachers alike, look at you, a disgruntled expression on their faces. Now you are treated <em>like trash</em>. A phobia now lingers... do you still have the courage to put in even more effort to study?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Questions I wanna pose: Is this Life? How would you feel if you were the protagonist in these 2 anecdotes?</p>

              <p>Both protagonists in both anecdotes are losers in their real life. In fact, both protagonists were already losers in their own lives when they surrendered their own worth to the people in their society to decide.</p>
              <p>In an ideal society where people are perfect, this may sounds like the right thing to do. However the society isn't perfect and neither were the people in the society. So to rely on an imperfect society full of imperfect people to decide your worth is truly living in a pathetic life indeed. It's almost the same as the protagonist asking the society "Am I a loser?". Only losers will ask this kind of question in their lives. But of course the only natural reply from the society would be "Of course you're not a loser". And this doesn't means anything when the comment does not truly generated from within yourself.</p>
              <p>Losers like to live in a life of lies and denial and that's is the main reason why they seeks happiness from the people in their society. Because deep down within their hearts, they are not able to accept the truth about their own lives....which tells them that they are a failure.</p>
              <p>And the answer to your question, everyone will eventually pulls themselves together and try to waste their lives seeking continual assurances from their society to convince themselves against the truth in their hearts that they are not a failure in their lives.</p>
              <p>This is not really Life, but it is THE life for many, alot, plenty of people in this world.</p>
              <p>Oh ya...a few fine examples of forumers living such loser lives would be Fantagf, HyperionDCZ, maurizio13, youyayu. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Such hatred... No offense, but do you know them personally parn? Not being outspoken or expressive is a bad judge of one's intelligence.</p>
              <p>Well, last I checked, a significant number of the Singapore's top 40 richest and most successful men are not very well educated.</p>

              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">At least they are not transsexual and are sure of their gender unlike Parn</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Parn – once a man with a small dick with no direction in life went for NS and fell in love with one of the real man there. Too bad that real man wants a real woman and not a gay. Frustrated that the guy refuse to reciprocate his feeling Parn decided to go for transsexual ops and sniped (by the way it’s snip and not snipe which Parn so love to use. Can’t even use proper English yet always use bombastic words like Mongoloid and don’t even know the true meaning behind the word) off its dick hopefully to become a woman. After cutting off what little dick he has and implanting silicone breasts, Parn went after the real man again only to be spurned off once more as which real man wants a fake woman???!!! Parn then went berserk and became vindictive and cursing all Singapore men including his father! Wait! Let’s go further back to Parn the man-bitch background! In the first place does he even have a father to begin with? Perhaps Parn was artificially inseminated and was cultivated in a Petri dish! That could be the second reason why Parn hated Singapore men so much because he didn’t have a real man to nurture him in his growing years!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ok, continuing on with the story of Parn the trans. So, Parn stuck in a fake woman body with no real man want seek out its frustration by seeking vengeance in the pixel world. Now, we all must try to understand why this man-bitch was so adamantly stupid in saying no girls want to go to bed before marriage. Well, that was because if Parn tries to go to bed with a real man and if the real man finds out it was actually a he before the real man will run for his life as he almost bed a transsexual. Damn! Fake boobies and fake cunny! The only consolation for bedding a trans is you can’t get it pregnant! Dang! Which real man wouldn’t want a family with a real woman giving birth to children when our government strongly encourages us to have more children!</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">And so, Parn the dickless man-bitch continues waging its war against real man but also secretly hoping one of the real man will accept it for who it is engaging it in its so call ‘intelligent’ conversation rather than engaging in sexual intercourse as husband and wife should do.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">By the way you know why Parn can’t vote? Not because of being underage but because the government can’t decide which gender they should put it…Neither male nor female. I guess we should just label it as Pariah Parn<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></span></p>

              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">At least they are not transsexual and are sure of their gender unlike Parn</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Parn – once a man with a small dick with no direction in life went for NS and fell in love with one of the real man there. Too bad that real man wants a real woman and not a gay. Frustrated that the guy refuse to reciprocate his feeling Parn decided to go for transsexual ops and sniped (by the way it’s snip and not snipe which Parn so love to use. Can’t even use proper English yet always use bombastic words like Mongoloid and don’t even know the true meaning behind the word) off its dick hopefully to become a woman. After cutting off what little dick he has and implanting silicone breasts, Parn went after the real man again only to be spurned off once more as which real man wants a fake woman???!!! Parn then went berserk and became vindictive and cursing all Singapore men including his father! Wait! Let’s go further back to Parn the man-bitch background! In the first place does he even have a father to begin with? Perhaps Parn was artificially inseminated and was cultivated in a Petri dish! That could be the second reason why Parn hated Singapore men so much because he didn’t have a real man to nurture him in his growing years!</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Ok, continuing on with the story of Parn the trans. So, Parn stuck in a fake woman body with no real man want seek out its frustration by seeking vengeance in the pixel world. Now, we all must try to understand why this man-bitch was so adamantly stupid in saying no girls want to go to bed before marriage. Well, that was because if Parn tries to go to bed with a real man and if the real man finds out it was actually a he before the real man will run for his life as he almost bed a transsexual. Damn! Fake boobies and fake cunny! The only consolation for bedding a trans is you can’t get it pregnant! Dang! Which real man wouldn’t want a family with a real woman giving birth to children when our government strongly encourages us to have more children!</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">And so, Parn the dickless man-bitch continues waging its war against real man but also secretly hoping one of the real man will accept it for who it is engaging it in its so call ‘intelligent’ conversation rather than engaging in sexual intercourse as husband and wife should do.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>

              <p><br>rummage, I don't take clones seriously. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>But I'm quite honoured that I have caused fear in the hearts of the clone owner that he/she has to restort to the cowardly act of hiding behind their clones.</p>
              <p>I'm actually enjoying the process of degrading the behaviour of the clone owner. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>And using clones to flame is not actually real flaming, it's human nature at its worst. I would like to see how far I can degrade the human nature of that clone owner. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> </p>

              <p>Both protagonists in both anecdotes are losers in their real
              life. In fact, both protagonists were already losers in their own
              lives when they surrendered their own worth to the people in
              their society to decide.</p>
              <p>In an ideal society where people are perfect, this may sounds
              like the right thing to do. However the society isn't perfect and
              neither were the people in the society. So to rely on an imperfect
              society full of imperfect people to decide your worth is truly
              living in a pathetic life indeed. It's almost the same as the
              protagonist asking the society "Am I a loser?". Only losers will
              ask this kind of question in their lives. But of course the only
              natural reply from the society would be "Of course you're not a
              loser". And this doesn't means anything when the comment does not
              truly generated from within yourself.</p>
              <p>Losers like to live in a life of lies and denial and that's is
              the main reason why they seeks happiness from the people in their
              society. Because deep down within their hearts, they are not able
              to accept the truth about their own lives....which tells them that
              they are a failure.</p>
              <p>And the answer to your question, everyone will eventually pulls
              themselves together and try to waste their lives seeking continual
              assurances from their society to convince themselves against the
              truth in their hearts that they are not a failure in their
              lives.</p>
              <p>This is not really Life, but it is THE life for many, alot,
              plenty of people in this world.</p>
              <p>Oh ya...a few fine examples of forumers living such loser lives
              would be Fantagf, HyperionDCZ, maurizio13, youyayu. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>Yea, I agree with you, parn. So to Fantagf, HyperionDCZ, maurizio13 and youyayu, let me give you an advice. As the saying goes: "no one in the world is perfect", please don't allow those imperfect people like parn affect you with their disparaging, and many times nonsensical, comments - simply put, ignore those people.</p>
