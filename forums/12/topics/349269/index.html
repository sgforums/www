              <p>My company is withholding my pay because they claim i owe them 4k+.</p>
              <p>Last year june i signed up for a degree course because they offered to sponsor and we had a vebal agreement that a contract has to be signed, 2 years, that's what they said.</p>
              <p>They paid for my first sem which amounts to 4k+. After half a year, they finally showed me the contract to be signed which added quite a lot of terms which I didn't hear before, so I decided not to sign it. After this decision, I decided to resign and they want the money they paid for the first sem back.</p>
              <p>I showed signs that I may not have the ability the pay back thus they are withholding my pay.</p>
              <p>Do I have the right to claim my paycheck and am I legally bound to return the 4k?</p>

              <p>What I really don't understand is why you went for the course without signing the contract first. If they delay the contract signing, then you should put off going for the course until the contract has been signed.</p>
              <p>That said, while you are under no contractual obligation to return the money, the right thing for you to do is to refund the money that they spent on you.</p>
              <p>Besides, the company can take you to court if you refuse to pay, and they can win.... just that they'll have a harder time convincing the judge since there was nothing in black and white.</p>

              <p><br>Who ask you to be soo greeedy and guiliable to trust a verbal agreement?</p>
              <p>Don't you know that nothing is free in this world?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So what are the terms on the contract that is unacceptable for you?</p>
              <p>The terms on the contract has to be fair to the company, cos it has to protect the interest of the company. But it doesn't necessary has to be fair to you cos you are working for the company and you have the luxury of upgrading your knowledge at the company's expense.</p>
              <p>So if you think it's not fair to you, that is because deep inside you think you can take the company for a free ride.</p>

              <p>What I really don't understand is why you went for the course
              without signing the contract first. If they delay the contract
              signing, then you should put off going for the course until the
              contract has been signed.</p>
              <p>That said, while you are under no contractual obligation to
              return the money, the right thing for you to do is to refund the
              money that they spent on you.</p>
              <p>Besides, the company can take you to court if you refuse to pay,
              and they can win.... just that they'll have a harder time
              convincing the judge since there was nothing in black and
              white.</p>
              <p>About the withholding of pay, if there's a clause in your
              employment contract that allows your employer to subtract your pay
              for situations like this.... then don't count on the MOM to help
              you.</p>

              <p>that's the fun thing about law, it cuts both ways<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>courts tend to protect the employee rather than the employer, not all hope is lost for TS</p>
              <p>the critical pt in this case is the period when TS refused to sign the 'new contract'. if the employer had 'threatened' to stop the course fees unless TS signs the contract, then perhaps the tables can be turned in TS's favour</p>
              <p>then again, the employer can always argue they were 're-negotiating', not 'threatening'.</p>
              <p>lol, at the end of the day, it will depend who has the better lawyer<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>Hmm? Okay... I always thought that if it ain't in black and white, then it's harder to play out in court. After all, with no hard proof that an agreement even took place, one side can always claim that there was no agreement at all of any kind, oral or otherwise.</p>
              <p>Of course, like I said, a judge can be convinced of the presence of an oral contract, just that it may be harder to do so.</p>
              <p>Anyway, bottom line is, TS, you don't expect your company to pay for your school fees and expect them to happily write it all off if you choose to resign. If that truly were the case, I'd happily work for your company, knowing that they would subsidize at least part of my fees even if I choose to resign.</p>
              <p>Your company was happy to pay for you because they know that you would use the qualifications you gain to help them later on after you graduate.</p>
