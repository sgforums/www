              <p>Your life is dictated by people around you, you told us so in this whole thread, and yes you think about yourself.  And you noticed that what you think about yourself do not match what others think of you. You are dictated by others. You need people to like you. You are just full of yourself, that you think the opposite.</p>
              <p>Thats why <strong>you</strong> behave like that.</p>

              <p>You are so full of yourself, expecting everybody to like you. So when the slightly overweight girl didn't give you a hoot, it rang your alarm bells, and therefore the existence of this thread seeking opinions.</p>
              <p>And when the opinions didn't seem to be in your favour, you go into defence mode aka self denial. The best course of action for you now is to totally log off sgforums, and stop reading the thread here. But we all know you won't.</p>

              <p><br>Hmm very enticing to push the slightly overweight girl off the bus. I am tempted. Maybe the inertia of her weight will make her smash her face on the floor and shut her up. But never got the opportunity to see her get on the bus. Just to test your intelligence, this is only sarcasm, don't be as foolish as this Angel7030, most likely won't understand sarcasm.</p>
              <p>Hey I never expect everybody to like me. Problem here is that some jokers here are not even posting opinions, they just here to flame and blame, not productive at all. Focus on the wrong stuff. Its like I post a thread on how to cook lasagna, some people say hey, they also got the same method, like buying the same tomato sauce from the supermarket. But there's some people who probably lack brains, come over here and post rubbish, like hey why are you so double standard, you completely ignored spaghetti bolognaise and only want lasagna. Stupid comments like that.</p>
              <p>I type a typo and accidentaly called her slightly overweight, all of the sudden some ridiculous people start name calling and saying I discriminate fat people, ridiculous ! I even agreed to change her description, to call her Carol. Then they kept hogging on this issue. Just look at Syria, if Russia and Iran can turn a blind eye on Syrian massacres, then it means that, just because majority thinks this is the issue, it doesn't mean its right.</p>

              <p>Precisely, looks like you are using "holier than thou" on me. Why don't you see yourself in the mirror instead of listening to bias opinions from demon angels from hell.</p>
              <p>Besides ignoring her has worked. I belief there was some group politics. She and her group of friends just want to show their exclusivity - in the next meeting, she was able to at least greet me because she noticed that I stayed a distance from her.</p>
              <p>In future, I be a bit careful about her because I don't want to step on her toes. Be nice and cordial but don't get too mixed up into her conversations.</p>

              <p>Hi TS,</p>
              <p>when I was in poly, I knew a girl like Carol too. No matter how hard you try to be her friend, it won't work because she has already acted like she doesn't like you. Don't be affected la...there's so many other people out there. So what even if that youth group doesn't "accept"  you? Find a new one. Join a new one. Or, make friends with the few you feel comfortable with and forget the rest. Why be so worked up on that?</p>
              <p>I used to be like you - bothered by people like that. Because 'my' Carol also treated me really bad in poly, snubbed me, made the others dislike me, and when I tried to talk to them they'd just leave me alone. I felt so alone in poly, until Year 3 when I broke off totally, and decided to be my own person and ignore her and the rest's attitudes towards me.</p>
              <p>I don't understand about 'my' Carol either - she'd blow hot and cold at me, sometimes she'd even treat me like a best friend and hang around me the whole day, ignoring the rest of her clique of 5 friends.</p>
              <p>Wipe Carol off your mind, you'll be so much happier for it.</p>

              <p>I am soulful but you are souless. Help me or condemn me? Your advice is full of poison. People who advice give them constructively and with understanding, yours are full of judgment and acidic.</p>
              <p>You can support all you want, then you and fat girl are the loneliest attention seekers in the world.</p>
              <p>Do everybody a favour and knock your own head. You need to go for an MRI scan. You must have knock it so many times that your brain flew out a long time ago.</p>

              <p>The only way to counter these kind of "Carol" people is to just ignore them. I come to the youth meeting because i only wanted to expedite my duties. After meeting, I just go back home, not bothered about their own gathering. Some of the people there noticed my "not bothered" behavior and began to speak to me.</p>
              <p>For me, I just focus on my work and not on the people there. I got better friends out there that I spent my time with.</p>
              <p>Yes we should be our own person and not try too hard to mix with people like Carol who only think of themselves and their popularity. In this world there are all sorts of people we got to deal with and Carol is no exception.</p>

              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Your</span> "holier than thou" attitude shows through like a sore thumb. It is precisely that, that causes you to attribute it to me. It is your "holier than thou" attitude that causes the whole group to cold shoulder you in the first place, which give rise to your posting here. </p>
              <p>There is nothing about me, that even comes close to a "holier than thou" air.</p>
              <p>Despite all your denials, you want to be in the spot where the fat girl is. Your goal is to win the leadership position, which you think shold be yours.</p>
              <p>You are there (and here) playing mind games, kiddo, and we see right through you.</p>
              <p>You have picked up some techniques here, in how to overcome their rejection of you.</p>
              <p>Congratulations, you played your part very well.</p>
              <p>No point asking you to look in the mirror, because you can't see yourself, you'd only see the fat girl sitting in <span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span> place.</p>
