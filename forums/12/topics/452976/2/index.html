Not that one who talk or speak alots are great, most are empty vessel. Let people judge you, if you are good, you are good, why care about other popularity.</p>

              <p>Simba, can't u find another youth group to join ?</p>
              <p>Why die die must stick to this one with that obnoxious leader ?</p>
              <p>R u there to have a good time, or r u there because u want to frolick among some pretty girls ? R the girls so to die for that u r willing to throw away ur dignity ?</p>
              <p>So, u like to talk a lot ... Maybe u talked too much...perhaps u need to learn when to keep ur mouth shut at the right time, only talk when u should.</p>
              <p>Example, a complainer who complains about her life incessantly just to get attention, u really shouldn't bother responding. She's not asking anyone to tell her what to do. So learn to keep ur half arse wisdom to yourself.</p>
              <p>Why other people in the group seem ok with her constant bitching and moaning ? Because that's her role, the comic, entertainer, life of the party. Birds of a feather flock together. Seems the theme of this group is about negativity n enabling such behavior.</p>
              <p>I doubt u fit in anyway.</p>
              <p><span>Since she is the "leader" u should not talk bad about her behind her back to anyone in the group. That's social suicide. </span></p>
              <p>U seem to be making all the wrong moves in this group. Maybe it's time for u to seek out new group n not make the same social mistakes again. </p>
              <p>Do yourself a favor, go look for a group with similar mindset. </p>
              <p><span>Note: quit with the body fats thing already, harping on the weight issue only make u look very shallow.</span></p>

              <p>There is probably other youth groups to join. The problem is, politics is everywhere, we cannot avoid, there will always be people problem. Should I persevere?</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, she seems to be everywhere. There is about 100 of us but whenever there is meeting only like 30 or 40 turn up. She is everywhere, like omnipresent. She goes around and talk to people, so hard to avoid her.</p>
              <p>I never spoke about my half arse wisdom to her. Here she is talking about her difficulty to passing this one test, because she complains about this certain examiner who likes to fail people and the passing rate. As I said there were about 10 of us at that time, and she was so loud and the rest were listening to her. Coincidentaly, my brother also took the same test. I will not go further detail on what I said but what I shared was that my brother didn't go thru the same problems as she did, so I was only proposing to her how my brother managed to pass his exam. That was all, it was something I thought I could let her know out of my own kindness, I thought it could help her, since she brought it up.</p>
              <p>Sigh, as i said politics is everywhere. These people knew her for years, they've been around since they were like 14 or 15. So there will aways be the inner circle.</p>
              <p>Seriously, we never do fit in anywhere we go. THat is just life. My eldest sister always complain to us at dinner about her office, about her feeling like a misfit. </p>

              <p>No man is an island? Precisely. We go everywhere we sure encounter this kind of people. So are you advising me to go live in a cave by myself and cut off all contact?</p>
              <p>Persevering is part of adapting. Persevere to take the stick, persevere to change, persevere to find out why. What else?</p>
              <p>I don't have body odour nor bad breath because my ex girlfriend used to love hugging me and kissing me.</p>
              <p>A pig? You hardly know me. Have you looked in the mirror lately? "The one who calls the other a name is actually that name" - Anonymous.</p>
              <p>Reason why I call her slightly overweight was so that all forumers can tell apart. If I just call her "girl" you may think I was referring to Girl A or Girl B. If I was shallow as you think I am, I would have called her "fat girl" or "fatso". However, I try to mince my words nicely. Had she been skinny, I would have called her "slightly skinny girl". Then you would most likely accuse me of being a bigot because I discriminate girls suffering from bulemnia or something like that. It never ends....</p>
              <p>Ok, next time, I give her a name, what about "JoSephine" or "Carol" ? Fair enough?</p>

                      her "slightly skinny girl". Then you would most likely accuse me of
                      being a bigot because I discriminate girls suffering from bulemnia

              <p>This is not called backstabbing or else every single person who post here would make themselves a backstabber. This is not about a "slightly overweight girl", this is about trying to avoid a misunderstanding. Kapeesh? I believe she thinks that I like her or something, this is why she snub me.</p>
              <p>I am new there so how am I suppose to say things behind her back because I don't know the rest very well. But I have been there for 10 meetings enough to know that there may be some misunderstanding due to my very open and social behaviour.</p>
              <p>Sigh, you just don't get my point. If I am cutting myself to the social world, why bother to be part of this youth org in the first place?

              <p>Annoy the pig? You are angry because I say that she is slightly overweight, now you are calling her a pig. Gosh, you got to be the worst offender of hypocritical opinion, I've ever come across. Kettle calling the teapot black.</p>
              <p>Pal, do you go to toilet with somebody? When you change your clothes, somebody help you to change? or somebody has to walk around with you?</p>
              <p>Of course we will always be lonely. We are not always with somebody all the time. I am still young, I can count my lucky stars. But knowing you, you will surely curse me. You are just full of angst. Do I remind you of somebody who hurt your feelings when you were schooling? Please forget about it and move on. Don't go flaming people like me who has nothing to do with your past angst.</p>

              <p>Miss Nelstar, I am sure you are not the same person as the person I described in the forum. Yes fat is not wrong. I never call you fat. There is something call inner beauty you know.</p>
              <p>My point is not about her physical shape - not sure why Jojo is harping on that. When what I am pointing out is potential for misunderstanding from her because of my open social behaviour. She snub me, maybe because she thinks I like her because I was very into talking to her. SO my point is I want to tone down so she won't think otherwise.</p>

Why not try outrightly poke fun of her cold attitude towards you, on a joking note, in front both of your friends?

              <p>What are you talking about? What denial? What side stepping?</p>
              <p>I am not talking about social problem. I am not talking about addiction to drugs, drinking or running away from home. Friend, clickishness in any group is always prevalent in all societies. This is what I am talking about. And you are talking about my behaviour is cutting myself from everybody? What logic is that?</p>
              <p>I attend around 9 to 10 meetings, I have seen a guy who keeps quiet by himself throughout the whole meetings, nobody speaks to him and you are telling me that his quietness and inaction is not cutting himself from everybody.</p>
              <p>There is also another dude, I am not trying to judge him, but i've overheard people calling him names and that he is a nerd behind his back. So there's sort of some social stigmatism against this guy. I don't know how to describe him except to say he always ask questions, normal people don't ask. One thing I know for sure, nobody speaks to him and he is regularly ignored when he is around at meetings. When break time, everyone will be talking to each other, leaving him standing there alone, loner. When he try to talk to people, they just ignore him.</p>
              <p>So you are telling me that my behaviour is cutting myself off from everyone, my so-called twist and turn and self denial?</p>
              <p>Its not about self honesty although I can say that I've not reflected otherwise, its more about the problem of clickishness among these people. Its prevalent among youths. For sure, if you have worked with a core group for so many years, you would not be very friendly to newcomers because you feel they haven't build that privaledge to join your inner circle.</p>
              <p>Why am I posting in Aunt Agony? To find out if anyone else is facing this, which I have found one other person who has in his office (check it up). To find if there's any solution to this (by far its been diverted by you, claiming that I am bias to fat people and then you go on to say that I am in self denial). What the heck !</p>
              <p>If you claim that I post here to boost my ego, then are you here to boost your ego as well? Just because you post here as well. Ridiculous, that's all I can say. If i am an ego guy I would have confronted her. However, I am a gentleman and I would rather be nice and not create trouble.</p>
              <p>I am seeking somebody to agree with me? By far, I've not been able to get anyone to speak on the topic because you keep on diverting the pertinent issues, harping instead about her body fats and my so-called self denial.</p>

              <p>Well, perhaps you may want to use another approach to break the ice with her? Why not try outrightly poke fun of her cold attitude towards you, on a joking note, in front both of your friends? This way, it's like pushing her into a corner and she'll have no choice but to give a response to your apparent accusation. You can keep this consistent, use it everytime when you are with her, till she gets fed-up with playing ignorance with you. :) This way will also help to dash her fantasy dream of you having interest in her, with your couldn't-care-less attitude.</p>

              <p><br>I don't think she has any fantasy about me having any interest in her. Lets call her Carol. I think she already has a boyfriend because everytime she comes to the meeting, she brings this guy who wears earings. However, this guy is not very active and appear disinterested in the discussions. Having said this, just because this guy is the boyfriend of this girl, he is treated well by the inner circle. Anyway just for the record, I am not interested in her. I am sure she is not interested in me, either.</p>
              <p>I am not sure poke jokes at "Carol" would work. Two months ago, I attended one meeting, we broke into groups. Our group was like only 6 people. We were halfway discussing when the cockroach was running at the wall. So one of the girls, lets call her Mary, got frightened, got up and almost went crazy. Mary's reaction was hillarious to say the least. At that time Carol was the leader and she laughed like crazy. She even made fun of Mary. She told me that whack the cockroach. I said that I was also scared of it (FYI - I hate roaches). So everybody laughed. That was the only time, in 10 meetings, that it broke the ice.</p>
              <p>Then came next week, we all broke down into groups. Carol became the leader again. This time there were 10 of us. Carol made a small remark that me and Mary and her are in the same group again, what a coincidence. Some of the group people laughed, I don;t know why that was funny. I made a joke, yes but our dear friend the cockroach is missing. Nobody laughed. Dead silence. Crickets chirping.</p>
              <p>Sometimes the inner circle make jokes, and they laugh like mad, but I don't find it funny.</p>
              <p>So its not advisable to make a joke.  </p>

              <p>What are you talking about? What denial? What side stepping?</p>
              <p>I am not talking about social problem. I am not talking about
                  addiction to drugs, drinking or running away from home. Friend,
                  clickishness in any group is always prevalent in all societies.
                  This is what I am talking about. And you are talking about my
                  behaviour is cutting myself from everybody? What logic is that?</p>
              <p>I attend around 9 to 10 meetings, I have seen a guy who keeps
                  quiet by himself throughout the whole meetings, nobody speaks to
                  him and you are telling me that his quietness and inaction is not
                  cutting himself from everybody.</p>
              <p>There is also another dude, I am not trying to judge him, but
                  i've overheard people calling him names and that he is a nerd
                  behind his back. So there's sort of some social stigmatism against
                  this guy. I don't know how to describe him except to say he always
                  ask questions, normal people don't ask. One thing I know for
                  sure, nobody speaks to him and he is regularly ignored when he is
                  around at meetings. When break time, everyone will be talking to
                  each other, leaving him standing there alone, loner. When he try to
                  talk to people, they just ignore him.</p>
              <p>So you are telling me that my behaviour is cutting myself off
                  from everyone, my so-called twist and turn and self denial?</p>
              <p>Its not about self honesty although I can say that I've not
                  reflected otherwise, its more about the problem of clickishness
                  among these people. Its prevalent among youths. For sure, if you
                  have worked with a core group for so many years, you would not be
                  very friendly to newcomers because you feel they haven't build that
                  privaledge to join your inner circle.</p>
              <p>Why am I posting in Aunt Agony? To find out if anyone else is
                  facing this, which I have found one other person who has in his
                  office (check it up). To find if there's any solution to this (by
                  far its been diverted by you, claiming that I am bias to fat people
                  and then you go on to say that I am in self denial). What the heck
                  !</p>
              <p>If you claim that I post here to boost my ego, then are you here
                  to boost your ego as well? Just because you post here as well.
                  Ridiculous, that's all I can say. If i am an ego guy I would have
                  confronted her. However, I am a gentleman and I would rather be
                  nice and not create trouble.</p>
              <p>I am seeking somebody to agree with me? By far, I've not been
                  able to get anyone to speak on the topic because you keep on
                  diverting the pertinent issues, harping instead about her body fats
                  and my so-called self denial.</p>

              <p><br>Perhaps. Maybe I am trying too hard to make an impression. At the end of the day, I want to make some friends.</p>
              <p>The trouble is, she's always there, hogging all the social conversations. I think the next time when she says something and 10 or 11 people sit down listen to her, I'll most likely go to another social circle to conversate. Not trying to be rude to her but I think I'll make more friends not being part of her conversation since I am not given a chance to participate.</p>

              <p>Ma'am, the answer is No No No and No.</p>
              <p>I read again and I think this person is normal. However I notice that you like to psychoanalyse people in a very negative light. Meaning to say, you have a negative perception of others. You simply past judgment very easily based on your past history of bad experiences.</p>
              <p>I am not trying to relate to her. I am trying to make friends. Most likely not her but perhaps with theothers. Yes I am trying to relate but someone is preventing me from relating. There is such things as politics you know.</p>
              <p>Maybe you should see a therapist. You are one of the most negative people I've ever encountered. Macgregor theory X and Y, you fall in the Y because everything you see, your perception is biased and negative.</p>
              <p>You should re-read what you wrote. You are the one with views all over the place. I am talking about adapting to this group and exploring and delving issues of group politics and about participation, and you are hogging about ADHD. You are obviously off focus.</p>
