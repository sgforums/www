YES. he is alot better now; at least he is aware and acknowledges that he has a problem and is working on it. i am more understanding over time having met alot more guys after that...<br><br>we love each other alot, we both did agree on it BUT he is still not there yet. we still fought about it like we used to.... and we broke up like the last time.<br><br>i dont wait another 3 years for him. if i get to be with him again and he has changed and i have become more matured and understanding, it can happen... or maybe not...<br><br>3 years ago when we broke up and moved on, i didnt think we would ever be together again. 3 years from now.. who knows? i may find someone i love even more ??? or will it be him? until then, my life goes on..<br><br>guy - you getting it now?</div>
