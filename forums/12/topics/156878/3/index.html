            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, perhaps we should not think of the word waiting...If your feelings are still for the other significant and s/he is not with you, but also has the feelings for you, then we should enjoy that moment and make ourselves happy as we can. At least we are honest to ourselves. If the future means together, it will; and if not, it will go. We will not regret anything we have waited or we haven't. I now think that way. I enjoy my time, being happy and staying healthy. I dont want to think of the word wating...Just be happy, go to the gym to have yoga everyday. If one day of of us changes our mind, it would mean we dont have fate for marriage. Chinese says "dzau dzuyn, mei dzau fung" I think.</div>
