How to overcome your jealousy while you wait: for me, I would like to declare that she does not belongs to me and neither do I belong to her. We are not married and she has her freedom of who she wants to be with, as do I.<br><br>That is me lah. For you, maybe you can do something like focusing on your studies, going out with friends, preparing for NS, etc, etc. There is no definate way to overcome jealousy just like that. You have to learn and you got to have focus while you are doing it.</div>

In fact, her behaviour is likely to escalate your insecurity if you ever consider this as a serious relationship.<br><br>Before you are even official, she already explained the 'clauses/fine prints' of what's like being in a relationship with her. Often, people say that sort of things to 'indemnify' themselves of future charges (This is the theory of indemnity in CloUdiSm).<br><br>My take is that if you cannot or see yourself sustaining such emotional pressure, probably with increasing intensity, it might not be advisable to see this beyond mere flings; especially if you are the sort of typical guy, with conventional thoughts and abhorred mind games.<br><br>Currently, you are just hoping that you might change her to suit to your will.<br><br>But this is only a remote possibility. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
