Imagine her as ur gf? do u wan to listen to her all the time without ur approval? do u think that insults ur intelligence? It seems she's playing mind games with u. In my opinion not a gd gf material.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think...she's confused. It could be that in the internet, it's easier for her to express her feelings since you guys don't see face to face. But when she sees you face to face, then she grows on the defensive because she's.. shy? embarrassed? I'm not sure. This is what I think.</div>

Firstly, sometimes she talks to me very nicely. once, she even called me dear in a mmorpg;maplestory. I was very shocked so I never answered her. Then, after that we talk on the phone while we were playing. So she said that she didnt realise she called me dear in maple, but next time when she calls me dear again, she ask me to call her dear back. Then she keep pressing f3 to me.(for all those who play this game, u should know. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> ) However, one thing i dont like is that she lies to me whether in game or real life. I just have my ways to find out. <span style="color: blue;">Next, she usually quite demanding to me, she wants me to listen to her, while she is stubborn and refuse to listen to me most of the time.</span> She also told me that she hates me and dont hate me at same time.
