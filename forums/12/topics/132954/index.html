That's what I thought...<br><br>Maybe that's just what some of you at this age would be after for now... But just remember that for such mentality, love can easily come with hurt and pain without much moderation in the relationship.. Anyway.. If you understand that hurt and pain are just part of the process in growing, then I'll say just go for what you like...?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>And if you really happens to patch back with him, he should be treating you fairly good...? Around the 2nd or 3rd month of your patch-back, see how he would be treating you then? If things have died down by then, put in a bit of intensity and 'color' of your own.. Even try talking to him about it if it doesn't work... His attitude &amp; mentality should be quite on the surface around then...?</div>
