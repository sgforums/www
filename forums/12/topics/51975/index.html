            <div class='col-md body'>For bloody goodness sake, don't be so wishy and washy and be honest with her about your feelings.  The longer you refrain from telling her how you feel, the more you are going to hurt her in the long run.<br><br>It is possible to reject someone with tact. No doubt a rejection hurts no matter how gently one puts it across. But at least its better than you leading her on.<br><br></div>
