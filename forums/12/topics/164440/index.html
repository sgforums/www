            <div class='col-md body'>Do we sense an Oedipal undertone in your grouses?<br><br>No offence intended, really. There have been known cases of such conflicts, particularly when the age difference between the parent and the child is not very wide.<br><br>Your dad is young, he looks young and he wants to feel young. He probably still loves your mother a lot, but he does not wish to spend the rest of his life mourning her death.<br><br>He is a grown man with an independent mind. As long as he is still loves you as a daughter and fulfills his due responsibilities as a father, how he decides to spend his remaining years is, quite frankly, his own concern. You couldn't and shouldn't deprive him of any happiness that he seeks. Since he is still human and not exempt from making mistakes, you <span style="font-style: italic;">could</span> warn him against any potential pitfalls, but if he is still adamant about living life the way he wants, then there is nothing else you can do, other than to perhaps accept his decision and support him should he ever needs your help.<br><br>That is probably what love in the family, love between the parent and child should be:<br><br>"A gentle pillar of solace and peace, humming a song of unending forgiveness.
