              <p>Fighting for custody of the children.</p>
              <p>People, please do not use the children as weapons to get back at your estranged spouse.</p>
              <p>It is not about who gets what.</p>
              <p>Ask yourself... when you fight for the custody of your children.. is that done in the best interest of the children.. or for yourself ?</p>
              <p>We adults are selfish and it's something we have to deal with. So do not punish the children for your own selfish reason.</p>
              <p>Yes. granted it is very painful for you the adult to be rip away from your children in the event of a divorce.</p>
              <p>But it is even more painful for the young child to see their family torn apart. </p>
              <p>If you are fighting custody because you are too selfish to let go. Then for goodness sake. STOP.</p>

              <p>i do not know whether she still love me or not. but one thing i know for sure, i still love her. thus i dont think it is retard for me to express my love for her, whether or not she still love me. i give what i have for her, hopefully she can give me a chance to received it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>jojobeach, i never ever consider using my children as a weapon to salvage my marriage. if i do so, themarraige is salvage not becoz she love me but she love the kids. maybe it wont last long. but i do ever think about it before when i was alone and desperate. but i wont do it.</p>

              <p>Jay,</p>
              <p>You don't have to fight for sole custody of the children. You can either ask for joint custody or frequent/open visitation rights.It seems she is not going to block you from seeing the children.. obviously .. she still wants you to remain the children's fatherly figure. So don't screw this part up. Talk to a lawyer and have your rights legalized if a divorce is imminent.</p>
              <p>Remember.. women can be very vindictive if you push her over the edge.</p>
              <p>So even if a divorce is needed.. make sure it's a fair and civilised affair. Both you and your wife.. don't need to fight to the bitter end.</p>
              <p>If you have concerns with the financial part ... constantly thinking she will spend your money meant for your children on another man. Then I think you need to figure out if you can set up some kind of Trust funds so that you have some form of control or expense segregation from your wife's. I believe you need a trust fund lawyer who is familiar with the laws at their country of residence.</p>
              <p>Your youngest daughter is not a lost cause. As long as you continues your effort to give love, support and be part of their growing up years.</p>
              <p>Myself.. is almost the same case as your children. Our father daughter relationship was never compromised, even though my mother had several boyfriends after their split. Because my father never given up hope on the children. and made great efforts to always be PART of my life. My mom stayed in SG while my dad went back to USA when I was only one.</p>
              <p>Let me explain this.. children knows whats going on in their own little way, so give them some credits.</p>
              <p>A 2 year old may not know why the heck her father is not living under the same roof, but she will know when her father has abandoned her.</p>
              <p>If you think a few days visit in a hotel doesn't do much good.. then I say you have no confidence in your children and their love for you.</p>
              <p>Don't give up hope Jay Ho. You can do it.</p>

              <p>hi jo,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i had try to console myself that even though we divorce we can still be in good terms. but when i am alone and start to miss my kids, i would start hating her for taking the love of my life away from me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i dont think too much about the financial part, as long as i had provided her monthly payout, how she manage it, i leave it to her. talking about money is not going to make the already broken relationship anybetter. if she decided to spent it unwisely, i guess she has to explain it to the kids when they grow up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i get wat u mean that it is not a lost cause even though they dont stay with me. but the pain is not able to educate my kids, seeing them grow up, play with them, talk to them face to face everyday.</p>
              <p>i also grow up in a broken family thus i know how impt it is for kids to have their dad. i screw up my kids life just like my dad screw up mine i suppose. i am sorry to hear what u been thru and glad that u gone thru it well.</p>

              <p>hi jo,</p>
              <p>i had try to console myself that even though we divorce we can
                      still be in good terms. but when i am alone and start to miss my
                      kids, i would start hating her for taking the love of my life away
                      from me.</p>
              <p>i dont think too much about the financial part, as long as i had
                      provided her monthly payout, how she manage it, i leave it to her.
                      talking about money is not going to make the already broken
                      relationship anybetter. if she decided to spent it unwisely, i
                      guess she has to explain it to the kids when they grow up.</p>
              <p>i get wat u mean that it is not a lost cause even though they
                      dont stay with me. but the pain is not able to educate my kids,
                      seeing them grow up, play with them, talk to them face to face
                      everyday.</p>
              <p>i also grow up in a broken family thus i know how impt it is for
                      kids to have their dad. i screw up my kids life just like my dad
                      screw up mine i suppose. i am sorry to hear what u been thru and
                      glad that u gone thru it well.</p>

              <p>It's ok to resent your wife for putting you through such pain. But the anger in you must not last. This is a grieving period for you.</p>
              <p>It is never easy to be away from your lovely children. Even my friends who travels for business experienced immense lonliness and slight depression when they travel for several weeks out of state, away from their children. In fact .. they admit missing their children more than their spouse.</p>
              <p>For your case.. the marriage is already under water. You need to get a grip, because life still goes on, you and your children will need to face reality.</p>
              <p>Focus more on your work.. think about what you can do for the future of your children. Most important.. is to treat yourself well.</p>
              <p>Remember.. your children will grow up.. they have their own thinking and their own wills. What you do today.. will stay in their hearts forever.</p>
              <p>You are only giving up the early years of their life with you.. don't throw away the rest of it.</p>
              <p>To be honest.. I respect my father more than my mother, because I know it wasn't easy for him all the time.</p>

              <p>There's always some women who have no intention of having children.</p>
              <p>It is possible to find women who don't mind divorced men with children. And who are understanding enough to accept and support his responsibilities as a father.</p>
