              <p>And on another note.</p>
              <p>Any females wishing to request for matrimonial and child maintenace need to submit that request to Singapore courts, if the children are ever born in Singapore or has a parent from Singapore, and also residing in Singapore.  Plus if the marriage is registered in Singapore.</p>
              <p>And oh.....no worry that the wife will remarry if you are providing a handsome amount of maintenace $$$, cos they will lose that in the event they marry.  That woman is smart, she will just keep herself a f buddy, a toyboy or a long terrm relationship with whichever men that er hem.....likes her despite her having children and husband.</p>
              <p>And technically, if one party still wishes to maintain the marriage, that one party just has to show proof that he is willing to maintain the marriage in Singapore and have a extra year for reconciliation.  ie. 4 years before the divorce can be finalised.</p>
              <p>In such a event, the court can very well allow the parent in Singapore to retrieve the children and placed under parent in Singapore's custody.</p>

              <p>~~~Its high time here that you consult a lawyer here and maybe in Australia (If she is australian chinese as you said), that will tell you what you should cut down on what $$$ you are sending to your wife.</p>
              <p>tip: separation papers are not filed in court during separation period.  So you best talk to a lawyer to get the know how.</p>

              <p>thanks for the advice. i am a decent middle income earner. i dont mind pay the amount that allow her to live a decent live and comfortable living for the kids. i can never put myself stopping payment even she married someone else as long as she require it. if the kids is in her hands, i can only pay it. the rest i dont wana think that far.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my wife is not a bad person, so pls dont think it is all her fault. it is my fault becoz i couldnt be a husband she wanted me. i feel sad for my kids becoz our differences could cause so much damage to them. i wanted to start again but i guess it is too late, i can sense she really seeing someone else even though she deny it. men six senses are quite accurate in desperate times.</p>

              <p>There is a distinctive difference in the cultures of the two countries. Being brought up in a foreign place, you cannot expect them to share your thoughts.</p>
              <p>Being in your current predicament, it is easy to become emotional. Blinded by such, you become irrational. There is nothing you can do if your wife insists in grabbing the children away. Also, a cheating wife will never admit to you. Claiming that the dubious relationship is platonic is a common practice for such people.</p>
              <p>Give your children an opportunity to choose who they want to be with. Even if they acknowledge someone else as their father, you will still have to accept it. A biological parent will never be able to beat someone who raise them up.</p>
              <p>Your worries about your wife marrying someone abusive is not unfounded. At the same time, if she realises that the new husband is not going to fulfill his role as a father and husband, she will also move on with the kids given the fact that you are aware of her affections for them.</p>
              <p>Don't rush into a custodial contest. Such dispute only goes to show how petty and short sighted we are. Possessive love is selfish. It is not love. Love can be shown in many ways. One way is to sacrifice yourself by playing the positively contributing bad guy. The bread giver yet the one who is constantly painted as the forsaker. For your children, you will be willing to play such a detested role.</p>
              <p>If you are 34 this year, I am just a few years younger than you. I'm fine if you need to rant. PM me if you think it's more convenient.</p>

              <p>i dont know whether they are abusive but i cannot rule that possibility too.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> if she has found her love, i wont congratulate her or will i curse her. It will be easier if we dont have kids involve.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i am not sure what to do next, i am pondering and possibly seeking legal advice about my available options. i wont allow my kids to call other fathers or live with someone else.</p>
