              <p>Peace everyone.</p>
              <p>Jay, i feel for you man. crap happens and your taking it in nicely. thanks for sharing and expressing your problems here so people can learn and also gain a thing or two.</p>
              <p>I think between the sexes alot of problem can arise, endless lah actually, miscomm etc, etc, etc except for the first part of the relationship where everything the other party say is correct, then married then downhill from there.</p>
              <p>It hard but possible lah. I'm no expert lah. I fail also but learn loh. if it means to fail a million time, marry a million times to get to the right person worth it mah, and if your life can't last you that long, at least your improving yourself with the last person also not so bad.</p>
              <p>Let's cut the crap...<br>For your case Jay, thankfully you got some good advices here. I wish you all the best in the custody for your kids. Please consult professional help on this matter and how you can increase your chance with being/staying with your kids, by the looks of it, since you willing to sacrifice everything i think u have a chance.</p>
              <p>For your wife, let her be happy. Hard to swallow but, don't dwell loh. Take time to reflect. Then move on (although i still havent move on myself). Think more positively but concentrating on the kids for now. This will occupy time to "forget her". ONE IMPORTANT THING. forgive her. then forget. Singaporeans or anyone for that matter, all forget then in turn forgive. Grow up and face the hard knocks in life LAH! see her then be angry for what? swallow and SMILE man. oh, sorry to say, i think u realised also, very hard to woo her back.</p>
              <p>For your children... hopefully u get them, if you don't.. they will come find you one day. (worst case scenario) but i think if u can visit them, that's good, build good relationship, close one. then see them grow up. and if u win them, don't think u can be a mother.. get a wife ya.. it maybe no no for u now, but common lah, who don't want to marry somemore? companion for life man! Need it!</p>
              <p>you should take it slowly, a step at a time. i'm telling you, you're doing good for now..<br>take care and love your kids well.</p>
              <p>p.s: don't think its too late and not impt to LEARN how to be a good parent. i know u might find it dumb and unnecessary but IF your kids is your LIFEm then go learn thru courses/seminars and anything that can make u a better dad and also will bring you closer to them. INVEST in them loving you for eternity.</p>
              <p>Peace Out.</p>

              <p>my wife of 7 years want a divorce. we had 2 kids and are currently staying with her at oversea.</p>
              <p>our marriage are dainted with lotsa argument and differnces. that build the bases of more arguement and unhappiness.</p>
              <p>she file for separation in an oversea court. she say we should cool down these 2 years and see what happens. i try very hard to change my temper and learn from past arguement and i vow i would change to salvage our marriage. 1 year on, while visiting kids, i notice she has change. she deny she seeing another guy. i question her but she insist they are good friends.</p>
              <p>they chat thru the night on phone and seem to be very happy. maybe as guy,  i feel it is hard to believe that such a behaviour can be deem as just friends. i beg her to give us a chance and kids a chance. but she avoid and saying she wont stop me seeing the kids. i am even willing to give up my job and singapore to stay with her at her country.</p>
              <p>i am at a lost, i fear i migth lost the kids forever and fear that my kids will be living for someone else and call other daddy. i love my kids very much and my wife very much. i can think and work properly. i wanted to fight custody for my kids but i dont want to anger her and create and unhappy tension amid i still hold some hope she would return to me. i am sending money to her and kids every mth to ensure they are alight.</p>
              <p>i am not sure what are my chances if i fight custody of our 2 kids. if i engage a lawyer it will annoy her. what if i lose the fight, she will probably stop me from seeing the 2 kids. if i dont fight for custody i am afraid my kids will be soemone else kids. i love my kids very much. i will do everything to make sure they are well even with my own life.</p>
              <p>i had lost hope in my work, life. and even probably consider joining a church to seek relieve from my horrific part of my life!</p>

              <p><br>u need to get a grip.... tink how can u take care of ur kids if u r so screwed up... basically its impossible &amp; pointless to get back ur wife since shes already lost faith in the marriage and saw the better path at the otherside.. if u reali like your kids so much, go talk to ur "ex-wife" for the custody of them... so better start standing up n dun let ur kids see how weak their dad is...</p>

              <p>If... I mean IF... You really lose custody of your children, don't give up hope. Like one of the previous posters, I love my dad more than my step-dad, because my dad showed me that he can amend his mistakes, live on with life and still care for me. Keep caring for your children, since they are still young, they will be receptive to your love.</p>
              <p>The end of love between husband and wife does not break the love between a father and child.</p>
              <p>All the best (not being pessimistic here)</p>

              <p>Seriously, i think what you should now is isolate your financial wealth from her and find evidences to increase your chances of gaining custody over your children.</p>
              <p>The relationship problem should be handled later. Just my point of view, your relationship is pretty much screwed.</p>

              <p>U mentioned tat u are a middle class workin man, &amp; she's not working.  On what grounds do u think she has in order to win the custody of the kids if she decided to file for divorce?  Dun a working parent has better chances over a non workin parent?</p>
              <p>I duno abt ur wife's character, but from your posts, it seems to me tat she isnt someone who is goin to be responsible as a mother, e.g "<em>chattin on the phone while sendin the kids to bed</em>".  U worried that she may said things tat are inaudible for the kids..Do u <em>really</em> think so? </p>

              <p>TS,</p>
              <p>you sound like a really mature, and easy-going guy. But if you want your kids, you should let go of your feelings and harden up your resolve to get your kids.</p>
              <p>Now, there's no one to blame for a failed marriage. The only outcome is who gets the kids. If you love them, and fear that they might receive less care or even abuse under their future stepfather, you had better work fast.</p>
              <p>Talk to a counsellor or lawyer if you have to. They are human beings too, and probably have more experience in advising or dealing with these than us 3rd parties here. Do focus on what you want and work on it. It's better than regrets in the future!</p>

              <p>Hi, you say she's overseas but you don't say where.  I know in Singapore, because of the Woman's charter, it is unlikely you will get custody.  Not only that but you will have to pay her alimony and all the while she will be humping her boyfriend and enjoying your money with him. </p>

              <p>It may be different overseas.  That why I say to consult your lawyer.  In some countries, if you can prove she's been unfaithful, this may mean that she is not fit to get custody. Move some of your money into your parents accounts so she can't touch it.  Cancel all her credit cards.  The war is about to begin.  Take care man</p>

              <p>Jay.ho,</p>
              <p>All is not lost.</p>
              <p>Now is not the time for you to wage war. Now is the time to reconcile and foster a tighter bonds with your children. You may ask.. how can ? They are so far away. Fortunately.. Rome was not built in one day. Patience...</p>
              <p>You need to come to terms with the situation.</p>
              <p>Your wife has decided she had enough of your flaws.</p>
              <p>When it comes to care giver of your children.</p>
              <p>1.Is your wife a responsible mother ? 2.Has she abused or ill treated your children ? If you answer yes to 1 and no to 2, then I don't see why it's such a bad idea the children remains in her care.</p>
              <p>It is possible that you have lost your wife, but you don't need to lose your children too.</p>
              <p>I think it is best you have a civilised conversation with your wife about the situation. Divorces do not need to turn ugly. Nobody comes out a winner in ugly divorces.. the ones who will get hurt are the children.</p>
              <p>Let her know that you care a lot about the children. ( Perhaps you have not shown much of this in action. Just because you are the sole bread winner does not guarantees a place in their hearts.)</p>
              <p>It is best you let her decide what she wants to do with her own future.</p>
              <p>Your main concern is not wanting your children call another man "daddy". May I remind you that .. your children will only accept another man as "daddy" only when you <strong>choose</strong> to abandon them.</p>
              <p>If you have not already done so, make it very clear to your wife that you are the children's father.. and no matter who she decides to marry or end up with.. you Jay.ho will ALWAYS BE the children's father. No one else can take over your place.</p>
              <p>Money does not buy a relationship with your children. Spend more time with your children during your vacations,  be their friend and earn your respect as a father.Even when you are not physically there.. you can always foster the relationship using other forms of communications.</p>
              <p>Unless you are really such a lousy husband.. she will eventually realised that other men also has their flaws.. whichever is the lesser of two evils. Just pray hard that she will not find another better guy than you, perhaps.. you may have another chance at reconciling with your wife again. ( But if she does find another better man.. give her your blessings and move on, because there is nothing you can do)</p>
              <p>Remember.. her coldness towards you.. is not because of another man.. rather your past attitudes and mistakes turns her heart cold. So the more you blame her difference towards you on her.. the less likely she sees the possibility of a reconcilation with you.</p>
              <p>Be responsible, caring, understanding, forgiving, loving and supportive father. Even if not for your wife's sake.. do it for your children.. if you can achieve all .. then perhaps.. there be a sliver of hope for her to turn her heart back to you again.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Good luck, be strong.</p>

              <p>they chat thru the night on phone and seem to be very happy. maybe as guy,  i feel it is hard to believe that such a behaviour can be deem as just friends. i beg her to give us a chance and kids a chance. but she avoid and saying she wont stop me seeing the kids. i am even willing to give up my job and singapore to stay with her at her country.</p>

              <p>i am at a lost, i fear i migth lost the kids forever and fear that my kids will be living for someone else and call other daddy. i love my kids very much and my wife very much. i can think and work properly. i wanted to fight custody for my kids but i dont want to anger her and create and unhappy tension amid i still hold some hope she would return to me. i am sending money to her and kids every mth to ensure they are alight.</p>

              <p>i am not sure what are my chances if i fight custody of our 2 kids. if i engage a lawyer it will annoy her. what if i lose the fight, she will probably stop me from seeing the 2 kids. if i dont fight for custody i am afraid my kids will be soemone else kids. i love my kids very much. i will do everything to make sure they are well even with my own life.</p>

              <p><br>I can tell you from a girl's perspective, your wife has already moved on, given up the relationship with you, do not love you anymore, do not regard you as her husband anymore, and you don't mean a thing to her anymore.</p>
              <p>So you should not be naive and still hold onto the impossible hope of going back to the past where everything seems to be fine again.</p>
              <p>Don't be surprised if I tell you your wife had long since made plans and prepared herself for this long before it happened and you know nothing of it.</p>
              <p>You should learn from your wife and show her that you can move on and you moved on with a BETTER life than her and you want to fight for the custody of your children.</p>
              <p>But please do not let your wife know that you are preparing to fight for the custody of your children. Let her know about it ONLY after you have obtained the custody of your children.</p>
              <p>And you should pay more attention to your own anger, cos if you cannot control your own anger....even if you have obtained the custody of your children, you might lose your custody if your children are fearful of your temper.</p>
              <p>It's retarded to express and bring out your love to your wife only when she have none left for you already. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p><br>I can tell you from a girl's perspective, your wife has already moved on, given up the relationship with you, do not love you anymore, do not regard you as her husband anymore, and you don't mean a thing to her anymore.</p>
              <p>So you should not be naive and still hold onto the impossible hope of going back to the past where everything seems to be fine again.</p>
              <p>Don't be surprised if I tell you your wife had long since made plans and prepared herself for this long before it happened and you know nothing of it.</p>
              <p>You should learn from your wife and show her that you can move on and you moved on with a BETTER life than her and you want to fight for the custody of your children.</p>
              <p>But please do not let your wife know that you are preparing to fight for the custody of your children. Let her know about it ONLY after you have obtained the custody of your children.</p>
              <p>And you should pay more attention to your own anger, cos if you cannot control your own anger....even if you have obtained the custody of your children, you might lose your custody if your children are fearful of your temper.</p>
              <p>It's retarded to express and bring out your love to your wife only when she have none left for you already. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
