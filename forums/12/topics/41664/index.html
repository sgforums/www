I carry on my "blah blah blah"...<br>I start by saeing a part of my private life... "A minor luv prob / encounter"...<br><br>I went out wif a grp of frens. Every1 brought a fren/s from another circle lah. Then I met dis gal. She's pretty &amp; sociable. I started to chat wif her lah. As such, we get along pretty quick. Then another guy recognised her, said he met her b4. So their relationship kinda better lah. I was a bit jealous at 1st, but hey... life's like dat. Its a guy's thing lah...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Then time was a little late. I had to go home, but they carried on da enjoyment. I kept tinking abt her &amp; imagining stuffs. I was determined not to "fall" in luv wif her. (Why? Dis is juz 1st impression, crush, mere lust...) So maybe get to noe her more lah... So I chatted wif her lor... Not much, but noe she rather like to "summerise" things lah... So I did most of da toking... (Ok... da process of wooing a gal, I noe I noe...)<br><br>Then once again I went out again wif da same grp of frens. Dat time I was late due to some reasons... but I managed to get there. I did saw her there too, but after some time, she had to go. I was like... "WTF?!" I only managed to chat wif her for a little while... then she disappeared. da remaining time I was deep in thought. Then lately I goin out to "gai gai" wif some other grp of frens &amp; I tried to invite her... but in da end she rejected lah...<br><br>I was like confused... angry, sad, weird, funny feelings all over. Then I had some weird tots lah, "She no interest in me? dats ok, she busy? can understand..." I oso tot some very WORST case scenario... "If got a certain guy come along &amp; she noe, she will come. Then I super "dulan"..." another "WTF?!" I tried to contact her but she somehow bochup... I started to tink "slant" again... like: "she find me nuisance, dun like me as a fren, etc, etc..."<br><br>I felt like having a revenge of my own... like ignore her, dun bother wat she does or wat, who she wif, even if frens ask me go out &amp; she present, I WON'T go... But then again... all these r juz my tots... maybe wat I "tot" was NOT wat she did? maybe I had it all wrong? Well 1 thing for sure: once I decided on smth, I stick to it. Period.<br><br>Ok... story stops here. 1st point: I was emotional &amp; my better judgement was clouded. 2nd point: How can I assume smth if I did not bother to find out? 3rd point: U add.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Wat I trying to sae here? There r times when we cannot control da things ard us or inside us. Its only when we STOP &amp; slowly "meditate"... tink thru &amp; focus, then we can find some answers. If not? find some frens whom U can CONSULT. not those who can only advice (no punts intended, sorry), tell or do watever to make U decide UN-rationally...<br><br>I, as every1 in dis reality, am learning. I learn in order to be a better man. I have flaws, MANY in fact. BUT I accept as wat I am, I dun aspire to be some1 else... be myself is oredi a good inspiration, coz my actions r DIFFERENT from others. Dats unique.<br><br>I continue later... <strong>IF U ppl wan me to lah</strong>... (I kinda crap alot...... ^_^'''''') As for da contents in da story... well... sorry, da characters (except myself  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) WON'T be revealed.

I carry on my "blah blah blah"...<br>I start by saeing a part of my private life... "A minor luv prob / encounter"...<br><br>I went out wif a grp of frens. Every1 brought a fren/s from another circle lah. Then I met dis gal. She's pretty &amp; sociable. I started to chat wif her lah. As such, we get along pretty quick. Then another guy recognised her, said he met her b4. So their relationship kinda better lah. I was a bit jealous at 1st, but hey... life's like dat. Its a guy's thing lah...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Then time was a little late. I had to go home, but they carried on da enjoyment. I kept tinking abt her &amp; imagining stuffs. I was determined not to "fall" in luv wif her. (Why? Dis is juz 1st impression, crush, mere lust...) So maybe get to noe her more lah... So I chatted wif her lor... Not much, but noe she rather like to "summerise" things lah... So I did most of da toking... (Ok... da process of wooing a gal, I noe I noe...)<br><br>Then once again I went out again wif da same grp of frens. Dat time I was late due to some reasons... but I managed to get there. I did saw her there too, but after some time, she had to go. I was like... "WTF?!" I only managed to chat wif her for a little while... then she disappeared. da remaining time I was deep in thought. Then lately I goin out to "gai gai" wif some other grp of frens &amp; I tried to invite her... but in da end she rejected lah...<br><br>I was like confused... angry, sad, weird, funny feelings all over. Then I had some weird tots lah, "She no interest in me? dats ok, she busy? can understand..." I oso tot some very WORST case scenario... "If got a certain guy come along &amp; she noe, she will come. Then I super "dulan"..." another "WTF?!" I tried to contact her but she somehow bochup... I started to tink "slant" again... like: "she find me nuisance, dun like me as a fren, etc, etc..."<br><br>I felt like having a revenge of my own... like ignore her, dun bother wat she does or wat, who she wif, even if frens ask me go out &amp; she present, I WON'T go... But then again... all these r juz my tots... maybe wat I "tot" was NOT wat she did? maybe I had it all wrong? Well 1 thing for sure: once I decided on smth, I stick to it. Period.<br><br>Ok... story stops here. 1st point: I was emotional &amp; my better judgement was clouded. 2nd point: How can I assume smth if I did not bother to find out? 3rd point: U add.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Wat I trying to sae here? There r times when we cannot control da things ard us or inside us. Its only when we STOP &amp; slowly "meditate"... tink thru &amp; focus, then we can find some answers. If not? find some frens whom U can CONSULT. not those who can only advice (no punts intended, sorry), tell or do watever to make U decide UN-rationally...<br><br>I, as every1 in dis reality, am learning. I learn in order to be a better man. I have flaws, MANY in fact. BUT I accept as wat I am, I dun aspire to be some1 else... be myself is oredi a good inspiration, coz my actions r DIFFERENT from others. Dats unique.<br><br>I continue later... [b]IF U ppl wan me to lah</strong>... (I kinda crap alot...... ^_^'''''') As for da contents in da story... well... sorry, da characters (except myself  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> ) WON'T be revealed.
