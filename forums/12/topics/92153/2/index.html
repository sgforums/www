Also, I'm group leader to 2 project groups out of 3. Finally, I'm doing my Final Year Project this semester.<br><br>It appears that quite a number of ppl have almost completed their FYP project.

Somemore, i'm pretty much depended upon for e other 2 groups tt i'm leading.<br><br>Now i couldn't concentrate at all, cos' there's too many things at hand.

And, i'm e only child. Perhaps tt's e main reason for my very small social circle.

I'm feeling like i can't take it anymore. Only a few years ago when i've decided to read up some books on psychology, <span style="color: blue;">I've diagnosed myself to be suffering frm depression at the same time.

Ain't that what you're WORKING for <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>NEXT... Note the <span style="color: blue;">HIGHLIGHTED</span>... It's kinda like a BAD HABIT to just read up books and 'diagnose' yourself... I believe you're far from being a medical professional... Even a professional should avoid 'diagnosing' oneself based on a few traits of clinical symtoms.. And psychology can really be much more complicated than you think it is... Moreover.. 'Depression' can be quite a vague disease to be labelled by the method you've just used... Not a smart move...<br><br>And please... There's no such thing as "I'm a guy and suppose to bear everything..." Just as you've mentioned.. You're a GUY... NOT a SUPERMAN... NOT a SPIDERMAN... Not ANY SUPER HERO... Even super heros get into troubles during their various episodes and from time to time would require a little help or two from those around them... REMEMBER... You're JUST a GUY....<br><br><strong>Below is my personal advices for you...</strong><br><br>1. As stated above. Get a 'life' along with your works. You can join us for outings if you like..? And REMEMBER. Pls don't give yourself EXCUSES like 'no time'... It's YOUR LIFE... PLAN it... Not RUIN it...<br><br>2. Try to practise a better management system.<br><br>3. Try to take things (failures?) easier... If you REALLY can't manage it.. May it be that you flunk your subject or whatever.. Can always START AFRESH...<br><br>GOOD LUCK...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

(basically i stopped studying since primary 3)<br><br>i had no tuition, and i was refused entry back to my secondary school, cuz one of the teachers hated me. (to think i scored the highest for her subject in class) so it feels like i was being kicked out instead of graduating, so if anyone ask me today, ill say i was kicked out. i was 100% alone, isolated and ignored. i really hated my school for driving me to desperation.<br><br>most of my "frens", even if they failed, they either went to ITE or a couple of em back to school successfully. in ite, they got company (bt they oso slacked and got screwed in the end), but i went to take a private dip instead, becuz of dat i was almost kicked to NS since to complications. so i had a great deal of stress before even clearing my deferment.<br><br>due to my attitude, i didn't make any frens there so i studied O lvls and took a diploma alone. studied by myself, eat by myself, listen to class by myself, everyday, and had to juggle between 2 priorities - o lvls and diploma. back then, noone believed i could handle so much things at one go. in fact, our form teacher tried his best to convince us not to go retake o lvls, juz go to ite and be done with it, cuz we'll just fail again. (im very stubborn)<br><br>den im the type dun ask questions de, so even for my new course, im pretty much alone when exams r near. i dun even got classmates there lo, to bug u or anything. there is completely noone, whatsoever, if i fail, dats the end for me. so its like, i chose this path all by myself, walked through it all by myself, and only myself. i was the only one i noe dat was crazy enough to attempt studying 2 things together, i was retaking entire o lvls too.<br><br>bt i survived, i believe ive been in worst situation den u, a deeper sense of isolation den u can ever imagine, and the story goes back to my childhood. even now, i dun eat dinner with my parents, so much for only child, being isolated by yr own parents, tell me how would u feel? i ate by myself since dunnoe how many years ago liao, dun remember having a single meal with my parents even though we live together.<br><br>bt i also believe there are cases worst than me, its natural.<br><br>so u can make it, im sure of it, nowadays, the probs i kana in school r like peanuts. those class politics, those project team managements and crap. i also noe how to handle them with ease.<br><br><blockquote>Scary part is tt after u've delegated e work, u find tt u have no idea how to work on yrs. I do chase my projectmates. Less understanding ones are finding mi a nuiscense already. I've no idea how to motivate myself, much less to motivate them. </blockquote>Best is use other ppl to motivate them, or pressurize them. You see, one thing I learnt is dat we cannot handle everything ourselves, there are things we cannot handle thus need other ppl's help.</div>

Though my parents neither ignore mi, nor huggles mi, but they do more or less try to provide mi wif everyday necessities to keep mi comfy to some extends. Fortunate for them, i'm a thrify person by nature, who's heart aches when i see them paying money for some things tt i dun really take to heart at all. My family ain't rich, and the earnings are rather average. I digressed...<br><br>Anyway, i still prefer to eat alone most of e time anyway. It doesn't matter who i'm eating wif, when in my mind i'm still processing wad to be done next for my projects. Really no rest of mind.<br><br><blockquote>bt i also believe there are cases worst than me, its natural. </blockquote>I dun deny even worst cases than mi. But then, no 1 wanna compare himself wif some1 worst. Problem is tt, if it affects everyday life, it's bad. As the old proverb say:"No man is an island". It's really sheer lifeforce tt is keeping mi alive rite now to do all these ranting. Not tt i've never tried suicide b4. In fact, 6 times drinking detergent already. Ended giving it up cos' after all suicide hurts. Best is to tired yrself out and died while sleeping 1 day. If it's juz some richie rich who can't get to buy tis or that and feels like hell, he/she is juz a spoil brat.<br><br><blockquote>Best is use other ppl to motivate them, or pressurize them. You see, one thing I learnt is dat we cannot handle everything ourselves, there are things we cannot handle thus need other ppl's help.</blockquote>I've done tis a couple of time b4 already, only if necessary. Approaching the lecturers is always e way. But it's e last resort, and it will strain the relationship wif every1 else.<br><br><blockquote>Hmmm if u had once down with those fatal illness or nearly faces death, u will feel tat all those things u stated in ur topic r nothing.<br>I have nearly experience death n now i am very optimistic with things in life. </blockquote>There is nuthin to fear abt death, except the process of death. If u died by gradually losing consciousness and ur nt suffocating or injuried, it's kinda pleasant. i've been down wif malaria once and was almost hospitalized. I also experienced Out-Of-Body when i was a child, and i regret walking back into tis body.<br><br><blockquote>RITE... Then QUIT COMPLAINING and DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT...<br><br>EXPAND YOUR SOCIAL CIRCLE... EXPAND YOUR INTEREST... Like you've described yourself... It's not that you don't 'connect' with people.. You DO... So just MAKE IT HAPPEN...</blockquote>Hate the idea of following other ppl's trend and thots. Some of them are costly. Others are fleeting. Pretty nice example is collecting game cards. Now they dun anymore, and those $$ invested are wasted, when i saved those $$ by scrimping frm lunches. Soccer &amp; basketball is nvr my interest, though it's most guys fav. I go for WuShu, literacy pursuit and music. Weirdo? Yup...<br><br><blockquote>STRESS - you can manage. talk to people who know and shares your feelings. you are never alone with your problems. we all experience the same feelings, only in a different context. </blockquote>U noe... tis is my last place to rant. Most ppl whom i noe and whom i trust are already tired of hearing all these rantings. Strangely, they come frm well-off family who has decent size of social circle, and doesn't have any other problems besides the age-old BGR problem. I'm lucky/unlucky tt i'll never get to encounter such problem.<br>I haven't found any1 emphatic of my situation beyond tis computer screen and forum. Most ppl had only mock at my inexperience of life. But is tt so? I dunno. i'm more than willing to get to know any1 in person going thru e same or worse situation than mi. Juz mail mi will do. But be warned. I've said earlier tt i might appear quite different in reality.</div>
