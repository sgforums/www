            <div class='col-md body'>Why are u so pessimistic with life? This is how u see ur life, focusing on ur unhappy past and incidents... ur mind is so clouded with negative thoughts and feelings...<br><br>Maybe u never experience affection from ur parents and so never really develop ur social skills... never experience the warmth from a friendship... which make u feel disllusioned with life, love etc.<br><br>I'm not u so i cant deduce how much suffering or even really understand the depth of ur heart-wrenching pain u truly feel.<br><br>I dont want to compare my unfortunate experience with u, everyones have their problems and their skeleton in the closet.. some might not experience the same pain as u but who know whether they will not or will suffer the same extent of pain as u in some part of their existence in this lifetime????<br><br>Death is an escape... u thought u think death is an escape from ur agony? how do u know in the first place??<br><br>Compare urself with those who died from hungry... or those who were physically-abused as a child and children who have no choice but to wander in the street as hooker.. theY live a life souless and unable to control their life..<br>compare to them, u still have some degree of control in ur life..<br><br>See a psych.... if u think u need help...<br><br>Have u been feeling depressive all these years until this semester, when u can't take it anymore ...  and started to break down... have u been running away from ur problem and until when the problem has became more serious?<br>I got this problem once when i try to run away from it but then things somehow pops up out of a sudden and somemore at the most crucial time...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Ogbunwezeh:</div><div class="quote_body">yeah also some ppl easily depressed... Feel very pessimistic n look at things very pessimistic. </div></blockquote>like me.. sometimes its rather hard to look at things in the correct light, somehow we always end up thinking the worst possible outcome of situations, den we try to come up with the ideal solution for each problem but somehow we seem to find flaws with all of those solutions, den the cycle continue and we end up feeling helpless and depressed, and maybe alone.<br><br>i mean, i am the last person anyone would think that would feel helpless, but true enough, this is the feeling i face very often, while subconciously reaching for an ideal solution to my problems for the worst consequences alive.<br><br>so we need to constantly remind ourselves, hey, dats the worst case scenario, life ain't so bad, nvm, lets rant and feel sad for awhile, bt tomorrow after a good sleep, will be better. thats what i do anyways, like right now. pretty bad mood, sat here since i came back, no mood to shower or anything, bt got frens to hear me rant on msn, den got someone play warcraft with me, so i think, well, it aint so bad, ill survive, ill jia you tmr bah.<br><br>or sometimes i will think of how ive struggled to get this far, n finally can do all these things, imagine what would have happened to me if otherwise.<br><br>bt even said that, its easier to talk than to do. hehe.. its always good to have a close friend to relate to, or some loved ones to support. now i kinda wish i got a gf which i love and can relate to. lol..  but the point is, it is virtually impossible to beat depression alone.</div>
