            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Babygal... I m sure u are very confuse right now as to which guy to choose as a potential husband as both guys seems to have their strong points, and both seems to be good.<br><br>In this situation, I guess I will choose B, cos I believe that love is very impt in a marriage, as marriage is for life.<br><br>You may feel miserable if u marry someone whom u dun really luv that much. True, u will not hv to worry in the future about $$ probs if you choose A, but deep down in your heart, will u be really happy? I guess happiness in a marriage is impt as well.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>[This message has been edited by autumn (edited 27 October 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear baby,<br><br>I've been reading the thread that has been going on from your initial post and I must say you're in a complicated situation. Simply because of many factors, any one you choose: A or B might not work out well. The problem is not in their qualifications per say.<br><br>Marriage is a serious issue and one I shall not give proper counsel over the Net. The things which we advice people with can seriously ruin others' lives if we do not understand the entire situation.<br><br>As such, I am opening up an invitation for you to give me a call and explain everything (which is comfortable for you) to explain. I do not wish to give my number to every single person. Please let me know in your reply post if you want to call me, then I'll figure a safe way to give it to you.<br><br>However, I do wish to give you some advice right here on the Net should you not wish to call.<br><br>You dilemna stems from having LOVE or having a comfortable life. Let's speak of the comfortable life you speak of. Saying that A can provide for you and is rich does not mean he can give you a confortable life. Dear, marriage is about 2 people coming together. 2 characters coming into 1 relationship. That's where you need comfort. Being able to relate to one another is the biggest asset to marriage.<br><br>Riches and gains can disappear in one day. Character on the other hand never dies. I would suggest you ponder over what kind of CHARACTER you want in the person you spend your entire life with. I am sure you don't want to make the wrong choice and get into a divorce. God forbid.<br><br>This is the summary of what I want to share with you. You also speak of the second guy having a good job and a car and being able to provide the best that he can. My dear friend, money cannot buy ALL provisions. Being a woman, your greatest need is emotional. While money can buy lots of things, it cannot unfortunately buy chracter, integrity, honesty, purity, and emotional comfort. These are just some of the things that tie in to a successful marriage.<br><br>Also, I really do wonder about your personal insecurities in life as well. Do you have any? I ask because you must know what love does to someone. If you truly love someone, then it might come to a point where it hurts. This is because love creates an environment where your past hurts, regrets come to life again and surface up. I wonder what you'll do then. Money and educational qualifications will not help to heal those things. Only true love from your heart and his heart can do that.<br><br>In closing, please consider carefully and give much thought to what you do with your life. The wise person will want stability, but not just in comfort.<br><br>Hope this helps!<br>Daniel</div>
