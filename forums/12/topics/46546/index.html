After you go for your university studies, you'll still face the challenge of finding a job....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  In general, it'll be easier to do a degree when you're a full-time student... But you'll face the problem of being financially independent usually... Is your permenant job on a contract basis...? If it's not I think it's certainly quite a good offer...? Considering both pay offers... The permenant job definitely sounds much more attractive....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> You'll probably enjoy more benefits too..? But as a start off mentality, you might be clearing off some people's SHI[/i]T if you're unlucky...? Nonetheless, shouldn't let this bother you much as this is just an empty assumption for anything can really be in store you what...? Be it good or bad...?<br><br><strong><br>now the thing is the temp job's interview is before the perm job..if the temp job accept me..can i say i consider first..coz i have another interview later?...and i think if i say this..and if the perm job dun wan me...den the temp's company will have a very bad impression of me liao....</strong><br><br>You DON'T have to tell them that you're having an interview later... Just tell them that you'll need one day to think over the offer and would call them back tomorrow... Besides, temp jobs usually won't be bothered much about these.... It's not like they're having you for permenant...?<br><br><strong><br>den worse thing..i think my job agency that agent will be really piss loh..<br></strong><br><br>No lah...

Accept the temp one first, when ask when can start work, you just say next Monday. Then go for the other interview. If you feel the perm one is the One, then just give the temp company a call and apologise.<br>Actually i have another way, but don't want to teach you how to 'cheat'.<br></div>
