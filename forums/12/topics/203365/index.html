            <div class='col-md body'>We're very good friends, we're "brothers". He used to be against MLM but somehow or rather, he got convinced by the so called communion... He told me there's potential in the company, Lampe Berger, and wants me to be his partner, or to put it bluntly, his downline. The thing is, I don't think MLM can ever make a person rich unless he/she is the director or one of the elite groups at the top of the pyramid.<br><br>I almost joined until I did my homework on MLM and to my dismay, it's nothing but bullsh<span style="font-style: italic;"></span>it. Maths don't lie. The problem is, I laid out the truth about MLM to my friend and the more I try, the more he's keen on wanting me to join, telling me how different this company is from others and how great and noble the leader, Steven Lim is. Because I strongly feel that doing MLM will put a strain on my relationships with friends and relatives and thus jeopardizing my social standing, which may marr my image in the long term, I choose not to join. Already I'm starting to get irritated by his persistant argument that it is a get-rich-scheme although he did not explicitly state so.<br><br>I think my friend's in a delusion thinking that MLM will make a person get rich soon. Either that or he has become one of those lying evil lots. My problem is not much of how to reject him, but rather to present to him the different aspects of dangers associated with MLM without crushing his ideals which are rooted into it and pull him out of it before he lose his friends.</div>

I wld make attempts to talk to him, but make it very clear that i will NEVER be his downline, and keep at a distance ba.
