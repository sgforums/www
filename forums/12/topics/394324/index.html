              <p>Hey, i am an18 year old girl sick as hell with the mind games that the people (especially those i care for) subject me to all the time. </p>
              <p>And i must admit here, so you understand the situation a lil' better, that i am lesbian.</p>
              <p>So this girl who i think has the same orientation as i do admits to having romantic feelings for me. She shares my woes about being the "social deviant". She and i have much to talk about, and have gone on several dates together of which the outcome has been fantastic. We somehow just have chemistry.</p>
              <p>However, these days, she seems fairly distant and she seems to be wanting out because i want to take our relationship at a slower pace. And i think she does this only to make me cling on even tighter to her.</p>
              <p>You see, whenever such  a thing happens i will always go crying back into her arms. BTW, She's a 25 year old lady so i expect her to be a lot more experienced than me and i fear she is becoming manipulative of my emotions, knowing very well that i'm head over heels in love with her. </p>
              <p>What should i do please? </p>
              <p>Please don't hate on me. </p>
              <p>And i know that most of you are heterosexual beings but its not wrong to be gay. I can't really help it can i? </p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>First of all, you're still young. Are you absolutely sure of your sexual orientation? From wat you say, she (your interest) appears to be sure of wat she wants (i.e. hard and fast) since she aint young anymore. She is probably worried that you're just taking her as a 'fling'. Are you still schooling or working? It's probably advisable to consult your school psychiatrist regarding this matter. It could affect your studies and/or work performance if she continues to behave like this.</p></div>

              <p><br>What do you mean it is not wrong to be gay?</p>
              <p>It's very wrong to be gay, take a look at yourself in the mirror and you shouldn't be in love with someone in your own gender.</p>
              <p>Just because many insensible, self-righteous people in the world supported gays, doesn't means they are GOD or even qualified to change the laws of nature.</p>
              <p>Ask GOD ok? IF you don't have a GOD in your life, then go ask your Parents!</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is wrong to be gay, stop lying to yourself and if you need to ask for support to overturn the fact that it is wrong to be gay, then you already know it's wrong to be gay.</p>
              <p>Please pay more attention to the screaming voice within yourself and do not deny it!</p>

              <p>Your mind playing games on you.</p>
              <p>There are lesbians and there are gays and there are friends.</p>
              <p>The line that separate these is not very clear.</p>
              <p>When does friendship, spill over into a gay relationship, or a gay relationship into a lesbian experience.</p>
              <p>You seemed eager to cast yourself as a lesbian. Check that your mind isn't telling you that you are "advanced' and "cool" and a "lesbian". At eighteen there is a need to rebel,  by becoming a "social diviant". Thats how the hippie and free love movements started out in the sixties.</p>
              <p>Your new found friend may not share the same views as you. She's a lot older and mature, and although she enjoys your attention, may not share your percieved orientation. It is not uncommon for two person to click well. And thats all there is to it.</p>

              <p>Hey guys, you are not helping her by saying whether homosexuality is right or wrong. Instead, go straight to the point and provide effective solutions. </p>
              <p>Raarachel, its good to know that you both are actually in love with each other. But due to society oppression, one of you wanted out. We cannot change how society perceive homosexuals, but you guys can choose to learn how to face up and live your own life, or continue to live by society guidelines. </p>
              <p>Back to your problem. Do not assume on what she is trying to do to you. Ask her to her honest with you, is it really because she think there is no future in this r/s? or that she does not really love you that she decided that she wants to get out of this thing. She might not be playing mind games as what you have said, it could be that she is confused with what she wants. Humans have their moments of insecurities too. Age does not equate to maturity and experience. As I said, do not assume, check your facts. Due to assumption, you could most probably bring down a beautiful r/s. </p>
              <p>If you really love her. Be determine and know what you want. Tell her what are you planning to do, that you are going to woo her, and ensure that she is prepared. Love can't feed on air either. She's 25, she should be working. Who's going to foot the bill? Think about it yourself, when you yourself are all sorted out, talk to her nicely about your plan. </p>
              <p>When it comes to love, i don't believe whether there is a right or wrong, i only know its about brain chemistry. =) Good luck. I will keep tab on this topic, do update on your progress. </p>
