              <p>I do not need to encourage homosexual relationship, just like how we need not encourage heterosexual ones. They are already there for goodness sake. Just that society decided to keep mum about them and sweep them under the carpet does not mean they do not exist. </p>
              <p>She might be a mere 18 year old girl who have yet to see the world. But that does not deprive her of making any mature decision that would affect her life. Having a heterosexual r/s does not mean a better future. If she do realise that she is gay, then I feel that she should find her own route, she would be happier that way. And even if in future she realise that she is not, she got to amend that mistake and move on. That's is when she knows what she eventually wants. And for us, who are we to direct her for her future? </p>
              <p>We can only be here to help her current situation. Btw, she did not get herself  in any wrong situation, she is just in a troubled situation which she does not know how to solve, thus seeking advices. </p>

              <div>Check your previous post. You called one of the forumer gay when he provided a piece of advice different from yours. And if I do mistake your sentence, then I apologies about it. Homosexuals are not sexual distortion. They are just people who are genetically different, thus becoming homosexuals. You can't cure them. If you can, they are not even homosexuals in the first place. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>I do not even need to accept them. It is just like, do you accept heterosexuals? I do not even have to think about it. They are there. I have never compared myself against them, much less to think I'm superior. There is no superiority involve when it comes to this. And I don't understand how can this factor come in. </div>
              <div><br></div>
              <div>Even if they do become the majority, so be it. I'm fine with that. In future if my children are homosexuals, I'm also fine with it. As long as they are happy. I don't believe in forcing people to conform to any values which will result them in being unhappy. I don't find happiness on others unhappiness. Get it? As to whether I really care for them or not, I can only show my care and concern by showing support and providing advice when needed. </div>

              <p>Not really mentally. Homosexual's mental capacity is the same as anyone else. It is genetically. Like how normal is it for you to be attracted to guys, is how normal for a lesbian to be attracted to a girl. It's all within one inner self. That's it. The only difference between you and them is the gender preference for their partners. </p>

              <p>It's like how you are born straight lor, on the assumption that you're a guy...I can't ask you to make a choice whether to be like girls or guys when you reach puberty right? As a straight guy you will just be naturally attracted to the girls, there is no choice what...</p>
              <p>Same for gays/lesbians la...when they reach puberty they'll start to become attracted to ppl of the same sex...no matter what kinda upbringing they have.</p>
              <p>Of coz la, there are ppl out there who do engage in homosexual activities for other reasons, but then like that they cannot be considered gays/lesbians, because they have a choice. For example, the guys who go for anal/oral sex in prison, they probably just need to satisfy their needs, or assert dominance.</p>

              <p><br> to me, I always believe believed it's the environment that causes
              one to be homosexual... things like boys school, girls
              school...</p>
              <p>of coz there's other factor like the xq28 genetic marker in ur x
              chromosome that affect homosexual but the studies result have
              been disputed...</p>

              <p>Haa, environment do play a part too in some cases, but not all. There are many more disputes to the genetic factor as compared to this sole reason of the x chromosome. I personally belief in the genetic part due to the neurotic scan that shows the difference in brain reaction when comparing that of a homosexual with a heterosexual. If it involves the brain, I think some genes do play a part then. </p>
              <p>I'm no science person, so I can't argue and reason with you about the disputes and all the genes thing. The genetic factor that I said above is due to my own personal belief and reasoning. It might not hold enough truth, but its good enough for me. I myself am still reading up on such journals to improve my knowledge. </p>
              <p>Ultimately, it boils down to whether you want to see the truth that society do have these people around and accept them, and not continue argue how did they origin, and whether the way they were originated are acceptable to you, before you as a fellow human being can accept them or not. </p>

              <p><br>Talking about depriving this 18 yrs old TS of making any mature decision that would affect her life.</p>
              <p>Do you think TS is aware that being gay/lesbian is abnormal?</p>
              <p>By providing the support that TS requested for, aren't you babysitting TS? Is that really going to help her to make any mature decision in her life? Does TS knows how is being gay/lesbian going to affect her future life? Did anyone of you have the courage to bring this awareness to TS?</p>
              <p>If TS insists on being gay/lesbian because she is born to be gay/lesbian, then I will accept that it is her own choice to live her life in the way she has chosen.</p>
              <p>But if TS is a confused 18yrs old who isn't 100% sure of the decision that she have made unwillingly or unconsciously, anyone should have the heart to provide sufficient information regarding gay/lesbian, instead of encouraging TS down her confused path in life.</p>
              <p>Don't push all the blame to TS and tell her that she should have realised when she eventually realised in her future. That's not being responsible to TS at all. You simply cannot come and fired away your advices based on what you think is right and fair to TS. You should based your advices in TS's perspective, and ask yourself questions like .....is she aware of gay/lesbian? Is TS confused about her own sexual preference? What is causing TS to feel agony? What is the real reason that TS felt agony? Who is causing her this agony(TS or her gay lover)?</p>
              <p>Many questions need to be asked from TS's perspective, and have any of you done that?</p>
              <p>Don't tell me you come here and help TS with your casually kind and irresponsible words when it is so on the surface and everyone can repeat and rephrase and reuse what you had advised TS on every other TS.</p>

              <p><br> Talking about depriving this 18 yrs old TS of making any mature
              decision that would affect her life.</p>
              <p>Do you think TS is aware that being gay/lesbian is abnormal?</p>
              <p>By providing the support that TS requested for, aren't you
              babysitting TS? Is that really going to help her to make any mature
              decision in her life? Does TS knows how is being gay/lesbian going
              to affect her future life? Did anyone of you have the courage to
              bring this awareness to TS?</p>
              <p>If TS insists on being gay/lesbian because she is born to be
              gay/lesbian, then I will accept that it is her own choice to live
              her life in the way she has chosen.</p>
              <p>But if TS is a confused 18yrs old who isn't 100% sure of the
              decision that she have made unwillingly or unconsciously, anyone
              should have the heart to provide sufficient information regarding
              gay/lesbian, instead of encouraging TS down her confused path in
              life.</p>
              <p>Don't push all the blame to TS and tell her that she should have
              realised when she eventually realised in her future. That's
              not being responsible to TS at all. You simply cannot come and
              fired away your advices based on what you think is right and fair
              to TS. You should based your advices in TS's perspective, and ask
              yourself questions like .....is she aware of gay/lesbian? Is TS
              confused about her own sexual preference? What is causing TS to
              feel agony? What is the real reason that TS felt agony? Who is
              causing her this agony(TS or her gay lover)?</p>
              <p>Many questions need to be asked from TS's perspective, and have
              any of you done that?</p>
              <p>Don't tell me you come here and help TS with your casually kind
              and irresponsible words when it is so on the surface and everyone
              can repeat and rephrase and reuse what you had advised TS on every
              other TS.</p>
              <p>Help only if you truly and genuinely want to help, otherwise
              focus on winning fame and honour in this topic. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>As I said, it is not up to us to direct her life for the future. We can only give her advice. I give mine, you give yours, it is her to choose who she wants to listen to, or not even to any of us, and use her own method to resolve her problem. Being homosexual is not abnormal, so how can TS be even aware of that in the first place? For TS to conclude that she is a lesbian at this point of time, I believe she have done her fair share of homework and has her experience. This is not for any of us to say in the first place. </p>
              <p>The problem now is: She wants to know why is her partner behaving in this manner, and not whether if she is gay or not. So why do you keep harping that being gay is wrong when you are not helping her at all? </p>
              <p>As for why ask her to learn from her mistake, is that she would be the only one who know in future whether is this a mistake or not, I'm not pushing the blame on to her. She is given a choice, if she chooses that she wants to live a heterosexual life and that whether she will end up happy in future or not, she still have to face the consequences on her own. And that, if she choose to lead the homosexual lifestyle that she knows she belongs to, she still have to face the results in future too. Under no circumstances am I pushing the blame to her.</p>
              <p>Right now, I am helping her on the basis that she knows that she is a gay woman, and that she is seeking help regarding her partner. And what makes you say she is not 100% sure? In her post, she did not mention a single thing about her confusion in her sexuality. So I do not understand why would this homosexuality would kick in, in the first place. </p>
              <p>I think you are the confuse one here. You keep contradicting yourself, saying in the first few paragraphs that she is confuse, then you say if she insist that she is homosexual, you will accept, later on you question whether am I helping her in the first place on whether am I right on her problem or not. The second part about she insisting that she is gay, makes me feel like asking you: Are you sure you are heterosexual? Can you insist to me that you are heterosexual? I don't believe you are heterosexual. What a joke -.-</p>
              <p>You picture out the thing yourself first before providing advice. I would not reply any post from you anymore, but only to TS.  </p>

              <p>Aiyah, from her posts you can tell that she (parn) did not even bother to read what we have posted previously, so why bother reading hers? Anyway, her posts are all the same what, same old boring crap <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>

              <p><br>Since you have already insist that being homosexual is not abnormal, then there's really nothing left to talk about as you are as equally confused as TS and don't know what is right or wrong in life anymore.</p>
              <p>Please don't reply to my post as I really don't feel like you deserved to be saved. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Read my posts carefully first before you make a fool out of yourself. I don't like to repeat myself just because you're stupid and I need to babysit and spoonfeed you with the comments that you have missed.</p>
              <p>Handicap people who cannot read well like you, really shouldn't even be exchanging posts with me. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
