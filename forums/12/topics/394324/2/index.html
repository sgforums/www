              <p>What makes you think that a gay couple have to go through gender alteration operation before they can form a family? Either one of them can be the biological parent of the child. This does not come under adoption mind you.</p>
              <p>And for goodness sake, by accepting homosexuals does not mean that we are gay ourselves. You can don't accept, that is your problem. </p>

              <p>Hey guys, you are not helping her by saying whether
                  homosexuality is right or wrong. Instead, go straight to the point
                  and provide effective solutions. </p>
              <p>Raarachel, its good to know that you both are actually in love
                  with each other. But due to society oppression, one of you wanted
                  out. We cannot change how society perceive homosexuals, but you
                  guys can choose to learn how to face up and live your own life, or
                  continue to live by society guidelines. </p>
              <p>Back to your problem. Do not assume on what she is trying to do
                  to you. Ask her to her honest with you, is it really because she
                  think there is no future in this r/s? or that she does not really
                  love you that she decided that she wants to get out of this thing.
                  She might not be playing mind games as what you have said, it could
                  be that she is confused with what she wants. Humans have their
                  moments of insecurities too. Age does not equate to maturity and
                  experience. As I said, do not assume, check your facts. Due to
                  assumption, you could most probably bring down a beautiful
                  r/s. </p>
              <p>If you really love her. Be determine and know what you want.
                  Tell her what are you planning to do, that you are going to woo
                  her, and ensure that she is prepared. Love can't feed on air
                  either. She's 25, she should be working. Who's going to foot the
                  bill? Think about it yourself, when you yourself are all sorted
                  out, talk to her nicely about your plan. </p>
              <p>When it comes to love, i don't believe whether there is a right
                  or wrong, i only know its about brain chemistry. =) Good luck. I
                  will keep tab on this topic, do update on your progress. </p>

              <p>What makes you think that a gay couple have to go through gender alteration operation before they can form a family? Either one of them can be the biological parent of the child. This does not come under adoption mind you.</p>
              <p>And for goodness sake, by accepting homosexuals does not mean that we are gay ourselves. You can don't accept, that is your problem. </p>

              <p>Gay, lesbian, homosexual are all sexual distortion.</p>

              <p>So tell me why you can accept them? Is it because you will feel superior whenever you compared yourself with these people? Is it because you pitied and despised them because they had a sexual disorder like a handicap and you don't?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Don't come and tell me how you can accept them! Tell me how you really cared for them!</p>
              <p>Tell me then, can you still accept them if they became the majority and your sexual preference became the minority?</p>

              <p>IF TS knows what is making her upset, then why would she need
              you or me or anyone else to advise her? Why would she even need to
              post a topic about it if she doesn't need genuine help?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Oh...are you trying to say that by behaving like a hypocritical
              clown/jester in her topic is really going to cheer her up?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ok, if that's the case...can you please go and juggle some balls
              instead? You're so useless in here!</p>

              <p><br>Told you already that you are unable to tell me what is the root clause of TS's agony.</p>
              <p>I wouldn't be a hypocrite like you who only want to help with kind words but wouldn't want to spend a bit more of your time and brain to think of the root clause that is really causing pain and agony to TS.</p>
              <p>Why do you even want to talk so much? I have nothing more to talk to hypocrite self-righteous people like you who only want to help people on the surface so that you can come and behave high and mighty towards me who has exposed you.</p>
              <p>Not going to waste time correcting you, but be mindful that how you treated and advised others with your couldn't-care-less hypocrite mindset, it will all come back to haunt you in your future.</p>
              <p>Maybe next time, people will also love to help you only on the surface...just like how you have helped others.</p>
              <p>At least I will. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
