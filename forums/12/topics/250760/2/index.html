Of course it helps that you express views similar to mine.<br><br>I have no comments about the lack of passion but AA has to exist within sgforums. Because there will always be forumites who come online to post about their emotional problems and baggages. So rather than have it all over the place, it's good to have consolidate such similar posts together.<br><br>This is basically a different issue altogether regarding the purpose of AA, but to put it in a way, AA wasn't set-up so that it was easier for resident AAs to give advise. It was more to control traffic, or at least that's what I think. So whether or not the Mod can or give advice isn't important, it's how he or she controls the traffic. Like you said, jaga.</div>
