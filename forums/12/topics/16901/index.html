            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Larry and Bear,<br><br>I guess I ought to say something here. I would to say.. "Thanks."<br>I mean yeah.. thanks. But then... as Bear has pointed out... in his last post... I would like to state one of my reasons why i removed the posting as well.<br><br>Assuming I posted irrelevant materials that are not provoking, not flaming anyone, yes it was my mistake that I posted it in a folder that is strictly has no direct relation with it. But before I posted that one, I had this decision of removing it once there is a negative response (negative response doesn't indicate people giving thumbs down for the story - i know my story sucks, but if people disapprove me posting it.)<br><br>Once there is a disapproval, if I persist, I am sure that will lead to conflicts. Some has to step back for avoiding these. Then I guess since I am the one who started, I will be the one who finishes it, at least while it's still peaceful enough. We sure don't want this folder to end up like "Chit-Chat" right? I am not saying that Chit-Chat folder is bad too, but it's just sometimes... plain quarrels and flaming which I don't really enjoy too. FYI : I was from there as well, and I was a forumnite starting from year 1999. But then somebody took away my password. Anyway, It doesn't really matter anymore. (And pardon me for no-paragraphs for this last part) The two last folders that I like most is still 93.3 FM and Aunt Agony. Except for occasional posting that seems freako -- you all know which one it is... these two are the nicest folders in this forum. yeah, cheers for Bear for being a good moderator *Wink*<br><br>Okay, I guess those are the things wanted to say for the replies from Larry and Bear. Pardon me for not being able to converse in perfect English. ^_^  but still I hope you can understand.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Bluey<br><br>[This message has been edited by little bluey (edited 22 May 2001).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Little Bluey,<br><br>Glad u can see things in the same light with us... =)<br><br>Well another way of going into it is to look for an irrelevant topic and and post it in there. then it wun be seen in the main channel, but the topic will be updated and pple will still click on the topic and thus read it. Either that, I can change start a topic saying things like 'Creative Corner' or something like sort. then we will know wat's it abt.... =)<br><br>Another reason it could have upset the forum, could be all this was just too sudden. Ur replies in this forum is somewhat limited, hence we are not used to the invasion of a irrelevant topic. It's a flaw in human, we just dun like to have too many impromptu things in our lives.<br><br>Anyway, I'm not a moderator here. In fact, there's no moderator for AA at the moment.
