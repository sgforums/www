She wouldn't be "experienced" in this area, &amp; will need alot of guidance &amp; reassurance. In a way, she's like a teenager You'll need alot of patience to be able to draw her out.<br><br>Hamster's like that too, but it doesn't matter to me. As long as I know he's with me, I don't really care what others think. Besides, he needs his space. If your gf doesn't want to come out with us, I suppose that's fine? Ultimately, if she really feels uncomfy, we wouldn't wanna impose. It's just that, it's a pity We don't get to see your special 1?<br><br>I understand that things are quite intense in the beginning of a relationship, but there're times we hafta be abit laidback, you know? At least that's how I've managed to keep Hamster happy He doesn't get forced into doing something he doesn't wanna do. But in return, he can't press me into doing something I'd rather Not do either<br><br>FeowFeow"<br><br>Yeah you are right i should give her a chance cos she is still young...<br>She just keep using lots of excuse to avoid meeting my friends lor haiz. what can I do....
