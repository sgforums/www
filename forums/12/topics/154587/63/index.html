            <div class='col-md body'>Boys &amp; Girls<br>These are some facts about girls:<br><br>When a girl says that she's sad, but she isn't crying, it means that she's crying in her heart.<br><br>When she ignores you after you've done something wrong, it's best to give her some time to cool down before touching her heart with an apology.<br><br>A girl can't find anything to hate about the boy she loves (which is why it is so hard for her to 'get over him' after the relationship's over.)<br><br>If a girl loves a boy, he will always be on her mind every minute of the day, even though she flirts with other guys.<br><br>When the boy she likes smiles and stares deep into her eyes, she will melt.<br><br>A girl likes to hear compliments, but usually not sure how to react to them.<br><br>When a particular boy flirts with a girl very often, a girl would start thinking the boy likes her. So if you treat a girl just as a friend, go easy on the smiles and stare ok?<br><br>If you don't like a girl who likes you, break it to her gently.<br><br>If a girl starts avoiding you after you reject her, leave her alone for a while. If you still treat her as a friend, talk to her.<br><br>Girls enjoy talking about what they feel. Music, poetry, drawings and writing are ways of expressing themselves (which explains why most girls like writing journals).<br><br>Never tell a girl that she is useless in anyway.<br><br>Being too serious can turn a girl off.<br><br>When the boy she likes calls her for the first time, the girl may act uninterested during the call. But as soon as the phone is back on the hook, she will whoop with joy and immediately start telephoning her friends to spread the news.<br><br>A smile means a lot to a girl.<br><br>If you like a girl, try making friends with her first. Let her get to know you.<br><br>If a girl says she can't go out with you because she has to study, leave.<br><br>But if she still calls you or expect a call from you, stay.<br><br>Don't try to guess a girl's feelings. Ask her.<br><br>Hearing the words "I Â¢Â¾ you" is a great reassurance to a girl that she is beautiful.<br><br>After a girl falls in love with a guy, she'll wonder why she never noticed him before.<br><br>If you need tips on how to flirt with a girl, read romance stories.<br><br>When class pictures come out, a girl would first check who is standing next to her crush before actually looking at herself.<br><br>A girl's ex-crush will always be in her memory, but the boy she loves now stays in her heart.<br><br>Girls love having fun!<br><br>A simple 'Hi' can brighten a girl's day.<br><br>A girl's best friends usually knows best what she is feeling and going through.<br><br>Girls hate it when a guy pays attention to them just to get close to their 'prettier' friend.<br><br>Love means devotion, caring and happiness to a girl, in this order.<br><br>Some girls care about looks, some care about brains, but ALL girls want a boy who will love and care for them.<br><br>Girls want nothing more than to feel loved.<br>When girls says:<br><br>FINE<br>This is the word that girls use to end an argument when they are right and you need to shut up.<br><br>FIVE MINUTES<br>If she is getting dressed, this is half an hour.<br>Five minutes is only five minutes if you have just been given five more minutes to watch the game before helping around the house.<br><br>NOTHING<br>This is calm before the storm. This means 'something' and you should be on your toes. arguments that begin with 'Nothing' usually ends in 'Fine'.<br><br>GO AHEAD<br>This is a dare, not permission. Don't do it.<br><br>LOUD SIGH<br>This is not actually a word, but is a non-verbal statement often misunderstood by boys. A 'Loud Sigh' means she thinks you are an idiot and wonders why she is wasting her time arguing with you over 'Nothing'.<br><br>THAT'S OKAY<br>This is one of the most dangerous statements that a girl can make to a boy. 'That's Okay' means that she wants to think long and hard before deciding on how and when you will pay for your mistake.<br><br>THANKS<br>A girl is thanking you. Do not question it or faint. Just say you're welcome.<br>Never do these to girls:<br><br>make her cry (never ever let a girl drop a tear for you!)<br><br>compare her with other girls (the least thing you want to do!)<br><br>let her wait (this is very important!)<br><br>raise your voice at her (if you don't want her to leave you!)<br><br>neglect her (try it and she'll say goodbye!)<br><br>force her (no forcing please!)<br><br>humiliate/insult/criticise her (that's the worse!)<br><br>order her (she's your girlfriend, not your maid!)<br><br>show her disrespect (we girls need respect like you boys too!)<br><br>lie to her (please be honest! honesty is the best policy in relationship!)<br><br>leave her alone (she needs you every now and then!)<br><br>pretend (be the real you!)<br><br>be insensitive (girls are sensitive, so please be sensitive towards us!)<br><br>be domineering (never even be possesive!)<br><br>take her for granted (although she's yours now, but treat her sweet!)<br><br>rank her with your friends (she's always number 1 in your heart!)<br><br>sleep with other girls (ha, if you want her to leave you, do it by all means!)<br><br>forget the goodbye kiss (leave her a lingering feeling!)<br><br>forget to hug (girls love hugs!)<br><br>forget the 3 words 'I Â¢Â¾ you' (this means a lot to them!)<br><br>spend her money (boys, be take the initiative to buy her clothes etc! so she'll be pleased)<br>What boys should do:<br><br>Boys should NEVER make a girl waits.<br><br>Boys should ALWAYS BE THERE for their girl.<br><br>Boys should NEVER LIE, because the girls are SMART these days.<br><br>Boys should ALWAYS be the BEST in everything, so that the girl can learn from boy, but don't be too arrogant.<br><br>Boys should be MORE patient and understanding when its the "time of the month" for the girls. They tend to have MOOD swings.<br><br>Boys should learn how to SHOW more AFFECTION to their love ones.<br><br>Boys should ALWAYS take the FIRST step.<br><br>Boys should MAKE DECISIONS. Don't say " don't know or anything " Girls like boys who can make decisions, whether is where to eat or go or do. Girls can give opinions but not EVERYTIME when the both of u go out.<br><br>Boys should try to SEND their girl home from school or work if they have the time despite the distance..<br><br>Boys should learn to call and sms their girl any time of the day &amp; nigth. Basically give their girl the sense of SECURITY. That is what girls want from most of their boy.<br><br>Boys should TRY to let their girl know where and what their doing all the time. So should the girl.<br><br>Boys should NEVER flirt around too much. Everyone would know that you are a jerk. Girls can gossip quite a lot.<br><br>Boys should learn to be MORE passionate.<br><br>Boys should KNOW their girl's contact numbers by heart.<br><br>Boys should NEVER force their girl to do anything that they don't want.<br><br>Boys should always TALK to their girl about their made-decisions and ask feelings about it.<br><br>Boys should NEVER always expect a GIRL to tell them WHAT THEY DID WRONG, when EVERYTHING was WRONG.<br><br>Boys should NEVER be ignorant!<br>How to tell if a boy likes a girl:<br><br>The boy will try to make you laugh.<br><br>He'll flirt with you when he can.<br><br>He might try to show off around you.<br><br>He'll help you out, if you ask for it.<br><br>He'll stick up for you when you need it most.<br><br>He'll be friendly to you and all your friends.<br><br>He might call you for no good reason.<br><br>He might make fun of you, in a joking way.<br><br>He'll tell you that you did good, even if you did horrible.<br><br>He'll make eye contact with a happy grin on his face.<br>How to tell if a girl likes a boy:<br><br>The girl will laugh at all your jokes.<br><br>She'll stare at you with a smile on her face.<br><br>She'll ask you who you like, continuously.<br><br>She might try to make you jealous.<br><br>She'll beg that you do everything for her.<br><br>She might start talking to your friends.<br><br>She'll talk to you about the different varieties of guys.<br><br>She'll always seem to be talking about how nice you are.<br><br>She'll always be flirting with every other guy except you.<br><br>She'll always ask what to do in a bad situation.<br>What a girl's action means:<br><br>If a girl cries in front of you, it means that she couldn't take it anymore.<br><br>If you take her hand, she would stay with you for the rest of your life; If you let her go, she can never go back to being herself anymore.<br><br>A girl won't cry easily, except in front of the person who she love the most, she becomes weak.<br><br>A girl won't cry easily, only when she love you the most, she put down her ego.<br><br>Boys, if a girl cried because of you, please hold her hands firmly, she's the one who would stay with you for the rest of your life.<br><br>Boys, if a girl cried because of you, please don't give her up, maybe because of your decision, you'll ruin her life.<br>Signs of boys fallen in love:<br><br>He willingly do anything n everything for his beloved.. with sincerity not coercion.<br><br>He constantly wants to humour his beloved and tends to be more talkative.<br><br>He tends to advise his beloved more as he truly loves her and wants her to be a better person<br><br>He tries to restrict her freedom due to his overwhelming jealousy.<br><br>He constantly fears losing his beloved.<br><br>He always monitors his beloved's movements as he feels insecure.<br><br>He hates the idea of other guys being close to his beloved.<br><br>He becomes jealous and sensitive when his beloved pays less attention to him.<br><br>He becomes the most hardworking person and helps his beloved to do anything and everything.<br><br>He becomes restless wen his beloved's away for too long.<br><br>He cares for his beloved more than he does for himself.<br><br>He constantly asks if his beloved loves him as he feels his love is greater than his beloved's.<br><br>He would not be bothered with other girls who don't hold any importance to him.<br><br>He will try to spend a lot of time with his beloved even though he knows he'll end up waiting for his beloved.<br><br>He praises his beloved in front of others.<br><br>If his beloved leaves him, he can't trust any other girl and wishes for his beloved to come back to him.<br><br>When there is a third party, he loses his mind and is willing to do anything to fight for his beloved.<br><br>He makes sure he ensures her safety at all times.<br><br>He is like a small kid who fights for constant attention from his beloved.<br><br>He treats his beloved as his most trusted one and willing to sacrifice all of his wealth and even his life for her.<br><br>He keeps asking his belove whether she loves him not.<br>When a girl:<br><br>When a GIRL is quiet,<br>Millions of things are running in her mind.<br><br>When a GIRL is not arguing,<br>She is thinking deeply.<br><br>When a GIRL looks at u with eyes full of questions,<br>She is wondering how long you will be around.<br><br>When a GIRL answers "i'm fine" after a few seconds,<br>She is not at all fine.<br><br>When a GIRL stares at you,<br>She is wondering why you are lying.<br><br>When a GIRL lays on your chest,<br>She is wishing for you to be hers forever.<br><br>When a GIRL calls you everyday,<br>She is seeking for your attention.<br><br>When a GIRL wants to see you everyday,<br>She wants to be pampered.<br><br>When a GIRL sms's u everyday,<br>She wants you to reply at least once.<br><br>When a GIRL says I love you,<br>She means it.<br><br>When a GIRL says that she can't live without you,<br>She has made up her mind that you are her future.<br><br>When a GIRL says "i miss you",<br>No one in this world can miss you more than that.<br><br>When a GIRL cries because of you,<br>She is the person who loves you the most.<br>Type of girls:<br><br>HARD-DISK Girls:<br>She remembers everything, FOREVER.<br><br>RAM Girls:<br>She forgets about you, the moment you turn her off.<br><br>WINDOWS Girls:<br>Everyone knows that she can't do a thing right, but no one can live without her.<br><br>SCREENSAVER Girls:<br>She is good for nothing but at least she is fun!<br><br>INTERNET Girls:<br>Difficult to access.<br><br>SERVER Girls:<br>Always busy when you need her.<br><br>MULTIMEDIA Girls:<br>She makes horrible things look beautiful.<br><br>CD-ROM Girls:<br>She is always faster and faster.<br><br>E-MAIL Girls:<br>Every ten things she says, eight are nonsense.<br><br>VIRUS Girls:<br>Also known as "WIFE";
