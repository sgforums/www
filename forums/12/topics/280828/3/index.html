Though like I said, when coaxing after an hour didn't work, I begged - which as you said, wrong wrong wrong. Kept sending her smses asking how was her day, that i missed her badly.

When a girl realises how strong you are when you can live without her, she might consider you again.<br><br>But...<br><br>hounding her again especially now is a waste of time, energy and effort. That's why it's best to not contact her at all. Recollect your thoughts and recompose yourself again. You need to get back to being yourself and be in the best moods possible.<br><br>For me, when it's over, it over for her too. I don't know how to give you an estimation. It can be 6 months or 3 months or one year. And the reason she wants to be with you may not be because she still loves you. It could be because she is also lonely and she cannot find another guy.<br><br>But the most important thing now is: rebuild your life again without her because girls absolutely hate needy dudes.<br><br>doko</div>
