If somebody treats us well, we like them. If they kick us in the ass, we don't.<br><br>It's good that you can find the inner peace to move on, and I'm glad your pain is subsiding at an exponential rate,<br>but it sounds rather MCP to not love the girl just because she is no longer in love with you, without fully acknowledging the reasons behind it.<br><br>Knowing you're at fault doesn't necessarily mean you want to take full responsibility for that. And the fact that you're healing exponentially fast may mean you have not fully learnt the lessons behind it.<br><br>Actually, we guys usually have lots of pride, and if I lost a girl I really love, I may lack the courage and the humility to truly recover the lost trust and love. Moving on is perhaps better.<br><br>Alright, all in all, I'm happy you're recovering, but your love for her may be somewhat shallower than what I had imagined (since you missed the old love she has for you, rather than her, the person), and it might be the best solution for everyone because like you said, she's happier without you.<br><br>Take care, pal..<br><br></div>

And i dont really like it cuz it somehow pretentious.</div></blockquote>Well, since you haven't come across it, perhaps I need to go and check it again.<br><br>I would agree that the book teaches you to focus on your goals, and not be a "nice loser" anymore. To a certain extent, that is very good to some people.<br><br>And I'm glad you benefit from it, and have the maturity to think about how best to achieve any goals you set for yourself.<br><br>For the first bold part, I would say that the difference between evil and good is an ultra-thin line. In the past, I have hated someone to the extent of hurting him before, now that's evil. When I clear those thoughts and focus on thoughts of compassion, now that's good. My point is nobody who walks on the surface of this earth is inherently good or evil. It's what you think, say, and do that makes you evil/good at a particular point of time. There are examples of murderers who are filial sons or good fathers.<br><br>For the second bold part, I strongly agree that being pretentious is useless and meaningless, but if you don't like someone, you don't have to be rude to him, nor do you have to pretend to like him. A curt acknowledgement will do.<br><br>That's just my opinion. Thanks.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's been more than a week since I last updated. Thanks to everyone who sent me PMs.<br><br>I do intend to remain her guardian angel no matter what happens in the future; that's the least I can do for her, after all that she's done for me and the way in which I treated her.<br><br>However, I have let go. Completely. I spoke to her some time ago, and she has changed, or at her attitude to me has at least - she doesn't harbour any feelings for me anymore. Further, I've been hearing so much about how happy she is from everyone, and how much she has moved on.<br><br>With each time I receive news about her, the more it hurts; but at the same time, because of the nature of what I'm hearing, I'm letting go more and more and I find my feelings fading day by day because the girl I knew and loved is gone. Not to mention I am still deeply hurt by the fact that just days after our break up I caught her in the arms of another guy. If we were in a relationship I would have no doubt he might have been just consoling her, but the fact we weren't only points to me that she has moved on. I don't care what her sister says or what any other girl does - I spoke with my female colleagues and friends and they have all denounced that act; which only proves to me that she has changed and moved on.<br><br>I have let go. The further I let go, the more I wonder where my true feelings lie. On some nights, when I'm not careful enough to focus, I just end up driving around and thinking about her ... so far I've burned almost $150 like this.<br><br>Yet at the same time, I think about all that has happened, and what I saw/heard, I question myself, that even if she one day wants to come back, would I really want her back? Am I someone she can just abandon on a whim, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">have her fun</span> and expect to be there when she returns?<br><br>I've been talking to the opposite sex beyond a work/friend relationship; because of my conflict in feelings, I don't exactly know why I am doing that. I myself believe it's because seeing how she's moved on ... I don't want to be left behind. Does this make me a bad person?<br><br>Does the fact I question like this make me a bad person?<br></div>
