            <div class='col-md body'>I have read your post and I find that she must have just snapped during the 4 years. She just can't stand you anymore before she dropped this bombshell. In her head, it's like enough is enough.<br><br>She must leave.<br><br>I don't know what you did or said that made her feel that way or how you managed to chase her. Fact is, there is something you did or said or it's part of your character that made her feel this way. Maybe she compared with other guys and felt there's better choice..but the most important thing that matters is that she has left you. Maybe she realised that there is something in your character that she realised isn't working for her...<br><br>This means that you are single and free to do things you like and want. And you get to chase another girl again.<br><br>The problem with girls is that they give ambiguous answers that leave you feeling more confused as evident in female posters in forums. Not all, I would like to say. So when you still don't know why you are suddenly alone, Im really not surprised. Some female posters will give you answers that leaves you feeling more frustrated. This is their language.<br><br>Im sorry but girls behave this way. Once they say goodbye, it often means forever. Worse is, you actually begged her to come back to you. You just nailed yourself further into the coffin of relationships. Don't worry, your case is not isolated. Many guys share the same problems with you. If they can get through this, I don't see why you cannot.<br><br>doko</div>
