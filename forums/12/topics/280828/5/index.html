            <div class='col-md body'>I can tell u la . It is over lo. You just make her interest rate towards you to a big fat ZERO. Normally MCP will get her interest rate high enough for a period of time. Because ur MCP shows that u are a MAN. woo. Non-MCP members are people who knows to say sorry when they know they are wrong and maintain ur posture or view when ur girlfirend is wrong. This prevent u to be wussy or MCP but maintain ur image as a MAN. But after certain amount of ur MCP 'torture' , she started to hate u a bit by a bit , dropping interest rate bit by bit. This hate accumlate like a volcano , once erupted it is over . So like i say , leave her alone. But u may try the "backdoor attack". Backdoor attack means attack her best friend lo. After a few weeks which is a cooldown period, contact her best friend and say that you are regretting and hope that she give chance. Dun approach her directly. She may still hate you. Females will remember all da bad things u do to her 4ever unlike we guys forgive and forget easily.

            <div class='col-md body'>Ohx... I see... I get the whole picture now...<br><br>Bro... I can say it's not your fault, entirely. And you are not exactly the bad guy you made yourself to be. So what if this is a long term relationship? There is no guarantee in everything, not even marriages. People still cheat. In this case it's her. Yes, she's two-timing you. It could not have just happened so fast. You really believe what she had just said? The guy was just comforting her? Oh what a good load of bullcrap! She was so considerate to let you know. Thank her for it.<br><br>But I want to know this:<br><br>I don't know what you mean by saying it's your fault by being MCP. To what degree is your MCP? Do you control her freedom? If so, to what degree? Do you restrict who she sees?<br><br>This is how it happens I think.<br><br>All along she was pretending to be in love with you while still dating that guy. You see she could not confirm her relationship with that guy. Actually she already knows she wants him before she so-called snapped.<br><br>During the course of the 4-year relationship with her, she got tired of you somewhere in Year 2 due to some reason, maybe due to the mcp reason or a combination of factors. At this point of time, she probably found other guys cuter than you but she wouldn't tell you that of course.<br><br>In Year 4, she found this guy so cute that she knows who she wants. Of course she still needs you in case their relationship fails. That means, you are the backup if she is back to square one.<br><br>This explains why she was so lovey-dovey before she suddenly snapped. There's no such thing as a sudden snap. Get it?? In other words, she should have snapped before this but she was just trying to tolerate you until she has confirmed her relationship with the guy. What a good actress!<br><br>Now I suggest you put yourself into a good state of mind to do the things you want and live the life you live before this break up.<br><br>-Do not think of her.<br>-Do not think how different she is now compared to before.<br>-Do not think of other girls.<br>-Do delete all links with her, her pictures, videos, etc<br>-Do enjoy your life.<br>-Go for a holiday with or without friends whatever that suits you.<br>-Basically you need a lot of time to heal your life.<br>-This woman has drained so much energy from you, you need to take a break from all women. You need to find something that can help you forget her. Do what works for you.<br><br>doko</div>
