            <div class='col-md body'>I've been dating this guy for 2 years. Well... For the past 2 years, our relationship didn't improve much.... No ups and downs, just plain straight, constant relationship. When we were in school, we don't meet up and do what other couples do, like having lunch together,study together, etc. People doubt that we are couple. To me and this guy, we don't really like doing such thing in school, esp in school uniform. But because of this, we end up not meeting each other often.. In 2 years' time, we only went out for about 10 times.<br><br>Recently, I confronted him. I told him that he doesn't really care about how i feel. I don't feel special in him and sadly, he has been rejecting me when i asked him out. Although it's alright for girls to make the first move, but when the other party keep rejecting, you will really get sick of asking him again. When I tell him about this, he said:'I'm really busy and i seldom go out even when i'm free.' Yes, he didn't go out with people even when he's free. Okay, let me ask u guys out there, do u wish to see ur gf when ur free? Or maybe just spend ur day with her? I believe most of u will agree with it but not him. It's been around.. 6 months since we last went out.<br><br>The idea of breaking has been in my mind for months, my friends persuade me to leave him. I choose not to. I don't wish to break his heart, he still loves me, just that he's a homely person and don't understand me at times.<br><br>He just can't compromise me, I know that i won't be happy if it continues. So should i leave him or continue with it? Should i care about my feelings or his feelings?<br></div>

BUT! we mature mentally slower than you ladies.<br>So, your BF (16? holy cow! so young!) is probly thinking bout game boy, PS2 or soccer more often than you. If he's close to you now... it's only for.. ahem... sexualy needs. Imagine a sexually matutred body with the mind of a child.<br>Sorry for being direct... but let's be adult bout this. The rest of the advices are right, you should learn to relax, make more friends, concentrate on your school instead. I know because I am one of the dumb asses who neglected school .. fooled around in NCC and landed up with a sucky job!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
