She may be afraid tt u spend too much time on ur gf and neglect her. i would think shes lonely and under alot of stress to handle things by herself.<br><br>She might not wan to tell u as she dun wan u to worry.=) One thing u got to get clear, sometimes we children cant interfere in parents matters. Though we may want to help, but we haf to noe tt at times its best to leave things to them. We just be there for them can l. dun worri, she will tell u when she wants to. =) And dun haf to worry, i think she likes ur gf lah, she just mayb dun wan to accept her for now. She lost her hubby rem? Its like someone getting hurt in a rls... and its more than tt... =) cheer up eh?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hey buddy, a word of advise. I believe it goes out the same for everyone out there who has a mum.<br><br>I have all my respects to Mums coz they have suffer so much to bring you into this world. The next time when YOU are celebrating yr birthday outside with yr friends, do take just a few moments to understand this, YOU are now celebrating the date your Mum has went thru, the greatest pain in delivery you out of this world. 10 mths of burdens and a few hours of extreme pain is not an easy task for a woman. Whatever your Mum has done or behaves, you have to take steps to note the problems. Take it as a challenge for you and yr GF. Sit down and discuss with her what might be the problem. Also, understand how she feels from the way yr mum treats her. We, man, are the most pitiful creatures on earth if we are ever stuck between 2 women, Mum and Wife... get it clear. Life sucks BIG TIME!!! : <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

As ur her only son, she might be upset that ur getting older day by day, therefore leaving her soon. At the first place u shldn't confront ur mom abt her attitude towards ur gf, this will only make her think u take ur gf more importantly then her. Thus making her very disappointed &amp; heartache. As ur mom i guess she has a little right to show her displease or disapprove of any particular girl u bring home.<br>Spare a thought for her. When she get old she can only depend on u to be there for her( ur father is no longer ard). She is ur mom that brought u up in a single parent family all these years. Being rude to her cos of ur gf is the last thing u shld to do her.<br>Think again ur mom that brought u up all these years or a gf u know for years?</div>

Don't just assume she should know or she will know. Communicate with her well. Tell her straight in the face if there are things you don't like or things which you think should be done otherwise.

            <div class='col-md body'>To Daiki:<br><br>I understand what you mean. I DO respect my mom. She is my onli kin now in this world. Say if i dont care about this, i wouldn't even have this emotion, wun have post this problem in the forum right? It's not like.. 1 time.. nor its 2 time.. it's hell lot of time i have been tolerant.<br><br>Actually those who is close to me, like my relatives. They all know about my mom's attitude. She is one stubborn woman. Imagine your own mom saying my father's side uncles "wu lai" and aunties as "those who onli like to eat people's money".. how will u feel? She always have the concept that my father's side relative is out to "eat us up". Seriously we dun have any valuable thing to steal loh. <strong>And</strong>, my father's side is always the one taking care of mi, being more understanding den my mom's side. My uncle have always tried talking to her, saying logical stuff, explaining that they are concern about us. Instead of being gratitude, she treat them as "hypocrite". I tried to defend my mom, says because her education level is not high, so cant blame her. But even sometimes, i myself also cannot tahan her ignorance.<br><br>To BLIM and bjork:<br><br>I told her about my galfren before i bring her home. She was the one that wants mi to bring her home. When my galfren came, its quite cool. But i realli dunnoe wad happen to her when my galfren goes home? I remember once, my mom says this "Dont always bring a stranger home hor.. hen jian(despicable) ni dong bu dong?"<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Once again, she is setting my galfren as an outcast where my galfren did absolutely zero things to agitate my mom.<br><br>If i have the chance to talk to her, i already did. Like i said earlier, we either will end up quarrelling or she will simply walk away. These days i have been very tolerant. I already minimise my anger, tell myself not to quarrel with her anymore. I talk to her nicely yet she says i very noisy.<br><br>Talk about greiving over my decease dad, i hav to add there is this "uncle" who often come to our house. I know they are obviously having an unusual relationship. Base on my knowledge and the things i caught them doing. I tried to act blur, i try to cover up. I told nth to my relatives because i dont wanna invite gossips. She bring someone home, fine.. so be it. I bring <strong>galfren</strong> home, she bu shuang?<br><br>To Homebody:<br><br>I will try again. I know everyone is inperfect.. I also wish i could settle this once and for all. But things just dun go my way.. what to do?<br><br>To 798:<br><br>Thanks for pointing out. She did mention that i didnt have a career yet and still going out to find a galfren. I mean, please loh, what generation is it now? Wait until got career then find galfren? When until rich den find galfren? 10 years later? 20 years later? Oh god, i cant wait that long.<br>And i already found her.. realli realli love her.. cant lose her now... Anyway i think my galfren is the source of motivation that makes mi work hard now... serious.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i hear you saying repeatedly that you are the only son. You are very hurt by your mother's behaviour. I too, am of the opinion that your mother feels threatened that she might be losing her only son to another woman. And perhaps the reason she behaved badly despite agreeing to have your GF come visit is because your GF is really good! the better your GF, the higher the chances of losing you. And perhaps why she didn't want your name in the new flat is becaues security is a very important thing to her. Especially when she lost her husband, the main breadwinner years ago. As much as she might yearn for a companion (like you), she cannot bear to let you go. I know that you are feeling very angry, and ?betrayed. You'd rather seek your GF for comfort. However, remember, whatever happens, the mother-son relationship cannot be undone. But any BGR, any marriage, can.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Like all others have said, ur mom might feel that ur gf is a threat of snatching ur attention to her away, so that's y she feel so negative abt u having a gf...<br><br>Basically, I believe everything can be sort out if you should have enuff patient to persuade or convince her. Most important, you must understand her situation of bringing you up alone after ur dad's departure. Every single parents would want the best for their children especially in bringing them with happiness. But too, they would most wanted their kids to understand them.<br><br>Perhaps ur mum belongs to the type that keeps problems to herself so as not to let you worry/ even stress out.
