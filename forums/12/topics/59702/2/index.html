            <div class='col-md body'>To justfourseasons:<br><br>A very wonder piece of advice from you. However i guess the point where you mention <strong>"the mother-son relationship cannot be undone. But any BGR, any marriage, can."</strong> is not really true though.<br><br>Heard of divorcing? What about parents disowning their children? Perhaps at this stage of life, my mom and i haven reach the stage that we will hate eachother, but seriously if that's the way she is gonna carry on behaving, that will take her no where ba?<br><br>To ivan|:<br><br>Very sad to hear that story from you. Didnt come across many broken families before maybe becoz my dad died when i was at a very young so there's rare chance of me hearing divorce case around.<br><br>Anyway, Its not that i dont show patience and understand her. Its just that i had know her for 18 years of life already, the way she behave and her character, its already like "lai ru zhi zhang". Like i say before, i already tried talking to her, and also try not to quarrel with her. Sometimes her words are really harsh, but i put up with it becoz i believe quarrel cant solve anything. But what i get is only disappointment.<br><br>This morning, i was getting pocket money from my mom(i quited my partime work for 3 months for exams and projects), she was telling mi to sign in a book before i take the money. I was like "WTF? does u need to be so calculative??" Last time she did want mi to sign in the book when i took money from her, but since i worked, i didnt take money so didnt touch the book anymore. Her reason for mi signing it up is : "Next time u dun return mi the money how? I give u so much later next time u run away how am i gonna take back from u?" Haiz... its so crappy loh.. everything she do makes mi realise how ignorant she is. She give mi the impression that <strong>she give mi money onli becoz she is my mother. </strong><br><br>I must add that there's times where she is very ncie to mi, buy food for mi.. blah blah blah.<br><br>To looksee:<br><br>Parents may not be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">always</span> right. If they are always correct, why do parents and children quarrel all the time? If they are a<span style="text-decoration: underline;">lways</span> correct why do they seperate their child from seeing someone they like? And last of all, if they are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">always</span> right, why do some end up divorcing?<br><br>But ya..i will spend time telling my mom about my gf.. hope it helps.. haiz.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>SoonKeong:<br><br>What I'm gonna say next is not going to be easy to do, and will even draw disapprovement from many here. But its what I think I would do if I'm in your position. (Actually, I have a similar experience of my mum being unreasonable).<br><br>1) Talk to your mum nicely what you feel.<br>2) Most likely, halfway thru, you'll be quarrelling, or feel that she is being impossible.<br>3) Then just blow it out. Quarrel like mad. Don't need to with-hold too much, but no vulgarities, just say out whatever's on your mind (but of course not things that will hurt her badly, or insults, like maybe say she stupid. but more like, " You always want me to do what you want, but you never thought of what I wanted", that kind)<br>4) Then, cool down. Go out.<br>5) Go somewhere else to stay for the night ( or several nights).<br>6) Call home before 12am, to tell her you are not going home tonight or for few nights.<br>7) Give her all sort of excuses why you don't wanna go home.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> After a few days, go home and see if she has sort out her thoughts.<br><br>I know some will think that its bad advise, but, seriously, how would she know the importance of listening to her son, till its too late? I'm not saying that mothers should let their son do whatever they like, but, parents need to know that children do grow up to become adults, and when their kids become (or is at the stage of becoming one) they no longer control them. They become their children's advisers. They can advise, but, they can'y control. If they do not learn their changing role, its inevitable that their kids will sometimes hate them for not understanding (who can tell me you have never hated your parents before? not very long, but for that split second, you feel that you didn't love them?)<br><br>its not easy to let go of your cutie little pie, but, parents will have to learn to let them go a little, so that they will come back. everyone needs space. their kids need space, they need the space too.<br><br>going away for awhile will make her sort her thoughts out. my aim for the above actions is to let parents realised that they cannot tie their child to them forever. The more they are afraid of losing their son, the faster they gonna lose him. if they give him a little more understanding, their son will definitely come back to his mum and remember her as a understanding mother.<br><br>true, maybe your gf and you may not be forever. but, i'm sure she will not be the only one in your life in the case where the both of you can't make it (I'm just saying if, not cursing you) the next one will come, and your mum still need to deal with it anyway. she will still act the same way, until something drastic happens. rather than watch you start to hate your mother day-by-day, and at the end of the day run off without her, why don't you do something to let her know, she is making life unbearable for you, and you really don't wish to go, just that she needs to give in a little, and you give in a little?<br><br>*Throw rotten eggs at me, I don't care. I won't take this down. I rather being labelled unfilial, than <b>acting unfilial</b>. I've been there done that, I don't hate my mum, and she understands my stand, and i understand hers as well. *</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's a sad thing that you wanted to fell out with your mother over your gf. Do you think it's worth it? Your mother has been with you since you were born.<br><br>How old are you now? Maybe she's trying to protect you from being hurt. All mothers do that. If you find that things that she said are not very nice and hurtful, sit down and talk to her calmly and listen to her first and tell her your opinion. You just can't quarrel with your mother just like that. Your dad passed away and she's already very upset and what you did upset her even more! If your relationship with your mother is bad, how are you going to get married with your gf in future?<br><br>In this century, lots of people tends to do things when they think it's right. I agree with that. But you have to understand how your mum feels. Your mum branded your gf as an "outsider". To tell you the truth, she's right! <strong>Has your gf married into your family?</strong>  Somtimes you have to weigh which is important. Your mum or your gf? What happens if your mum leave this world?! To you, it's simple by trying to reason out with your mother but in fact you are wrong.<br><br>From what you have said, you are quite young and you want to have your own life which you are still young and inexperienced!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Soon keong,<br><br>Few things to add. Your mother is playing two roles. One as a mother and the other as a father. Do you know how hard is to play these two roles at one time. She's playing the father role in your case involving your gf. If you want your mum to accept your gf, you have to prove your worth! Nothing comes for free!<br><br>You have to show it through actions to prove her points are wrong, then she will be convinced! Otherwise, there's nothing you can do. Your gf is nice and it's good for you. But your mum think otherwise. Your mum doesn't want you to be hurt if anything goes wrong between you and your gf, your mum wll fee hurt . Although her ways are overboard but you have to think she has your welfare at heart! If your gf is understanding, she will tell you or advise you not to go against your mum and both of you have to prove it to her by actions and not just words by arguing with her. It doesn't help and it will only make the matters worst!<br><br>Your friend said that your gf is a nice girl and you agree with them totally! Let me ask you a question, who know better? You or your friends? Being together , you have to observe her character as well! If she's a good girl, she will respect your mother no matter what! If she's not, then you can forget abt it! There are lots of things to learn and it will take time!<br><br>If you want to know my example, you can ask me about how me and my wife go through before marriage......</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey SoonKeong<br>let me clarify "the mother-son relationship cannot be undone. But any BGR, any marriage, can".<br>When a parent has a child, both has no choice wrt the relationship. The parent's blood runs in the child. Yes, the parent can disown the child in legal terms, but the parent cannot deny the fact that the child carries his / her genetic material. Wrt abortion, the mother can abort if she so wishes. However, the story changes once the child is born. On the other hand, the child too cannot choose who he / she wants as parents.<br>As for a marriage / BGR. A break-up / separation / divorce could be on the cards. When that happens, it is a decision / choice on both parties to call it quits. Other than the fact that one used to share one's life with another, there is no other links. That was what I meant as choice. Yes, there might be heartaches and traumas. But one made a choice. And one's blood does not circulate in that partner.<br><br>So, after all that is said and done. Are things better with you?<br>May i ask, what would you do if you were your mother, in her situation? Don't say "i don't know". What exactly would you do / say / feel?</div>
