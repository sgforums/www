Let me share with you what I've been through.<br><br>When I was having s.e.x. with my ex years ago, which was the first time I ever did such a thing as far as I remembered. But the moment when she uttered something to me... something that goes like this, "..honey, I'm not fresh anymore." I was shocked. I paused for a while and that day on, I gave myself some time to think it through.<br><br>Days passed, and I realized that I should get over it and accept her for what she was then. From that day onwards, I made a decision to get over it at once and I did!<br><br>As they all said, it's all in your mind. Also, it's your choice whether you choose to accept or condemn that person.. But as far as I understand, you wouldn't condemn a person you love right? So, get over it bro!!!<br><br>Best of hope!<br><br>S.H.I.N.</div>
