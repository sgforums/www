Lastly, u r frustrated by a lot of things.<br><br>Maybe u should find something to occupy yrself. For instance, try to pick up ECA if u haven't. I'm not saying that doing this is wrong, human being do have their needs and desire. U must learn to control and divert these energies to other things. I know for the initial stage is hard, but dun give up. Juz keep yrself occupy, u tend to let yr mind run wild while u r not doing anything. U can try it by doing something.<br><br>Make more friends. Interact more with yr friends, try go out with them. I'm not an expert, but hope this will help.<br><br>Cheers,<br>takumi<br><br>----------------------------<br><br>nOtHing's fRee....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Oh mind, only 14 and have been masturbating for 2 yrs....... that's kinda young isn't it, and already so deep into such things......<br><br>Dun think u r abnormal as in masturbating everyday. But then, like what yr friend has point out, too much of it will make u look restless and tired, chances of aging older are faster too......<br><br>Read from a mag b4 that masturbation actually relives some stress but too much of it is defintely not going to help. These's no way others can help you to stop other than yrself...... try praticsing some self control, or keep yrself busy in other activities so that the urge wun be so big.<br><br>Keep in mind u r only 14, i am sure u dun wanna look like 25 when u r 18, do you? And also, u r under age for certain act, do bear in mind.<br><br>Nevertheless, wishing u good health and hopefully, leading a more healthy life.<br><br>Regards<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It norm I think, Things will change as u get older...<br><br>actually experts say that pple live longer if sexually aroused. Well, u can't possibly get married at this time. But still they also mentioned that having too much will affect daily life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Ur tiredness is not due the the energy loss, but due to the insufficent sleep at night I suppose... Coz the saying that u feel shagged is actually a false belief, just that it's late at night usually that u do such things.<br><br>------------------<br>Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear</div>
