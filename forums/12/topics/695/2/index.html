            <div class='col-md body'>I like to WARN you people, don't masturbate. Your Mothers and Fathers never tell you not to masturbate, but you know better than them that when you learn to control yourself, you learn the value of SELF-DISCIPLINE. I have to go through NS to learn that. I think people have a tendency to pleasure themselves and SELF-DISCIPLINE gives them a challenge in their lives. IF you dont believe in SELF-DISCIPLINE, someday there can be a BIG PROBLEM.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>If you are what you wrote, then it is a worrying sign. Masturbation is not abnormal but doing it everyday may be a problem. How taught you to Masturbate anyway?. And what are you thinking before you Masturbate are some of the questions to answer. This compulsion in Masturbation may lead to all sorts of activities later on in your life that may affect the rest of your life. Do take care and think carefully before you attempt to do anything.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey, girl.  Don't worry about it.  That's the worst you can do to yourself.  If you enjoy it, go right ahead.  Nobody, but nobody can say to you it's wrong.  This is your own business.  As I said before, the only thing bad about it is if you feel guilty (and you should damn well NOT feel guilty about it) and then worry.  You are normal.  The next worse thing you can do is to avoid masturbation by having sex with a man, at such an early age when you cannot control your feelings and your thoughts.  That would be terrible because you will end up either a nymphomaniac or in the local whorehouse.  God forbid!<br><br>So be normal and enjoy yourself.  And if you get bored with it do some sports, real sports, or go jogging a very long time.</div>
