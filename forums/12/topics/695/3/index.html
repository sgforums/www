            <div class='col-md body'>Hi<br><br>Self intro first, I am a 20 year old guy. Actually I also faced similar masturbation problem during the age between 12 to about 15++. Just like you, I find it hard to control myself and just wanting to do it often, very often maybe worse, 3 times a day I can still remember and lasting 3 months after which I start to tone down. The worst thing was my results during exams are just like roller coaster! I felt guilty over it, at times I ask myself what the f*** am I doing, is this my real nature? NO, I have to fight this thought. My mind was strong enough to prevent myself from doing wrong things. So I start to keep myself BUSY with work. I took up taekwondo, and learn self discipline. Then I posed up another challenge for myself, if I can resist the masturbation urge for 1 day, I will reward myself with something, like buyin some ice-cream to eat. As time goes by, I lengthened my challenge, I can still remember my highest record was 1 month without masturbation, from then I know I have succeeded in self control. Nowadays, I can easily stop masturbation for 3 weeks, even under the influence of porn pics. I am not joking, serious.<br>I kept telling myself that I would not want my parents to worry about me unduly, that's the spirit that keep me fighting on with the temptation.<br>Trust me, if I can do it, so can you, the key once again, KEEP URSELF BUSY, at the end of the day, you will feel tired. Even a dick in front of you, u will show no interest in it after a tired day. Or you can go running everything you start to have the thoughts, run for a kilometre or 2. U will be damn tired and also, try not to be alone in the house, be around with your family or rather if your mother go out to the market, follow her, then you will have no time to think about it. Or you can also ask ur classmates out for revision. Most importantly, never never get bf at this point of the time until you have learn to conquer ur masturbation thoughts. Serious, I have seen a case of tragedy of what can happened if the urge is not under control. I will with-held the name of the case I have seen for privacy purpose.<br>Once again, wish you luck, YOU CAN FIGHT IT!! =0)<br><br>Yours sincerely<br>Grey ( A mix of good and evil )</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you musturbate, that means you are mature enough to know about sex.  Whether enough to be on the safe side or not, I do not know. What makes you want to musturbate and do it everyday? Is it because of somebody, boredom or just lust. In any case, it is still normal and consider healthy. It has nothing to do with loosing your energy but instead will refreshens you after doing it.  You should feel satisfied and happy after your session of musturbation.  I recommend you seek council at school to find the actual cause for your tierdness in school.  Do not worry about telling them about your sexual interest for it will help them more to help you. You may also try eating better diets and getting enough rest.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's perfectly normal to masturbate. I would recommend any parent to discreetly "allow" their child to do it or at least talk to them about doing it. It's self-exploration, we're now so afraid to even say words pertaining to sex. Movies get censored or rated R(A) because of sex. People don't seem to know that it's so perfectly normal that sex is the center of our lives and what makes the world go round. It's just how each and everyone handles it.<br><br>Growing up will always encounter hormonal changes in a teenagers' body. And don't believe all that God crap about sin and how masturbation is related to the Devil etc. It's ALL CRAP! We didn't evolve to have hands reaching down there. If the Gods didn't want us to masturbate, our hands would have been way shorter!<br><br>P/S: If you can't seem to stop doing it, don't bother to. Perfect the art of masturbation! Be a master to your own body!</div>

Your Mothers and Fathers never tell you not to masturbate, but you know better than them that when you learn to control yourself, you learn the value of SELF-DISCIPLINE. I have to go through NS to learn that. I think people have a tendency to pleasure themselves and SELF-DISCIPLINE gives them a challenge in their lives. IF you dont believe in SELF-DISCIPLINE, someday there can be a BIG PROBLEM.<br></div></blockquote>lolx... yes u cannot masturbate in army camps as its illegal against army law. But not when u're at home or outside....  lolxx...</div>
