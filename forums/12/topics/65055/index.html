I would consider him as a best fren. But i think now with all the support and advice from yr guys, i know where i am standing now. Being his best friend, i shall stand behind him so as to give him all of my best support. He's the only friend who i can really talk to inside out, so this is something i would wan to keep and treasure. I shall jus be his punchbag bob haha.. and be there for him whenever he needs me as a friend. That's what happens when he has got conflict with the girl. =) So happy to be back! He is not mine i know but i think at times of trouble, i shall be there for him.</div>
