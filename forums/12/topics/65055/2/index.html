Resemblance of water molecules losing it cohesive bonding.</div></blockquote>U seem to have grasp da meaning of when to hold tight, when to let loose. Its like fishing... To catch da fish U have to rein in &amp; let loose so dat da line wun break. Da "line" here is wat we can refer to as "Frenship"...<br><br>Remember, some things cannot be rushed, da more U desire, da more it may slip thru yr grip... take it easy. no GREAT frenship is brom from a dae. it takes time. learn to trust him &amp; he will trust U in return.
