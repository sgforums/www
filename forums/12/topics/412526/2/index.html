              <p><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> You are affected because you perceived that they are being rude to your girlfriend. On the surface that appears to be the case, but part of that ruffled emotion is attributed to the fact that you subtly conceded to their perspective, hence the anger.  </p>
              <p>If you violently react on your part, what happen is that you subconsciously acknowledge their fact and you made that matter to you. The truth is that we cannot cease people from bitching about us (or our partner) and your role as a boyfriend is not to convince the world that your woman is beautiful to them, but rather, it's beautiful because you love her for who she is.</p>
              <p>P.S: There is a niche is every market - it doesn't matter which partner you choose for as long as you like what you have. Some guys like girls who are on the meaty/fleshy side and if they are comfortable, seriously, why give a damn? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p><br>Firstly, you should kick your girlfriend for not making any efforts to shed those mega-kilos! Does she has no pride to look better when now that she has a boyfriend?</p>
              <p>When she is done and dumped all her mega-kilo watts of fat particles from all the right areas, then all your camp mates will automatically kick themselves when they start to masturbate to and secretly fantasie about your girlfriend. If you're lucky, you will get to kick their ass with better reasons!</p>
              <p>Kicking your camp mates and picking a fight with people when you are on the disadvantage side, will only end up bringing you with more pain and anguish even if you managed to win all the fights.</p>
              <p>She's fat, and it's a problem with our current society, so fix her fat-ness and you won't have a problem or try to maintain your mental balance by convincing yourself "She's fat, so what?" when you are cornered. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Go watch "Shallow Hal", Jack Black was attracted to Gwyneth Paltrow not because he knew she was fat. Either there's something going on with your relationship or you just have a strong fetish for big woman.</p>
              <p>You won't be so affected and concerned by your camp mates if you really can accept your girlfriend even though she is fat.</p>

              <p>why are you angry over what someone else think? i mean like, if the whole world thinks u are dumb, does that really make you dumb? besides, remember the wright brothers, everyone think they are retarded to even think of flying but without them, we won't even have budget airlines now. we won't even go to the moon... just coz others think doesn't mean it is so, simply because reality is a matter of perception... like for example, you think ur gf is fat? maybe you go america and see? she is likely to be thinner than average.</p>
              <p>the other thing i wonder is, what's wrong with being fat? for chris sake, as long as i am healthy and have my limbs intact, i am happy. let me ask you, is it better to be fat and healthy or attractive but dying of sexual diesease such as AIDS?</p>
              <p>sometimes, small things are just so, small things. it's a matter of perspective.</p>

              <p> i believe parnie had summurized her entire post in one sentence which is the last paragraph. she means that if TS really loved her for who she is, TS would be immune to his campmates crude comments, just as i am immune to occasional riducules at me for liking parnie. i dun really care what others said about me in sgf regarding parnie, i simply just feel that parnie is for me, and i go for it, that's all.</p>
