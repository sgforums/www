              <p>Since you chose a gf of a bigger size, then accept it. Sometimes friends will laugh here and there but it may not be anything malicious. If you can't accept it, then maybe u are ashamed of your gf also. Then why choose her in the first place? lol</p>

              <p>No. 2 fully disagree... I think gf is a private decision... and commenting about people's gf infront of them is to a lesser extent similar to commenting about people's mom. Some peeps will giv u an instant Finishing Move for doing that lol. The next time he does that comment about his mom and if he gets angry then tell him to stop commenting about your gf she's your family too hehe.</p>

              everyone to laught. I know what they are laughing at. Because my gf
              is quite fat. I can’t stand that humiliation towards my gf…i was so
              fucking angry on that time till now. I already show my fucking
              attitude to all of them after they laught. But even they say
              sorry,pai seh and what ever, but i don’t think i will meet them
              anymore…this is not the first time already if this happen again i
              think i will fucking puch them hit them one by one..i really endure

              <p>Doom, you should pity your friends who are so immature.</p>
              <p>These are people who are "toxic personality". No good will come from hanging around people like them.</p>
              <p>They are empty inside, so they try to derive some kind of "happiness" by putting down others. Yet they will gain nothing but have lost a friend.</p>
              <p>They make fun of your gf because they do not know what it's like to be in love and to care for someone. So they do not know the hurt they cause.</p>
              <p>A true friend do not hurt another friend.</p>
              <p>True friends are those who are happy because you found happiness.</p>
              <p>Stay away from these few, go find others more deserving of your company.</p>
              <p>No love lost here.</p>
