              <p>ya, tell yur fat gf to be like me, run everyday, but dun run all the way to MacDonald or food centre hor? otherwise become more fat, i see many singaporeans wear nice sport attire like preparing for a long run, but most run and walk to market to eat and do shopping..more worst lor.</p>
              <p>Anyway, having a fat gf, if you really love her, you must be able to take people laughing at you, that is the spirit of love. Fat also good ok, no need to buy bed</p>

              <p>ah, for this, singapore people failed miserably, in taiwan, japan and even korea, we still cultivate the culture that man are the master of the family. Every woman must learn to serve there husband well, man should not do sweeping or washing, cooking is ok, as man cooks well to feed the family, but man sweeping and washing in taiwan or in japan is consider a bad omen, to us, if a man sweep the floor or wash dishes and clothing, it is consider a very poor family and the man will go jobless.</p>
              <p>In older day which is still practice today, my taiwanese mother will take off my Dad shoes, prepare bathing for him, warm up the dishes when my Dad is back from work, I and my brother have to wait until he sit down, eat, then we can start eating in a well manner, later we will have desert and chit chat while watching Tv or playing games together. That is the discipline of taiwanese women, we care for our husband more than sg gal, who only knows how to shop and nag.</p>
              <p>In Japan and taiwan, man going to red light district is a norm, as long as he do not get involve in a relationship it is ok, that is a man need, but in sg, it is consider a bad thing, an affair or a disgrace to the family. That is why there is so many problem in singapore marriages, unlike we taiwanese, we are more caring for man, understand them, and respect them as the master of the family. That make a man proud and in turn motivate him to work harder to help the family and yet can enjoy his life more openly.</p>
              <p>So, if a guy marry me, he is a lucky guy</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>I have met plump people who are nice too. Being overweight is not a crime but it's taxing on your health, coupled with a slew of health problems, aches and pain, plus being overweight tend to age a person. I can say all these cos' I was near obese 3 years ago. The weight just keep piling on, even though I tried to exercise. Gradually my knees were so painful when I climb up and down the stairs, I knew this was the last straw and I was only in my early 30s. My family kept scolding me to lose weight but didn't know what to do. I was desperate, hagged and looked like a 'ah soh'. Even my other half was complaining about how 'bad' I looked beside all those trim and slim women. Guessed how I felt! I really thanked my old friend for inspiring and helping me cos' he lost at least 15 kg of fats and his super round paunch of 30 years was finally gone, as with his HBP and HC. 3 years had gone by since I lost the body fats(not just weight) and is still as trim and healthy as before until now. I look and feel much younger. Don't wait for health problems to crop up. Being overweight is certainly not good for your body and health,and sometimes self-esteem and image. That's why our S'pore government has been placing such a huge emphasis on losing weight and staying healthy. Medical bills are on the high.</p></div>

              <p>For me, slim and thin as always, i had tried to get more fat, make my front more bigger, but to no avail, cos i cannot eat alot, and i hate sugar, i like soup, porridge and fruits alots, drink lots of water, for snack, i love bananas and fishballs.</p>
              <p>I can run very fast, jog, cycle and swim that even my personal doctor cum trainer also asked me to cut down on my exercises, some of my frens told me, after married, give birth to baby, you can get fat with big front, let see how it goes.</p>
