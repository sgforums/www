              <p>Did you buy her from a matchmaking agency ? The agency should have checked her marital background. Chances are, they did and your SG marriage is a valid one.</p>
              <p>Since you mentioned you've visited her in China before, you should be able to find out from the local authorities there about how you can verify her previous marital status.</p>
              <p>If it's a scam, you can sue your matchmaking agency for a full refund, and seek to nulify the SG marriage.</p>
              <p>But then again, you're a fool, and you may not get your recourse.</p>

              <p>Obviously so, but he said he visited China with her before.</p>
              <p>When he said it, I assume he visitted her parents and family members.</p>
              <p>So unless he forgot his trip completely, at the least what he can do, is just to visit again to the same places.</p>
              <p>Now, this will be more complicated if he DIDNT visit her family and relatives.</p>
              <p>If he has no way of contacting her, and no way of contacting her family and relatives, then.....I dont know what he can do, maybe contact Chinese police for help, give them her name, data, address, etc, and say she is a missing person, please help to find and trace her.

              <p>then again, it might be a well thought out strategy from the China wife. Marry, leave country for a few months, make husband desperate, and finally make the move of asking the husband to send money to China because of the "mother".

              <p>Yes, I oso must be careful about PRC woman. I know Angel 7030 likes me, but I fear her intention. Afterward, she run away to Taiwan for another man n open another 290 Joo Chiat bar.</p>
              <p>PRC &amp; Taiwan woman, Sigh...all the same wan.</p>
              <p>Ok, factor to consider:</p>
              <p>1) Did TS check his wife mom, see physically she is sick?</p>
              <p>2) TS say he visited his wife in China. So why TS don't know where his wife stay? Why don't start with his mother in law's house? U mean to say, TS neva bothered to go to his mother in law house to check out on his "sick" mother in law?</p>
              <p>3) China got yellow pages? To check addresses?</p>
              <p>4) China people r one child system. So TS wife don't have a lot of relative to stay wif.</p>
              <p>5) TS don't know any of his wife frens in China, he can contact wif?</p>
              <p>6) Try TS wife facebook to see if can ask the wife facebook frens wat happen to her</p>
              <p>7) If TS wife is gone for &gt; 1 year from now, TS have to consider initiating divorce procedure. Time to look forward, put things behind and remarry again. TS 28, still young.</p>

              <p>DryTears83<br><br>First, my sadness in hearing your predicament. My job brings me into contact with foreigners. Among them, China people. <br><br>I heard a story from a Chinaman working as a truck driver here. His family was conned and cheated by another Chinaman. The swindler ran away with the money to another county. This truck driver managed to hunt down the swindler, tied him up and reported police but apparently the police was also corrupt and the case disappeared into thin air.   </p>
              <p>This truck driver is working here to recover the loss.</p>
              <p>My points are these:-</p>
              <p>1) other nation's police may not behaves like our's. Dont expect too much from them, esp those third world police forces. <br><br>2) Not all China people are swindlers. Anyone can be a cheater. Cheater can be found all over regardless of race or nationality. I hope your case is really a misunderstanding between you and her. </p>
              <p>3) If you discover that there is really a hidden motive behind this woman, just let it be. Money can be earned back.</p>
              <p>Some here may remember the case of a Nigerian scam and Singaporean man. This guy went to Nigeria looking for the swindler to claim his money back. For ages, his heart broken mother was left searching for him, wondering whereabout is her son. Until today, he is never been found.  </p>

              <p>Then when will Singaporeans wake up? Why 
              does everyone frown on the idea of an SG man marrying a foreign lady? If
               it remains good, people will still talk bad behind them and expect 
              something bad to happen, but if something bad happens, everybody jumps 
              in and start firing off blindly. Why? Does it feel great to gloat over 
              another's misfortune? Would you dare say the same thing if you are right
               in front of this poor person? Or is it simply easier to let loose your 
              disrespectful comments in a anonymous environment, without regards to 
              how people feel, and without having to be responsible for it?</p>
              <p>And is it okay to think that only bad marriages happen with 
              SG/foreigner combo? Seriously, I've heard of more bad SG/SG marriages 
              than you can ever imagine. Yes, there are the PRCs who are out to scam, 
              but isn't there the PRCs who really wanted to settle down in SG? And for
               a fact, I know of a PRC who married an SG uncle, they had 1 child, and 
              they are living happily now. One black sheep doesn't mean all sheeps are
               black.</p>

              so how does it feel after putting down your fellow citizen like that? 
              But if your not a SG, forget what I said.</p>

                                      SG marriage is a valid one.</em></p>
              <p><em>Since you mentioned you've visited her in China before, you

                                      how you can verify her previous marital status.</em></p>

              <p><em>Serves you right." - </em>jojobeach, may I ask how did you arrive 
              with these conclusions? With your assumptions based on cases where SG 
              men got conned? With your assumptions that most men in such cases are 
              poor, old, fat and ugly? Why don't you ask the man instead of wild 
              guessing and then slapping the man with your assumptions? Here, I'm 
              assuming your an adult, so as adults, we need to be responsible for what
               we say, especially things that may hurt others, and we also need to be 
              able to justify what we say, simply setting a rifle to auto and fire off
               is not a good idea.<em><br> </em></p>
              <p>And again, I'm asking that fellow forumers contribute if you can, and move along if you have nothing useful to offer.</p>
