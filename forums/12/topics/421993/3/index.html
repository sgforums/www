              <p>Then when will Singaporeans wake up? Why does everyone frown on
              the idea of an SG man marrying a foreign lady? If it remains good,
              people will still talk bad behind them and expect something bad to
              happen, but if something bad happens, everybody jumps in and start
              firing off blindly. Why? Does it feel great to gloat over another's
              misfortune? Would you dare say the same thing if you are right in
              front of this poor person? Or is it simply easier to let loose your
              disrespectful comments in a anonymous environment, without regards
              to how people feel, and without having to be responsible for
              it?</p>
              <p>And is it okay to think that only bad marriages happen with
              SG/foreigner combo? Seriously, I've heard of more bad SG/SG
              marriages than you can ever imagine. Yes, there are the PRCs who
              are out to scam, but isn't there the PRCs who really wanted to
              settle down in SG? And for a fact, I know of a PRC who married an
              SG uncle, they had 1 child, and they are living happily now. One
              black sheep doesn't mean all sheeps are black.</p>
              <p><em>"You just got PUNKED!! BIG TIME!!! Does she have a Singapore

              know whether you are a SG, but if you are, may I ask, so how does
              it feel after putting down your fellow citizen like that? But if
              your not a SG, forget what I said.</p>
              <p><em>"Did you buy her from a matchmaking agency ? The agency

              wife from China.</em></p>
              <p><em>Serves you right." -</em> jojobeach, may I ask how did you
              arrive with these conclusions? With your assumptions based on cases
              where SG men got conned? With your assumptions that most men in
              such cases are poor, old, fat and ugly? Why don't you ask the man
              instead of wild guessing and then slapping the man with your
              assumptions? Here, I'm assuming your an adult, so as adults, we
              need to be responsible for what we say, especially things that may
              hurt others, and we also need to be able to justify what we say,
              simply setting a rifle to auto and fire off is not a good
              idea.<em><br></em></p>
              <p>And again, I'm asking that fellow forumers contribute if you
              can, and move along if you have nothing useful to offer.</p>

                              such cases are poor, old, fat and ugly? Why don't you ask the man
                              instead of wild guessing and then slapping the man with your
                              assumptions? Here, I'm assuming your an adult, so as adults, we
                              need to be responsible for what we say, especially things that may
                              hurt others, and we also need to be able to justify what we say,
                              simply setting a rifle to auto and fire off is not a good
                              idea.<em><br></em></p>

              <p>After married, do you still believe your money is still yours ?  Assets are now shared, that's why it's called a MARRIAGE. Not a business transaction with no strings attached. So 10k, 20k, 100k, does it matter ? No.</p>
              <p>His China bride don't even bother to file for a divorce, she RAN AWAY. That means she is NOT wanting to come back to this little ISLAND PRISON in the future.</p>
              <p>In her mind, SG MEN are HORRID.She RAN AWAY.</p>
              <p>SG men think they can BUY love. In fact, they think they can buy a permanent maid with bedroom benefits.They think they OWN the woman just because the men used their money to BUY the rights.</p>
              <p>Some men with China/foreign mail order brides treat their foreign spouse like prisoners. The only thing they didn't do is make the women wear a location tracker on their necks. They don't allow them to go back to their home country as often as they like. They control them like dogs. Feed/give them what they want them to eat/receive, and expect the wife to be grateful and appreciative.Singapore is but an ISLAND PRISON to these women.</p>
              <p>Singapore is a tiny Island country. Foreign brides came from countries with HUGE land mass. Singaporeans are used to living on a dot, they arn't. They will get island fever, they will get home sick. Are you prepared to give them the freedom to move about freely just like before they get married to a SG man ? Unfortunately, most SG men are selfish and too miserly.</p>
              <p>Of course I am not saying ALL men with mail order brides are like that, but MOST of them are. Thread starter sounds like one of those CONTROLLING men, and the only way she can get away is when her mom is dying. That's pathetic.</p>
              <p>Women are humans too. Stop treating women who are financially and socially disadvantaged like an object you can own.</p>
              <p>Until, SG men who choose to BUY foreign brides, get over their "little men" syndrome, more of marital tragedy will continue to happen.</p>
              <p>As for the ugly old fart part. Think about this. 2 years with her and no kids.How many high level executive do you know that's under the age of 35 ? Not in Singapore.</p>
              <p>He's probably an older man divorced with children from his previous marriage. No Singaporean girls will even wanna touch him with a 10 foot pole.</p>

              <p>For the kind hearter souls who put thier views here - Thank you</p>
              <p>Yes, I do gave her money from time to time and most of it is for her mother's treatment ( $10 - $15K) during the 2 years of marriage. I strongly do not think that for this small sum of money one would go out and cheat.</p>
              <p>I would like to find out, if she is legally married in SG and when I sought the help of the authorities and find out she is ALSO married in China, is it illegal? If so, will the China Embassy assist in legal?</p>

              <p>Faced the fact - 2 years for 15 to 30k  - in some china village - that is enough for them.

              <p>Question - why you ask how to find out, if she is legally married in SG ? didn't you married her in SG ?</p>
              <p>China is too huge - she may have use someone else name, you will not find her if she does not want to be found.<br><br>My advice is to just use all legal mean to dull the marriage, all financial ties and more one with your life.</p>

              <p>yalor, give up lah, learn a good lesson from it, tho relatives, forumers here and friends may laugh at your lost and stupidity, take it as a hard lesson learned, PRC gals only, everywhere also have, my suggestion is that next time, since you cannot get sg/taiwan gal like me, try thai gals, they are more true to love and serve their husband much much better than other countries women. Give a try. </p>

              <p>To the PRC gals, that is the norm, to go back to their hometown without anything from their venture is consider a big failure. If u ask a PRC guys about PRC gals here, he will laugh and pity sg men, who are so called, best educated and talented, for being so stupid</p>

              <p>Just make an police report or check with Immigration &amp; Checkpoints Authority (ICA) of your wife being missing and you might have an better chance of finding her and if possible seek legal advise if you can divorce her for being run away. No offence, but you are lucky that you do not have any children with her yet, otherwise you and your child are going to suffer if this non-sense happen again,who know if you will become an "<span id="result_box" class="short_text" lang="en"><span class="hps" title="Click for alternate translations">Cuckold</span></span>" (æˆ´ç»¿å¸½) of course unless you enjoy being abuse like this garbage below :</p>
