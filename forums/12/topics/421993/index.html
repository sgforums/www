              <p>Dear fellow forumers,</p>
              <p>Hello there.</p>
              <p>First of all, let me do a bit of an introduction of myself since it is my first post here.</p>
              <p>I
               am 28 this year, currently working as a higher level executive in a 
              local company, and is also pursuing a bachelors honours degree. About 2 
              years ago, I married a China girl in Singapore. Yes, initially I thought
               my life is fulfilling, having a good career with good pay and decent 
              bonuses, and good future, got a loving wife and planning to have kids, 
              but now, things are not what it had seemed.</p>
              <p>Initially, she left 
              my side due to her critically ill mother who was diagnosed with stomach 
              cancer not long after we ROM. As a caring and understanding husband, I 
              did not hesitate to allow her to go back and care for her dying mother 
              which doctors predicted that she has only a year or so to live. All I 
              thought of was, to let her mum to be cared for and to allow my wife to 
              fulfill her fillial peity.</p>
              <p>I do visit her a few times a while when she is back in China, and
               remain in close contact through SMSes and phone calls. However, things 
              have turned for the worse and we ended up quarrelling over the phone 
              over certain issues frequently. I do not blame her for being like this 
              partly due to her mother's condition</p>
              <p>Lately, for the past few months, she has remain uncontactable, 
              and I am eager to know about her whereabouts. The thought of her going 
              missing or being harmed frequently bothers my mind that I suffer mild 
              depression, ending up neglecting my studies and under-performing my job.</p>
              <p>I
               am a desperate man now wanting to know about the whereabouts of my 
              beloved wife, but I do not know how do I start with. I have thought of 
              seeking help from the embassy of China, but chances of them assisting to
               locate my wife is slim due to the vast population in China.</p>
              <p>I am 
              at my wits end, thats why I am writing in SGforums to seek advises. Non 
              constructive sentences are not welcomed in this thread. I seek your 
              understanding.</p>
              <p>Please help me .... Thank you very much and I am truly grateful</p>

              <p>first, lodge a police report (maybe she could be around for all u do not know)...police will advise u to further check with the embassy for help...</p>
              <p>the authorities would also need some leads as to her home contacts, friends etc. and what are some of her other behaviours and stuffs leading to her sudden dissapearance...</p>
              <p>its also good to check with the lawyers on matrimony issues if any claims were to arise in the future....there is certainly a time bar on such issues....and i believe she may turn up one day for it if that's her plan and intentions... </p>
              <p>with so many news of PRC gals cheating on local men....this may be a possibility...</p>

              <p>Thank you for your advise. I have her necessary documents like passport details etc, but i do not have her exacts contacts in china.</p>
              <p>I strongly do not think she is around in singapore because she will still need Visa applications through  spouse.</p>

              <p>Dear fellow forumers, the man is already feeling depressed, he mentioned that he is unable to contact his wife, that's it, so I would kindly ask all of you to avoid the wild guessing. Contribute if you can help or simply move along if you have nothing to offer, not too difficult right?</p>
              <p>Hey DryTears83, like what Fcukpap mentioned, you should contact the police for help, afterall, your wife has been missing for months, and that's a really long time. Try to deal with it step by step, hope all turns out well for you.</p>

              <p>The police report on missing wife would establish the date she went missing.</p>
              <p>No report, it would only be your word against hers.</p>
              <p>Keep record of attempts to contact her. Telephone calls, SMS, registered mails.</p>
              <p>She may be trying to contact you, or may be don't want to contact you.</p>
              <p>ROM means what. Registered your intent to get married, or solemnised?</p>
              <p>If solemnised, she is your legal wife, with all the rights and privileges of a wife. This might complicates your personal matters in later life.</p>
              <p>Most important question, What does she mean to  you?</p>
              <p>This will decide if  your career is more important then her.</p>
              <p>Will you abandon everything and go searching for her, because you love her? </p>

              Do you have her address and phone number? If yes, you should have chances to locate her. If no, then how come you're getting married to a stranger???
              
              I am usually wary of china ladies, no matter how much they claim bla bla bla. Usually their aim is only to get singapore pr or money, so I hope yours is different. But if yours is different, as in she is a caring and loving wife, then how come she would not take your calls and just "disappear"?
              
              The other thing is, why quarrel... Now quarrel already then you regret, don't you think it's stupid? If you really love her, then talk nicely, there's no need to upset the relationship. It's better to reason things out nicely.
              
              And have you given her money all these while? My logic says that if her mum has cancer (real or just a lie), your wife will come asking you for money eventually. Then it's your gamble whether to give her the money.
              
              Good news is, I believe she will contact you eventually. Bad news is, I think she don't love you the same way you love her, otherwise she shouldn't have remained uncontactable.

              <p>stop jumping to conclusions.  the TS did not say a single thing about his wife cheating on him.</p>
              <p>if you have nothing better to say then shut up.  stop being biased against PRCs.</p>

              <p>Using authorities to locate her ? Put a warrant out for her ?</p>
              <p>She is a woman, not your slave.</p>
              <p>Her family will contact you the husband if she is really missing.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, it seems even her own family members are helping her HIDE from you. That tells a lot about the marriage, and what she or her family truly thinks about you.</p>
              <p>Let her go, if she truly thinks you are her soulmate, she'll come back. Can't force love.</p>
