Its may or may not be love, but certainly four years is something.<br><br>II) You have been attached for four years and being single is far too scary and terrible to bear. You rather cling with short term vision of your relationship and handle it as it comes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>When you break and patch too many times - this relationship becomes very unfulfilling and is very difficult (and I mean VERY) to even mantain long term. Unless...<br><br>I) Substantial amount of rest is there (probably about one year) for both party to lead their own life and probably reflect upon themselves during the time when they were leading the relationship (noticed I mentioned both, not one). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>II) Enlightenment from external or internal sources (This is often conjunct with the period of rest that is given) <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Correct me if I am wrong - your bf requested the breaking. I always believe in one thing - when a guy gathers enough courage/guts to mention break, it throws a whole new meaning into the relationship. Anytime you heard this word more than a second time (meaning break, patch, break again), statistics has shown that further patching will only resulting in the same outcome.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You can try to win him back - but in the end, even if you succeed, which do you think take place: <strong>Win a relationship back, or win him?</strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
