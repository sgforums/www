Life is a journey to travel and experience. Make stops here and there but move on. As you travel this journey, you will have different priorities at different times. As a kid, as a teen as a young adult ...... and so forth. If you make a stop for too long, you get stuck and stagnate. Surely, you don't want to hang around the same old oasis all your life. Therefore, at some point in life, love (romantic form) and sex (pleasure) seems more important.<br>For me, I go for the oyster rather than the oasis.</div>

Of course if she's still dependent, the in-laws will be a really naughty bunch to skip.<br><br>But then if we keep adding in all the negative factors in the relationship, I think even snow white will eventually be raped by the seven dwarfs.<br><br>I don't think everyone would like to have a bad ending to their lives or relationship when they are already living in a bad movie of their lives.</div>
