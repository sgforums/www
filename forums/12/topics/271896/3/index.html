Alot of people spent most of their time worrying about all the millions of negative factors in their life before they have the confidence to take the next step in their life.<br><br>The reason that people do that is mainly because they do not have sufficient self-confidence in themselves. And whenever they focus too much on the negativity of their lives, it will stop them from progressing up in their lives. It's called Self-Sabotage.<br><br>It doesn't necessary means that the rich gal's parents will Definitely looked down on the boy's parents. There are always at least two possibilities in any situation. Maybe you're a pessimistic and that's why you often chose to view situations in a negative manner, but I'm sure you're also capable to view the situations in a positive manner too. It's a choice that you have to make within yourselves and how much hopes you have within you that you may share/inspire others in your life.<br><br>Ultimately, when the time comes...everyone is going to die eventually. But that doesn't means we have to stop breathing and miss the opportunity to lived a fulfilling life before we meet our negative end. Things in life will never transformed themselves positively to you, if they do...then you're blessed and should appreciate that moment into memories. It is YOU who must determine your resolve within yourselves that you are going to remove your own negative perspective and replace it with a positive perspective. Else, how do you plan to live out your life?<br><br>Love itself is already rare and doesn't comes around easily and often, so if you do find love in another girl and she loves you too. Don't you think you should dump all your negative forecast on your relationship and start telling yourself that you will make it through? If a guy does not have the courage to brave the weathers of a relationship with a girl, then isn't it an insult to the love and trust that she have placed on the guy? And if a girl is willing to bear the risks of giving birth in the future, what's the reason that the guy is behaving like a wimp?<br><br>Guys who focus too much on the negative areas of their own potential relationship are usually the ones that finds it most difficult to get into any relationship with the girl that they liked.<br><br>Maybe that's the reason why there are more single guys out there than divorce cases.<br><br></div>
