But then love is blind, right? If you can accept his betrayal of your love, then reconcile with him in the hope of fruitful future. Otherwise, ponder about your future in this relationship and give an indepth consideration of what you want for a man. But, be prepared to suffer and struggle in terms of financial, health and emotional aspects.<br><br>If I am a woman, I want my man to respect, cherish, and love me for who I am with mutual understanding of our expectation, values and belief. Otherwise, focus on your immediate priority like your career or education.<br><br>As per my signature, "It is in the moments of decision that your future is shaped." , no one can say you make the right or wrong decision.

            <div class='col-md body'>While everyone is free to fall in love or be attracted to someone, &amp; no one has the right to meddle in your private affairs, it is also important not to lose sight of pursuing your own personal development. There are of course no rules on love &amp; marriage, &amp; no one has the right to restrict you in any way. It is sad to see young people getting involved in frivolous relationships, &amp; suffering &amp; agonizing over them when they should be fulfilled &amp; happy.<br><br>When women act with dignity in relationships, problems can be avoided. Women should not have an easy-going, careless attitude concerning love, as this may lead to regrets &amp; suffering.<br><br>Love should be a force that helps us expand our lives &amp; bring out our potential with fresh vitality. This is the ideal, but all too often, people lose all objectivity when they fall in love.<br><br>The question is Â“Does this person inspire you to work harder, or distract you from what you have to do? Does their presence make you more determined to devote great energies to your activities, to be a better person? Do they inspire you to realize your future goals &amp; work towards them? Or is that person your central focus, overshadowing everything else?Â”<br><br>If you find that you are neglecting things you should be doing, forgetting your purpose in life because of the relationship you are in, then you might be on the wrong path. A healthy relationship, is one in which two people encourage each other to reach their respective goals, while sharing each otherÂ’s hopes &amp; dreams. A relationship should be a source of inspiration, invigoration &amp; hope.<br><br>Rather than becoming so love-struck that you create a world in which only the two of you exist, it is much healthier to learn from those aspects of your loved one that you respect &amp; admire, &amp; continue to make efforts to improve &amp; develop yourself. Antoine de Saint-Exupery, the author of <span style="font-style: italic;">The Little Prince</span>, once wrote, Â“Love is not two people gazing at each other, but two people looking ahead together in the same direction.Â”<br><br>Happiness is not something that anyone else, not even a lover, can give you. You have to achieve it by yourself. And, the only way to do so is by maximizing your potential. If you sacrifice your own growth &amp; talent for love, you absolutely will not find happiness.<br><br>Particularly young women who are often very vulnerable to persuasion by young men. They can sometimes act as if they are stunned &amp; lose their ability to make calm, rational decisions. Since young women are the ones who most often get hurt, they have every right to assert their dignity &amp; look after their own welfare.<br><br>It is precisely for this reason that is it important for young women to develop inner strength &amp; self-respect.<br><br>It is demaning to be constantly seeking approval. If you find yourself in a relationship where you are not treated the way your heart tells you you should be, I hope you will have the courage &amp; dignity to decide you are better off running the risk of being alone for the time being rather than enduring an unhappy relationship.<br><br>Real love is not two people clinging to each other; it can only be fostered between two strong people secure in their individuality. A shallow person will only have shallow relationships. If you want to experience real love, it is important first to develop a strong self-identity. True love is not about doing whatever the other person wants you to do, or pretending that you are something you are not. Ideal love is fostered only between two sincere, mature &amp; independent people.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>-lift an eyebrow-<br><br>it is okay to be confused about an ex. Just make sure HE doesn't know YOU are confused. This means you remain in control and its not up to him to take advantage of the situation. Just because you were weak once with him does not mean you want to be in a relationship with him either. As much as a man can be tempted, so can a woman.<br><br>I find that a lot of girls once they were intimate with their ex tend to start thinking about 'lingering love' etc etc. Sometimes I think it is an excuse for themselves cos they don't want to face up to the fact that the intimacy occurred simply cos they too have desires.<br><br>Take some time off and look at him in the most subjective way possible - and think - do you still want to be with someone like him? Don't think of his good points but his bad points. Then if not, move on. Don't have to talk to him about what happened anymore. it's over.</div>
