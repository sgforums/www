The thought of me being 'hot with the ladies' is one I chuckle at. Which guy wouldn't want to think he is good with girls? But I have no delusions of such sort.<br><br>I am prone to arrogance every once in a while. And yes, I am a rather large d-ck. Self-confessed. Still, most people find me acceptable to hang around with. Just overly vulgar. And overly horny. Funny thing is, I would have stopped all such nonsense had she raised a whisper about it.<br><br>Look guys, any behaviour that might have not been acceptable to me was purely out sadness and admittedly, bitterness. And the only thing I have done to her was give her the silent treatment. Nothing else. I am not a particularly mean fellow. I did not spite her or whine about her behind her back - that would be inappropriate for a guy to do, wouldn't it? I did not pester her in any manner, just left her alone.<br><br>I have spoken to her a few times. There was one time she wanted me to go home with her. It was late, maybe around ten pm? But I didn't want to send her home all the way though. Just said bye and got off at my train stop. Again, probably bitterness. Or perhaps sheer fear? Didn't really talk to her after that, except to wish her well when she was down and ill, once.<br><br>I am thoroughly confused about what to do.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, i dun really understand how u can b so vulgar as u've mention. From the way u write your essay, it seems u're a pretty smart kid... Well, i'm in your situation as well here.<br>Its been 2 years and 4 mths since my x left me, after which i've not found another gf. Reason being that no matter how i look around on the streets, getting 2 noe pple thru friends, none has gave me e feeling tt they r as gd as her. lols.<br><br>Back to your problem, i believe time will heal e soreness and bitterness no doubt, yet e loneliness is something u cant heal, i would suggest u get into either sports, or get a hobby or something 2 occupy your free time. Do not think nor lust bout her and u'll find tt its not so bad after all...<br>Time will unveil the path u will b moving onto, till then, cherish your life and make e best out of wat u have. Chill out dude. Take Care. =)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The nabehs and ceeba-s, f-ck yous and kaninas fly out of my mouth like there's no tomorrow. Just a horrid verbal reflex that is almost impossible for me to curb. It's ironic then how she liked me because I was was to quote, an 'intellectual'.<br><br>There is a Mandarin saying, "Nan ren bu huai, nu ren bu ai."<br><br>Pardon my hanyu pinyin. Mandarin is not my mother tounge.<br><br>Brudders, don't ever fall for that saying.<br><br>I spilt out all the dirty secrets I had to her in an effort to be open about everything. I confessed that I am a heavy nicotine addict (honestly which girl in the right mind would like a smoking boyfriend?), confessed that I had ended up in sleazy Geylang motels with even sleazier women while in dubious or intoxicated states of mind, generally admitted all the incredibly stupid things I have done with my life. And I have yet to sit for my O-levels.<br><br>As of now, I am willing to accept that I have to leave behind all the emotional baggage carried over from this failed attempt at love. I admit that I cannot keep lamenting about how much of a jerk I am without changing myself for the better. Cliche, but simply the truth.<br><br>I am glad to say I no longer hold any bitterness towards her. She is a wonderful person, a beautiful girl and I can never for the life of me wish ill upon her.

Do you know tt begin a womanize is the worst nightmare to any girl?<br>Go and change ur attiude first. Sitting behind the screen confessing doesn't help!</div>
