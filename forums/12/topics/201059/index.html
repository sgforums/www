            <div class='col-md body'>I always thought of myself as being emotionally strong.<br><br>Being a guy and all. I was determined not to let a dumping bring me down. I confess it is an ego thing. The she-didn't-mean-much-to-me-anyway sour grapes syndrome. Hell, the fact that I am actually appealing for help on an online Aunt Agony forum is a hell of a bruise to my pride. Again, that macho-guy-I-can-handle-anything comes into play.<br><br>Yes ladies, males are assholes. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But I cannot lie to myself. I am still crazily in love with her. I catch myself doodling her name, almost subconsciously. I suddenly became self-aware of how gorgeous she actually is - beautiful face and hot body. Nice boobs and tight butt. It's funny how I have never appreciated how pretty she truly is.<br><br>After all, I did not fall for her looks when I first went out with her. Beauty is only skin-deep and that rings true for me. She just had this ability to make a broody guy like me smile alot. And that, dear friends, is what had truly melted my heart to pieces about her. She was such a happy soul, and happiness as they say is infectious.<br><br>But alas, I proved too much of an asshole for her. Feel like smacking myself for letting slip such a babe. There are many qualities about me she dislikes. I am a rather unruly and vulgar person, as well being rather unrestrained in my promiscuousness (I leave that open to your interpretation). My mistaken impression was that she was willing to accept my faults. I was wrong. And I do not blame her at all. For I am a first rate bast-rd at times.<br><br>Right now, I can safely say it is affecting me badly - her absence. I live out my days with no motivation going on. My work is in a mess. My mind is in a mess. I have alot of tasks to sort out right now, in a crucial part of the year. But I just cannot seem to focus. Jumping off tall heights sounds faintly attractive. My temper and behaviour has gotten even worse than before.<br><br>Help me people.<br><br>A part of me wants so badly to win her heart back. So badly. But I feel that she just would not accept me anymore.<br><br>Another part of me, the rationale and logical voice within me, tells me to move on and forget her. But the thought of forgetting her truly torments me.<br><br></div>

Nice boobs and tight butt. It's funny how I have never appreciated how pretty she truly is.<br><br>After all, I did not fall for her looks when I first went out with her. Beauty is only skin-deep and that rings true for me. She just had this ability to make a broody guy like me smile alot. And that, dear friends, is what had truly melted my heart to pieces about her. She was such a happy soul, and happiness as they say is infectious.<br><br>But alas, I proved too much of an asshole for her. Feel like smacking myself for letting slip such a babe. There are many qualities about me she dislikes. I am a rather unruly and vulgar person, as well being rather unrestrained in my promiscuousness (I leave that open to your interpretation). My mistaken impression was that she was willing to accept my faults. I was wrong. And I do not blame her at all. For I am a first rate bast-rd at times.<br><br>Right now, I can safely say it is affecting me badly - her absence. I live out my days with no motivation going on. My work is in a mess. My mind is in a mess. I have alot of tasks to sort out right now, in a crucial part of the year. But I just cannot seem to focus. Jumping off tall heights sounds faintly attractive. My temper and behaviour has gotten even worse than before.<br><br>Help me people.<br><br>A part of me wants so badly to win her heart back. So badly. But I feel that she just would not accept me anymore.<br><br>Another part of me, the rationale and logical voice within me, tells me to move on and forget her. But the thought of forgetting her truly torments me.<br><br></div></blockquote>I guess you were just lonely, that's y your felt that you still loved her. There are no true love anyway, is all about companionship.</div>
