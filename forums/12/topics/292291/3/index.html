            <div class='col-md body'>TS<br><br>IMO if it is just a one off thing, I think we should just bury the hatchet. My rational is that we can never fathom a person's mind. I just felt that the lesser we speak out sometimes will be good for the future. People always perceive differently and it is because of this, r/s can become sour. In a worse situation become ill aggravated.<br><br>Also, in chronic cases like the recent renowned Joo Chiat spat, it goes to show that it will never stop even with the police and legal litigations.

Go tell many people in your block and neighbourhood about the way they make noise to disturb you and family.  In no time, words will spread to the market.  IN market the nasty neighbour will get to hear the words and hope when they hear this they will stop their nuisance.</div>

If you call the police, they will take their sweet time to respond and at most they will only "advice" the neighbour to be considerate.  If you call the Town Council, you might get a visit from IDIOTS like I did who asked me many times if I am sure if the noise comes from my neighbour's flat as "ah, you know ah, in the night when it is quiet, you might think the sound comes from this flat but maybe it comes from many floors away.  We can never tell. And you know in the newspaper got report people hear sound of marbles rolling in the night but there's no one.  I not saying it is ghosts who we don't know if its really your neighbour making the noise" - ????<br><br>So what to do?  I had to visit other neighbours and ask them if they were also bothered by my nuisance neighbour (and he llikes to drill things, drag furniture about, bang stuff around at 3am almost every day!).  After I "shamed" him and he kena lecture by many neighbours then he stopped his noctural activites.   But of course, your neigbhour might retaliate in other ways.  Like mine did.  His children would vomit at my front gate, throw stuff, use a football and bang the walls as they past by the flat, etc.  Until I filmed a few such activites - one with the mother standing there with a boh chap look - and threatened to broadcast this with an explaination that these acts are done by children of parents who would do "home repairs" at 3am in the morning!  For more than a year now, I have had uninterrupted peaceful sleep!   The wife also greets me when she sees me (but she told another neighbour that I'm so fierce so surely no man will want me ... ah, but her standard of 'man' like her husband, yucks, I also dun want  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>Its not that you want to be nasty, but to some people you have to be very garang otherwise you suffer.</div>
