They are just bunch of gangster family.    They even got relatives overseas to bully us by telling us they are in good position to disturb me and family for they are stayin on the top floor.   The old heck's son said he is not working so can afford to disturb me and family the whole day.   What crap !!<br><br>I advise you to let the neighbour police know about this and see how much they can help.   If you call the police, if you are lucky they can be nice to help.  Tell your taxi driver neighbour he is not staying in a house whereby there are no neighbours, in HDB flat we are to be considerate to others.</div>
