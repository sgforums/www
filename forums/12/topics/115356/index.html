            <div class='col-md body'>people have different priorities - anger is temporal (being bad tempered when i was a kid so i noe) so its okay, when he nags, it means he cares about you. try to tell him that you know what you are doing, and you appreciate for his nagging. when you are angry, just brave it out, than think clearly lor.<br><br>for a small example.. today, i was angry with my friend for saying sarcastic things when i was sick. but i left my harddrive in school, den i asked her to look for me tomorrow and she was willing. so its quite okay after all, people have flaws and always misunderstand this and that, and that is your boyfriend, of cuz u'll get angry, but in the end, it will be okay. i think. think of the bright side if you can.</div>

Maybe there're juz some advices you might want to consider.<br><br>1) Since the course in Retail (Got such a course?),anyway, will begin in the mid month and you've a few months with nothing to do, Go and look for a temp job as a salesperson or retailer...<br><br>2) Once you're wroking as a retailer/salesperson, at the same time earning $$$, you must know the rules and the structure of Retailing/Sales. Know how the people work, the way they present themself to the customers, the ways they talk to the customers, i.e. Tactics, Communications...etc...so much more to learn.<br><br>3) Though a few months working as a retailer/salesperson is short, but no one says that you can't work if you're studying..make full use of your working experiences in Retail/Sales to apply in your course works and make full use of what you'll be learning in the Retail course and apply them in your work. It'll sure make you a better Retailer/Salesperson, which in turn, who knows, you'll be promoted to a more senior or higher position.<br><br>4) Do note that without much qualifications that you had, from the start, you'll be in a very low position, but you must work hard and proves yourself worthy. Prove to them that you're a capable Retailer/Salesperson. At the same time, do your studies well n get a good qualification. ITE'll only upgrade you for a short while..you'll need to upgrade yourself even more higher (Dun worry abt that yet, concentrate on what you're going to do now).<br><br>5) With the will, determination and <span style="color: red;">DISCIPLINE</span>, you'll be a very successful person whom you want to be.<br><br>Nothing comes free.
