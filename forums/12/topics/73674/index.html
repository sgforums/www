Sharp noses are very ugly, how sharp is yours?  Maybe you should spend the money on your nose instead, try to make it smaller.  And make your lips smaller too.  No matter what you do, people will still be able to tell that you are infected with foreign blood.  So just deal with the fact that you are not one of us.  Hope I wasn't too harsh.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
