The next day, she had tummyache and couldn't come to sch as a result. I myself seeing her being unable to have her dinner properly and had to 'suffer' makes my heart ache. It really pains me to see her getting hurt and 'suffers'. As a result, being her BF and caring for her, i make sure she had her lunch and dinner on time. Sometimes after her cca, i would wait for her and fetch her home. Got one time i waited for her for an hour . When she was finally released from her cca, she thought i would be angry ( Huh? angry for what? Lols, its not her fault mahs.). But i was on all smiles and fetched her home.<br><br>FYI, u said i did not treat her properly right? My GF initially said that i treated her TOO GOOD. She said i was too lenient with her and that i did everything so that she would be happy. She said in her blog" You are too good to me, i just dont know how i shld repay you." She was right, i respected her every decision.<br><br>Got one time she asked me to meet her at JP cause she was very bored, being alone as her mother went off for manicure. I was very happy that she wanted to meet me so i replied her sms saying that "Ok i would be coming, but could you wait? Cause i think it might need 35mins for me to get down to JP. " I asked her whether she could wait is because if i went there at the wrong time, her mother might find out about our r/s and her parents forbid to have any r/s actually. After awhile, she smsed me saying" Erm its okay bah, i think you no need to come down lerh. No need to ma fan(trouble) you" I replied saying its no trouble at all and that i really want to meet her. I also mentioned that i dont want you to be bored and i dont mind being "mafan-ed". She replied "Its okay, you dont need to come lerh." I respected her decision, so i didn't meet her." 2 hrs later, i sms-ed her asking her if she is still bored and she say she isn't. When she updated her blog , her blog mentioned " I actually wanted to meet HIM** der, but i changed my mind last minute [[sorries**??]]. She wanted to apologise to me because she knew that im being dissapointed being unable to meet her. I replied her CBox saying "Aiya! I where got so xiao qi der? Me not angry larhs....Its okays."<br><br>Infact i decided to break up with her because my parents encouraged me to, and to move on. Im not blaming my parents, but their encouragement even make me wanting to break up. Im actually hesitant to break up initially, but after what she sms-ed me and my parents encouragement, i finally broke up with her. I do feel sad ... Just that i dont show it ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>I broke up with her is because if i continue to be her BF, i might even hurt her deeper and i will be selfish for that. If i broke up with her sooner, she might be able to find someone who's even better than me ...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Scania N113CRB luver:</div><div class="quote_body">WHO SAY I NOT SAD?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>The last time when i viewed her blog, she said she had no appetite and because of that, her parents and she forced herself to gulp down her dinner. The next day, she had tummyache and couldn't come to sch as a result. I myself seeing her being unable to have her dinner properly and had to 'suffer' makes my heart ache. It really pains me to see her getting hurt and 'suffers'. As a result, being her BF and caring for her, i make sure she had her lunch and dinner on time. Sometimes after her cca, i would wait for her and fetch her home. Got one time i waited for her for an hour . When she was finally released from her cca, she thought i would be angry ( Huh? angry for what? Lols, its not her fault mahs.). But i was on all smiles and fetched her home.<br><br>FYI, u said i did not treat her properly right? My GF initially said that i treated her TOO GOOD. She said i was too lenient with her and that i did everything so that she would be happy. She said in her blog" You are too good to me, i just dont know how i shld repay you." She was right, i respected her every decision.<br><br>Got one time she asked me to meet her at JP cause she was very bored, being alone as her mother went off for manicure. I was very happy that she wanted to meet me so i replied her sms saying that "Ok i would be coming, but could you wait? Cause i think it might need 35mins for me to get down to JP. " I asked her whether she could wait is because if i went there at the wrong time, her mother might find out about our r/s and her parents forbid to have any r/s actually. After awhile, she smsed me saying" Erm its okay bah, i think you no need to come down lerh. No need to ma fan(trouble) you" I replied saying its no trouble at all and that i really want to meet her. I also mentioned that i dont want you to be bored and i dont mind being "mafan-ed". She replied "Its okay, you dont need to come lerh." I respected her decision, so i didn't meet her." 2 hrs later, i sms-ed her asking her if she is still bored and she say she isn't. When she updated her blog , her blog mentioned " I actually wanted to meet HIM** der, but i changed my mind last minute [[sorries**??]]. She wanted to apologise to me because she knew that im being dissapointed being unable to meet her. I replied her CBox saying "Aiya! I where got so xiao qi der? Me not angry larhs....Its okays."<br><br>Infact i decided to break up with her because my parents encouraged me to, and to move on. Im not blaming my parents, but their encouragement even make me wanting to break up. Im actually hesitant to break up initially, but after what she sms-ed me and my parents encouragement, i finally broke up with her. I do feel sad ... Just that i dont show it ... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>I broke up with her is because if i continue to be her BF, i might even hurt her deeper and i will be selfish for that. If i broke up with her sooner, she might be able to find someone who's even better than me ...</div></blockquote>hmmm.... Scania,<br><br>you don't need to prove anything to us...<br><br>it's your gf that you have let down.... she decided to move on,<br><br>and you decided to let her move on....<br><br>so be it...<br><br>these guys here can say anything they like.... but if your concious is clear then just ignore them.<br></div>

You are the first who said such nice comments(including others)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> Thx alot!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>But anyway, my ex GF doesn't want us to be together anymore, not because that i had cybersex with someone, but because she thinks that we are not compatible and that we had different thinking. I cant possibly force her to be my GF, i somehow have to respect her decision, so that she can be happy.<br><br>I somehow have a feeling that she wont be happy if i continue to be with her. Already from day one of our relationship, she already hinted to me that she wasn't too keen on this r/s and that my move was too fast. She said she will  "try" to love me..Its quite obvious she dont wish to be in this r/s, but at least she tried to commit herself to this r/s. I did commit myself to this r/s, but curiosity made me do a DUMBA$$ move and i had cybersex with someone.<br><br>If im not serious about this r/s i wont have confessed to her because i felt very bad and felt that i had betrayed her, but instead thinking" Why should i tell her? No one will noe if i keep mum right?" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> I had made a stupid move. Ask yourself, have you ever made a dumba55 mistake to the ones you loved?</div>
