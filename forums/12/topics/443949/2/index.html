              I used to be so insecure and unsure of myself like you are. My colleague once told me, "If you don't know how to love yourself, you won't be able to love someone else.".
              
              It got me thinking for weeks. When I finally understood what she said, things changed. I'll never wallow in self-pity ever again. I'm as worthy as anyone out there, :).
              
              Here's another classic for you :" It is not easy to find happiness in ourselves, and it is not possible to find it elsewhere.".
              
              Hope it helps!
              Whatever decision you make, best of luck, ;)!

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> The conundrum between remaining as friends or
              progressing further; ultimately it is your call. The ironic fact is
              that the more reasons we use to justify the existence of a
              relationship, the less likelihood it would happen. However, I am
              not advocating for a 'no' - just that we have to decide what is it
              that we really want and make a choice. Remember this: remaining
              status quo through inactivity is a choice by itself.<br> <br> All woman has their own insecurities; in varying degrees some ways
              or another. I would think that it is natural. However, if you feel
              that yours are slightly geared outside standard deviation, then you
              might want to find out the root of this insecurity, what exactly it
              is and how you would like to deal with them from a <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>personal transformation point
              of view and not from a relational aspect.</strong></span><br> <br> Somehow, your post seemed to suggest that you are not worthy of
              him; rationally, that is the weakest form of emotional reason/s to
              justify a 'reject'. Well, if you like something, you just like it.
              It may not be a big deal to others, but hey, it's your opinion and
              choice. After all, beauty and love is not structured in a universal
              format that 'permits' certain exclusive category of people who are
              capable of being in love and those who are dismissed off this
              potential. Does not seem to work in that way.<br> <br> Being in love is a self permitted right; if you decide that you are
              unworthy, then naturally, in your experience, you have learned that
              you are unloving and nothing good will ever come out of your love
              life.<br> <br> Your belief will end up being a reality.<br> <br> If having a friend is more important, then you will always find it
              hard to progress anything further than a bff. Because ultimately,
              like all things in life, there is always an element of risk. Even
              the best of relationship has that potential to become something
              sour. However, if your greatest challenge to proceed further is
              because you deemed yourself as unloving, then you might want to
              reflect on how you would want to unlearn this 'lesson' and
              overwrite it with a positive note.<br> <br> Once you have self love; your perspective will naturally change.
