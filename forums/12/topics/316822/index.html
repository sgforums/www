              <p>I'm really sorry if I'm bothering you guys but I've surf SGforums forums for close to 3 years already but I never once posted before. Tonight was the first time that I felt really lost and I had no one to turn to. The person that always guided me along was the very same one that made me lost.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I got to know this friend from another one of my friend around 8 months
              ago. He was helping me with a project; a project involving a module
              that I wasn't really good in. I didn't really noticed him over time
              cause he was in a different class from me so we didn't really had much
              contact.</p>
              <p><br>So by a twist of fate i found myself hanging out with him alot, through dota, through movies and etc as his class and mine were very close. So as time goes by we are really close, more of like younger brother and older brothers.</p>
              <p><br>So recently I notice people talking abt us, saying how close we are and how we might be gay couples. At first it was really fine as we took it for being a joke and such. We didn't really cared abt their comments though, outsiders mah, why let them affect our friendship.</p>
              <p><br>But this fateful night this friend of mine told me that if there would be another rumours of us being gay couples again he would end the friendship. I was very surprised, and I asked him why.</p>
              <p><br>He said he didn't like peer pressure and he once suffered before in the past. So now if there would be peer pressure he would just leave this friendship and everyone else also. He said his pride and ego wouldn't allow him to ignore those comments made by people.</p>
              <p>But what he said was really hurting. I thought we were good friends? Why would he let go of our friendship just because of what people say? We even promise each other that we would be the best man for each other during our weddings and yet he is unable to ignore what people say?</p>
              <p>I really feel abit paiseh to say this but he's the very first male I shed tears for but I'm not afraid to say that I love him alot. He's a really good friend.</p>
              <p>So can anyone advice me on what to do now in this situation of mine? I really don't know what to do and who to turn to already..</p>
              <p>Sorry if my english sounds very weird, it's my first time posting a thread here..</p>

              <p>well, since your friend  has already decided that he want out from this friendship, maybe u might want to consider stop seeing him for a little while. As his good friend u have to respect him right?</p>

              <p>soleachip &gt; Yep I told him that was it fair to me and I would be hurt by it. He told me that he places himself first so he would leave..</p>
              <p>av98m&gt; We haven serve NS yet.. Both in year 3 liao, he's doing his FYP while I'm doing mine next sem. I dun think those people really mean it bah, maybe just joking around but my best friend couldn't really take it.. His pride is really his achille's heel, he even got angry @ me winning him in a arcade game cause I used an infinite combo</p>
              <p>BotaHead &gt; I respect him alot. I gave in to him alot of times already. Even time he gotten angry and loses control he threatens to end the friendship. Everytime I told him I was sorry and I didn't mean what I said that made him angry. I put the blame to myself even though I wasn't convince it was my fault at all.. But this is the only time I stood up to myself..</p>

              <p>Hi daigooro,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Did the nasty remarks surface only recently?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's
                  rather common for this to happen in friendships between males. Call it
                  sexual revolution or homophobia, we've grown accustomed to the concept
                  of homosexuality in our time. It's a real barrier to forming close
                  friendships and the nagging question of when "have they crossed the
                  line" invites rumours and gossip. Even more so in your environment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Everyone
                  is changing and taking shape. At this age, your peers and your best
                  friend, including yourself are negotiating your ways into manhood. The
                  pressure to be 'masculine' or 'macho' matters to anybody. Male pride
                  matters to every boy and it's not something you take lightly. He
                  needs to be accepted and don't want to be seen as a failure. Yep it's
                  ignorant of them all, but the way I see it, hey it's an inevitable
                  response.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Me thinks as long as you guys don't see why you two can't bunk on
                  the same bed for a night, why be disturbed? Only when you start feeling
                  uncomfortable then there is valid reason to fear and avoid each other.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Won't be a good idea to corner or pressure him for a decision at
                  this stage though. The more you try convincing him the worse it gets. Let your
                  best friend cool off for now. Maybe in time to come, he'll understand.
                  Right now, it won't be easy to change his mind.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You seem like a
                  sensitive soul who knows that friendships between people, particularly
                  intimate ones forged over difficult times are very important. Just keep
                  in mind that way before people began abusing the idea of
                  homosexuality, it was perfectly cool for males to form a very strong
                  bond with each other. Say lincoln and joshua speed. And plenty others to boot.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the next
                  move I'd make if I were you, just let it ride. Let him be for now.
                  Don't contact him or sms him or call him. When and if you bump into him
                  in school, just remain polite with a hi and bye.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He's going to call you and ask you what's up.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>That is
                  when you tell him you're finding the sissy label a huge pain in the ass
                  too. And just like him, you don't wish to be seen as one. Be cool and
                  take care kiddo.</p>

              <p><br>Nothin much to advice le, daigooro.  U hav oready done ur best, the rest is up to him le.  If he has decided to let go, jus be cool abt it.  Cos he carez more of his pride than anything, at tis point of time, no matter wat u do, he wll not change.  U can simply care for him frm a distance, need not contact him.  If one day he does ever change &amp; regret tat he let u go to save his pride, he wll look for u de.  How he does tat, nobody wll know &amp; u shld not even b bothered abt it.  If he really wants to look for u, he wll find u. </p>
              <p>For now, move on, get on with ur life.  U ll find there are still many things out there that u can enjoy with many other pple who sincerely carez for u. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"></p>
