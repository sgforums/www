              <p>I'm really sorry if I'm bothering you guys but I've surf
              SGforums forums for close to 3 years already but I never once
              posted before. Tonight was the first time that I felt really lost
              and I had no one to turn to. The person that always guided me along
              was the very same one that made me lost.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I got to know this friend from another one of my friend around 8
              months ago. He was helping me with a project; a project involving a
              module that I wasn't really good in. I didn't really noticed him
              over time cause he was in a different class from me so we didn't
              really had much contact.</p>
              <p><br> So by a twist of fate i found myself hanging out with him alot,
              through dota, through movies and etc as his class and mine were
              very close. So as time goes by we are really close, more of like
              younger brother and older brothers.</p>
              <p><br> So recently I notice people talking abt us, saying how close we are
              and how we might be gay couples. At first it was really fine as we
              took it for being a joke and such. We didn't really cared abt their
              comments though, outsiders mah, why let them affect our
              friendship.</p>
              <p><br> But this fateful night this friend of mine told me that if there
              would be another rumours of us being gay couples again he would end
              the friendship. I was very surprised, and I asked him why.</p>
              <p><br> He said he didn't like peer pressure and he once suffered before in
              the past. So now if there would be peer pressure he would just
              leave this friendship and everyone else also. He said his pride and
              ego wouldn't allow him to ignore those comments made by people.</p>
              <p>But what he said was really hurting. I thought we were good
              friends? Why would he let go of our friendship just because of what
              people say? We even promise each other that we would be the best
              man for each other during our weddings and yet he is unable to
              ignore what people say?</p>
              <p>I really feel abit paiseh to say this but he's the very first
              male I shed tears for but I'm not afraid to say that I love him
              alot. He's a really good friend.</p>
              <p>So can anyone advice me on what to do now in this situation of
              mine? I really don't know what to do and who to turn to
              already..</p>
              <p>Sorry if my english sounds very weird, it's my first time
              posting a thread here..</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The society we live in reward behaviors that
              appeared to be gender-appropriate and punish, in various aspect, behaviors that
              does not go in sync with norm are often criticized. Eventually, much as we
              would like to live according to our own ideals, it's difficult to eliminate the
              negative response exuding from our environment that tries to shape us to what
              the majority is like. People love to judge accordingly to what they perceive in
              their own limited understand and knowledge of what they think you, him or your
              relationship is. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Do you agree or disagree? Because that answer
              will determine whether you bother about whatever entity outside yourself
              believes in. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Apparently, social pressure is something very
              real. Likely, it isn't just about the relationship; it could be such that (1)
              you might display unconscious effeminate behavior or (2) your emotional
              attachment to this guy is beyond what an average guy would normally give to
              another guy, thus that could possibly give rise to such a conclusion by people
              around you - that you two are gay couple. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Whether this is true or not, actually it
              matters little. Because as long as you are clear about your own sexual
              identity, being heterosexual (unless you have resolved an identity crisis and
              clarify that you are actually homosexual), that's all that you need to know. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I know this guy, who is quite effeminate in
              his mannerism and once thought he might not be straight, but hell, he is
              getting married later this year. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Sees this as an opportunity to expand your
              social circle. I mean, it's good that you have a good brother/friend that you
              can trust and count on, but you are still young and it's essential that you
              learn to socialize with other people, than to cling merely onto one person for
              companionship. Have a healthy mix of both girls and guys in your social circle
              and people with similar interest or ideals. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">It's not the end of friendship imho, just a
              transition that you have to manage. </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>

              <p>I do not agree. <br><br>If there comes a point of time where the roles are reverse and I hear people speaking bad things about my friend I would gladly tell them to shut it. If it still continues all I would do is show the middle finger and tell them to STFU.</p>
              <p>My views on friendship maybe different from others, but I do know how to identify and treasure good friends; for I have lost many in the past due to the similar mistakes that I may have made.</p>
