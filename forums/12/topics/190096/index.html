Go to hell, ANDREW FARKER!</div></blockquote>I'll be blunt about this:<br><br>As much as I can understand that you feel a deep sense of injustice (I'm a tutor myself, and I've dealt with unreasonable parents as well), you have got to watch that temper of yours. Hurling profanities at the tuition kid's dad online isn't going to change the way he thinks of you, and he may very well end up taking legal action against you if he finds out.<br><br>No point being a tutor if you can't maintain a reasonable degree of patience, methinks.<br><br>If you want to continue teaching your student then you're just going to have to put up with his dad. Just apologise nicely to him and say that you won't do it again. Remember that he's the one who's paying you the money and can simply sack you at a moment's notice. If you want him to continue employing you as his son's tutor, then you just have to suck it up and bear with him.<br><br>I know it sucks, but that's the way it is. I've also had to deal with totally unreasonable parents who make outrageous demands of me.<br><br>I'm not asking you to like that your student's father's attitude; I'm just asking you to put up with it.</div>
