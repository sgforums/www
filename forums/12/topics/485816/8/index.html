              <p>Unlike you, who need your wife to lie about how big your cock is in order to have an erection. </p>
              <p>My husband is not afraid of accepting his faults so he can become a better man. Our marriage can only get better and stronger.</p>
              <p>Your marriage will eventually stagnate , then decay. Due to your lack of personal growth. Your childish behavior will need to be out grown some day. </p>
              <p>Your wife will get bored dealing with a man-child and start dreaming she has a REAL man's cock inside her instead. Maybe she's already thinking about it.. like I said, women are better at pretending.</p>
