              My husband 's buddy, A, of his got married, his buddy's wife, Ms X got pregnant eventually. Oneday, we go to his other friend's house for gathering. When Ms X who is pregnant arrived, my hubby waited no more and rush to entertain her, totally ignored me. After Ms X gave birth and attended another gathering with us, my hubby also, upon seeing her, rushed to entertain her, and when she mentioned she wanted to go KL, my hubby nodded his head indicating that yes, he also wanted to go KL.
              
              Another incident, during a bbq session, my hubby sat alone at a bench, and when I wanted to approach him to sit together, I briefly sense that he wasn't happy? Cos after awhile, Ms X had wanted to approach him to talk but perhaps she saw me sitting beside him, she said she wanted to go get some drinks. (???? I don't understand, all this while, she just 'notice' my hubby but didn't 'notice' me??
              
              My question is,' Does my hubby likes her?', 'Does she likes my hubby?'
              
              There are some other incidents before we got married. I can't describe here, only can say, my hubby's body language really suggested otherwise even when I asked him whether he likes this wife of his buddy but he replied, he entertained her not because he likes her but because she is his buddy's wife. Is that true?

              you. </p>
              <p>Gay guys will not go for girls, and straight men don't go for
              gays. No competition here.</p>

Not just normal talk about the situation, cry your eyes out, explain how you're feeling, let him know that it's emotionally hurting you, and let him know you're jealous. Yes, don't be afraid to use the jealously word, it's common for a people in a relationship to be jealous, it's actually healthy.
