            <div class='col-md body'>From my point of view, it's the guy's problem.<br><br>I suppose most people have about almost the same definition of inner beauty, but apparently this guy doesn't seem to find HIS definition of inner beauty. Different people have different tastes. It doesn't mean you don't have inner beauty just because one guy said so. I'm sure that are many other people who know and can see your inner beauty. I agree with gerrykoh, its better not to hang out with him.</div>
