You should be more attracted to her, but since you're not, it means she's doing it the wrong way.<br><br>When a girl says she neglects her friends for you, and have to sacrifice so much to be with you, it means she likes you alot!

That's the least you can expect.<br><br>But no, she invested so much time and effort on you, to have you break up with her.<br><br>Yes she's sore, very sore about it, that's why she keeps saying what she does.</span><br><br><strong> wad should i do? I'm really at a loss now. </strong></div></blockquote><strong>What can you do ?<br><br>I see a few options here.<br><br>1) Patch up with her. - But do you think she will do that? Chances are its very very unlikely, unless you prove to her that you UNDERSTAND what she has been doing all the time, and will appreciate what she will do in the future.<br><br>2) Forget her. - This will be hard, but remember that time is the greatest healer, even though it leaves behind a scar...<br><br>Nothing else you can do i think.

She must have her own reasons for giving you the hot and cold treatment, and complaining that you don't understand her. Have you ever wondered if the problem doesn't lie with her, but with you?<br><br>The problem now lies in the fact that both of you do not understand each other, because you don't communicate. Hence, I suggest that <span style="color: red;"><strong>both of you should sit down and have a good heart-to-heart talk</strong></span>.<br><br>Talk to her about your thoughts and feelings, and get her to tell you about her thoughts and feelings as well. Ask her about what she really wants from you, and discuss about what both of you can do about it. Explain to her why you think she's giving you the hot and cold treatment, and tell her about your feelings. This way, both of you will understand how the other party thinks and will be able to better compromise one another.<br><br>However, if there is still no solution after a heart-to-heart talk, then I might suggest a temporary break up to let things cool down for awhile.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks pple. perhaps it's really my fault and i really dun understand her. the more i put in effort the more i screw things up. failure or not, i failed her this time. i appreciate her, but really not enough. i'm so stupid. the first time i decide to break with her i really should let her go, she wun be happy with me, but because i can't bear to, i end up hurting her even more. we spend too much time together to give each other free space and too little time communicating our thoughts. we're still together and even though i wanted to make up for everything, i know things can never be the same, and i can see it from her eyes.</div>

The way you deliver a message across (especially to your partner) is quite very important... Don't think that you're already so close and such, hence overlook things.. I mean some couples can work on that level of communication at appropriate times, but not all couples can do that or rather, not every partner would be able to accept that...<br><br>WORK on your COMMUNICATION with her... 'Guessing games' are quite a 'no no' though some might like to think of it as a privilege to the female... Personally, I feel that 'privilege' or not, as long as it jeopardise the relationship, I don't see what so 'privilege' about it... Sometimes 'guessing games' can add some 'spice' to the relationship, but when it come to important issues or things you're really concerned and bother with.. It's always WISE to BRING YOUR MESSAGE ACROSS... If one would like to just deliver a message 'hanging down there', should very well be prepared for the consequences...</div>
