              <p>1. You ASSUMED that you had taken your aunt's house keys while grabbing a set of OTHER keys.</p>
              <p>2. At your parent's house, you NEVER needed to use your aunt's key, so what fell out was another key you ASSUMED was your aunt's key which you later picked it up.</p>
              <p>3. At Jurong point, you realized your AUNT's KEY was missing amongst other keys you had on you, a key WHICH YOU NEVER HAD BROUGHT ALONG IN THE FIRST PLACE.</p>
              <p>4. When you searched in your car, the key of course could not be found as you HAD NEVER brought it along.</p>
              <p>5. When you reached home, voila! The key that YOU NEVER TOOK was lying in its original position.</p>
              <p>What really happened was a case of 'absent mindedness', a common afflication on the mind when you are thinking or daydreaming about other things than to FOCUS on what you are supposed to be doing, TAKING FOR GRANTED that your INSTINCTS would NATURALLY do what you want done.</p>
              <p>That it happened for quite sometime would only mean your mind is constantly deep in thoughts, perhaps over problems or unresolved issues and living reality based on error proned natuaral instinctive habits.</p>
              <p>The solution is to find a free time, sit down and work out your problems with or without others' help. If unresolved, then switch back to reality and FOCUS on what you are doing, one step at a time till your next free time to resolve your problems.</p>
              <p>Nothing spooky on what happened, but it may become spooky if you continue on this way, as you may be endangering yours or others' lives with your absent mindedness - while crossing the road or driving a car, leaving this world into the next.</p>
              <p>Take care and Cheers!</p>

              <p>Hi Larry Teo,</p>
              <p>What xtreyier has kindly suggested is the most likely possibility of what has actually transpired. An alternate but less likely possibility will be that you actually brought a duplicate key along without realising that there is more than one of the same key. Thus, the original key remain untouched on your table.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>lol why you hijack this tread? </p>
              <p>and TS, you're being paranoid. Do not assume it is done by spirits. The more you think it is, the more scared you are. just try to relax and calm down. let it cool off your head. Go swimming :) good for your mind. Concentrate! </p>
