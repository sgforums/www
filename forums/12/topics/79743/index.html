Be there for her, listen to her, yada yada yada... yeah u could touch her with ur sincerity n love, but that happens most of time in movies. We choose to believe in such a lovey doey state but in reality it doesn't exist that much. If I were u, i would choose option (b)<br><br>b) What do i mean by being smart? Ok keep ur distance but by being good frens. But start paying very close attention to who she really is. What's her inner person? What's her real character? Look out for her indirect words, her actions. Most importantly, what are her INSECURITIES in life? Everyone has insecurities. Most of the time it's simply company and love, but it could be more complex like she may have a huge selfcentred ego. The key is... to present urself as that solution to secure her insecurity. But it must all be presented as if love acted on both of u and fate brought u 2 together to be so in love. It's like u give me what u want, i give u what u want. It sounds cheap but in reality if explained in it's basic terms, that's what love is...<br><br>Choice is yours...</div>

If you are asking me what is the most effective way to change her mindset and be willing to settle down with you in a relationship - it's difficult for me to explain here unless I can possess your soul for one day to understand more about your situation.<br><br>You mentioned 'she is popular and pretty.' - therefore by plain waiting, I can guarantee that you will NEVER get her.<br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Consider three strategies now:<br><br>I) Advance without her knowing that you are advancing. (She sees you as an interest, but the impact is weak. Learn to chase her without her knowing/seeing that you are trying to court her - if not, this will raise defense and reduce your chance of success)<br><br>II) Keep a steady flow during the chase. Do not perform sudden halt, then cranky move, halt and move again. (Do that once and you are almost 'owned')<br><br>III) Adopt both serious and fun attitude towards her. Humor is a good element. (Personality wise, check and attract her with attitude and characteristic that she is most vulnerable to)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
