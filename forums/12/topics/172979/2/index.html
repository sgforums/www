Obviously u haven't met a true friend yet. Else you would have never said those words. I am glad and would like to thank God that I have not just one but more then 3 true friends. Those were there when I needed them. They were there thru thick and thin with me. I really mean it.. Especially this gal fren I have, is always by my side. We understand each other better then our gf/bf do us.. Yah.. Thats true friendship..<br><br>And to thread starter, Are you even reading these replies? I am sorry but I don't see you replying or even acknowledging all those good people who have taken sometime to reply n try to help you. I know you must be real sad and all. But if you noticed it, you not replying to them is already a major flaw in your behaviour. So first change it. Change the way you treat people and they will change the way they treat you.<br><br>Best will be for you to go and interact with people who have common interests. Like you said you like playing computer games then y not join clans and make more good frens? You will have a common topic to talk about and from that you can go to other topics.<br><br>Anyways, you are what you think you are. So why not think that u are a great n friendly guy and start behaving like one! =)<br><br>Cheers..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Loneliness seems to be in all of us, that's why we seek galfriend/boyfriend, friends, having children, having family. the reason of doing all these is to have companion and avoid loneliness. Some people cannot stand loneliness as it will make them go mad.<br><br>However, you can always join social activites like Religon studies, mountain climbing, tour to occupy yourself. Just be comfortable and at peace with yourself, and avoid the negative feelings like 'I am lonely so I am a loser'.<br><br>You are free alone and you can seek to do what you like. Take up a hobby like origami,  reading, etc and you will find yourself not lonely anymore.<br><br>Your friend do not want to go out b'cos they are occupy with hobby or they like to be alone. Friend who share the same hobby with you would like to go out with you. Havent you heard of 'birds of the same feather flock together'. So, be more open-minded.</div>

Life is not bad for you .. you are healthy and can see, play games... unlike those people suffer from poverty and died of hunger.. you are much better well off..<br><br>No matter what, be happy!<br><br>i think maybe be ur relative and cousins have done some injustice to you bt hey dude, why bother with those people and let them affected your life. Dude, you decide how your life is to be like. Get out to the real world and befriend more.<br><br>Maybe for the christian friends, they do not know you well initially and as time goes by, they start to know more about you and start to help you more.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>for me...i have friends , but whenever they jio me out , i always reject with some lame excuses. i know in my heart i wanna go out with them badly , but i dont know why my mouth reject them straight away when they jio me out. i dont know whats happening to me , at times i felt very lonely @ home , i dont like  to be a loner. i used to go out with them a lot , almost everday during holidays , but ever since i enter ns , i realise im drifting further n further away from them. i started to be a anti-social person. i dont know when i can return to my usual self. sigh</div>

But if u nvr take the first step ,how r u going to get closer to the 'fate'? A life time partner is the one that will really appreciate u,love u ,share yr happiness,sadness and care for u! She is the one really going to spend rest of yr life together with u.....As what some people say join forum outing or whatever to broaden yr social circle..I met my partner thru forum outing!</div>
