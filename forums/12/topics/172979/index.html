            <div class='col-md body'>You're not alone.<br><br>There were a few cases here before you, that's much worse i believe. One who has 'friends', but all they do is to use him when they do go out with him. One who's only friend went overseas and they lost touch.<br><br>You know, the strangest thing is, i believe that going for forum outings may actually work. You can try to talk a bit more, then go for one of their many outings. You'll meet a few people that way, and some of them may end up being close friends..<br><br>Alternatively, you can join you christian friends. Religion can really play a part in one's life, as you may soon find out.<br><br>Yet, the first thing you should do is to know your lifestyle must change, in order to know that something needs to be changed, one must realise that it's wrong, or ineffective. If what you're doing is not getting you new friends, then change it.<br><br>Hope this helps,<br>Aaron</div>

But at least I know I have friends with me in school. However, did you try asking yourself why don't you have friends?<br><br>Is it your characters?<br>What is it that you have done that make you not have friends?<br><br>If nothing's wrong, maybe you are just imagining things. Just cheer up and make friends around you.</div>
