Life is full of ups and downs... Your army friend better not sign on... One down moment in life and all his life collapse... In Army, lots of downs and ups... If he really wanted, he can prove his worthiness and get into OCS from SISPEC also. That show that he does not worth going into SISPEC and that is just an excuse to feel down....<br><br>Your other friend can always retake the course one mah... another excuse user pax...

Then somehow in her final semester, she didnt do as well and miss out by one grade. So she got 3.97 overall cap when 4.00 is what she needs to get second class upper honours. She feels devastated. And this honours stigma affected her whole life even now. (she earn less per month/cant get better job)<br><br>Another example would be my BMT army friend. Hes very athletic and friendly. He wants to sign on as officer. He even won Best physical Trainee for the whole platoon. Most people like him except for one section(8people). Maybe those people backstab him and grade him very badly in peer appraisal and eventually he got into sispec instead of OCS. His life go downhill after that.</div></blockquote><span style="color: darkblue;">This is a really bad attitude...<br><br>what, "she earn less per month/cant get better job"???<br><br>what, "His life go downhill after that"???<br><br>you are talking in terms of absolutes where there are none...<br><br>honours mean better job (not absolute)... better pay (not absolute) and that means <strong>happier?</strong> (not absolute)<br><br>got into sispec means lower status (only in the military, not in life) ... lower pay (only in the military, not in life) ... and <strong>miserable life?</strong> You/he made himself miserable (your/his mind), never the situation....</span><br><br>If you want to transform your mind... err learn philosophy (hard) or take up a religion (easy)</div>
