So, in fact, rejection is better, so that rather to have long period of wondering and pondering, at least you get the true out of it, it may hurt in someway, but it better be hurt down than later.<br><br>Finally after being rejected, you should feel released, now you can plan your life better and move on. As for him/her, take it as a friend. We must adapt to an open mind concept toward love. It is essential to control one emotion in term of love, dun look down yourself just because someone rejected you, perhap it is a blessing in disguise that someone out there is much better and  more beautiful and waiting for you to appear to hold his/her hands.<br><br>Learn to take rejection as you learn to accept.</div>

As for him/her, take it as a friend. We must adapt to an open mind concept toward love. It is essential to control one emotion in term of love, dun look down yourself just because someone rejected you, perhap it is a blessing in disguise that someone out there is much better and  more beautiful and waiting for you to appear to hold his/her hands.<br><br>Learn to take rejection as you learn to accept.</div></blockquote>Ok.<br>I cant help but laugh.<br><br>What the fuck is this?</div>
