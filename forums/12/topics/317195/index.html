              <p>Your condition is not uncommon among girls your age.</p>
              <p>I too suffered from this condition, but only for two years.</p>
              <p>It has to do with your self image thing. And no, you are not crazy.</p>
              <p>But it is possible to get over it.</p>
              <p>Start by eating smart and healthy.</p>
              <p>Know what food to eat and what needs to be avoided.</p>
              <p>Nowadays I eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables.. I call them guilt free food. These foods don't make me want to puke and and I can eat as much as I want.</p>
              <p>Foods that makes me guilty and makes me go puke are those oily and fatty stuff. Like pizza, hamburgers and deep fried food, and more often hawker food.</p>
              <p>It will be betta if you go vegetarian. But remember to read up on how to ensure you get a balance and nutritional vegetarian diet.</p>
              <p>At your age, you still need plenty of growth foods to ensure a long healthy life.</p>
              <p>If eating a healthy diet still doesn't help, please seek professional help.</p>

              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;">90% of people suffering from Bulimia are women and it's not because of their desire to be to thin - rather it's the <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>fear</strong></span> to be <strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">overweight</span></strong>. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;">You might want to speak to your teacher, school counselor or someone you trust for a start - someone in your social circle needs to know that you are suffering from this plight. These are the people who can provide you emotional and psychological support around you 24/7; the internet does not. </span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt; color: black; font-family: Arial;">You need to address this fear, because most of the time, it's unfounded.

              <p>At least TS is not in denial about her condition. She knows it and that is a good start. Since you are aware of your problem I think deep inside you are a strong person and can get out of it easily. Take the courage and talk to your parents again.  I'm sure they can help you the second time around just like they did the first time. IMO going to a psychiatrist is errmmm really a waste of money. Any good doctor will also help you to overcome your problem.</p>
              <p>Be strong and take care.</p>

              <p>Chuin,</p>
              <p>Your condition is not uncommon among girls your age.</p>
              <p>I too suffered from this condition, but only for two years.</p>
              <p>It has to do with your self image thing. And no, you are not crazy.</p>
              <p>But it is possible to get over it.</p>
              <p>Start by eating smart and healthy.</p>
              <p>Know what food to eat and what needs to be avoided.</p>
              <p>Nowadays I eat plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables.. I call them guilt free food. These foods don't make me want to puke and and I can eat as much as I want.</p>
              <p>Foods that makes me guilty and makes me go puke are those oily and fatty stuff. Like pizza, hamburgers and deep fried food, and more often hawker food.</p>
              <p>It will be betta if you go vegetarian. But remember to read up on how to ensure you get a balance and nutritional vegetarian diet.</p>
              <p>At your age, you still need plenty of growth foods to ensure a long healthy life.</p>
              <p>If eating a healthy diet still doesn't help, please seek professional help.</p>

              <p>Ong,</p>
              <p>I don't know what you've been eating. But it seems you're eating the wrong kind of foods and at the wrong quantities.</p>
              <p>A balance diet is important.</p>
              <p>I am no nutritionist, but a vegetarian diet high in fiber and substitute proteins plus multi-vitamins keeps me slender and trim.</p>
              <p>You may want to consult a nutritionist to resolve your weight issue.</p>

              <p><span><span style="font-size: small;">My name is Ker-Yu Ong, I am 18 years old and a recent high-school graduate from school in the USA. I am back home in Singapore for my summer vacation and have received a grant from my high school to pursue a community awareness project.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span style="font-size: small;">            </span></span></span><span><span style="font-size: small;">My proposed project is to create a book containing entries from the people of Singapore that focuses on the prevalence of eating disorders in this country. I hope to receive entries in any form (letters, art work, collages, photographs, poetry, just to name a few) from all who are interested -male, female, older, younger -that reflect their thoughts, opinions, experiences, etc. with eating disorders. All entries will be anonymous, so hopefully this project can also serve as kind of outlet for those individuals whose suffering is still a secret.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span style="font-size: small;">            </span></span></span><span><span style="font-size: small;">I am interested in this topic because I have personally suffered from an eating disorder for the past three years, and my experience has truly shaped the person that I am today. In February 2007, Channel News Asia reported that t</span></span><span><span><span style="font-size: small;">he number of teenagers with eating disorder has increased six-fold since 2002, and that the Singapore General Hospital said 140 new cases are reported every year. Each time I arrive home from abroad and catch up with friends, I hear about how many new people have "turned" anorexic or bulimic. An eating disorder, I believe, is a desperate cry for help, and it upsets me how trivial this topic may appear. T</span></span></span><span><span style="font-size: small;">he goal of my project is to bring more attention to the prevalence of eating disorders in Singapore, and hopefully to shed some light on the underlying issues that are plague these our community.</span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span style="font-size: small;">            </span></span></span><span><span style="font-size: small;">I have attempted to contact schools to ask for their help in letting students know about my project, but have unfortunately been denied at every institution thus far. I hope to receive help your help. If you are interested in sending me an entry, or know of any interested individuals or groups, please have them contact me at: </span></span><span><span><span style="font-size: small;">9636 7643.My home address, where all entries should be submitted, is:</span></span></span></p>

              <p>Lol why would your parents be disappointed? Parents don't get disappointed because their children have problems. They're disappointed when these problems are handled poorly.</p>
              <p>Well... I suppose it's better to cut down on intake than to puke everything out. Find out how much you should be eating (based on food charts etc.) but reduce it if you don't exercise much. (I expect that at JC level it would be almost totally impossible to exercise regularly.) That way you have a clear idea of how much you should be eating and there'd be no need to puke just to be sure. Remind yourself that this is a healthy level and it's perfectly healthy to stop there, certainly more healthy than to throw everything up.</p>
              <p>Good luck with battling this... Perhaps a greater insight, a better description of the source of your frustration with bullimia might help. That way we may be able to help you better. We need to understand why you have a desire to do this. Is this your way of telling people you need help? Is it just a habit? Or is it because you want to maintain your figure? This will be very helpful information for people unexperienced with this disorder so we can help you overcome it no matter how inexperienced we may be. =)</p>
