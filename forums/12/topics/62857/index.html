How man times have u aruged with someone you loved, and then found out later it was all just a misunderstanding?<br>One of the common problems in relationships is that after we get to know someone, we have a strong tendency to believe that the meaning we give to their words &amp; gestures are accurate.<br>We misunderstands their intended meaning. We jump to the wrong conclusions..<br></div>
