              <p>as per title.</p>
              <p>yes, i'm a loser but i'm trying to change. :-D</p>
              <p>i got less than a handful of friends now and these are guai-guai types, stay-at-homes like me.....i want to meet new people and change my life.</p>
              <p>people have said try going to clubs / bars, but that's really not my thing.</p>
              <p>i read in books that to meet new people, can join interest groups but i don't really have any interest in things like football or hiking or fishing.</p>
              <p>i used to be very super-shy and reserved, but now i've changed my personality a bit to be more playful and talkative.....only need to meet new people to complete my life.</p>
              <p>pls advise. serious only.</p>

Another thing could be myspace, I am pretty sure you can either find community groups on google (which is active) and you could probably start from there.</p></div>

              <p>also, no offense, but i think it's kinda hypocrite to volunteer for community services just to meet friends. :-D</p>

              <p>actually, we all get along very well and flirt etc., but there's always a thin boundary between girls and guys mah.......like when girls go out to do girly things, usually guys excluded. :-)</p>
              <p>yeah, sgforumers are good, but then, no outing leh......even got outing, the outing also very specific, like makan outing, or football outing type.</p>
              <p>as for interest, er.....it's video-gaming (very casual, not hardcore), and watching porn (main hobby lol......got porn outing?).</p>
              <p>and i don't like sports either (btw, football really makes me sleep).</p>
              <p>astrology is cancer. i think i fit cancer's personality quite well. ;-D</p>

              <p>no, never joined any outing before, dunno which interest / outing to join.</p>
              <p>and yeah, cancer really is me. :-D i really like nature and stuff, and although i don't really like cooking, i would prefer it to sports without a 2nd thought.</p>
              <p>and video games.....i only play xBox / Playstation that kind, not online games.</p>
              <p>online games.....er, really a bit silly. :-D</p>
              <p>i think i must find my own path.</p>
              <p>and that Jerry's geylang outing is it food only? i doubt these guys would go and fark prostitutes right? :-D</p>
              <p>maybe if there's anyone here like me without much friends but want to meet more people, u can post here and maybe we can organize a small group outing like 3 - 4 people, and we can do something small for a start, like go mcdonald's eat etc. :-D</p>

              <p>Aww... the old folks home thing was real sweet :D</p>
              <p>Hey, if you're looking for friends, I suggest starting out from sports/games. If you like to stay at home (like me), the Internet is your key to friends. Start out by playing games on different websites then getting to know others. Whether or not he/she is trusty will be up to your judgement...</p>
              <p>Sports is a real good alternative to meet up friends. It can't be that you stay at home everyday, all the time, 24 hours. You HAVE to exercise, right? If you ever go to parks to jog, many avid joggers would be there :D</p>
              <p>If you seriously don't exercise (as in really often), and you're 25, go be a volunteer. That's the minimum you can do.</p>
              <p>I'm half your age and similar to you (i'm not in primary school) HEHE. So you can choose not to take what I say, since well, I'm half your age o.o</p>
