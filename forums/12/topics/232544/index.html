It can fade away slowly but the person will always be someone special in your heart. That is totally normal... but the point is you still have to move on regardless... just keep it as a nice memory.</div>

It will erase any future awkwardness for that matter of fact and you could probably maintain that 'goodwill/causal friendship', even if you reckon that a relationship with her is impossible?<br><br>Like Devil had mentioned - shouldn't it be easier on your part to get along with life, since you had classified her as someone who 'took advantage' of your kindness? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
