              <p>Hi everyone,</p>
              <p>I am pondering if i should quit university... I am studying Biological Science for my degree now... right now, i feel like shit because i did not do well for my exams... I am really wondering if i am really stupid or what... it seems everyone is smart and able to catch those concepts easily while i spend a hard time grasping the concepts... i still manage to catch up for the concepts but in the exams it is always those minor details like remembering those reagents or molecules that is killing me... Also, there are always competition between friends... there is one guy who pissed me off recently... he keep on saying that he is not good in studies but in actual fact, he is and is getting good grades... seriously, what a F*****... i cannot tolerate the things he said also...</p>
              <p>I feel like quitting is also because of the stress... there are tremendous stress right now and i keep on having the fear  that i cannot get a good honours for the degree...</p>

              <p>Work <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">smartly</span></strong> with no life. That is the secret to getting good grades.</p>
              <p>As they have all said, just memorise first, understand later. Sometimes there are concepts which are too abstract to me, so I memorise, vomit out later, then understand only yet even later.</p>

              <p>anyway aiya i also a first yr uni student. struggling with my engin studies also. i guess uni is much different from what we used to do.. memorise then spit out what we rmb. uni is more of really understanding the concepts and applying them. thatz why i feel sometimes working hard is not enough.. its about working hard! anyway, i feel u will be less stressed if u lower down ur expectations. for me i just aim to be average student lor. whatever the case, as long as u give your best, then dont have any regrets about it =)</p>

              <p>Please, tt guy's attitude is not even trying to be humble... before the exams, he always mention: ai yeah i dun care i only here to get a degree... then you see him chiong like mad and right before exams call everyone to ask questions... moreover, his knowledge before his kan chiongness is already very good... is like he is smart already... then right after a paper, he will be yes this and that loudly...  humble? lol</p>
              <p>the problem is the uni paper requires you to remember not just one molecule or what... but a numerous of them... so what is the possibility of you remembering them the next time? in fact, do you still remember the things you learnt in sec sch in exact? concepts i bet we all can remember but not all the details... </p>
