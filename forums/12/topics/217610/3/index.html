So the streets or surrounding neighbourhoods in North Melbourne is generally ok? Alot of you are probably curious why i shelved the idea of staying in the International Hall Residence as i do not wish to be affected too much by hall activities as i heard there could be a number of them. I really wish to just focus my attention more on my studies and not be distracted. Also, i understand once vacation comes i wuld have to vacate my hall and take up residence again only when semester starts. I may want to stay on to work and earn some money during the holidays. I have chekced college square and min. lease is 1 year. And in the event that i have found a better option, i would have to pay a penalty of $300 and the rent till the unit is rented out to a new tenant. That would be really costly.<br><br>So, do you think it's alright to rent over the internet so i have a place to stay when time comes? Im studying commerce in Melb Uni btw. Im really trying to cut down costs as much as possible. Why i would prefer to stay alone is also i do not want to share my  apartment with people who are inconsiderate and their weird habits, later coming into a dispute and all. Very messy la. Though its cheaper but human relations can be complicated. Maybe once i have settled down there and know the person better then probably i may share the place.</div></blockquote>--------------<br><br>Hi<br><br>I have lived in North Melbourne for more than 2 yrs and  I still live here now .  I used to work night shift at Crown and came home quite late, I have never experienced anything bad  . It is true that the perception of the area is not good, but I rent my own aprt $750/mth with security entrance and a nice neigbourhood. It is good or bad, we are old enough to know what to do.<br>I like the area because It is close to Asian restaurent s and cheaper shopping as I dont have car and sometimes too busy to have time for cooking. Living expenses are a bit cheaper and it is just so close to the city , uni, and gym. I dont feel isolated in the area as living alone. Melbourne is not like Singapore.<br><br>However, there are a lot of aprtms for students in the city, and I dont think you will have problem, but please do not rent over the internet as it can be misleading. Alo, if you rent your own aprtm, please look for a real estate agent ; in case something happens, you can still get service and be protected by law.<br><br>Looking for work, overseas student visa only allows you to work 20hrs/wk legally  (unless cash in hand) and if holidays, it can be full time. Your uni attendace has to be more than 85%. Wages are just average for overseas students. But if you want to have a better paid in holidays, go to agency for professional job and you can earn up tp $20-36/hr depending on yr experience.<br><br></div>
