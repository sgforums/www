Therein lies the problem.  If it's not in black and white, the residence condition may not necessarily apply in a court of law.

I was never much of the clubbing sort to start with, so it's no biggie for me.<br><br>As for it being a place to retire, grow cattle and shag sheep, I'd say that's more WA than Vic. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

This happened 12 years ago when I was a first-year undergrad, and back then I was absolutely stuffed.  In any case, these days, something like that isn't anything to lose sleep over anymore, and I've got a lawyer who takes care of things for me.  I'll have to ask him about that one just out of curiosity.</div>

The photos usually don't give you a good idea of what the place is really like, and you'll need to check out the neighbourhood personally - the last thing you want to do is rent the place and get stuck with noisy neighbours.  I would suggest that you get temporary accommodations in early February at the latest, and then personally check out potential places to rent.<br><br>Right now I would suggest that you just do your research on the net to get a feel of what prices are like.  In the meantime, get your paperwork together!  You will need a statement from the bank - it doesn't have to show figures, but it must include a statement to the effect that you (or whoever's backing you) have definitely got enough cash to cover the rent for the duration of your stay.  Basically, any documentation that shows that you're a good bet for your landlord will work in your favour.<br><br>Brunswick and Coburg are all right neighbourhoods, although I personally prefer Brunswick - it's slightly closer to Melbourne Uni.<br><br>You've definitely made the right choice in avoiding the halls.  if you want to get serious about your work, you don't need the distraction of having a couple of hundred students around you.<br><br>Commerce, huh?
