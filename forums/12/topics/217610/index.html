            <div class='col-md body'>Hi guys,<br><br>I will be commencing my studies in Feb next yr in Melb uni. Currently, i'm having a bit of a problem finding accomodation. Date is drawing near n i still have yet to find one. Reason being im seeking private rental accomodation as opposed to college square and university halls as they are rather pricey. Would like to find out from those who have been there or are still studying there which are the areas or streets that i should not stay and where are the reasonable places to stay? I have looked at a few online postings from accomnet and S-H-A.com.au . Mostly alot of postings were showing High Street, Vale Street in North Melb and Collingwood.<br><br>Lastly, some of the areas i know to aviod are richmond and footsscray(not sure if i got that right). Though most would advise taking up hall residence, i understand that i have to vacate during the holidays and it would be much too troublesome should i decide to stay on during vacation to work. Any additional advises regarding internet, mobile phone , gas and electricity bills would be greatly appreciated. Way of life and people over there also.<br><br>Thanks guys</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Downtown Melbourne is pretty expensive, average is about A$1K per month. Neighbouring suburbs that are close to Melbourne uni like Carlton will be slightly cheaper, about A$800/month. I don't stay near the city currently, so I don't know much about the suburbs over there.<br><br>I'm using a pre-paid dial-up plan which costs $20 per 50 days. The home phone line connection is about $28/month, and each call costs about 16-20 cents. My average phone bill per month is about $45.<br><br>Electricity bill comes once every 3 months, mine is about $150.<br><br>Water bill is included in my rent.<br><br>I'm using a pre-paid mobile phone by Optus. Calls to the same telco's pre-paid users after 9pm are free.<br><br>The people here are generally friendly and polite. Way of life is pretty relaxed.<br><br>Cost of living is slightly higher than Singapore due to food (takeouts average A$6) and transportation costs.<br><br>Like what the other forumnites have said, find short-term accommodation or stay in the halls for a semester or two while you look for cheaper alternatives. It is better to be able to settle down immediately.<br><br>Good luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Ah, another Melbourne Uni student!<br><br>OK, surrounding Melbourne Uni, you have Carlton and Parkville, both of which tend to be somewhat expensive.  To the south you have the city - don't even think about getting a place there.<br><br>I recommend that you go slightly further north of Carlton and look in either Brunswick (NOT Brunswick West) and Coburg.  Brunswick is closer, but both have tram lines that runs straight past Melbourne Uni, and it's pretty convenient to get to school from there.<br><br>I strongly suggest that once you get here, get a car and a licence (if you don't have one already).  Even if you are at Melbourne, chances are that you'll have to go to the other universities' libraries to get research materials.  If you're living in Brunswick, take it from me that you do NOT want to go to the Monash Clayton library by public transport.<br><br>For starters to see what's available, look up http://www.domain.com.au, and check out Brunswick or postcode 3056.<br><br>If you have any further queries, please feel free to send me a PM.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>More thoughts:<br><br>- Having a place by yourself is always going to be more expensive.  A 1-bedroom place might go for $850 a month while a 2-bedroom place may go for $1200.  Do the math.  Also, if two of you are getting the furniture, it works out cheaper.<br><br>- I recommend avoiding furnished places.  The furniture's usually crap.<br><br>- Around the corner from Melbourne Uni, there's a bookshop called Readings on Lygon Street.  The side window is covered with ads for people looking for housemates.<br><br>- As spidee has said, the telco price wars work out in your favour, so look at a few and see who offers the best deal.  I've been with Optus for the last 10 years, and they do all right by me.<br><br>- Broadband should set you back about $50-60 a month.<br><br>- For God's sake, get a place with gas appliances.  You do NOT want to pay to run a gas stove in your kitchen.  Most places use electric heating, but if you can find a place with gas heating, go for it.<br><br>- If possible, avoid getting a place on the ground floor (unless it's a house) - ground floor places are cheaper, but it's really not worth it in terms of privacy and security.<br><br>- Speaking of security, you're right about Footscray and Richmond.  In any case, neither is as conveniently located as Coburg and Brunswick.  Collingwood's not too great on safety either.<br><br>- More stuff backing the car point.  If you do have a car, Footscray market is about 20 minutes' drive from Brunswick, and for things like meat and vegetables, it's much cheaper than the supermarkets.  And if you do get a car, top up your tanks on Tuesdays - it's the cheapest day of the week.</div>
