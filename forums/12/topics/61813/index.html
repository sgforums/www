            <div class='col-md body'>hmmm since u already said you told her b4 u liked her... and she's reacting in such a way, prob she doesn't want to take one step further in yr relationship wif her and just continue to remain as frens. So in tt case prob her actions is hinting to u tt she doesn't have any romantic interest in you...  perhaps tis is just an infatuation on yr part or maybe you're looking for someone on the rebound( after yr break-up wif yr ex)  tt you might have come on too strongly... hence i suggest tt you all continue to remain as frens and see how the relationship goes.. in any case keep yrself open to other girls and hope you'll find the right one someday!!

This does not only includes you; other people would be affected if they did what you did.<br><br>What you suppose to do? If she wanna avoid you, then let her be because chances are, she is not feeling very comfortable with your affection and attention. And yes, it is a one-sided love and like all one-sided love - you do not have the authority, power, stand and position to bargain or make request. Since you do not have all that mentioned, you could only wait or give up. I suggest the latter option, although if you have the fighting spirit, you could opt for the former decision, at your own risk.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
