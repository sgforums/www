Somehow that explains why you went into irc and other means...<br>Everyone wished that their prince/princess will appear one day. Fair enough.<br><br>Thirdly, may i ask? What is your frequency of having a girlfriend?<br>How girlfriends have you had?<br><br></div></blockquote>I first started dating at 21 yrs old, if I remember right. Altogether, I have 3 steady gf. The first 2 lasted only 3 months each due to problems, this one lasted about 4 years. My first gf was 5 yrs older than me, the second was 4 years younger than me, and this one is 8 yrs my senior. I had the second gf because my friends say I should try to get a younger gf because that is the right thing to do, apparently I did try and it didn't work out. She's pretty though but still only lasted 3 months nonetheless. I like ladies that are older than me, probably 3 years older is great, but even 1 year older also good lah. I really don't care, as long as she is older than me. Sort of like, you know, I really appreciate matured ladies. I don't like ladies who anyhow throw tantrums like a spoilt child.</div>

This is not dreamland. Wake up lar.<br><br></div></blockquote>Yeah, I do work mon-sun but because I'm doing flexible hours, I can work and stop work when I wanted to so most of the time I try to go out with my gf and spend time during the weekends, despite all the work and responsiblities.<br><br>I am matured enough to hang out with older woman, I am sure of that. But my looks, well, it didn't look old enough. I look like a 19 yrs old boy despite being at 25 yrs old, and I don't think I will look any older anytime soon.<br><br>It's easy to say alot of things here, but then in real life, it's not as easy as talking you know. Otherwise, everyone would have a perfect love life, had it been as simple as what you've suggested.</div>

Easy to say don't think so hard but when you suffered a broken heart then you may know how it actually feels like... There was 1 girl I really like and until now, about 8 yrs already and I still hope that I will get in contact with her again... Still miss her alot coz I will always remember one thing she told me about money. It leaves me a very good impression of her. Last time we argue and I stop contacting her due to some misunderstandings, and then shortly after she changed phone number... email also gone... If she happens to play sgforums... if your name is Beth and surname ends with starts with "L" then look for meeeee. Her email, now defunct already, was BethBubbles@hotmail.com</div>

"Who would like this $20 bill?"<br><br>Hands started going up. He said, "I am going to give this $20 to one of you - but first, let me do this."<br><br>He proceeded to crumple the 20 dollar note up. He then asked. "Who still wants it?" Still the hands were up in the air.<br><br>"Well," he replied, "what if I do this?" He dropped it on the<br>ground and started to grind it into the floor with his shoe. He picked it up, now crumpled and dirty. "Now, who still wants it?"<br><br>Still the hands went into the air.<br><br>"My friends, you have all learned a very valuable lesson. No<br>matter what I did to the money, you still wanted it because it did not decrease in value. It was still worth $20.<br>Many times in our lives, we are dropped, crumpled, and ground into the dirt by the decisions we make and the circumstances that come our way. We feel as though we are worthless; but no matter what happened or what will happen, you will never lose your value.<br><br>Dirty or clean, crumpled or finely creased, you are still<br>priceless to those who love you.
