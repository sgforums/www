I am causing her stress... She says she is always the one holding on to the relationship. She puts most of the blame on me. Although there were alot of things that I have done secretly, alot of things I should have said, but I didn't, and that makes me seem like I wasn't doing anything for the relationship. When she needs money, I gave it to her, I put her above me, sacrificing all my money to give her. When she has problems, I try to solve it for her. She likes to spend money, and I tell her she shouldn't do that, she doesn't care. And yesterday, I tested her and ask if she can treat me to a movie, she opens up her wallet and show me the $2 left. She bought a new 02 Atom phone recently, so she has money to buy that phone but no money to treat me to the movie, and yesterday is monday, it's cheaper. Anyway, that was just a test, money means so much to her that this relationship is doomed had I been poor. She wasn't like this in the past, that's why I loved her so much. She will spend money on me, even if I did pay her back every cent, but it makes me very happy. Then, things started to change some time back. She became obsessed with things and money. As I've said, there were alot of things I've done for her and only need her to keep her word, but she didn't. One example is when she had a mountain of debts on her credit cards, and I paid part of it for her, in the end managed to clear all the debts, nearly $9k of it. All I asked is that she cut up those credit cards now that the debts has cleared, but she couldn't, she said she won't use it, just keep it. Now a few months later, she chalked up debts again, I am giving up hope. I stop giving her money because it's a lost cause, I need to save money to get a house in the future, to give my kid a nice life, but it didn't matter to her what the future will be, she only cares about her life now, she can't endure hardships, she needs to buy new clothes every month, needs to eat expensive food every month, spending beyond her means. There's so many things that I know this relationship won't last, yet I keep hoping one day things would change. It won't change, so I have to move on I guess. And to think I was so faithful, won't even look at other girls, and I don't even go find whores. I know life isn't fair, so I won't rant further, anyway I'm dumped so I'm moving on.</div></blockquote>Good to see that you still have a sound mind. And to be able to analyse all the above. People change for no rhyme or reason. Guess you have to just accept that.<br>Talking to your friends may be not a good idea, in my opinion. Why? Because the more people you talk to, the more ideas you get, the more analysis they offer. And you end up with a major headache. What's the use of analysis after the fact? Leaves you nowhere. Instead find someone where you can pour your heart out, a listening ear. Ask them NOT to give their opinions.<br>Take a day at a time. You'll sail through this period soon. Learn from this experience. We all have gone through that stage before.</div>

Somehow that explains why you went into irc and other means...<br>Everyone wished that their prince/princess will appear one day. Fair enough.<br><br>Thirdly, may i ask? What is your frequency of having a girlfriend?<br>How girlfriends have you had?<br><br></div>
