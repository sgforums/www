Bet your 2 years ain't easy.. honestly, I'm experiencing it for less then a few months.. and I can feel rather depressed @ times. I did numb myself in work and company activities and always out meeting new pp. *_*  as suggested by some.. i wanted to have some other pp distracting me.. but.. if a guy wants to go beyond friendship... I just 'run' away. Feel like slapping myself sometimes... coz.. its rather irresponsible<br><br>I asked myself why i react like that.. then.. i realised I haven't clear my state of mind. (okay.. i'm kinda slow) I kept asking myself with qns like... " we loved one another.. why cant things work out?", "what if we got married?" or "he is the one, aint him?"So.. i just keep asking myself qn... trying to understand why things dont work out.. it may take years or.. even someday.. when both of us got married to another.. I'll still be figuring out the ans..<br><br>Watever that is... I wish u well and that both of us.. can go thru this stage of our life.. becoming stronger and happier.  btw.. i'm a taurus.....<br></div>
