            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Chaah,<br><br>It's been 2 years, &amp; you still haven't moved on.  You ask why...<br><br>1. Nobody can help you move on, UNLESS you want to move on.  Friends can persuade you &amp; comfort you till their throats are dry, but if you refuse to let go, &amp; you refuse to accept that it's over between the both of you, then No matter what anyone says, you won't.  There isn't anyone to blame but yourself, girl...<br><br>2. By hanging on, &amp; wishing you can turn back the clock, the only person you're deceiving is yourself, &amp; you're wasting Not only your time, but that of those around you as well.  Because they hafta keep being there for you to cheer you up, to comfort you, to talk you round.  Are you being fair to them?<br><br>3. Make a positive effort to tell yourself you wish to start afresh, &amp; it's time to close a chapter &amp; forge ahead with a new &amp; happier life.  Whenever you catch yourself thinking of him, make a CONSCIOUS effort to think about other things, such as shopping, colouring your hair, getting the newest magazines to check out new buys (ohmigawd, is this theurapeutic!), indulge in a homemade facial, etc.<br><br>4. Let all your friends know that you intend to move on, &amp; ask for their support.  They'll be glad to help you if they're true friends.  Let them take you out &amp; paint the town red.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Remember.  When you refuse to let go, when you refuse to accept, then the person who loses out most is YOU.  Because the world won't stop just because of you.  Others go on living, as do your friends, &amp; obviously he already has moved on.  It's only you who's stuck in a space which suffocates you &amp; makes you miserable.<br><br>Best of luck.

Learn to be independent of your own happiness.<br><br>Learn to love yourself more before you can proceed to accept love and love another person.
