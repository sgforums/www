Then after that something happened...her sis butt into the scene, and her sis wants her out so she can hv a go at me. So she listen to her sis, and had flings with other guys. I beg her to stay for the next few weeks but she was adamant to leave me. Hearbroken, i left with my entire world shattered...totally life changing event...that i never fell in love again for a long long time. 2 years after that she tried to come back into my life. she gave me a call during CNY and i was surprised hear her voice on the other end. she asked to see me but my instant reaction was to tell her that i was not comfortable to see her - it was a very cold response from me...as you see the old me who loved her had died when she left. the remnants of me...barely a skeletion of my oldself has no more of the same fire left for her. at the other end of the line...i can hear her heart dropped...but i had no feeling for that anymore. later she wrote me a letter to say how she cried when she left me...but i cannot feel for her anymore. i reply with a simple note and never write to her again.<br><br>was i being too cold? but i had died...</div></blockquote>Wah cool man u did the right thing!<br><br>Was she cold when you begged her to stay?<br><br>Does she love you deep enough to fight for you when her sis wants you?<br><br>When she sleeps around with other guys did she think about you?<br><br>Are you a dog who listerns to this gal who comands you to sit and stand whenever she please?<br><br>She had her fun and when no one wants her she comes crying to you..<br><br>Gals are such a joke..</div>
