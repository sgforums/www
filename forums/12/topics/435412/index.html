              <p>occasionally I'll have these kind of thoughts but they are just 
              temporary , I have not come to a point where I felt all is lost and 
              theres nothing left to go on. Anyway I felt that suicide is a selfish 
              and cowardly way to end your life.  It would be better if I sacrifice my
               life to save others, that will be cool and they may even remember me 
              for life lol. Well these kind of situation may not happen and even if it
               did I m not sure if I have the courage to sacrifice myself  to save one
               or a few. One thing is for sure I would not want to be the receiving 
              end , I would feel terrible if someone were to die for me.<br><br>I felt
               that I m expendable and I doubt my death would have much impact to 
              those around me. It would be   nice  if I could save or protect others 
              even at the expense of my life. Perhaps I watch too many movies where 
              the hero sacrifice his life to save others, but that is probably the 
              best way to end your life.</p>

(spare you my sad love stories)... one thing lead to another. I was divorved once, felt like a fcuking failure. Now it turned out that the divorce is a good thing. I'm happily remarried. And a father of 4 and a half. </p>
              <p>Life is not as bad as it looked then. Once the naivette got chased off by life lessons, life <strong>can</strong> be... as good as it gets. What you want may not be what you have. But what you have is confirmed plus chop what you want. Else why the fcuk are you holding on to it? :)</p>

              <p>You have never died before so you think dead is better than alive. I've always heard stories of someone hearing ghosts crying. It just got to show that dead is never better than alive. May be when you are dead, you would think alive is better than dead but by then it is too late for everything.</p>
