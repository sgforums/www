              <p>Inequality in wealth  distribution, and its related cousins  causes the main problems in the world today. Poverty, crime, drugs prostitution and trafficking in women are all the consequences. The world will never be free of problems as long there is inequality of wealth distribution. The Capitalist countries always argue that meritocracy and status leveling is a necessity for society to function, but the fact that it benefits only certain individuals much to the disadvantage of others does not go hand in hand with a harmonious society.But the harm unequal societies cause are orders of magnitudes greater than any claimed benefits such as progress, technological developments and financial returns.</p>
              <p>They put forth a theory that is remenisiscent of nature's food chain, but what they do not realise is in the natural world, everything is free and taken from one another. In this way, resources for survival are passed around , rather than concentrated in one place.  The western nation has long embraced this fact and introduced the concept of tax. Law and order go in hand with equal wealth distribution in society, and so do the concepts of democracy and the free world.In the 19th and 20th Centuries, rich nations agreed that a balance should be struck between corporations, governments and societies and this is being done through the tax concept.</p>
              <p>The poor and uneducated , or the handicapped have little means of survival and depend on the higher class of the population to better the world. This is the order of nature and it should not be refused or ignored. The balance of the world lies in this nature. While the educated and wealthy have no obligation to care about the poor, they are indirectly affected by the inequality in society. Their sons and daughters get kidnapped for ransom by people seeking this wealth for the betterment of themselves. people start wars and scams and society becomes unsafe. Any attempt to control this will result in more rebellion from the lower class. It is in the human to get the best for oneself, though at least have one living comfortably within means.</p>
              <p>The inequality of wealth distribution is a blind spot in international economics and in our understanding of the world.  The fight against an unequal society is one of the great challenges of our age. Our approach challenges basic tenets of traditional economic theory and opens new fields of analysis on a diverse array of important issues such as foreign aid, capital flight, corruption, climate change, corporate responsibility, political governance, hedge funds, inequality, morality – and much more</p>
              <p>Globalisation and international trade and finance have got a bad name of late. Each brings opportunities, and risks. We must now start to address seriously what may be the biggest risk of all: tax abuse, and tax havens and everything they stand for.</p>

              <p>I don't think we all would like it if every one were to be given the same supplies, ie. if one drives a Porsche, then all should be driving Porsche.</p>
              <p>In Singapore we need only to go to the Giant, Ikea, Courts hub at Tampines to see masses of Singaporeans at their capitalist worst.</p>
              <p>It is about as good as it can get.</p>

              <p>I don't understand what you're trying to get at. Are you really trying to talk about the tax system, like Ice Dive says?</p>
              <p>Anyway, income inequality or unequal distribution of wealth in society is indeed a huge and serious problem in societies all over the world; but it's hardly a blindspot in economics or for any government. I believe it's in every government's own interest to distribute wealth <strong>fairly</strong> (I don't think <span style="text-decoration: underline;">equally</span> would be right) in society. But with that said, it's difficult.</p>
              <p>BUT. I'm just saying.</p>
              <p>I don't know what you're trying to say. But I think you need to differentiate between what's fair and equal, socialist and 'harmonious', 'givingbacktosociety and equalwealthdistribution.</p>
