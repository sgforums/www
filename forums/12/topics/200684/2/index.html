His mom separated from his dad, who was an alchoholic and gambler. She lives alone and is on medication for anxiety and panic attacks. None of her grandchildren knows her. She lives her own life. His 2 brothers divorced. We only meet for the CNY 1st day. My parents marriage broke down a few years ago, followed by my dad's death. My mom is not on talking terms with all of us as she has so much hurt and anger in her. My 2 sisters are singe, unemployed and also seeing counsellors for their own emotional problems. My brother also went thru a painful divorce. There is no one to take over our kids. We have managed ALONE all these years.<br><br>My husband used to enjoy sports and occasionally gambles with his friends. I used to be very sporty too and used to organise gathering at my home. We would laugh and joke and have plenty of food on the table. However, eversince all the family problems overtook our lives, we gave up everything. It was a struggle just to get the kids to school and back and we finally got into a routine these two years. That's why we never realised the cracks until now cos we were too busy just surviving as we experienced the breakups all around us.<br><br>When I became a Christian right in the middle of all these crisis, <span style="color: blue;">I was told by some christians that there was a curse over my life.</span> They brought me to some deliverance sessions and I went thru a very frightening and traumatic experience of being delivered from whatever demons that were influencing me. I am afraid to approach the Christians in case I have to go thru another spiritual cleansing. So we go to church but do not talk to anyone. Also, after we became christians, I pressured my husband to give up gambling (big mistake, NEVER pressure your husband to do anything). I also presssured my husband to become a christian hoping that all these curses will then have no power over our lives, divorces, mental problems, diseases etc.  Our non-christian friends also avoid us after they know we are now christians and when they see both our families having so much problems, some avoided us like the plague in case like the sars virus they catch the curses too. I am a  very different person now, I used to joke and laugh and was very fun-loving. But now, I am so afraid of the words that come out of my mouth incase they become curses and I have become so sensistive to the words of others in case they become curses over my children's lives. So I don't mix with the other mothers when we pick up the kids cos all they do is gossip, gossip, gossip and the church says we have to account for every word we say to God. I am so stressed out and feel like I am going crazy. How come others can curse and swear and say anything and nothing happens to their loved ones? I see their kids eat junk food and drink coke as babies and they are so healthy. When I took care of my children, I gave them healthy food and yet my son was very sick for 4 years and I took care of HIM all ALONE. My husband just switched off. I am so scared that if I make a little mistake in my life, my chldren will get back their health problems. The bible says that if you continue sinning, worse things will come into your life. I am so tired of trying to be the perfect mother and wife. I don't do any of the things that are considered sinful. I am just the average ordinary person with feelings. Trouble is that anger and unforgiveness is also sinful? I can forgive someone who has harmed me but I can't be friends with that person again and I get told off that I must love and cannot be unforgiving. How to survive like that?</div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by four-niner:</div><div class="quote_body">Maybe your hubby misses the old life where your family used to do things. One thing is some guys DONT LIKE women to boss them ard, they may keep quiet but it dun mean consent, initially it can be flattering having someone take the initiative doing all the things, arranging this or that but too many time after a while it can be negative, things get swept under the carpet he dun say you dun know but once quarrel all this comes out. communication is the key.<br><br>Regarding religion, it is very impt to have common religion for family harmony this should not be forced and both spouses must agree willingly.<br><br>Though I'm sort of christian is not my place to say abt other churches but I know this ... god is very simple only, if you find that your life borders on near hysteria or doing very extreme things then that is not being christian and is not what god is abt.<br><br>A good example would be David, during his life he suffered very much, his life is a constant cloak and dagger intrigue, he either was always running after his enemies or he running away from enemies, and he killed a lot of people and even harmed his own men so he can steal other peoples wife but he had a relationship with god and god with him, when he do thing wrong  god punish him just like any father would discipline a son. But he never dwell on those punishments. The point I'm making is god always forgives no matter what kind of scoundrel you are and a relationship with god is very simple only.<br><br>But if as your christian group say <span style="color: red;">god will curse you </span>if you do little bit wrong then I think David would never have become king and jesus would not be born of his line later on either.</div></blockquote><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>MOD</strong></span><br><br>Clarification Point: Topic starter mentioned the christians say she was cursed.

            <div class='col-md body'>I am not one of those aunties that you see outside the school. Precisely, that's why I read widely and try my best to keep up. Didn't u read what I wrote, that I try to discuss current affairs with my husband but he is the one not UPDATING himself. I attend seminars on health, financial, educational and social issues. If my husband is available, he comes along, if not I go alone. Even then, he does not want to discuss anything after the talks. Certain issues, you need to state your stand. Also, a person can never be the same after 15 years. Everyone changes, even after a year. We grow mature, or interests and opinions change after each major life experience that we encounter. I also make sure that I look presentable enough, as I still have to attend the occasional annual company dinner with him. So...<br><br>About work, I know some of my girl friends work because their husbands are not earning enough. They are so stressed out, and their kids are having problems in school. This solution works only for those who have very good family support and close relationships with the in-laws or grandmothers. A girl friend told me her life is so meaningless, work, work, work, then come home housework, housework, housework. There is even less time and energy for the couple.</div>

You can try to communicate with him and see if the issues are really there. HOWEVER, do NOT push and stress him for answers...<br><br>1st thing. Straight opinion and no offence. Given your hubby's background, it won't be very much surprising if he's more prone to go into a 'reserved' nature. His current status could be due to many possible factors (including some already mentioned by other forumites) like...<br><br>1. Mid-life crisis<br>2. Stress at work<br>3. Contentment with life (withdrawal into comfort zone)<br>4. Adapting to a new role (father?) in life<br><br>At any point, family counselling though won't guarantee any result is certainly worth a try... Family counselling is not solely about finding out the 'root of problem' and forcing that particular party to change, but to try and work things out together instead...<br><br>In any case, your hubby certainly seems like he has lost that zap in life.<br><br>My personal advice for now is to try and gain back his interest ONE STEP at a time. Don't go for extreme things or do things in which you would expect to see that change in him INSTANTLY. Instead, do milder things and just allow that opportunity to pour in naturally if it happens... MOST people cannot or doesn't like to be forced to do things they don't have interest in... So try to arrange things in such a way that could interest him (more of that nature and tendency as you're targetting mainly on him) and hopefully interest your kids to an extent at the same time? You can try and work on PC games (which allows involvement of most if not all of the family); do a birthday celebration for him; or some special occasions. But try to plan things in such a way that they don't just end there. eg. for him shopping or dining vouchers so that he can bring the family out... Work on the smallest of his comments to boost his confidence... ie. if he suggest something and you think that could be worked out, tell him it's a GREAT IDEA! But try not to push too many tasks into his hands for a start as he might still be in a lazy or uninterested mood? What you really want to get him to do is to begin getting interested in things for a start... Not make him RESENT and 'withdraw' again....<br><br><span style="color: blue;">Friends.</span> Quite very important thing. As related to communication within the family and his lost of interest to life... No offence.. But that's simply because there really isn't much of a life to start with? THE FAMILY needs to ENLARGE their SOCIAL CIRCLE!! YES!! AS A WHOLE!! Go OUTDOORS and LEARN SOMETHING as a FAMILY!! Go for NTUC fairs and PARTICIPATE in GAMES and COMPETITIONS!! KNOW MORE PEOPLE as a FAMILY and KEEP CONTACTS!!<br><br><span style="color: blue;">YOURSELF.</span> You'll NEED to keep COOL and stay in BALANCE... Yes. Get yourself a LIFE! BUT keep it in GOOD BALANCE!! Don't overdo it until the point where you drift from your kids and husband... KEEP IN GOOD SHAPE and GOOD SPIRITS!! BE A LEADING ROLE MODEL!! INSPIRE YOUR FAMILY!!!</div>

Nowadays a lot of family have to depend on 2 person working to support it together.<br><br>If he want to quit ? then why cannot you think of the option of quiting as a house wife also.<br><br>Maybe it is time for you all to have a good talk, and explore other options, with more modern thinking then bound by old traditions thinking.</div>

Precisely, that's why I read widely and try my best to keep up. Didn't u read what I wrote, that I try to discuss current affairs with my husband but he is the one not UPDATING himself. I attend seminars on health, financial, educational and social issues. If my husband is available, he comes along, if not I go alone. Even then, he does not want to discuss anything after the talks. Certain issues, you need to state your stand. Also, a person can never be the same after 15 years. Everyone changes, even after a year. We grow mature, or interests and opinions change after each major life experience that we encounter. I also make sure that I look presentable enough, as I still have to attend the occasional annual company dinner with him. So...<br><br>About work, I know some of my girl friends work because their husbands are not earning enough. They are so stressed out, and their kids are having problems in school. This solution works only for those who have very good family support and close relationships with the in-laws or grandmothers.

Let him live his life in the way he wants... why is that so difficult?<br><br>Since he is so lethargic, if you leave him alone, he will just not do anything and simply continue with the marriage?
