I studied up to 'O' levels but I love to read n read n read. I have tried looking for a part-time job but the offers are really miserable, a tuition coordinator agency offered me $3 an hour, an education centre offered me $6 an hour. If I go out to work, I get a part-time maid to help me clean the house, it costs me $10 an hour.  I used to get $3500 per month but of course that was 10 years ago before the kids arrived. My personal advice to the younger ladies out there is NEVER give up your career for your family for too long. You will not make it back there and when the kids are grown, they really don't need a full-time mum and you are stuck.<br><br>I have tried getting the husband to "wake" up. We have been to overseas holidays, shopping, movies, picnics, bbqs etc. I have to organise all these activities, he just seems emotionally absent during all these outings. The shopping trips got so bad, he was just dragging himself around, I now do the shopping either on my own or with my kids. I thought maybe he feels less of a man since these activities are organised by me, so I tried asking him to organise an outing or holiday, but he did not know how to do it. So I discreetly gave him some agency names and left him to learn. He started to give all sorts of excuses and in the end I had to do it. Even eating out is a problem. I have to do everything. Once I asked him to order, but the kids did not eat what he had ordered cos he does not know what they like to eat, since he never talks to them. Then he got angry, shouted at me and said he "bo-chap" and will leave me to do all this. I told him that he has to learn what the kids like, but I can't get through. He has never been involved in their studies or their lives. It seems he has just been following behind like a black shadow. I have not realised this, but I am beginning to see it now. He must be a very unhappy man. Yet he can't speak up his problems. I try to ask him for his opinion on anything, the elections, changes in the education system, he says he doesn't know. He's got no opinions on anything. What else can I do?</div></blockquote>Dear an_open_door,<br><br>Are you sure you are open door, sound more like a close door to me. You say it with 'O' level can get $3500  that was donkey year when police wear shorts. Please dig yourself out to the real world, ask around how many degree holders out there that work for years and yet to get $3500 ? and how many are out of jobs ?<br><br>Think you forgot to be thankful, you already taken for grant your good life and fine fault with it. You get hoildays, shopping trips .... but have you ever ask yourself, why your husband seem emotionally drainned ? Did you even stop to think how much strenght, effort, blood and soul he have given up to earn that type of money in the tough job market to be able to bring you on hoildays and shopping trips, of course he is drainned.<br><br>If he working his ass off to provide for hoilday, what is so wrong of expecting the non-working wife to make all the hoilday booking and arrangements. You think bossess so good pay your hubby to use office time to do it ?<br><br>You a problem woman, you ask him to order in resturant, if he not order, you and your kid fuss over it !!! Instead of blaming yourself for spoilting the kids to be picky on food, you blame your husband.  Of course everything he does - you all not happy , do you also not happy, of course he is dare not get involve with you and your kids !!!<br><br>Of course he is a unhappy man !<br><br>What you to do ? get out of your housewife and see back what is really happening outside, it is no longer the good old sunshine days that you left it to be a housewife, it is raining days which your husband have to struggle. Maybe instead of complaining about him getting his clothes and your house wet, maybe it is time for you to wait outside and hold a umbrella for him to shelter him from the rain into the house.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Clarification: I did not say I am an open door. I am searching for an open door that's why I joined this forum to get a more global picture of the situation.<br><br>Clarification: Giving feedback is different from complaining. Eg if the hubby orders spicy food or gives fish with bones in it to the kids, we keep quiet, smile sweetly and give them to the kids? Problem is  he is so out of touch he does not know or care what his children eats. Is this spoiling the kids?<br><br>Clarification: I used to work and came home to do the household chores, take care of the kids, put food on the table and everything else. Now he goes to work and comes home to a clean home, kids homework DONE! all school problems taken care of, dinner on the table, fruits cut and waiting, fridge and kitchen cupboard stocked up, laundry in place. His friends problem - one side of socks missing, shirts burnt or missing cos maid has misplaced them. We got no maid, so no maid problem.  he doesn't even have to top up the toothpaste or toilet roll, like hotel ok? Still need to go out and shelter him from the rain? That would be really suffocating. I don't even do that to my son. I buy him an umbrella and tell him to use it if it "rains".<br><br>Clarification: If I choose and plan the holiday, I am being controlling. If he choose, he picks places suitable for adults, he has no idea how to include the kids. So we just give him face and follow? Point here to all young men and women: if u r not ready for the sacrifices and responsbilities of a family, remain single. It's not tien mi mi, tien mi mi forever!<br><br>Clarification: Is working life really all that bad? Donkey Monkey years ago, I started with $900 pm and retired years later with $3500 pm. Cos I was willing to work hard, read up and learn and contribute. Working life is good cos u get paid, CPF is growing, u get medical and social benefits, u get experience for the next better post, n if u r lucky u make one or two real friends. Not like this anymore? Please update me.<br><br>So we live in a real world with real people with real problems!<br><br>No offence meant, no offence taken. We r all just communicating honestly!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>reading ur clarifications, i came to realise something...who are we to tell u or give any advises whatsoever when the problem u are having is domestic in nature. and are you trying to gather sympathy votes here? or trying to find a friend, perhaps? what's your objective/motive in this forum?<br><br>you should instead proceed to talk things over with your husband and if he doesn't want to talk about it, then go to a professional counsellor.<br><br>period.</div>

Or RATHER... Change the situation for the better of EVERYONE... Often, only when it's a 'win win' situation then the other party would be more likely to change...<br><br>Have patience too...?
