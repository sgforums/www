It was difficult then to leave him, cos I did love him but it did drive me nuts with insecurity especially when she reputedly looks like a model etc etc.<br><br>What happens then if you love someone too much to leave him/her even when you know you may not yet be able to win his/her heart truly? He/She may have given a relationship a chance, but trust is something that needs time to build up. Now, whenever if an ex contacts me, I let my husband know. He trusts me to handle it because I give him this security that I love only him.<br><br>Its wonderful to have a relationship where both are secure in their love for each other, but sometimes it just doesn't work that way.<br><br>They have their own issues to sort out... and if you care for her, and you feel she does love this guy she is with, then I would think you do the gentlemanly thing and let her concentrate on building this relationship.<br><br>Afterall, she is not your only friend. And if she is just a friend with relationship problems - I think you can just let her know you will always be available for a listening ear and helping hand, but give her space to sort out the issues she has with her current bf ba.<br><br></div>
