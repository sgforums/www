Imo trust has to be earned and not blindly given. At this time my gf has truly done enough to earn mine and this trust will be always on a on-going review basis determined by her behaviour and honesty to me.<br><br>Its a true and honest feeling when people say they trust their partner but not the ex... i said that to my gf too... ren xin ge du pi, zhi ren zhi mian bu zhi xin... i will not bad mouth my gf's ex but neither will i trust him or any other guys to behave gentlemanly behind me in front of my gf...its not about self confidence here, its about not being naive as a matter of fact...<br><br>take care Itachi, imo if you want to have a friendship with your ex, do a little bit more to earn her bf's trust...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>Well, I think it's diffcult to avoid ur ex totally like he/she just send a greeting message of how u do u do. What i trying to say is though a broken r/s does not mean each of you cant be frenZ in the future. In a r/s, wat u need is an trusting and understanding partner, be ready give to give ur umost understanding to creat a mutal trusting r/s. If u love him, believe in him and hav confidence in urself as well as in ur r/s.<br><br>Cheers!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>is jealousy and distrust the same?<br><br>Sounds to me a lot of these people are suffering from jealousy. They just don't want to share the love or time or attention of their partner with someone who used to have it.<br><br>Would you equate that with distrust?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>no offence, but the girl should just ditch him...he is selfish and insecure and dosen't trust his gf, at all... selfish not to other ppl but his own gf, imagine he does this not only to you but other guys, this dosen't do gd to her... also selfish in the sense that he dun let the girl see the other "better" opportunities ouit there n keep her for himself.... another thing is the girl is plain stupid...can't see this, maybe u shoul;d show the girl his msgs... see her response, if she sae she ok with it and wanna end ur fren ship, too bad for her, her lose n she is stupid...<br><br>a relationship should be filled with love, trust, faithfullness... not a jail...<br><br>i have gfs, i do let them mix with their exs, to the extent that 1 returned to her ex, i did feel hurt, but its the good for her coz sees gt some 1 she thinks is better... i will get jealous when my gfs talk abt/with/to their exs or go out with them, she will too if i did the same... btw, i do communicate with my exs also... its all about trusting ur gf, her faithfullness and the best for both parties... true, if either party leaves the relationship, but look on the bright side, u may get a better partner infuture and lucky it isn't aft u r married... also, if u realli love that person, dun limit her/him frm their happiness...<br><br>SHE/HE LEAVES BECOZ SHE/HE IS HAPPIER THERE!!!!
