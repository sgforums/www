            <div class='col-md body'>Hm... long distance relationship... tough question!<br><br>Well, all I can say is that from what I know, it takes a lot of communication, time and effort. It has an advantage because the technology is really advance these days and video cams are so accessible.<br><br>However, the con will be the <strong>lack of physical contact</strong> between the couple. It's a failing factor that will pull a relationship apart as physical contact is a very important ingredient.<br><br>Certainly, it depends on how the couple interact to make the relationship work. But in my honest opinion, long distance relationship rarely last. I believe, that the maximum it'll last is only for a year.<br><br>Feel free to prove me wrong. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

And to love somebody is a gamble - When you put your heart into the relationship; you risk breaking it. The question here is: Are you willing to risk heartbreaks, disappointments, disagreements, conflicts, or seperations as an inevitable price to pay when you enter any relationship?<br><br>If one is holding on to any emotional baggage (such as hatred for their ex-es, insecurity, loneliness... etc), he/she cannot afford to pay the price mentioned above. Only when two individuals who are whole and complete can afford to enter a relationship and this will result in a more fruitful development within their relationship over time.<br><br>In conclusion to olala's statement: You can choose who you want to give all your love to. But bear in mind the price you have to pay.<br><br>Don't hate the other party if that person has a change of heart, because everyone including you have a choice.

How did you got to know her? Is she a 'quick warm' or 'slow warm' person...? Does she talks about anything else to you other than photography and photoshop? Is the topic of 'photoshop' closely related to photography in your context of discussion...? Are these 2 topics what you two talk about only most of the time...?</div>

Though it doesn't guarantee anything, but at least it's not a bad sign...?<br><br>One thing is... It might be better to have your emotions and feelings for her in check if possible... If you really can't withhold it, can try dropping hints from time to time rather than to just 'drop the whole bomb' on her at the moment where you can no loger hold back...? Or you can try to channel them into 'hints of expressions'... Expressing bits of your feelings for her in various ways... But as much as you might be directly or indirectly (hinting) asking... You should always be prepared that there's a chance that you might be rejected...? Like they've always said... Nothing ventured, nothing gained...<br><br>So have you worked out on the LDR thing yet? It could be really quite a challenging and taxing thing especially when you don't really have quite an idea of things... And for her behalf.... Would she be prepared enough to hold on for that? She has any previous experience(s) in BGR....?</div>

First, the very apparent ingredient - Physical Availability. Being there for a person takes up the most part of a relationship in reality. Humans need physical contact and presense so that a stronger bond and impression can be formed within a relationship.<br><br>The presense of this ingredient will in turn take effect on how they will react towards each other as obstacles come along. It's easy for one to say that one will overcome the obstacles by faith and will. Nevertheless, when obstacles such as distance, busyness or even temptations appear, these will put a challenge to the long-distance relationship, which is lacking in physical contact and availability.<br><br>Although I would not deny that there are still couples who made it through and officially got together after their long-distance separation, these handful are, unfortunately, rare.<br><br>To conclude, it's a long suffering for both parties. Challenging as it may be, the reward to these long-distance couples is worthwhile. But, on the other hand, one may rather wish to pursue earlier happiness that will last for a long time than to be physically challenged periodically. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>well said.. ur ang mo is good too nia.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>
