There are many guys in the world who will accept almost any kind, category, types of woman, as long as they are biologically born female with decent character, its good enough. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>My theory is this: Pick the girl that appeals to you the best (highly subjective, since it is personal preception) because don't ever live your life one fine day and discover this someone who looks better than your gf and your heart start to itch.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In your case if you are able to get pretty g/f with decent character, then go ahead, because let me tell you: you can give chance to plain jane (I said giving chance because I presume you ain't very interested in them, because if you are really interested, looks factors stands very minor precentage - its more about the inner beauty) - but one fine day Miss pretty with-as-good-as-your-gf's character were to appear and its likely, you heart will spin and comparison take place.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In summary: Its bad to dump your gf for another gf because of physical looks. So choose one that is appealing in your eyes to reduce the chance of such scenario.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Actually... I believe people are all judgemental animals. Usually their eyes will spring towards the most attractive first... But falling in love really is much more than that... it takes time and lots of chemistry, a lot of understanding. All these will only show when you spend quality time with your partner.<br><br>What Yunhaier mentioned, I sorta agree. The "play-safe" policy. It may sound bad. That is why you have to know your own character. Are you one who gets distracted easily? For instance, you are given a very caring and good girlfriend, but in terms of appearance, she is never what you want. Then a babe walks past, hints at you... will you start wanting to know her? Even with that slightest thought, it is already a wrong move. No determination.<br><br>So quite often, the dilemma is... you have fall in love with this charismatic girl, she has lots of wits, intelligent and fun. But she is those average kind of girl on the streets, and you like her for who she is. You know her and might have the chance to know her more, and develop more feelings from there. But at the back of your mind, something is pulling you back...<br><br>You fear that one day, if you and her are already an item, an attractive girl walks into your life, or a pretty girl you like long ago fancies you all of a sudden... and your current girlfriend is definitely more inferior in terms of looks... will your heart and mind begin to struggle?</div>

But the truth is....  because she's pretty.<br><br>I found that the one of the most basic requirements for me to fall for anyone is her looks!  Though I won't fall for EVERYONE who looks beautiful.  Being beautiful is one thing, she must at least have a decent behaviour too.  Whao!  Such high requrements!  <span style="color: red;">I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks this way</span>, just that not many would admit it.  It makes you seem so shallow.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>The thing is, I don't want to feel this way.  I don't want to fall for only pretty faces.  I want to fall for ordinary looking girls as well.  I have missed out a few chances of going into a relationship because of the way I think.  Because the girls who had feelings for me, didn't really score that well in the looks department.  I wished I had given them more chances, but I simple can't.  I have no feelings for plain looking girls like them.  Why??!

"Was it merely lust or U REALLY like her?"<br><br>Wat I now do (regarding yr &amp; MY case), I take it naturally. I still "like" pretty faces, BUT then I get to NOE her 1st... then once long liao, I OVERLOOK her aesthetic features &amp; start to see more of her "inside" as in her character &amp; such...

This is the reason why people will choose parterns whose overall looks factor are the same.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>However, this is not always the way it works. Self esteem, confidence, karmic relations, personal character adds up to about 75% importance. Look on the street and you will find couple of average looking guys with stunning babes.<br><br>Why you may ask?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In warfare of Love, first Law of the Art of Seducation, everyone is either seducing or being seduced. There are 18 differents types of victims and 9 different types of seducer, each with its own strength and weakness. They are people who will tend to fall for that kind of seducer because of two reasons.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I) Childhood psychological and 13 - 26 years of environment influence.<br><br>II) Astrological, spiritual, karmic relationship with that person.<br><br>Ok, I am going off topic. <strong>However bad their character is, their looks always seem to be able to cover it up for them. </strong> - it highly subjected to individual basis, but for my case, I see no reason why their looks can cover-up - the risk factor category of people will be probably react in this way is people who worship girls (definition - treat girls better than guys a thousand times (Flaws of Inequity) - not neccessary buaya.) Well, for me, I don't believe in pretty girls must have such benefits - if their character suck, probably I wouldn't even give in to them.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Everyone wants a good looking gf/bf with great character, no doubt. The key thing is that are you able to get them? Desire and reality is two different thing: if you are able to - I say go for it, because when you found a good one - its unlikely you will drop him/her for another potential - then everything has to be depended on how this relationship is being led.  In theory, this will greatly reduce the chance of failing in the relationship - however it best to be work in two ways (she preceived (highly subjective) you are good looking and same other way round.), but in reality: it isn't so perfect. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
