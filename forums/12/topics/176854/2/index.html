I think because they just wanna be happy and dun like to be troubled by little things that they dun know how to solve.<br><br>I assume maybe by ignoring the problem, it is consider solved to them. emotional problems are conceal, avoided and never talk about, but if its some technical problems, they will be more than willing to help you happily. cause they like to feel useful and able to help but not helpless and unable to answer your question. I am too wondering why men dun talk about their emotional feeling, I feel very frustrated about it too. but no choice to accept this fact. sometimes maybe they do talk about it but firstly they need to think about it for a long time first...</div>
