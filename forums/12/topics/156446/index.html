            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a bit confused. If they really are your "close group of friends", I doubt they would even do the things you've mentioned they did. And even if they they, they'd make up for it.<br><br>I'm an anti-social so I can't say much for myself, but from what I've seen from my other "more popular" classmates when we hang out as a group, if such incidents occur, everything's met with apologies, hard but friendly whacks on the back and then an offer to buy whatever the said person wants, as means of apology. It's all done in a very light-hearted, but sincere manner.<br><br>Also, don't worry too much about your physical appearance, that isn't all that makes a person nice to know. I know of someone who's really large and all, but he's a very pleasant, fun-loving guy who's damn optimistic and all, in the end you don't even care that he's fat. He's one of the people whom I really admire because of his spirit.<br><br>*pat*</div>

Grrr. *makes mental note to always hit control+c before posting*<br><br><blockquote>sorry to say that ,i think u r fat n ugly,find new fend</blockquote>Hey, thanks for the encouragement. [/sarcasm]<br><br>monstar83: D'you have any hobbies or likes and stuff like that? From what I gather from your first entry, you don't sound like a very social person. (This is coming from someone who spends nearly all her time glued to the computer. XD; *gets whacked* ) Why not try out online friendships? If you have meeting-people-face-to-face-phobia (like me), it's a great way to start off. Join a few communities that have people who share your interests and just talk away? At least if they "forget you", you can always harass them via private messages. &lt;<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I used to be like this too when I was in primary and secondary school. I realise after a while its not others who treated me badly but its me myself who never make myself known to others, I was too reserved and dun voice out my opinion in the conversation in a group. I was so afraid to speak out because I scare of people thinking I made a cold joke. They would forget me everywhere they go, even asking opnion also nobody will care about what I think. I start to think I am too stupid or not pretty enough thats why nobody like me enough to care about what I think.<br><br>I realise as I grow up that people forget about one's existence, its not because of any of looks or intellectual. its because theres no contribution to friends about your thinking, and you are always keeping quiet when everybody are talking and laughing, its close to invisible you will become.<br><br>Be the one to start a conversation, be the one who organise an outing. learn to give more opinion about things people say. Friends are about sharing thoughts, enjoying each other company, helping each other and more. start by observing how people converse with each other, how they get people to attract to them, how they make themself so known to people, why people enjoy talking to them.<br><br>Remember its not about looks fatness or intellectual. its just about communication. How you present yourself in talking. Attract people with your personality and be you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>this is my first post in someone else's problem, but well.<br><br>i think u shldn't try too hard to force yourself into a grp of friends. firstly cause if they don't like you (or don't realli care abt), you will only look like a fool trying so desperately to get into a circle of friends, impressions r hard to change. and even if the rest of your "friends" are okie towards you. there might be someone (or a few of them) that realli hates you (human r like that, they can hate pple for no reason), then chances of you being invited to their gathering wud be xtremely slim.....<br><br>and also, if you try to make new friends, don't act cool or try to impress everyone in that new grp so quickly. just try to blend in with interest. common interests is why friends get together.  (usually)...<br><br>...or you can always go with the old school style/anime-style, "can we be friends?". lolz...<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well guess they're not even fit to be called your friends. Find a new group to chill with. Anyway it may be more of how you think of your appearance than how you actually are. If you say you're fat and stuff, why not do something constructive? I'm not in the best shape myself, so I workout to keep myself in shape. Perhaps you can start by finding a training partner, so that you can motivate each other along the way! Believe in yourself more dude!</div>
