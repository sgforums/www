How can you possibly find someone who is so perfect.. even if there is.. Would you really want it??? You have seen many many threads in AA about ppl feeling insecurities and fearing this and that.. And i oso did saw some of your posts.. You can tell people how they should or can do for their love life/ relationship.. But then why do give yourself a chance to do so also..<br><br>Don't hide yourself in the shell.. You are hurt once doesn't mean that you have to shut the door and and keep yourself in a small space not wanting to know what's the world outside.. Have more comfidence in yourself... Don't be too negative.. This not only lead to insecurities.. but oso your happiness.. You won't feel happy in anyway..<br><br>Bad at expressing feelings.. well me too.. you can chose to wirte a small note to express yourself if you ain't good at speaking.. you jus have to learn to open yourself more.. Expose yourself more to the world... Intereact with people around.. If you don't wish that history will repeat.. then learned from it! You never learn you never move on.. you never realised what is wrong..<br><br>P.S.: Remember is time to move out of your shell.. peel off your old skin and start new.. Don't keep hiding in the world of yourself only..<br><br>CHeers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><strong>Open your arms to change, but don't ever let go of your values!</strong></span></div>

Many of us noe that by being secure or insecure, it plays an impt part in our lives, not only in relationships.. Being secure will enable you to do something with much more confidence instead of thinking it over and over again with sometimes no results coming out of it.<br><br>Anyone of us has our pros and flaws.. Its how pple look at it.. To you, it may seem a flaw and that you may feel not good abt it.. But to another party, he/she may find that its ok and acceptable.. It does not really matter if you have thousand of flaws.. If that person really likes you and you have feelings for the other party, nothing will stop you 2 from falling in love..<br><br>Don't let a disadavntage in you stop you from doing things you like.. You still have your strengths.. Its how you look at it and utilise it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I have not shared with him yet all my past "injuries" and pain, so maybe he would not understand for quite sum time...then he told me that I am a unique individual in my own right so I asked him how am I special? He said I am funny, I make him laugh, that I am beautiful and I should stop thinking otherwise.<br><br>Then he decided to bring me out next next Friday (after all of our exams are safely over) to this show that I have been wanting to watch for sometime but never go to it cos I dun have enuff money lor <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> Told me that hopefully that would cheer me up and said that this is one of my advance birthday presents (cos he wudnt be here in decemeber when I celebrate my 21st birthday, he would be back home <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> )<br><br>Indeed the sweetest guy I have ever known in my life until now. Maybe the time has come for me to forget my fears and just go for it.<br><br>i.c.y</div></blockquote>GO for it.. I'm sure you can handle this! Good luck to ya!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Devil1976, thank you for posting that thread.

Seeing him is like seeing myself in the past. Before I have given so much, maybe I gave it to the wrong person...but maybe this time..I would have a chance finally to give it to someone who would cherish it...<br><br>He is giving me a lot of chances now.
