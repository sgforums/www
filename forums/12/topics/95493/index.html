            <div class='col-md body'>Why do I always feel so insecure??<br><br>I am always worried that even if I find someone who really like me one day, he might have a change of heart. Because once he saw all the flaws in me, he would think I am not so perfect after all. I always strive to hide the bad sides of me but I guess they will show sometimes. Especially when I start to let down my guard, when I have really fallen for a person..I would start to assume that it doesn't matter. But maybe it does...<br><br>I am really bad at expressing my feelings. I might act like an ice queen even if I really like someone. This had happened once to me when I was in high school. He was my first love. And he liked me too. But because I was too shy to give him any kind of encouragement...he decided to let me go and started to go after another girl. That was my first taste of pain in love...<br><br>I do not want this to repeat itself again.</div>

But as in all relationships, you will find out more and more things about each other - good or bad.<br>If the relationship is meant to be, then both of you will look past all these faults and concentrate more on the good points.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

So somehow I was afraid to commit myself to another person because I was afraid of loving someone too much again, because it will only mean I will get hurt just as badly as before...<br><br>But I remmeber what Devil1976 mentioned in one of his "enlightening" post, about the 4 ppl we will meet in life. Devil1976, thank you for posting that thread. Because somehow it makes me understand more now...I know now here is someone who has always been waiting for me patiently, someone who sees me beyond my flaws..someone who is willing to stand by me when I am happy or sad. Seeing him is like seeing myself in the past. Before I have given so much, maybe I gave it to the wrong person...but maybe this time..I would have a chance finally to give it to someone who would cherish it...<br><br>He is giving me a lot of chances now. I do not want to miss out those chances. So I think I will take the risk and go with it...maybe it is time for me to open my heart to someone else now...I have grieved enuff.<br><br>i.c.y<br><br>P/S: And yea, you are right on why I chose this nick when i first came here <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
