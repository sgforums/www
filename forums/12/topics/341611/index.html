              <p>Working in a hospital as a staff nurse, as i am a rather new nurse, and i am a slow learner, i was assigned to a preceptor. Preceptor's job (usually Senior staff nurse) is to teach new staff nurses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hate my preceptor so much that i am so fear for work everyday because she scolds when a bit of mistakes is being made. She even scolded me in front of my collegues, patients and their relatives. She expected for a new nurse like me to know everything. She wouldn't assist me for i am doing, she only checks my works. Everyday, i had work 1 - 3 hours of overtime because i did not complete when i had to do, of course, my preceptor also need to accompany me for the uncompleted. She scolded, "Did the hospital pay me overtime for teaching you?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am now very depressed. I used to laugh alot last time, but not even a single smile from me now. Feels like quiting the job, but i was bonded with the hospital.</p>

              <p>Then buck up.  She's just training you hard now so that you will be able to survive on your own without people picking up on you. Besides, she had to spend time trailing you and spending the time getting upset with your poor performance.</p>
              <p>Imagine if your mistake cost someone their life. Then you might blame your perceptor for not teaching you hard enough.</p>
              <p>New at job of course get some shit. You think like school. Mistake get "F" only? If you cannot take this little bit of stress then quit being a nurse. Bond is only money, just pay back mony loh.</p>

              <p>Maybe u can talk to someone senior on top regarding this thing?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Making sure u can survive on yr own is one thing. Never teach/guide u and expect u to be top notch is irresponsible in my opinion. I think if u one day cannot take it. U shall fcuk her back. Nurse has no military law or DB. Just told her off, 'U never teach me anything and expect me to know. U think I am god?'</p>

              <p>Working in a hospital as a staff nurse, as i am a rather new
              nurse, and i am a slow learner, i was assigned to a preceptor.
              Preceptor's job (usually Senior staff nurse) is to teach new staff
              nurses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hate my preceptor so much that i am so fear for work everyday
              because she scolds when a bit of mistakes is being made. She even
              scolded me in front of my collegues, patients and their relatives.
              She expected for a new nurse like me to know everything. She
              wouldn't assist me for i am doing, she only checks my works.
              Everyday, i had work 1 - 3 hours of overtime because i did not
              complete when i had to do, of course, my preceptor also need to
              accompany me for the uncompleted. She scolded, "Did the hospital
              pay me overtime for teaching you?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am now very depressed. I used to laugh alot last time, but not
              even a single smile from me now. Feels like quiting the job, but i
              was bonded with the hospital.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>VERY VERY SAD&gt;&gt;&gt;!!! ARRRR</p>

              <p>First step is always the hardest, I can understand how u feel.</p>
              <p>Since u are bonded, then no choice but to tell urself u can do it and prove to her ur abilities. Treat her scoldings as a lesson for u to learn ur mistakes, because in hospitals the staff are dealing with life and death, so naturally she'll be alot stricter with u.</p>
              <p>After learning the ropes, i'm sure things will be easier for u. Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>He everything also dont know so the big boss ask me to teach him his work. Something i was like throwing him into the sea and letting him learn how to swim.</p>

              <p>Eventually he became very experience in his work. Although til now he still treat me very nice but i think he must have hated me a lot during that time.</p>
