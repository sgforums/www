              <p>Don't be so hard on yourself, you are new. Noboby in this world
              is borned to be a  staff nurse. Learning takes time.<br> <br> Don't be too concerned about your preceptor points of view. Give
              yourself time to learn and adapt. Your preceptor is probably trying
              to pull rank or trying to showoff.<br> <br> If she continues this way or turn abusive, report her to higher
              authority - maybe your nursing manager can help?<br> <br> Remember to smile - don't let what happening around you rob you of
              your inner strength, inner calm and your self dignity. Their are
              your priceless assets - remember!</p>

              <p>Say is easy than being done. I see her face, i got that phobia

              <p>You know sometime, i know that i know how to do the correct
              thing, but with she around, i will just somehow did something
              wrong. She is like staring at you with one kind, the face is so
              black, and scold whenever you make one small move. With such a
              person around, how possible for me to concentrate on my patient. I
              tend to concentrate more on her face than the patient face.</p>

              <p>You think like on TV,  the person guiding you must smile so that you feel better?</p>
              <p>Maybe its just her way and her life.  What she is doing with herself is her issue. At least, she is monitoring you and making sure you are trained. Its better to be told immediately and have your mistakes corrected at the point in time than to wait until wrong work has become a habit before she comes and tell you that you had done wrong 1000 times and only at 1001 then she bother to tell you.</p>
              <p>Why can't you see that you are learning the process from her.  Why can't you see also that she might be reacting to your attitude as well. For all you know, we only hear your story, Maybe you are really bad at things and its causing your precepator stress. Or maybe you also never smile or be respectful of her, so why should your senior smile for you? Be grateful for your precepator. It is because she cared about her work and your work that she is hard on you.  If she does not care, then kill one or two patient also never mind. Definitely it will be your fault one. So think about it. Your precepator might be nasty but does she bad mouth you behind your back or back stab you? She is simply hard on you on your work as she might want to see perfection. That's all. BTW, you have about 50 years of work ahead of you. Learn to like it. You will look back a appreciate her even though her approach might make you feel bad now. There are worse people out there and who will do more damage to you than just be nasty to you about your work.</p>
