            <div class='col-md body'>Dun worry buddy, this is juz a crush. You cant really fall in love by juz smsing/chatting in a period of just 3 weeks.<br>You can choose to get out of it, coz it is not right to go after a girl that is attached. Besides, even if you managed to get her, there is no gurantee she will stay by your side always.<br>In my opinion, this person has no respect for her bf. If she is really into serious about her relationship, she will not indulge in flirting with other guys and leading other guys on.<br><br>Forget about her. Concentrate on more impt things in your life. Though I agree sometimes happiness is up to you strive for, but this girl doesnt seems to be worthy of your love. Move on.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think she just wants something to hang on if the current relationship goes wrong. she probably won't give up her current relationship for you.. because she is scared of insecurity. she rather stay with something that gives her secure.<br><br>i suggest you think it through.. besides, there are more special and unattached girls out there. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>good luck.<br></div>
