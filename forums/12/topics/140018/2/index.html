            <div class='col-md body'>Hi thanx to everyone the replies, especially to ShrodingersCat, mistyblue &amp; parn for the helpful advices...<br><br>Just started sch this week so been rely busy... my course is one where projects is a complusory component. So i'm kinda of "forced" to interact with others... i already found a grp with 2 guys (including me) &amp; 3 gals.<br>The class culture is kinda open &amp; friendly, prob 'cos everyone knows everyone is needed in such a course...<br><br>But somethings still remain the same, eg. my phone is still silent as the nite. I had a grand total of 3 calls only this week--- one frm a fren borrowing money (imagine how my mood roller coaster when i first pick up the phone..), the other calling 'cos he suspect he has HIV &amp; a wrong number..<br><br>I'm rely hoping things will slowly turn for the better, where i'll hopefully find some normal, better frens who will call me out. Just for the sake of socializing, &amp; not using me  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

Turning 30 this yr. During young, 'O' levels not gd enough to go poly or JC, ended up studying private 'A' levels but only passed GP and flunked everything else. LL went NS, ord @ 21. Joined HDB for sponsorship of PT Architectural studies at SP. Did not even started the course cos discover passion not there and left to work in other lines. Was in sales for a few years and rejoined govt sector again cos tired of sales job. Did a Mgt studies Dip from SIM (PT) and only graduated towards late 20s and resigned from service cos really hate the stupid and mundane work routine.<br>Now I am only starting to look for what I really want in life. Really really regretted to have wasted more than a decade wandering and drifting nowhere. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br>Though I am 30 and should think and behave like a grown up man, sometimes I feel that I am a kid trapped in a man's body. To be honest, I still don't really know what I am looking for in life, in terms of my career, love life and ultimately, what makes me tick..<br>I think only god knows, and I seriously hope you will not be my duplicate, pal.</div>

My post was just a light hearted presentation of some probs i'm facing in life. If u read carefully, my main complain is a lack of quality friends &amp; occasional loneliness...<br>I did mentioned studying hard for my diploma &amp; hoping for the best in my current course.<br><br>So from where did u infer that i am a "nvr ever faced probs in life, pampered &amp; sheltered by parents. get a grip &amp; stop complaining. instead of whinning...lazy bum .."<br><br>Don't everyone face some problems, feel disocuraged at times?? What is the point of AA forum if one cannot express their problems in a candid manner.<br><br>Ur "thou holier than" attitude speaks a lot abt urself too... perhaps u shld do some serious reflections before shooting ur mouth off<br><br>hey jr, no need 2 send me private msgs. post it here 4 all 2 c. yes u r rite, i do have n attitude. but my attitude is 2 absorb wat ppl have 2 say instead of rebucking. 1 of the other sickening traits of the gen y is "always think they r rite". how r u goin 2 survive the real world? but still, i thank u 4 your comments.</div>
