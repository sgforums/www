            <div class='col-md body'>My life story is like a rip off from that of my fave anti-hero Adrian Mole.<br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Question: I am 23 &amp; Â¼ years old. What have I done with my life?</span></strong><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Answer: Nothing</span></strong><br><br>As I was packing my room, I realized I have not acquired a lot in life. I have a decent wardrobe of nice clothing, bought a new Acer notebook last week &amp; just received my diploma from a private university. But deep down I really feel, with every fibre of my beings, like a LOSER.<br><br>ACADEMIC<br><br>I flunked both my Â‘OÂ’ &amp; Â‘AÂ’ levels. LetÂ’s take a look at my Â‘OÂ’ levels grades first:<br><br><strong>Â‘<span style="color: blue;">OÂ” Level Results</span></strong><br>Chinese--- A1<br>English---B3<br>E Maths---B3<br>A Maths---C6<br>Science--- D7<br>History--- E8<br>Literature--- A for Absent<br><br>Pretty OK results for the first 4 subjects? Unfortunately, I flunked all the remaining subjects. As a result (no puns intended), I could enter neither a JC nor Poly, and ended up in a 3 years Pre-U course. The course felt like eternity &amp; the Principal &amp; teaching staff made me felt like a juvenile delinquent.<br>My Â‘AÂ’ levels were even more impressive. Other than GP &amp; Chinese, I failed all of the 3 Â‘AÂ’ levels subjects. This explains why I am in SIM, doing a diploma in management. Despite working very hard, IÂ’ve only managed slightly above average grades for the diploma.<br>IÂ’m starting the 2nd of the degree course next week &amp; IÂ’m really feeling the jitters after 3 months of carefree despondency.<br><br>I could never fathom why I did so disastrously for 2 most of the most significant National exams.<br>Even amongst the slackest of my peers, most of them scrapped through the Â‘OÂ’s &amp; Â‘AÂ’s with a minimum Â“Full CertÂ” . What scares me is I actually studied hard for these exams. Ok, maybe not barred-no-hold effort, but considerable effort.<br><br>I am contemplating a brain scan, but the high cost is putting me off.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong><span style="color: blue;">FRIENDS</span></strong><br><br>The umber of friends I have approximateÂ… the umber of fingers on one hand. IÂ’ve not been to a movie or clubbing for almost 3 years, not Â‘cos IÂ’ve no money or no time, but simply Â‘cos I have no company.<br>I honestly do mind going to the movie alone (did that many times now), my greatest fear is only those lovey-dovey couples sitting beside me. ArgghhÂ… How I scorn these people!!<br><br>I am also deciding if I should terminate my hand phone line. I basically do not get any calls or sms, apart from mom &amp; sporadically official matters ( NKF donations, dubious lucky draw winnings). My good friends calls me only when they need 1) to borrow money 2) Run errands or listen to their problems. Once settled, I will never ever hear from them againÂ…. Until they are in trouble again<br><br>As a result of my virtually non-existent social life, my likes &amp; dislikes have also grown distinctly apart from others.<br><strong><span style="color: darkblue;">Like: </span></strong><br><strong>Monday<br>Tuesday</strong><br><br><strong><span style="color: red;">Dislike: </span></strong><br><strong>Sat<br>Sun<br>Public Hols<br>Valentine **<br>Christmas **<br>New Year</strong><br><br><strong><span style="color: blue;">Neutral:</span></strong><br><strong>Friday<br>Chinese New Year<br>Ghost Festival </strong><br><br><strong>** such occasions should be scrapped </strong><br><br><strong><span style="color: violet;">LOVE</span></strong><br><br>I have an overwhelmingly vexing love life, which suffocates me almost every nite. It all boils down to the problem there is no love at all--- Relationship or Friendship--- in my life; the vacuum is drowning me.<br>It pains me to think if I would to die today, how few would the turn out for my funeral be. Other than my parents &amp; close relatives, I am saddened that how few frens &amp; ex-lovers may be there. Most of my friends &amp; ex-lovers probably wouldnÂ’t even know, since they have long ceased to contact me.<br>The prospect of such an embarrassing scenario has kept me from committing suicide<br><br>I conclude that I must either have<br>1) A grotesque, repellant appearance or<br>2) Some serious character flaws or<br>3) Psychotic illness ( My psychiatrist says itÂ’s depression, not schizophrenia)<br><br>Why do I find it so difficult to have something easily inherent in most people--- finding a decent girlfriend &amp; having a few friends to hang out with<br><span style="color: #444444;"></span><strong></strong></div>

What matters is what you  want to do with yourself. Its not always important to follow the same academic path as everyone.

I basically do not get any calls or sms, apart from mom &amp; sporadically official matters ( NKF donations, dubious lucky draw winnings).

            <div class='col-md body'>Anakin Jr, hey...there's nothing bad in your life right now...so don't feel bad about it ok?<br><br>You have your education, parents, your health and your sanity. It's nothing wrong to feel this way once in a while...it happens to everyone at least once in a year. Just that you happened to think of it more than once a year. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I can assure you that you're not alone and this is really a cold world you're living in even though you may be the warm one around. The coldness will vastly overcome the little warm that is emitting from you, and that's why you need friends in your world...they warmed up your world. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Of course the warmness of your friends varies from little warm to hot. And there must always be a balance to make sure that your world don't get too cold(not enough friends to warm up your life) or too hot(too much friends liao). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>I can tell you that the problem lies within you although I don't know you personally to pinpoint your flaws. And don't waste your money seeing any psychiatrist, they're no good at all. Save those money for those useless consultation sessions to pamper and buy something for yourself, you'll feel happier than going for those consultation sessions. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Since I can't tell you exactly where your fault lies, I could do a quickpick like Toto or 4D. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Okies....you have a lot of expectations of yourself and you're feeling bad/worse tha you're not even half as close to your own expectations. And this is getting you down and out. So please lower your expectations of yourself...lower them until you feel normal and better.<br><br>How to lower them to make yourself feel better? Well, the traditional way would be to give yourself loads of excuses and blame alot of people for your own situation, but that will make you as scornful as the witches of eastwicks. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> To do it correctly, you should take a pen and papers, write down your frustrations and expectations so that you can see them clearly and your mind will have an impression of it through your own photographic memories...hahahaha... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>After you've done so, start to ask yourself this question "Why am I feeling this way?" - To your frustrations list and "Why am I not achieving it?" - To your expectations list. You will need to answer them by writing them down on the paper and don't care how long the answers are going to be. You must take note of this when you're answering the questions, that is... <strong> Do not blame anyone in your answers to those questions in your frustrations and expectations list. </strong> *This is important even though it may be harsh*<br><br>Once you've accumulated those lengthy answers, summarise them and put those summarised answers for your frustration list as your Personal Goals and expectations list as your Life Goals. Personal Goals are the things that you'll need to learn in order to change yourself. Life Goals are the realistic expectations that you should work towards after achieving your Personal Goals. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck and have more patience in yourself, you won't change in just a day...but you'll see results everyday if you're determined to give it a try. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
