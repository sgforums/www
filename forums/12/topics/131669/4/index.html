My point is... she have to place her stands firm in the first place. If she didn't want to be touched, she should have rejected him firmly. She have to get this fact straight so that she won't get  into such situations again. Not because he is her bf, so even she dun like it, she still allowed him then feel dirty afterwards. She's only 17, imagine how many more bfs she will have before her marriage? At least one right, she dun protect herself the correct way, she gonna feel the same over and over again. Coz every relationship will proceed to the intimate stage. At least a high percentage of guys will try to make advances. This fact u can't deny</div></blockquote>i take it that u missed the point that she's not a willing girlfriend to begin with? and that some boys are very good at applying emotional blackmail to girls to get what they want, and then taking advantage of their inexperience with situations like that. if a guy has to make an advance, instead of it being a spontaneous thing, then i don't feel it's a respectful relationship to begin with. that fact YOU can't deny.</div>
