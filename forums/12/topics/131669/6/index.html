The things he have done are very common in relationship. Just that victimgal felt that it's past her limits. That's y she's furious.<br><br>When she said dragged, the image that pops out in my mind is he's pullinh her with all his might and she's like resisting 100% while kicking her legs in the air? Or it's pulled her while coaxing her?</div>
