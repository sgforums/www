But objectively speaking, ANYONE can come out in the internet and post another person's photo and contact number and as easily just accuse him / her of almost anything...<br><br>My personal advice for you is to be too haunted by your experience with this guy, but instead be careful next time... Take appropriate actions necessary when you feel that you're really uncomfortable with something in your future relationship and not let the same thing or similar things happen to you again?<br><br>I would also like to tell you that you're still young.. So I hope you won't let this single experience of yours run you into thinking that 'all guys are jerks' and such thinkings.. And if he has already caused you enough agony, having him ruin your future relationships would definitely not be worth it....<br><br>Try to cool down and just let things pass for now?<br><br>I'm not sure how your relationship ended with him... But when a relationship ends, often the consequence can sometimes be ugly... As you know, we're only hearing from you at this point of time and so won't know exactly what is going on... Please try to understand even if some of us might find your story hard to digest?<br><br>Wish you well and to get over the incident soon.. At this point, I'll personally give both parties the benefit of doubt?</div>
