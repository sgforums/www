            <div class='col-md body'>victimgal, I think you need to let go and put this episode behind you. You won't be able to move on and start afresh if you let this thing keep hanging around your mind and having the wish of exposing him to every single girl that you will probably meet. You have already warned all of us about this, so I guess it is time to put this to a close and stop thinking about the whole experience. The more you think you are traumatized by it, the more you will be. Just see it as an experience that will help you to deal with this kind of people better in the future. It won't do you good to keep on bringing this up, after all it is over <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
