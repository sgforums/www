He said dunno but think that its quite normal for guys to do it.<br><br>So farking pissed coz he lied saying he dun do all these 'kinda' of stuff when I did ask a few times before whether if he watch porn etc. I even told him at that point of time that I only want him to be honest at the begining of our RS.<br><br>So when I rebutted that I was angry coz he lied. Yet his reply was coz its shameful. Then why the fark did he has to kept insisting that i shut the fark up that its normal? And contridicted that its shameful at the same time?!<br><br>Now he even have the cheek to say that its his hobby!<br><br>He himself even admit that he wouldn't comfortable if I ogle at other men or naked picts.<br><br>Also he is supposed to give me something but kept dragging it for months!<br><br>Reasons given?<br><br>Tired from work lar...no time lar..<br><br>When in fact he is busy with his hobby late into the night.<br><br>And of course, he forgot totally about it even though I reminded him a couple of times about it since its supposed to be my anniversary present!<br><br>He bloody hell said he dun want a naggy GF.

            <div class='col-md body'>i must say that he's not experienced enuff on porn stuffs or he's too lazy to <strong>HIDE</strong> it, if he hide it well, u wont know at all, then u wont feel bothered about it, he can watch it while u are not around.<br>- clear IE history, cookies, temp file etc, that's the basic.<br>- clear or disable the whole "documents" thing on Windows.<br>- hide in folders that cant be browsed easily. like in Programs files/common files/  there create some folder and sub folders to hide it, then add hidden attribute to those files and folders. Then disable the "show hidden files" at all time, only enable when he want to watch.<br><br>there are many other ways to lower the chance of getting caught by u, if he's willing to take the trouble. And btw, i watch porn since i started to have a PC that can go internet, before that also go watch video tapes when in sec sch. Most of my male frens also watch.<br><br>For the problem on his comments about your dressing, this is human nature...... got sexy girls we want to take a few looks for sure, but we dont want our girl fren to be looked by other guys.<br></div>

If watching porn is enough reason to warrant a breakup between couples, I suppose the majority of Singaporean couples should be considering separation right now. Yes, excessive and obsessive addiction is bad, but men have this wonderful hormone called testosterone in them. Porn is but just an avenue that helps guys relieve themselves of the pressure, and it's pretty harmless if used with the right attitude.<br><br>Furthermore, a probable reason why the threadstarter's BF has to resort to porn may be that his GF is doing nothing to help him relieve of his sexual needs.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
