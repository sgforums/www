              <p>have u talked it out with someone?mayb ur brother?its ok to cry it out with him, afterall, its not a small matter that just happened. but what has happened has already happened, n time cannot stop right at that moment. u have tried to avoid the pain n u couldnt, so now its time to face it. if u can face it along with ur brother, then u 2 can get over it together. u dun haf to forget, bcoz u cannot. u haf to accept, accept that she is gone, accept that life has to go on.</p>
              <p>share what u think with ur brother, or if u think ur not strong enough yet, share it with another close relative or friend, let them in to help u get over this crisis. it takes time, dun rush urself, dun stress urself, we r but human, we take time to heal.</p>

              <p><br>Hubby was very supportive throughout that period, very supportive.  we managed to pull thru that very tough period, the darkest period of my life, the most lost period of my life.</p>
              <p>but over the weekend, we had a fight.  he brought up something that made me feel that he was blaming me for the miscarriage...  that was like throwing a big rock down at me when i am at the bottom of the well...  ever since then, i have been haunted by the miscarriage at the back of my mind and at the bottom of my heart.</p>

              <p>i dun think he truly blames u for the miscarriage la, it might b a rash comment in the argument. when ur angry u say things u dun mean. dun let it get to u.</p>
              <p>now ur very sensitive, so every word that may mean something u immediately catch it n store it like ur sure he means it that way, but he may not haf meant it, especially since its in the middle of an argument.</p>
              <p>no one wanted the miscarriage, so when ur tired n frustrated, sometimes ull tend to want to blame it on something. no one is at fault, he will know that, but its very natural to try to blame it on someone or something bcoz we humans dun like things to happen without something responsible. makes us say stupid things, so dun put it to heart</p>

              <p><br>Yes, crying it out is only the temporarily solution to your eternal sorrow and it's definitely unhealthy for your health and your heart if you are going to cry it out every day and night like an addiction.</p>
              <p>You need address your sorrow in your case because the cause of your sorrows are due to irreplacable losses.</p>
              <p>Discuss with yourself the past/recent relationships you have shared with your mum before she passed away and reflect upon it if you realised that you could have made life easier for your mum. I understand that there is nothing you can do right now to bring her back to you again and repaired what you had done in the past, but I can assure you that your mum would be very pleased to know that you have resolved to change your life values and live your life on as strongly as you can, doing everything that would've made your mum happy and proud if she were still alive and you know she would've given you her silent approval for decisions that you know she would've also encouraged you for it if she were still alive.</p>
              <p>You must understand that you can never bring your mum back from dead, but you can always live on strongly on her behalf. You are her daughter and part of her still lives within you if you must know. You will always bear some resemblance of your deceased mum and you must live on and passed down her values to your future children so that you and your mum may continue to live within your children in the future for all your generations.</p>
              <p>Discuss with yourself regarding the events that has led to your miscarriage, you should find out the reasons which led to your miscarriage and realised what you should have done better to avoid it the next time. It's true that you will never be able to forget and forgive yourself for what has happened, but at least you can move on knowing that you will never repeat the same mistaken which led to your miscarriage again and you will definitely be more cautious on your future pregnancies.</p>
              <p>The reason why you needed to discuss your own sorrow with yourself is because the addition of other people will only bring about greater sorrow to add on upon your existing sorrow. People may want to genuinely help you out, but they do not understand that they are never going to understand what you are going through and how it feels like to be you. If you can understand what I meant, you should help yourself by rejecting their offers to discuss your own sorrows together with you.</p>
              <p>And yes girl, this is the time when you really need some time to sort out your own problems.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ohh, by the way do watch out for this Fantagf, cos he's an Ah Kua and he will never understand nuts about miscarriage cos he will never get one anyway. He will only follow and copy my advice like a parrot and repeat to others to "cry it out", cos that's all that he will ever know. Afterall, what else do you expect from an Ah Kua right? <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>My condolences to you ( albeit a late one ).</p>
              <p>On the list of things for you to do now, what should come first will be to patch up your relationship with your husband. If you let your sorrow get in the way, it will only worsen your current relationship, and things could easily spiral out of control.</p>
              <p>If your husband is blaming you for the miscarriage, then I will say that he is a very unthoughtful man. Get a counsellor to talk to the both of you, though I will say he is the one who will need more counselling at the moment.</p>
              <p>As parn said, you are the only one who could trash things out with yourself, but don't take things too heavily upon yourself. The only person who could truely share this burden with you now is your other half, hence he is the one whom you need the most. This is why you will need to work things out with him as soon as possible, otherwise you will lose your only pillar of support left.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I hate to say this, but parn is right. We could throw a line of words of support here and there, but the only one who can understand the pain you are in is yourself. Hence, we could easily say or type the wrong thing in this situation, as your pain is not something we could feel. The one who could choose the next step for you is none other than yourself, so it is entirely up to you now.</p>

              <p>Emotions are great for carrying thoughts into your subconcious.</p>
              <p>Your bereavement has affected you deeply in your subconcious (or heart if you like).</p>
              <p>You have to get out of this emotional state. Otherwise you will remain in this altered state for the rest of your life.</p>
              <p>As Cool-gal suggested, consider what your mum would want you to be. You have to assume (or maybe it is, I don't know for sure) that she is watching over you. She don't want you to grieve. She wants you to get on with life, and have more children.</p>
              <p>Get into that frame of mind, emotionaly, energetically, enthuasiastically, and do things that would please her. Mothers always want their daughters to be well.</p>

              <p>Its only a suggestion - accept all the vagaries of your mood swings,  and emotions - just know that its there - cos the more u fight , the more u try to do somtheing to substitute - its suppression (its akin to pruning the branches of a tree - which results in giving deeper roots to the tree, strenghtening it. </p>
              <p> of course, if u feel the need to express - do so and keep at it like u are here, just hope ... those around u, including here, empower u as opposed to .... .</p>
              <p>Your mother's demise, your husband's stance towards the  miscarriage -  are all all that happened <span style="text-decoration: underline;">(they were causes outside of u)</span> - but the reality is how you processed it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">with</span>in u and even now as u are reading it its u  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">processing</span> .. .
