When chance is rare, it's better to just stick as friends for now...<br><br>About thinking too much of her... I'm afraid can't help you on that. Sorry. You've just got to learn to control your own thinking a bit. It's will-power. Don't be too discouraged if you can't stop thinking of her even if you thought you've tried hard enough though? There're many things we would be learning in life, this is just one of them...</div>

U asked her abt her feelins. Its betta than NOT asking at all. Da feeling of being told "no" &amp; da feeling of NOT noeing is 2 seperate emotions. But NOT asking is a far worse "slow poison" for U to bear. Trust me.<br><br>Perhaps at yr age where da raging hormones r in U, U shld learn how to control it. U shld start to SEE everything ard U. Yes, at yr age curiousity abt "love", bgr, watever, is common &amp; normal. Such emotions have no immediate cure for it. Only thru family guidance, help from frens, advices from elders, good living examples, etc, etc... will U learn wat is goin on &amp; help U pass thru dis period.<br><br>I have some suggestions. U can get smth to do. Play video games, play sports, go shopping, read books, go work out, anything as long as U keep yrself occupied. BEST is if U concentrate on yr studies. Matters of da heart can only be eased thru time. Time is a very GOOD medicine. So while U have dat, do something useful &amp; beneficial for yrself.<br><br>Oh yah... U can oso try dis. TREAT her as a fren, NOT as a gal. Meaning U treat her as a fren like how U treat yr guy frens &amp; gal frens whom U dun have much feelins for. Juz dun act like a WUSS in front of her. Be natural &amp; throw da past away. U r walking towards da FUTURE.<br><br>Ok?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Of course, a heart in love commands the mind to do silly things. By the way, this is not a rejection - why are you crying then? She merely said that you do not trigger love at first sight. You even mentioned that only recently you people talk on the phone - pls lor, haven't learn how to walk you wanna attempt to fly? In other words: You haven't even do much to consider a decent chase and you expect results? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In love, you don't always get the case of you liking someone else and she in return the same speed, velocity, intensity and feel.<br><br>P.S: In art of seduction: Do not express feelings/drop obvious hints right in the beginning of the chase. It is highly anti-seductive.<br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When you ask such a question, you shld be prepared.. most gals will say no, even if they like u a bit they will also say no, so dun be bothered by her answer so much, if you really like her, call her and ask her out often.. if she agrees to go out with you, most prob you got a chance.. good luck pal.. anyway if she doesnt, den dun think so much, look for another target.. sometimes in life the person you like may not like you back.. you got to accept that..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey mate, you should just forget about her. If she did like you NOW as in when you spoke to her, she would have the empathy to say something like "but now... the feeling is different from when I 1st saw you etc". But she did not did she? THus this is complete rejection in my book, you can expect her to feel awkward with you now, and you have no real friendship with her now.<br><br><blockquote><strong>At least U did smth which helped U. U asked her abt her feelins. Its betta than NOT asking at all. Da feeling of being told "no" &amp; da feeling of NOT noeing is 2 seperate emotions. But NOT asking is a far worse "slow poison" for U to bear. Trust me. </strong></blockquote>I disagree, for instance, even if I have feelings for people, I don't say it because 99% says the feeling is not mutual, as brilliantly demonstrated by Riemin here. Let me ask you all, how many of you loved a person and the feeling WAS mutual? Well?<br><br>Thus, if I like someone, it will just show in my actions as in I help/talk as friends. If I spill the beans the whole friendship thing is ruined because she will feel awkward and avoid me (Girls avoid me anyway in general, but she will avoid me EVEN MORE). Plus there;s the added poison of heartache.<br><br>So the rule for tough Men_@_Arms and people like me (rare)... don't spill it. Show it, but don't spill it, showing it will get the message across without the awkwardness. But ofcourse don't show it too obviously.<br></div>
