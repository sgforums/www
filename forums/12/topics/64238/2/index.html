            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by men_@_arms:</div><div class="quote_body">Hey mate, you should just forget about her. If she did like you NOW as in when you spoke to her, she would have the empathy to say something like "but now... the feeling is different from when I 1st saw you etc". But she did not did she? THus this is complete rejection in my book, you can expect her to feel awkward with you now, and you have no real friendship with her now.<br><br>I disagree, for instance, even if I have feelings for people, I don't say it because 99% says the feeling is not mutual, as brilliantly demonstrated by Riemin here. Let me ask you all, how many of you loved a person and the feeling WAS mutual? Well?<br><br>Thus, if I like someone, it will just show in my actions as in I help/talk as friends. If I spill the beans the whole friendship thing is ruined because she will feel awkward and avoid me (Girls avoid me anyway in general, but she will avoid me EVEN MORE). Plus there;s the added poison of heartache.<br><br>So the rule for tough Men_@_Arms and people like me (rare)... don't spill it. Show it, but don't spill it, showing it will get the message across without the awkwardness. But ofcourse don't show it too obviously.<br></div></blockquote>I dun disagree wif wat U said. But to be ready for it mentally &amp; early is better than waiting &amp; hoping for smth dats 50/50... &amp; wif da amt of emotions piling up while waiting for it is not good for health. I tried my method &amp; yr method b4 &amp; cld see da diff...<br><br>I waited for a gal for 5 yrs b4 finally realised it was never meant to be was a LONG time wasted &amp; slow poison... Another was a short 1, considering dat I told her my feelings &amp; she was not on da same wavelength. Dat hurts too but was rather fast.<br>Chang tong bu ru Duan tong...<br><br>Every1 have their own wae of handling it. I believe yrs is as good as my wae... cept dat diff ppl diff pattern, diff results.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Have not contacted her since she did not answer my call or reply to my msg. Will sms her one lat time to tell her that i got her birthday present and would just want to pass it to her...if she still doesnt give a darn...i guess she isnt the type of girl i thought of her to be.<br><br>But not to worry guys just going to buy a birthday present since i did say i would get her one. Just the birthday present and thats all.Full stop to this draggy piece of nonsense.<br><br>Turst me i will be up and well again. Thanx guys for everything.</div>
