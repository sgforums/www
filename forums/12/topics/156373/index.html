Because I'm in Stansfield College and they are under the same "Group" owner... even though they offer a well recognized degree from <span style="text-decoration: underline;">University of London</span>, their management sucks... And I know many SIC students transfer to Stansfield after their first year... if you want to experience "Uni Life" with lots of activities and CCAs then SIM would be better as they also offer UOL programmes... Opps... have I just betrayed my school??</span><br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by lktlkygr:</div><div class="quote_body">I have a dip in accountancy but i cldn't get to local U...

I taking it too... =Ãž ... yes, I'm crazy... I asked before many Diploma in Accounting students in SC why they dont take ACCA instead of taking an overseas degree, they told me its too difficult... is it the same for you??? I know the passing rate for each paper worldwide is about 30-40% only... but Singapore got alot of Prizewinners one leh...<br><br>If you want to know more private institutions then visit all those education fairs held a few times a year at suntec convention hall...<br><br>What course do you intend to pursue?? Bsc Accounting?? Business?? or something else???<br>What do you intend to work as??</span></div>

I think the best to study is Accounting or Banking coz the rest are quite general...<br><br>Cost of studying in SIC for 1 year is about 4000++ (4subjects)<br>Cost of registration for UOL is 120 pounds(not too sure the exact amount)<br>Cost of examination fees I paid last year for 4 subjects is almost $1700...<br>and that is fees for 1 year...  and you have to pay that for 3 years...<br>dont forget you have Misc costs like Reference books, transport(no concession) and so on<br><br>for your info, if you want to buy reference books, some are not available in Singapore, you may have to buy from amazon.com so...<br><br>Exam is 1 year once and is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">set by UOL, marked by UOL</span><br>Need to be careful where you study because if lecturer tell you wrong things, you study wrong things, then GAME OVER...<br><br>If you want to know more you can always PM me...</span></div>

It's actually CAT(Certified Accounting Technician).<br><br>The CAT qualification is internationally recognised and highly regarded. Upon completion of the exams and required practical experience you will be able to apply to use the letters CAT after your name.<br><br>Well, u were thinking that ACCA is way too difficult for u? but seriously, it's difficult but i can assure you that if u can go through this, u're going to be very qualified to be an accountant in the future.<br><br>Now that ACCA's innovative partnership with Oxford Brookes University, it allows ACCA students to study for a BSc (Hons) in Applied Accounting, while taking their ACCA examinations.<br><br>While before taking ACCA you could think of taking a CAT. Completion of the CAT Scheme allows you to move directly to Part 2 of the ACCA Professional Scheme exams. In addition, ACCA's partnership with Oxford Brookes University allows you to obtain a BSc (Hons) degree in Applied Accounting upon completion of Part 2 of the Professional Scheme exams. Passing the Part 3 exams and gaining three years' relevant practical experience will lead to ACCA membership. (The is a total of 3 parts for a ACCA).<br><br>Since u've said in the beginning that u are a poly acctg grad, i suggest u to either take the ACCA straight if you think that u are good enough and doesn't need another basics or u can go for a CAT 1st which also takes 1 yr like ACCA's part 1. If you ask me... i'll go for CAT 1st, becoz CAT is definately easier to handle than ACCA's 1st yr.<br><br>But of coz, again since u are a poly grad... you may enquire about if you could ask for any exemptions~ if u could, u shld check up and maybe entering ACCA straight away might be a good idea.<br><br>Upon doing all these, from CAT - OBU - ACCA, u can achieve 3 certificate in acctg. Isn't that great? hehe.<br><br>if u wanna know more, juz visit the ACCA website at:<br>http://singapore.accaglobal.com/<br><br>or if u want any personal comments, juz ask me here^^</div>

Linking it with AIT should definately not be forgiven. If u've bad impression on that school, then pls keep it to urself.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by joeacid:</div><div class="quote_body">hi, erm... forget wat i say abt the SQA. i've got some serious typo there. It's actually CAT(Certified Accounting Technician).<br><br>The CAT qualification is internationally recognised and highly regarded. Upon completion of the exams and required practical experience you will be able to apply to use the letters CAT after your name.<br><br>Well, u were thinking that ACCA is way too difficult for u? but seriously, it's difficult but i can assure you that if u can go through this, u're going to be very qualified to be an accountant in the future.<br><br>Now that ACCA's innovative partnership with Oxford Brookes University, it allows ACCA students to study for a BSc (Hons) in Applied Accounting, while taking their ACCA examinations.<br><br>While before taking ACCA you could think of taking a CAT. Completion of the CAT Scheme allows you to move directly to Part 2 of the ACCA Professional Scheme exams. In addition, ACCA's partnership with Oxford Brookes University allows you to obtain a BSc (Hons) degree in Applied Accounting upon completion of Part 2 of the Professional Scheme exams. Passing the Part 3 exams and gaining three years' relevant practical experience will lead to ACCA membership. (The is a total of 3 parts for a ACCA).<br><br>Since u've said in the beginning that u are a poly acctg grad, i suggest u to either take the ACCA straight if you think that u are good enough and doesn't need another basics or u can go for a CAT 1st which also takes 1 yr like ACCA's part 1. If you ask me... i'll go for CAT 1st, becoz CAT is definately easier to handle than ACCA's 1st yr.<br><br>But of coz, again since u are a poly grad... you may enquire about if you could ask for any exemptions~ if u could, u shld check up and maybe entering ACCA straight away might be a good idea.<br><br>Upon doing all these, from CAT - OBU - ACCA, u can achieve 3 certificate in acctg. Isn't that great? hehe.<br><br>if u wanna know more, juz visit the ACCA website at:<br>http://singapore.accaglobal.com/<br><br>or if u want any personal comments, juz ask me here^^</div></blockquote>Just a small correction on the above.<br>If you have a local polytechnic diploma, you are already have exemptions on level 1 paper for ACCA. You will have to take 1 more paper to go to level 2. (That's from my knowledge as they keep changing the rules). SO it's not NECESSARY to take CAT and waste ur time.<br><br>As for being a CPA, once you get ur ACCA you can apply for Singapore CPA (which is 5 papers or is it 6 now). Once you pass that you are officially a CPA.<br>Only issue with ACCA is that on level 3, you got to pass 3 papers at a go. For e.g. if you take the 3 papers, you pass 2 and fail 1...considered as fail and have to keep retaking.<br><br>As for the Oxford Brookes University exams, the papers are very easy. The project that you are suppose to do is very easy. (My fren took it before, I saw her work and was SHOCK at how bad the quality is and yet, they pass her. But that's my opinion)<br><br>**Con side: you might not be able to pass fast and end up wasting alot of time.<br><br>While on the other hand, if u take an Australia University degree, you can take ur Aussie CPA which is easier (as told by some people as it's MCQ questions) and after u pass that...u can take the Singapore CPA exams.<br><br>Another pointer, it all depends what you want to study. As mentioned before by the above. FINANCE and ACCOUNTING and AUDITING are all very different things. Pls. be sure what you want.<br></div>

It is a reputable one and i remember reading a news that Aussie was in need of Nurses and Acctants and those who hav Aussie CPA has a high chance of getting a PR or applying for citizenship~</div>
