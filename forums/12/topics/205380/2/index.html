You ought to realize that you can only go this far to help him. If he ever shows you such abuse and disrespect more often than now, you have to really deal with him the hard way - slap the daylight out of him.<br><br>There is no reason to change for someone if that's not the real you. You don't have to change for the sake of somebody just because of certain issues. As a husband, he ought to be a gentleman as well and have some self-respect. It's all up to you on how you want to deal with him. Better deal with him now than to let him continually seek abuse towards you without giving you any  respect at all.<br><br>Living together as a couple isn't easy, but have faith everyday that things in the marriage would be better. If you're the type that always give in, try to put that into control from now onwards. Giving in too much to a man in a relationship will cause him to lose his respect for you.
