            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tranquil2:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi, would like to know what are the factors that can contribute positive effect to long term relationship. cheers! thanks</div></blockquote>There are two ways of looking at Love and generally we reflect subconsciously and consciously in our mind.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Suggested by Third Law of Love: <strong>'Though together, we chose our current relationship through our own personal and specific reasons.</strong>' - we, indeed, calulated certain strange aspects of a relationship that we derive and gain. We are together for 'unseen reasons.' Under the heart and mental calulation, we accept or reject. (Although this famous saying of 'I love you and there is no reason for it.' - being together in a relationship and loving a person is two different thing. You can love someone, but sometimes you exercise your free-will in not having a relationship with you because of this law.)<br><br>Common topic posted: You rather love or be loved? Its kinda obvious that people are calulating without them knowing. When is the last time when you did something for your bf/gf and felt unappreciated? We were told by countless of people and books saying that we should give without expecting anything in return - in life, probably yes. In love, it has to be mutual. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The elements we 'calulate and look for.' differs very much from people to people. Simple young love probably looks for plain puppy love happiness. As you age, you gain maturity and experience, you look for security of all aspect (Material fulfillments, character compatiability, etc) and so on.<br><br>The reason why am I explaining this is because we are together for a reason and therefore qualities displayed can be seen and spotted to influence positive effect on the relationship. Of course, everyone would say trust, honesty, blar blar blar; these are but the cusps of long term relationship. (To know more about these, I suggest you read Dummies for Relationship) To ensure a more fulfilling one, one must source for the core. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I) His/her own definition of love - how he/she looks at love in his own view and preception. (This is important to maintain relationship harmony. <strong>We cannot spend time looking at each other, instead we look together in one direction</strong>.)<br><br>II) The ample effort shown in relationship. (To work is to believe and is to improve. To slack in relationship is to slip in routine mode, is to get weaken through evironmental factors)<br><br>III) To acknowledge that every partner is different and that we must be adaptable to improve one another instead of sitting there and wait for people to suit to us. (We mould one another to be better eventually)<br><br>P.S: Not every partner we get are lifetime partners - in fact among the several, its only that one. Even so, these 'kicked-out.' candidates still have their reasons to be there in the first place. As we learn, we grow, we gain. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
