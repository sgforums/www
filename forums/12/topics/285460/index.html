Money is really not attractive, yes, but career advancement is there i believe.<br><br>I'm also a person who didnt work just for money.  I enjoyed my job, thats why i worked hard.  But as we grow older, there are commitments and responsibilities that we gotta assume, like family commitments.<br><br>That said, good opportunities are hard to come by.

            <div class='col-md body'>In my opinion, I always think that a psychologist should be one who has a caring heart and will do his/her best to help others. And not because of $.<br><br>Anyway, being a psychologist, I also believe that a BSc in Psychology is not sufficient to do a good job. However, training is also important in this field and I feel that this is actually a-trial-and-error field. So, with adequate knowledge and sufficient training, a psychologist will do his best for his patient's welfare.<br><br>TS, think carefully of what you want to do.<br><br>If the most pressing issue at the moment is to earn $, then, I think you should continue doing your banking job. Or else, i can forsee that you will quit your new job in another 6mths time. Its always not too late to go into Psychology after you have earn buckets. I known lecturers who went into Psychology at the age of 35. And they are doing well now.<br><br>If you do not have any pressing issue at hand, then, just follow your dreams.<br><br>Cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Stay in your banking job for the next few years. build up a substantial reserve which will give you more confidence and security when you decide to change job to follow your dreams later. The new pay will be pittance, but you wont feel so pressured knowing that you are not dependent on it to make ends meet.<br><br>If you don't even have enough reserves, you won't ever be happy even if you change job to do what you have always wanted to do. Always fearing the next bill, meeting the next mortgage payment etc etc.</div>

It's just a matter of timeand depends on your ' tolerance ' level.<br><br>Continue your banking job , increase your sales and upgrade yourself at night OR quit banking job is all up to you. Some option may seem rational but it can make you uncomfortable.<br><br>$2350 and $2300 dont make much of a difference. You could get the psycho job and work another part-time job at  the same time to compensate for the loss of potential financial chances in your banking job.<br></div>
