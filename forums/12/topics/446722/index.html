              <p>Ok, let me break my silence, seeing a few Singaporean men want to be friendly.</p>
              <p>First of all, I had problems with my education. I got an "A1" for "O" level pure chemistry and a "B4" for "O" levels. Then I had problem at the sociology department where I wrote an arguably decent essay and got a "C".</p>
              <p>However, worse of all, I had problems with jobs. Employers made petty excuses to sack me. Mr Christian Huber, if you want to know, I was the only who got you the "Money" page at "The Straits Times" with just one phone call. Yet, my employer called me slow and sacked me.</p>
              <p>Nowadays with tuition, I cannot teach girls and I also worry for the country's future as honestly, some kids are REALLY insane.</p>
              <p>In general, the elderly and seniors in Singapore seem to disapprove of me, maybe because some of my family members are bankers and in the government sector.</p>
              <p>SOMEBODY in Singapore also fed me SOMETHING and I ended up in a coma and woke up in hospital. THAT PERSON must not only be rich but have a certain position to access such a drug.</p>
              <p>Then I wake up from my coma and it is said I have an illness.</p>
              <p>Well, I read up on that illness and it doesn't come with a coma. I can also still dance difficult moves perfectly while that illness is supposed to come up coordination problems. I still meet up with my friends. I am also supposed to have difficulty sleeping but guess what, I sleep 12 hours per day!</p>
              <p>Increasingly my family members are all plagued with illness one by one. I am also lonely and want a man.</p>
              <p>I ever met a guy I like at a wedding dinner but he seemed rich (will his parents dis-inherit him if he marries me), and in addition, I kinda knew the company he was working for was and is in trouble.</p>
              <p>I am NOT healthy and don't think I can satisfy a guy in sex, and nor am able to produce a healthy baby plus I seem to be discriminated against working in Singapore and Singapore females all seem to dislike me anyway. In addition, two of our family businesses got sabotaged</p>
              <p>I like him anyway.</p>
              <p>However, I keep on working in other areas like research but the ang mohs insist a lot of positions in this area are voluntary so in the end, I am in a voluntary position.</p>
              <p>But I keep on working, and thinking of him, because I am lonely anyway, and my "job" seems rather important.</p>
              <p>Well, I can only appeal to the elders through these two points I hope-</p>
              <p>The story goes that my parternal great-uncle was one of the men who fought at Bukit Timah hill against the Japanese during World War 11.</p>
              <p>Well, if this story, I am not sure, is not true, AT LEAST my parternal grandfather's photograph is featured in the building of the Fuchow Clan Association, so he MUST have done something!</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, I have no $$$ and all my $$ are paying for medical bills and I have a bit of memory problem which means I cannot really perform in an office job and I am also still "working".</p>
              <p>This is my story.</p>

              <p>I think her story, though may sounds paranoid, but always a possibility that she wasn't lying or anything. I just think that she leads an interesting life... lol...</p>
              <p>And I feel sorry that you think that to be in love, you need to sexually satisfy a man. It might be true most of the time but not all men are the same. When it comes to true love, you don't need sex. And if a man is horny, I'm sure you can sexually satisfy him anyway unless you don't have all 3 (vagina, mouth, hands).</p>
              <p>I think rather than looking at the bad things happening in your life, take some time to slow down and smell the flowers and look at the wonderful things you have. That is a recipe to be happy.</p>

              <p>Dear VeggieBao,</p>
              <p>I have a cat! He left two scratches on my wrists, but I still believe he is a nice cat.</p>
              <p>And DailyFreeGames, you shouldn't type such words in reply to me. This is PRECISELY the type of words you guys say which get me into trouble with Singapore girls. I CAN understand why they would be angry.</p>
              <p>Well, my parents are against me getting married, because I have no $$$$, am on medication and am not independent.</p>
              <p>Maybe much to your surprise, I don't fancy kids that much, perhaps due to phobia with my occupation as tutor.</p>
              <p>I don't mind staying in HDB, my guy doesn't need to be romantic, but he can't be an MCP and if he's not loaded, how is he going to pay my medical bills?</p>
              <p>To be very frank, I've started to hate tuition and telemarketing. Do you believe that after REPEATEDLY telling them to inform me about cancellation of classes, they telephone me when I'm on the bus to cancel? And there is no reinbursement, and yet afterwards, I'm still expected to be on good behaviour? Singapore parents are fussy, and many don't even pay me the extra money if I correct their child's learning disability. And I have no defence, since I'm not licensed.</p>
              <p>What irks me is repeated cancellation of classes despite me giving a discount and STILL when I AM on the bus. which means I have to pay for two bus fares in addition to NO PAY!</p>
              <p>No more tuition for me, thanks but no thanks. I will type whatever I know here, and you can use the knowledge if it's useful.</p>
              <p>Honestly, these families have a car and they know I don't drive.</p>
              <p>However, what irks me the most is why I am ALWAYS expected to work for FREE! Do I look like I have the words "free labour" on my face?! Oh well.</p>
              <p>Ok, I'm awake, and glad.</p>
              <p>Going to library to do research today.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Ok, let me break my silence, seeing a few Singaporean men want to be friendly.</p>
              <p>First of all, I had problems with my education. I got an "A1" for "O" level pure chemistry and a "B4" for "O" levels. Then I had problem at the sociology department where I wrote an arguably decent essay and got a "C".</p>
              <p>However, worse of all, I had problems with jobs. Employers made petty excuses to sack me. Mr Christian Huber, if you want to know, I was the only who got you the "Money" page at "The Straits Times" with just one phone call. Yet, my employer called me slow and sacked me.</p>
              <p>Nowadays with tuition, I cannot teach girls and I also worry for the country's future as honestly, some kids are REALLY insane.</p>
              <p>In general, the elderly and seniors in Singapore seem to disapprove of me, maybe because some of my family members are bankers and in the government sector.</p>
              <p>SOMEBODY in Singapore also fed me SOMETHING and I ended up in a coma and woke up in hospital. THAT PERSON must not only be rich but have a certain position to access such a drug.</p>
              <p>Then I wake up from my coma and it is said I have an illness.</p>
              <p>Well, I read up on that illness and it doesn't come with a coma. I can also still dance difficult moves perfectly while that illness is supposed to come up coordination problems. I still meet up with my friends. I am also supposed to have difficulty sleeping but guess what, I sleep 12 hours per day!</p>
              <p>Increasingly my family members are all plagued with illness one by one. I am also lonely and want a man.</p>
              <p>I ever met a guy I like at a wedding dinner but he seemed rich (will his parents dis-inherit him if he marries me), and in addition, I kinda knew the company he was working for was and is in trouble.</p>
              <p>I am NOT healthy and don't think I can satisfy a guy in sex, and nor am able to produce a healthy baby plus I seem to be discriminated against working in Singapore and Singapore females all seem to dislike me anyway. In addition, two of our family businesses got sabotaged</p>
              <p>I like him anyway.</p>
              <p>However, I keep on working in other areas like research but the ang mohs insist a lot of positions in this area are voluntary so in the end, I am in a voluntary position.</p>
              <p>But I keep on working, and thinking of him, because I am lonely anyway, and my "job" seems rather important.</p>
              <p>Well, I can only appeal to the elders through these two points I hope-</p>
              <p>The story goes that my parternal great-uncle was one of the men who fought at Bukit Timah hill against the Japanese during World War 11.</p>
              <p>Well, if this story, I am not sure, is not true, AT LEAST my parternal grandfather's photograph is featured in the building of the Fuchow Clan Association, so he MUST have done something!</p>
              <p>Meanwhile, I have no $$$ and all my $$ are paying for medical bills and I have a bit of memory problem which means I cannot really perform in an office job and I am also still "working".</p>
              <p>This is my story.</p>

              <p>My blog's website is down for the moment, but I will get back to you when it is up and running again.</p>
              <p>Well, I do eat three meals per day. I eat a light breakfast and lunch but have extremely excellent dinners.</p>
              <p>Normally, I eat a fruit for breakfast then something like cereal, oats or biscuits for lunch, but during the third day, I eat something a bit heavier, like leftovers from dinner. Sometimes, when my mum stocks up on instant mee, I eat one packet of that. Of course there are also drinks of cheap coffee and honey during the day.</p>
              <p>Then once a week, I go Starbucks or Coffee Bean for brunch. I also DO surf the internet; I have to, and I USE a LOT of electricity.</p>
              <p>And my dinner- are you interested to hear about my dinner?</p>
              <p>As for my "voluntary" research, does it LOOK like I GOT a CHOICE?</p>
