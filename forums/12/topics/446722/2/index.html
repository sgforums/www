              <p>And DailyFreeGames, you shouldn't type such words in reply to me. This is PRECISELY the type of words you guys say which get me into trouble with Singapore girls. I CAN understand why they would be angry. </p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p><br>Well, I am known to be straight to the point person when I think that person is able to take honest feedback. So in another words, I think you're strong in mind enough, despite how others may think otherwise. Personally, I don't care about girls angry at me, you won't be if you have 10 girls and you know you can afford to make 6-8 angry and there's still 2 there for you. Plus, so far girls bring nothing but trouble to me, so it's not like I need them so much to be afraid of their anger.</p>
              <p>But I'm not here to argue. I'm here wondering why a smart person like you will have this loss of confidence in yourself. There is this feeling that seems like alot of negative thoughts have swarmed your mind. As with everybody else, we have negative and positive thoughts all the time and how we feel depends on which type of thoughts we want our minds to give priority to. At this moment, I think you gave too much attention to the negative stuff in your life and all these builtup makes you feel bad.</p>
              <p>I am not sure if you travel alot... with that I mean really poor countries like Myanmar or or Thailand or even North Korea. If you do, you find that conditions in those places are so bad you barely can find anything to be happy even for a second. But when you do know those people, and communicate with them, some are able to find happiness despite their conditions, and their conditions are so many times worst off than yours I would presume. Yes, they may be sad but yet they give time to happy and positive thoughts. It gives them hope. On the other hand, I see that you find so many bad things in life to complain about, that you are almost blinded to the wonderful things God has given you.</p>
              <p>You mentioned you go to Starbucks? That's their 1-2 week's pay for your 1 hour of enjoyment. Do you see the huge contrast now? And you're still complaining about life?</p>
              <p>I just want to say... and I can say with huge confidence, that you have some talents and abilities in you, but from your conversations here, it appears that you have undermine these abilities and talents and instead you keep focusing on the negative aspects of what happens to you... like how others was being unfair to you, for example... think about this... those people working 1 month for just $300/month... lives have been unfair to them since they were born... and some of them ain't complaining, why should you?</p>

              <p>I was very pretty when I was young. I almost always was chosen to be the bride when we were playing games in kindergarden. From kindergarden to primary three, boys came up to me and gave me presents, played with me or talked.</p>
              <p>Isn't primary four a bit too fast for looks to fade? I always had a good dinner, you know. I also wasn't a quiet kid and wasn't an easy kid to handle in school.</p>
              <p>Then in secondary three, initially, I got "Bronze" for NAFTA and scored quite high on some exercises. Then suddenly, I couldn't even run anymore and my inclined flex arm hang drop to zero. Meanwhile, I was still ok to march and play in military band (I ever carried base drum), while my running stamina dropped and I couldn't pass the running.</p>
              <p>How I know there isn't a rich, powerful psycho of family of teachers or something in Singapore. I am afraid as my grand-nephews and nieces will be injured or something as they are boisterous.</p>

              @ilovemusic,
              Aiyah, u holding onto cancelled cheques and expired cheques (the past), it is only valid in your mind, reality-wise it is bereft of meaning and utterly useless.
              One can simply live or one can try to live, the intelligent ones would abide to the former, the neurotic ones will always chase and waiting.

              Frankly, there is no need to see a doctor, all that is needed is to be honest and by that I mean get real about oneself cos one's ideas of .... is clashing with reality, about life and living. BEING SELF-HONEST MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE.

              <p>TS is extremely paranoid... did you do drugs?</p>
              <p>I think you need to see a doctor for your mental health as the doctor would be in a better position to advise you about your next step.</p>
              <p>The past has already happened and doesn't matter. You can't change it.</p>
              <p>You really need to see a doctor I think because you're extremely paranoid and that is really bad because it will affect your social skills. You're always concern about people harming you, and if you think like that, how to truly have friends?</p>

              <p>I am only writing as though I am speaking and not in formal English, that's all.</p>
              <p>And speakoutfor, I used to hang out with a neighbour of mine. We weren't officially a couple but we used to go out.He bought me some small items and in the end, he passed away. I never knew the reason though.</p>
              <p>And since you want me to write in better English, I'll give it a shot.</p>
              <p>I realise from "The Straits Times" that men want a "pretty face"in a partner.  Up to the time span of last year, I used to see two faces of mine- a sweet pretty face and an ugly face. I didn't realise this for a very long time. I just look at the mirror and I still look very pretty and decent. It was only after I had a camera telephone, started taking photographs that I realised my photographs and the face which I saw in the mirror reflection is different.</p>
              <p>I knew this, but I didn't say anything for a long time as I resented being judged by my looks but oh well.</p>
              <p>I get along better with male students. If you don't believe me, just watch me at a restaurant or at McDonald's and I still attract glances from male students as well as kids. Kids still come up to me and smile, especially the male ones. And when I frequent Boat Quay, I still attract glances from the Anglo Saxons.</p>
              <p>In general, Singapore women still look at me as well. They can see my fairly decent face, as I perceive.</p>
              <p>Of course, my fairly sweet and decent face is nothing compared to my looks when I was younger.</p>
              <p>And speakoutfor, my problems equates to EVERYTHING in your post.</p>
              <p>And DailyFreeGames, I do have friends and we hang out as usual.</p>

              <p>Well, to reply to a previous post, I am not the messiah. However, why do I get this feeling that the Holy Spirit is fond of me?</p>
              <p>I am pretty pure as much as a human can be, you know, so much so that most men feel uncomfortable with me. I am pretty much artless as well. I AM.</p>
              <p>And in addition, I went without some food more than once to give to the poor, you know?</p>
              <p>A prophecy just came to me, but I rather not post at risk of getting arrested.</p>
              <p>You don't believe me. Well, let me just say don't deny Singaporeans jobs for the sake of denying jobs and you might want to read up on what the word "Job" means.</p>
              <p>You are already unhealthy and fat, aren't you? Well, don't say I didn't warn you by not posting anything.</p>
              <p>If you want to call me psycho, go ahead!</p>

              <p>For instance, the whole Bedok Reservoir saga; so many people commiting suicide.</p>
              <p>Then bodies found floating at Marina Barrage and elsewhere, for instance.</p>
              <p>Next, suddenly, so many news of students behaving intimately with the opposite sex and being obsessed with McDonald's. Why are kids so obsessed with fast food? It is a potential health hazard and problem.</p>
              <p>I also heard from a relative that kids nowadays are threatening each other using penknife.</p>
              <p>In addition, all the news that kids kill, riot etc. Why are kids so violent nowadays? It's very strange.</p>
