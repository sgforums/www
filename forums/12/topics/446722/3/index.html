              <p><br>I don't understand why you can't have a man... even ugly people have gotten married... even really sick people got married... what exempts you and make you such a special case from being able to have a man unless it's your own decision?</p>
              <p>The only issue I noticed about you is that you're very paranoid... I have a sense it's schizophrenia...</p>
              <p>Anyway, why do you care so much about how the world runs... the fast food is unhealthy and people eat them, so why would it bother you so much? People commit suicide, why suddenly concerns you? You living at Bedok Reservoir?</p>
              <p>I think you need a boyfriend to open up your mind and control you. Sgforums alot... you just need to have silk clothing and they will do the rest.</p>

              <p>I am just concerned about the news, that is all.</p>
              <p>I am not ill. If I really am ill, how come I can still balance myself and dance really complicated dance steps, you know. And if I am ill, does it come with a loss of energy? I already lost a lot of energy prior to taking medicine, you know. As in I really scored quite well in some NAFTA exercises but then I didn't have the strength to do them anymore while my sit-ups were still ok and decent. I ever got "Bronze" for NAFTA at secondary school, you know.</p>
              <p>And how do you explain me being in military band and next, reduced to the state where I sleep so much. I sleep 14 hours per day! I can do salutation to the sun and hold for quite a while, you know. And I'm supposed to have difficulty sleeping.</p>
              <p>And here's me sharing more strange news. It was reported in "The Straits Times" that a man wanted to get into medical school who did well in his "A" levels who eventually became mentally deranged. There are more than one such reports.</p>
              <p>Do you know what sort of books I am reading in the library or not? I am reading thick books thrown with scientific words, graphs, jargon, mathematical equations as well as graphs. And I am able to understand them. Me with "B"s in "O" level science? I am tempted to make some "top" students read the books I read and see whether they understand and we compare as well as debate.</p>

              <p>And here are some more strange news. It was reported in the "Yahoo News" that an SAF officer, after completing some exercises in America, was suddenly murdered and his family dead.</p>

              <p>Because the teenage years are the formative years, therefore (roughty) how you were as a teenager would determine how you would be for the rest of your life.</p>

              <p>It is slowly dawning on you that your future is uncertain, unsecure, and you don't know where you are headed. The simple remedy is just make sure you have a plan for the future.</p>

              <p>You are troubled, and sound incoherent. I know you want to find and outlet to all the troubles and want people to feel for you (if this is not a joke, but just in case this is real I can give you some tips and advice). This is your life, You are the only person who can help yourself. So buck up and stay strong.<br>Now first and foremost, You said you don't like kids and you are still a tutor.<br>I would recommend you to quit your job as a tutor as your dislike for kids will not make you a good tutor. A good tutor must be bubbly and be firm when necessary, and must be loving and understanding to the kids. Also He/She must be confident and be a person of good morals as they will be the modals of the students they teach!</p>
              <p>If your student's parents cancel on you when you are already on the way, you can tell them and request them to pay for your travelling fees (to and from).<br>Also, the past is already the past. Whether anyone did really poison you or not, it is already the history.</p>
              <p>Do you still want your past to haunt you and deny you the right for you to enjoy your life to the fullest? You have already spend the first few decades of your life feeling sorry for yourself and lamenting that why everything dont goes your way, why not you wake up from all this an enjoy your life with a fresh start? No one will have any reason to harm you delibrately and if there is find the reason why and confront the person.</p>
              <p>Also, Why bother about not being able to get a man (boyfriend). You can be happy even when you are single as you can have your family and friends around you ! I know of people who are middle age/ elderly and  single and are happy and successful in their life.<br><br>If you are feeling really low and down, go talk and catch up with your real life family and friends! Have fun! Eat good food!<br>It is much better than coming on a forum and talk endless on negative stuff right? You can also call counselling hotlines from these sites: <a href="http://www.aware.org.sg/support-services/counselling/">http://www.aware.org.sg/support-services/counselling/</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritans_of_Singapore">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritans_of_Singapore</a>. They will give you plently of ideas to cope with your life and encourage you along.<br><br>So Cheerup and think yourself as a normal, healthy person. And you will be. Trust me.<br>I have been through that. I can tell you my whole story if you like to. </p>

When you die, you will ofcourse still look like you over dose on medication even if it is sleeping pill. You think overdozage on sleeping pill really like sleeping meh? Already say le. Not sleeping, is dying. <br>Burn charcoal the charcoal produce carbon dioxide, monoxide, and lots of smoke.<br>Imagine breathing smoke and suffocating while you sleep and die. All smoke, die also not easy sia. <br><br>Aiya the best is to be alive and take your future and life in your own hands and  NOT putting it in the hands of death in which the outcome is obvious - Game Over.</p></div>
