              <p>We broke up last year during March. After giving many different reasons, it turns out that she likes another guy. No idea why the hell, I told her I don't mind; and that I'll wait for her for as long as it will take. After that, she became really cold towards me. Slowly we don't talk at all.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After half a year, I met another girl. I tried to be friends with her. At first I thought I was interested in her, but when we started chatting really well - it reminded me of my ex girlfriend. I felt despaired cause.. just when I thought I could finally forget, I realise that I totally can't. didn't really talk to the other girl soon after..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Before new year, my ex girlfriend suddenly talked to me again. I was glad that we could chat as friends again, after so long. Then, she invited me to a new year party. I went that night, chatted and had a lil fun during the party. Till before sunrise when we were alone else where, I was a lil tipsy; and I broke down infront of her. I told her how terrible I felt for so long, that I couldn't forget her even if I wanted to.. I just can't. I cried, felt pathetic. And then she told me, actually.. she still loves me, but she can't think bout any relationship this year cause of her major exams. Holding on to some bit of hope, I told her I'll wait.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now, I try to talk to her every now and then. But.. it returns to the time when she kinda ignores me.. My heart aches real hard whenever I think bout the memories we shared..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Am I being too naive to wait for her?</p>
              <p>If I shouldn't wait, what's one way to just forget?</p>
              <p>Sometimes it's really hard to forget..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I need help, don't know what kinda help though.</p>

              <p>Nope. You are not naive to wait. If you do not want to wait, then, just occupy your life with other things. But in the first place, why do you want to forget her ?</p>
              <p>You want to forget her just because she occassionally ignore you? I guess that isnt a steady relationship.</p>

The reason why I want to forget on the other hand, is because waiting hurts.. it's gonna be 2 years in total if I'm goin to wait. While taking her word that I should wait, things now are showing that our distance even as friends are getting further each day - which means chances are probably not possible even if I waited for this year to end..

              <p>Just keep everything open - your heart, your options - and focus on other things, such as your job or your studies or even focusing on being a better man so that if, just IF, the day ever comes, you'll be able to take better care of her if she gives you the chance to. :D But in the meantime if anything else comes along, give it a try and not shut yourself out from new developments... :D</p>

              <p>I would suggest wasting no more time waiting and move on and socialise with other girls around you.</p>
              <p>From my point of view, she just wants to maintain a platonic friendship with you. The New Year party was simply an opportunity for you and her to be normal friends, but you screwed it up when you broke down and pour out all that I-can't-forget-you stuff in front of her. And no one would be so bad-ass enough to rub salt into the wounds of a heartbroken guy by saying something like "Oh stop telling me all these crap and get off me, creep.", so naturally she threw in the common school/projects/major-exams/i'm-too-busy excuse to make you feel better.</p>
              <p>This is probably why she is cold towards you all the time - she didn't want you to be hopeful of a closer-than-friends relationship with her, and it seemed to her that a platonic relationship is not possible.</p>
              <p>You've already lost her as a girlfriend. If you don't wish to lose her <strong>as a friend</strong>, I would advice you to talk it out with her and assure her that you will not try to start another BGR with her but would like to keep her as a normal friend.</p>

              <p>wow.....guys always fall for such lousy "kind" words from girls. Most of the time, they probably just give you false hope, just in case they have nobody to fall back on...or they cant find a better excuse to reject you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You mentioned that there was another ger whom you can relate to. Go for her if she is good. Why cling on to a history when the future is in front? And let your ex knows what she has missed out..</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>hmm i understand how u feel.. it must be difficult trying to focus and do your stuff when she keeps coming into your mind. juz try to carry on with your life as per normal bah. try to keep yourself occupy and try not to be left alone or else you will start to think again. Best is try to make new friends. As for what will happen between her and you, dont think so much. Time will tell. Keep your options open at the mean time. :)</p></div>
