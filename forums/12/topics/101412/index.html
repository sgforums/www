If  love her so much, I'd make sure she has a helmet on everytime she rides with me because I sure dun wanna dick around with her life. It seems like the guy here only care about her when he got brake failure. Before that, he dun care about her safety at all...</div>

Preventation is better than cure. The above scenario can happen only if<br><br>(1) The rider does not care about GF to ride at that speed or both guy and gal siao one.<br><br>(2) While being siao, the guy knows nuts about bike and it's maintenance. The probability of both the throttle and brake spoil at the same time, excluding prior accident just before the slope, is extremely miniscue even without much maintenance.<br><br><strong>(3) And on top of that, got helmet, he wear himself and ask GF no need to wear!!!</strong><br><br>(4) I am not sure if there is any long stretch of downslope that is long enough to go at 160km/h at any considerable long time.<br><br>So, give me a better story than this.</div>
