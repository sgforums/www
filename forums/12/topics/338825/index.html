              <p>2nd day, we played together again.. A intro B to me.. i added him as a friend.. and as u noe B is a very very noisy person who craps a lot.. so B start talking to A and didnt talk to me as he doesnt really noe me... tho i dunno him too..</p>
              <p>A didnt bothered to intro each other... only the names.. thats all.. situtation is awkward.. the cheery me then started to shut up and play.. i only talk when they asked me questions..  A then keep asking if i were left out as i keep on keeping quiet.. so i asked him not to worry.. tho i did not denied the fact that i were really left out..</p>
              <p>2 hours later.. A tried to cheer me up.. which really worked.. so and i talked..</p>
              <p>3rd day.. i woke up, straight away gone in to play maple.. finding they both already online.. playing... first thing i said in maple is "YO!!".. B "yo" me back.. A kept quiet..</p>
              <p>so i asked.. is A there?<br>no reply..</p>
              <p>then B ask A something... A straight away replied.. I was shocked..<br>i asked A if he heard me saying "YO!!" and as if he there.. NO REPLY STILL!!</p>
              <p>then A started chatting with B after a few secs of my question..<br><br>he totally ignored me... I WAS REALLY REALLY ANGRY AND SAD!!</p>
              <p>2 hours later.. B log off to play other games..</p>
              <p>A talked to me.. asking real lame question.. that type of question which a very NOT close friend would ask.. I answered of cuz...and i added a sentence b4 i ans, "so u finally talking to me eh?"  i still feeling fed up...</p>
              <p>as i kill the mobs.. i obtain some items for A which he needed in the game.. so i ask him if he need it.. he replied INSTANTLY.. so he came to find me and took the item from me.. after he took the item from me.. HE IGNORED ME COMPLETELY AGAIN!!! i ask him questions, no reply, i ask if he is there, no reply.. i go find him.. HE IS MOVING AND IS NOT AFK!!!</p>
              <p>i am real sad and angry at the same time.. i am so confused.. me and A are close friends for 3 yrs..  later.. i decided to log off the game..</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>1) you are definitely not his close friend.</p>
              <p>2) don't bother yourself with people who don't bother about you.</p>
              <p>3) don't revolve your life around just one thing or one person. expand it.</p>

              <p>You sound like some girl who got angry with her boyfriend because he didn't reply to one of your 4294967296 SMS messages, and you think that he is ignoring you for another girl. Dude, you're a guy with a stick between your legs - don't be such a wuss by posting something so trivial on Aunt Agony.</p>
              <p>There could be so many reasons why he ignored some of your messages, maybe he happened to be focusing on his game when you wrote the messages, or that there were a lot of people spamming the message board in the area his game character is located in. Why not just ask him straight whether he saw your messages instead of whining about it here? Can you imagine, friends of three years, getting into a quarrel just because one of them did not reply to a few messages the other posted in an online game?</p>

              <p>If you want entertainment and your just playing a game for fun, go and play.</p>
              <p>But if your looking for friendship or a relationship, don't bother going to Maplestory or any online game searching for a soulmate. Get a life and stop crying so much.</p>
              <p>If you consider yourself a guy, be one. If you consider yourself a pussy, cry all you want here. You can even cry to <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/users/209889">kiseki</a>... =P</p>

              <p>i am sad because it is a 3 yr friendship where everyday we are so close to each other.. thinking of that friendship breaking is saddening...</p>
              <p>IF U THINK IT IS NOTHING.. ur really not fit to be a friend..</p>
              <p>and ya.. thx for some advice..</p>
              <p>this thing seems trivial to u guys.. but major to me.. anyway thx for knocking some sense..</p>
              <p>i felt much better after talking to some of my reallife friends.. one of them even had the same experience as me..</p>
              <p>and btw.. to those who says i am immature..</p>
