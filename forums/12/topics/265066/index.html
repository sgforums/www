            <div class='col-md body'>I know what I am going to receive from a lot of replies here. Insult and jokes and cheeky replies. It is okie. I still post my story and still wanna see the feedbacks from the rest of the people who treat it seriously.<br><br>To cut the long story short, I am in love with another girl. That is not unusual. It is supposed to be a good thing. However the problem is I have a wife.<br><br>Yup I am a bastard and I deserve to be castrated.<br><br>Let me ask back a question in return. When you marry, who will you choose ? A person you like a lot, but do not like u as much. Or a person who like you a lot but you do not like tat much ? This is because in the past, I always thought tat it is not possible to find a person who you like and like you in return. I always thought that is a Moulin rouge fantasy and that is why I choose to find a person who like me a lot. I think a lot of people will choose this because it is supposed to be fortunate to have someone who like you and dote on you while it is tiring to love someone who do not love u that much in return.<br><br>However Moulin rouge fantasy is the right way to go. One should find someone he loves a lot and in return, love you. Even though it seems impossibleÂ… even though there are no perfect things in the worldÂ…It is the right thing to do. If u choose the above question  to be someone who like you a lot but you do not like in return, you will face a severe dilemma like me. Later on in life you find someone who you like a lot and like you in return. But it is already too late.<br><br>Typical story is like this. I used to like a girl a lot. I crazily chased her. I failed. Totally miserable with no confidence in myself anymore. Met another girl. Seems to like me. Go out for a few dates. Acceptable and become girlfriend. Eventually become wife. However we face problems such as me lacking passion and energy in planning anything in the future with her or do anything for her. There is just noÂ… enthusiasmÂ… I never really crazily like my wife but I can live with her for many years. There are no real problems except having little enthusiasm for anything related to her and it is straining her. Then I met another girl and I started to like her. I go back to the time when I crazily like a girl again. We have similar character, similar hobbies and we like each other. Whenever I think of the future with her, it is something I always wanted in life. When I think of my future with my wife, all I see isÂ….. a normal lifeÂ…..<br><br>So what should I do ? Divorce and try to seek a new life with the new found love ? We only live once and being in a unfeeling relationship is not helping any of the parties. Stay with my wife and become a moral and responsible man ? Furthermore all love dies down one day and I just never see the potential problems I have with the new love.<br><br>What should one choose ?<br></div>

But speaking calmly and discussing how to work around this problem?<br><br>How long have you been married?<br><br>I dont think compatibility means needing to have the same interests buthow to complement each other in mutual understanding that differences will exist and will ALWAYS exist. Simply cos you not marrying a clone of yourself.<br><br>However, to reach this stage of compatibility means to put in effort. If you have never put in effort, it will never work because in all relationships, it will be a union of 2 different people who have lived separate lives until they decide to live together.<br><br>Though I believe due to your reasons that you felt you have never really loved your wife and 'settled', you never felt the 'impetus' to put in the necessary effort in the first place. this is a reason, not an excuse for not doing it ever though.<br><br>(and I think it is VERY important that you do not blame her for the marriage to begin with... .  it is immature to say she 'ask' u to marry her so u did. Whatever your reasons for marrying, it is a decision you did make. So take up that responsibility at least.)</div>

It won't be him not telling me if we could work things out better in this marriage, because really...<br><br>If he had ever held my hand, held my face, looked into my eyes and kissed me, and ever told me he loved me - all these become an act - because he never truly did.<br><br>If he had loved me before but he changed because of circumstances - that's another thing. At least its worth trying again, at least its worth putting in effort to salvage the relationship for what was there but then was lost.

I failed. Totally miserable with no confidence in myself anymore. Met another girl. Seems to like me. Go out for a few dates. Acceptable and become girlfriend. Eventually become wife. However we face problems such as me lacking passion and energy in planning anything in the future with her or do anything for her. There is just noÂ… enthusiasmÂ… I never really crazily like my wife but I can live with her for many years. There are no real problems except having little enthusiasm for anything related to her and it is straining her. Then I met another girl and I started to like her. I go back to the time when I crazily like a girl again. We have similar character, similar hobbies and we like each other. Whenever I think of the future with her, it is something I always wanted in life. When I think of my future with my wife, all I see isÂ….. a normal lifeÂ…..<br><br>So what should I do ? Divorce and try to seek a new life with the new found love ? We only live once and being in a unfeeling relationship is not helping any of the parties. Stay with my wife and become a moral and responsible man ? Furthermore all love dies down one day and I just never see the potential problems I have with the new love.<br><br>What should one choose ?<br></div></blockquote>What you do if you are in your wife shoes?<br>Imagine coming home everyday to someone who loves someone else..<br>Sad rite?<br><br>Let me ask you, if one day you came back from work and found your wife sleeping with other guy, will you really be angry at her?<br>Angry for what? Since you want to play with another gal why can't she play with another man?<br><br>Do you know that you are making a laughing stock out of marriage and the girl who loves you more then you love her.<br><br>If you really love the other girl then divorce lor, prove to us that your so call love for the other gal is so true and so really that you will do anything for her?<br><br>Scared? Cannot do it ? If you are a real man then you should give your wife and the girl you love a chance, instead of hiding behind all this crap.<br><br>YOu keep saying that the replies here are "Insult and jokes and cheeky" but have you honestly ask yourself why people want to say this things against you?<br><br>Actually what is the point of us advising you?<br>YOu know what is rite and refuse to do it then whats the point?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When you marry someone, you make a decision to be with that person forever..<br><br>I remember reading somewhere, there will always be better person out there. Someone whom you will think is prettier, more suitable for you, etc.<br><br>But what makes marriage works is commitment. The willingness to continue to stick to each other, to talk any problem out, and to find a solution for them. Not just giving up the moment you meet the "better" person.<br><br>For you haven't been with that person long enough. Now it is all good and nice.

            <div class='col-md body'>What you guys have said are very true. I agree that I am the antagoniser in this story and all the fault and blame lies on me. And my wife deserve someone better than me and I should tell her my situation and face it bravely. Maybe I am indeed the coward that hides behind a forum and seek advises from the other people instead of facing it one to one.<br><br>On the buddhist story, I find it interesting but it also in a way tells that everybody in the world is the same and there is no special one out there. Is that the truth about love ? Is marrying someone just because you can live with her and not because you are truly crazy about her the right way ? All love will die and shrink and everybody you are with, no matter how deeply you are in love with, goes back to the same ending ? I think maybe I am too idealistic about love.<br><br>By the way I am a year into the marriage. And I am not going to have a fling with the other girl and it is the worst thing to do.</div>
