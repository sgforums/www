Seriously, what's going you back from telling him? Because you don't want to appear as the bad girl in the picture? You already have plans to leave him, even if you were to tell him, it shouldn't change the fact (unless he loved you very deep).<br><br>- Plan structure of your talk. This talk probably has a concluding effect. Therefore, the content of your conversation can be long, it doesn't matter. Most important, the things you wanna say to him and the things he ought to know, add it in.<br><br>- Location important. Seriously, no meeting at each other's house. Go somewhere quiet. A beach or park or something.<br><br>III) If this relationship doesn't last - avoid any form of BGR within the next 12 months. Take this good opportunity to reflect upon yourself.
