            <div class='col-md body'>Seriously, who are u kidding when you say that you only realised it after your ex's dick penetrated you?? Obviously, you were aware of what was going on and you had the CHOICE to refuse sex even after the initial penetration. But you did not... Therefore, you were as much a willing party as he was. You parted your labia majoras, he pumped you with his rod. Both of you just wanted sex. Simple. Hormones isn't it? Just do it like they do on the Discovery Channel, That was loveless sex and you didn't think about the consequences. Zham 1st, think later...Now you feel guilty after all that humping... Don't blame it on the guy, you'll do better putting the blame on hormones.<br><br>If you still want your previous relationship to continue, (I think) you should let your ex know about what happened, but I wouldn't want to predict his reaction....</div>

People gossips esp in a case when the blow is too much for he/she to take, esp when they feel that they are the victim... they might just end up saying.. what have i done wrong in the relationship that my partner sleeps with another person? and you end up being condemn.. trust me.. people can say one thing at this time but when the real thing takes place.. you will be surprised their words differ from what they told you initially.. and i can also tell.. no one in the world is going to accept that.. we are humans not animals that after mating, forgotton about their mate.<br><br>you should just let go<br><strong>1st scenario:</strong><br>you choose to keep quiet and you feel guilt tearing at you, one day you will be in the ayslum by thinking and fearing and feeling guity everyday<br><strong><br>2nd scenario</strong><br>you tell him, you feel peace at heart that he knows the truth but another fear that he cannot accept comes in. ok assume he cld accept... he is going to treat you real diff and i can say that kind of life he is going to give you after he knows it = HELL. everyday, you will be metally emotionally abused by him.. you cant really confront him, he will use what you told him on you and I can tell since its your fault in the first place, you will be speechless upon his confrontation. he might go around spreading what you did to him.<br><br><strong>3rd scenario</strong><br>you let go.. don tell him anything and move on.. give yourself time to be release from this guilt before you attempt another relationship, which can say... the guilt wont b long since the person isnt going to be him. you feel guilt because you cheated on him. Make aure you dont ever repeat the mistake again and you live in bliss.<br><br>if you try continue this relationship, your life might be in terror, nightmares... guys... their actions and words can go beyond your imagination esp if they aint the one at fault.<br><br>I have analyse it for you... the situations you might get into and sis yun had also advice you... many people had... you still eventually have to make the choice yoursef.. make a wise one, cos a wrong one = disaster. love yourself before others could love you.<br><br>cheers <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>may god bless you</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I know its probably difficult at the moment to think straight as to what to do but one of the better thing to do at this moment is to just try and cool down so that you can get your emotions and mind straight again.  otherwise, the guilt and all the different and conflicting advise floating in your head will only cause you to become more confused and not know what to do, how to think and consequently how to feel.<br><br>It is only natural to feel guilty since that is a reactive protective mechanism that each and everyone is given and born with.  It is normal.  The issue for you is to decide what to do with how you feel.<br><br>Destructive way to handle guilt is to let it simmer and eat you up.  The better way is to use this powerful emotion to change your behaviour and learn from it and not repeat the mistake that you made.<br><br><strong>Yes you do have some soul searching to do </strong>but at this juncture, there is little point getting into the "you are to be blamed" or  "takes 2 hand to clap" game etc.  Sure everyone makes mistakes but more importantly after a mistake, of course you will feel horrible and lousy etc but instead of staying there, use that feeling as the basis and determine in your mind what you do not want to repeat.  That is what this guilt mechanism is for!  you can use it as a tool.  So use it properly, it can be used to make us just a little better as a human being.  By using this powerful tool properly, you can avoid hurting youself and hurt those you love in the future bec it will alter your thinking and behaviour for the better.<br><br>As to the whys you got into the situations, well only you can tell and analyse what went on, it may be as some had suggested that in a momentary lapse you had let your guard down and allowed the desire for sex/intimacy to carry you through and only to wake up after it is done.  That happens.  This is why so many people often regret after that.  But many just let guilt eat them up until they become numb and not take an active determined selfwilled step to change their thinking and behaviour.  So they continue to perpetuate the problem and feel guilty until they are so numb that it becomes "normal"!  Its just like alcohol or tobacco tolerence etc... the more you drink the less it affects you.<br><br>But on the other hand, if you think that you may have been drugged then you would want to reassess what your next course of action would be.<br><br>Do you know what went on?  Are you conscious of what actually went on?  The problem is that if you had engaged in heavy petting willingly then to go further, it is just another step in the process, something that is usually natural (probably something that you are used to already with him) so the mental and emotional barrier would not be as high since its the next step.  But if you had not consented to him having sex with you, then he has violated you even if you had engaged in heavy petting.<br><br>So if "you didnt know what happened until he penertrated you" meant that you had not anticipated having full intercourse but had been willing to pet with him, then you need to determine in your own mind what happened, whether you crossed the boundary automatically like before and only woke up to it when he penertrated you or that he had just taken advantage of the situation.  If it is the latter, he has violated you.  That is the same principle in law that got Shangkar Aiya-ed.<br><br>if you didnt willingly engaged in petting etc and only realised as in woken up to it and actually noticed that he is having sexual intercourse with you, then he has violated you!!!<br><br>As to why a guy will have sex or not have sex with you and your desire for him etc, that is another thing altogether, may be you should focus on your current state of mind first and clear out the doubts and guilts and analyse what happened first before you go on.  otherwise, you will be too muddle headed and confused emotionally to be able to handle anything else ahead.<br><br>Take care<br>franzx</div>
