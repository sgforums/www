            <div class='col-md body'>ahha u call that short? i guess it's short, but so many details.<br><br>my initial thoughts are these: ask YOURSELF. wat is YOUR motive for going if u want to go. i know ur question is not whether you should go or not, but the main person to convince is YOURSELF, then the rest can talk later.<br><br>now to answer your real question:<br><br>no one knows wat the motive of your buddy is, not even ur boyfriend. only he himself knows. however sometimes it's not wat u know.. it's wat u FEEL. your bf feels that he's trying to put a third leg in, well he has a reason to feel that way. not that he's a good or bad guy, some guys take it lightly, some guys are easily jealous. this is the guy u chose, so if he were to THINK that your buddy is after you, then u may want to reject your buddy's offer with much regret. whether or not ur bf is right doesn't matter. it's wat you do and how he feels about it that matters.<br><br>of course bringing these two paragraphs together, if you feel that there is absolutely nothing wrong with accepting your buddy's invitation, and that u totally trust urself and so should ur bf, YET ur bf still feels that way, then u have to make a choice. neither is wrong.<br><br>one might say he's too possessive and that u have to stand for your rights, another might say that if you don't betray your conscience then go for it, yet another might say don't go becos you shouldn't do things like this to make ur bf jealous. wat do YOU say?<br><br>off the record, when i was in a reln i trusted implicitly, so i would let my gf go. but after being cheated upon, and hearing lots of stories about gals cheating on guys i am now also, like u, confused as to where that line is drawn.<br><br>disclaimer: yes yes yes guys cheat on girls too, i don't want this to become a topic of guys vs gals. i was merely reiterating a personal experience and observation. pls take it with a pinch of salt... and pepper too if u like it spicy!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I wish i could give some advice in regard to this topic....however the unfortunate thing is....i'm also facing this kinda situation and getting paranoid easily.<br><br>My Op is...your buddy have no 'evil' intention. That's because i'll give him the benefit of doubt as he is your buddy, so it should stay that way.<br><br>Your Boyfriend i believe is inferior...or insecure,<br>Try spending lots of time with him, both of you take effort to share about matters of the heart, and re-affirm(don't know if this is a correct word to use) the promises made in the past. I hope this helps.<br><br>Lastly, to you. Do state your stand and stand by it.<br>That'll develop trust and respect from Both your buddy and BF.<br>I mean if anything really happens....you know what to do.<br><br>Take Care and cheers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I guess such things happen all the time ... guys jealous about the males surrounding their gf ... the girls jealous of females surrounding their bf ....<br><br>I would just like to share something which I have discovered myself during relationships that I had. Ever wondered why sometimes only certain people would be marked as having motives ... while ur bf might not even bother about other guys? I guess one important thing for you to do is to let your bf know your buddy. Since you say he is your buddy ... then the more your bf should know him in person. I always make it a point to know my gf's frens, especially those that she used to hang out with. And those include guys, and once I became frens with them ... Somehow, the insecurities kinda fade off a little. Of course I am not saying that it would totally prevent any betrayal ... but at least on my part, I won't always be overly suspicious. Hope my idea works for you too.</div>

I have not agree to it yet, one reason is because I'm down with fever and flu!!<br><br>This is the second time he ask me to be his date. but the previous function I did not attend. I know this buddy through my ex, he is my ex's buddy. Of all of my ex's buddies, he is the only one I have contact up till now ( It's been 4 years since the break up).<br><br>well definitely my bf know him and also know that he is asking me to be his date. My bf is furious. To me, he is only asking me out. but to my bf, he assumes that he has a 'motive' lah.<br><br>why does my bf conclude that?  this is what he told me.<br><br>I have not met him for almost a yr till this:My buddy actually just came back from overseas from his ns field trip. b4 he left he actually ask me to meet him for dinner cos he say he wish have a dinner with me b4 he left for the trip. so i just went to meet him b4 he went for the trip as usual..<br><br>and after the number of times he asks me to be his date, my bf told me as a man's sixth sense and what my buddy is doing, he has a feeling that my buddy has a motive...<br><br>i can't figure it out then.

(I presume all ur dates are one to one dates.) Gives him the wrong idea and gives ur bf a sens of not secure.<br>I noe gers like attention and guys to ask them out on dates at times. Now I am asking u: Is it tt u cant figure it out and leave it there and dun do anything?<br><br>For me, I would say wat ur bf say is definitely correct. Of all the person in the world (family and other frens), he ask u to haf dinner b4 his verseas trip. This aready shows he got some motive. I mean u are not single. (If u are single, its ok but uare not!!!) I mean u just go out with this guy fren bcos he ask u to? (and haf dinner to improve things bet u and him and to worsen things bet u and ur bf?)<br><br>If u think its impossible, pls make clear to him and dun attend one to one dates with him...
