              Wow, the person who wrote that looks down on others, purely because of a lower income level... where is the humility? Cleaners may be lowly paid, but even they contribute to society in a level that's crucial to the functioning of society as a whole. We certainly could learn more humility rather than looking down at your own kind, that's disgraceful.
              
              The message there is full of fallacies and doesn't have substantial facts. I also have an MBA, my ex-girlfriend donâ€™t even have a diploma and I think love transcends qualifications or income level. Love doesnâ€™t needs to be qualified. I donâ€™t love my pet dog because it doesnâ€™t have an MBA like me. For a person who needs someone to have an MBA in order to fall in love, I think thatâ€™s worse than my pet. Even my dog is wiser about love. Love isnâ€™t about theory or MBA, true love is more than all these.
              
              â€œDon't be a misery/burden to a woman.â€� &lt;&lt;&lt; Wow!!! Whoever wrote that is so self centered. Itâ€™s like, if there is a disaster, you all can slowly die because I will not help, please do not be a burden. So so so self centered, really disgraceful.
              
              â€œNo wonder divorce rates are going upâ€� &lt;&lt;&lt; LOL!!! Canâ€™t believe you can link that to this without any good evidenceâ€¦ I also know how to do thatâ€¦ â€œMy dog is more wel behaved than the self centered person who wrote those thingsâ€¦ NO WONDER DIVORCE RATES ARE GOING UP!!!â€� LOL, please donâ€™t make me laugh.
              
              â€œRecently, Singapore had also recognise the existence of house-husbandsâ€� &lt;&lt;&lt; Oh my God, only recently??? Only Singapore??? Only husbands??? Gosh, if someone wants to degrade someone else, at least put in some effort and not just berating without any good facts or well conceived arguments.
              
              Summary &gt; The stomper in writing that article has told us more about himself/herself rather than the other way round. I have no doubt some guys are assholes, but in being hurt by one and trying to flame the all the guys, thatâ€™s not only a lack of class and lack of intelligence, but also suggest he/she is close to being moronic.

              <p>But not just in Singapore, Men were shameless long ago and they continue to be shameless for their personal, selfish benefits.</p>
              <p>It's the same for Women too. We are shameless because we cannot lose out to Men in whatever we do, especially in an arguement with shameless Men.</p>
