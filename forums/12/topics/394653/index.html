              <p>i guess it very much depends on the intent of the man of so called lower calibre proposing to a woman of higher capabilities.  as a woman, i would rather go for a man who can support me emotionally and takes good care of our family tho he might not make as much as i do. beats having a fantastic guy whom might not turn out to be that ideal isnt it?</p>
              <p>as long as we have a mutual understanding (and he has to be mature in other aspects of thinking as well!), i dont feel that atypical differences in academic level, salaries or family background should be much of a concern.</p>

              <p>and then after getting a rich hubby or sugar-daddy.................they should start looking for a younger man that's better in bed with a bigger dick...................</p>
              <p>later after that, she can divorce rich hubby to get half his worth or suck sugar-daddy dry...................the woman is now older but richer so she should still look for young men.............but since her pussy is no longer so tight, she should look for  black guys....................</p>
