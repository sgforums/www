Unless you can 'win over her sister's heart' at the same time too? At least try to be on friendly terms with her... It's good to start early, especially you're planning on going long term with this gf. Try to show more maturity yourself at the same time. Btw, what her parents saying about all these (and your relationship)?</div>

You should befriend her elder sister first before eyeing on her little sister. If you struck down this obstacle, you will be the husband of her little sister in no time. That's why you are having this problem because the elder sister is jealous and they are twins. Go research about twins to understand them better.<br><br>However, forget about her little sister for now and focus on your studies first. Just stay in touch once a while as friend. Why waste your time? Get good marks and be successful in your career. Make more friends in the process.<br><br>A romantic relationship requires heavy investment of emotional, financial and spiritual aspects. Are you prepared for it?</div>

Unless you can 'win over her sister's heart' at the same time too? At least try to be on friendly terms with her...

            <div class='col-md body'>i think its just the beginning. after u happen to get together with her lil sis, e elder sister might continue stirring up more trouble. from the looks of it she seems like the two-faced kinda sort (front say 1 thing, at the back say another thing..) so just think thru it carefully before u start wooing her..<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I heard twins are somewhat connected. You never know that her sister like u too and is jealous about her sister. If u can handle yr own parents why not try to get to know her parents too. If her parents approve of u there will be no need to give a hood about her sister.</div>
