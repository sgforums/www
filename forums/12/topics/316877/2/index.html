              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">Just because someone doesn't love you <strong>the way you want them</strong> to doesn't mean they don't love you with all they have.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">this one more direct. people have different ways of showing their love. so like some already said, the person didn't love you the way that's in your love ideals. I agree that it's hard to be with someone who don't share your love ideals.</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-family: Arial;">girl A might appreciate the guy keeping her company everytime feeling that is love while girl B might think guy should be working hard for the future and less on the accompany which she don't mind and that is love.</span></p>
