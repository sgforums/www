            <div class='col-md body'>I got to know my Ang Mo bf last year. We have been together for about 1 year. At first, i tot we wont be together for long as he is an Ang Mo. As most of us think that foreign guys who come here to work wont take relationship seriously. They just need a companion when they are here and they will definitely go back to their country to find a serious partner.<br><br>I alwaz think in this way that's why i dun take this relationship seriouly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> But seriously speaking, i am one who dun usually take relationship seriouly such as i will wait for my bf to call me, i wont call him and i dun treat him as good as my other friens. I dun care much for him and dun wish to meet him often maybe only like once or twice a week. I treat all my past bfs all da same. They alwaz say i neglect them and dun care abt them. That's why all my past relationship didn last long.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Anyway, i also dun care much coz i usually get bored after some time.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>I treated my present Ang Mo bf da same way as i treated my past bfs. He has been working here for some years then one day, he told me he's leaving coz his contract has ended. He told me, he wish that i can go back to europe with him. I was shocked ! coz i never thought that he will ask me to leave with him as i treated him  in dat way. And i never tot of a having a serious relationship in my life. I just want someone to keep me company and make me happy when i am sad. When i heard it, i was really speechless. As i never tot a guy will say these things to me. Then i asked him, "why do u treat me so good?" he said, "i really love u very much and wish that u can come with me to europe." WOW! i was really really happy then, dunno wat to say. btw, i didn reply him.<br><br>From then onwards, i meet him almost everyday but i am still seriously thinking about this relationship. Such as do i really love him that much? Am i really ready for a serious relationship? I realli cant make up my mind. he has not left but i think i will go there and treat it as a holiday first and see what will happen.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>What do all of u think of Ang Mo? Is he really serious with me?  Would like to hear your opinions about my relationship.</div>
