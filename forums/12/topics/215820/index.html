            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I dunno how to say this but few days ago, I asked my father for 500+ deposit for my private sch fees and he started to flare up and things turned ugly from there on.<br><br>Now, he is asking me to work and support myself in studying :'( and pocket money also going to cut..probably lesser and lesser. I am 19 now but the lesser and lesser im refering to is months..<br><br>I know he can't provide me forever but the thing is..is such a big jump! From just plain lazing ard at home, taking one part-time job this yr only and quitted 1 week later. It's a cleaner job and ppl, young or old told me is not suitable for me..it's for old or retired ppl..so I quitted.<br><br>I dun dare to take up sales..I got zero stamina and my speech isn't good. If you read my past stories here in the forum..I dunno..I have a fear of talking to ppl and crowds..and also, I am so afraid..it's like so sudden..just throw me into this..this adult world..<br><br>How do ppl manage to study and work at the same time? How to overcome this fear?? This really sucks but I dunno how come I faced this so soon  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>

I have a very similar view with darknessfall. I believe he want you to pay for your own studies because he want you to cherish the opportunity of your education. Probably he feels that you've never treated finance spent on education precious but taken for granted. At the same time it is good to be able to stand independently. My sister worked part time to buy things that she need even when she's younger than you and she's currently in Australia studying her degree with loan. Maening she'll have to pay it back with her own means when she graduates.<br><br>Stand up, don't be a wimpy girl.</div>
