            <div class='col-md body'>This is my first post in this forum. I think that, by writing, I might be able to vent out my frustrations that have been bothering me for quite a long while.<br><br>I used to have a really intimate friend, but suddenly for some unknown reasons, he started to avoid me half a year ago. In case if you are wondering, no, I am not a gay; I do have a gf. It is just that I am very close to this friend because of the time we have both shared.<br><br>We had attended the same classes, lived in the same hostel, and did everything together. For example, he even did English essays for me because his English is much better than mine is. Ironically, when he did the essays for me, my English grades are always a tad better than his are. For that I am grateful. I had a great time then, because I thought I have find my Â“best friendÂ”.<br><br>However, things started to change when we came to Australia. We got into different university in Australia, and because we live quite far away from each other, our contact was minimal. That was fine with me; I am satisfied to receive an occasional phone call from him. At times, if we were both free, we would meet up for lunch during the weekends.<br><br>What I do not understand is why he wanted to avoid me 6 months ago. He suddenly did not answer any of my phone calls, and I have also tried to contact him through friends, icq, emails, but to no avail. I cannot think of anything I have done that might have offended him, and I gave up trying to reach him.<br><br>I think life has to go on, I managed to retain my composure and not look sad, and be expressionless or just smile, even though my inner self is crying out. One thing, I do not want people to worry (that is if there are), and secondly, I would rather be professional than to show all my emotions to other people.<br><br>Regretting what was lost has become a regular thing since then, and whenever I am on the bus, pensively looking out of the window, I tend to think of my past school life and what has went seriously wrong.<br><br>I would be thankful if anyone has any suggestions to help me cope with this situation.<br><br>[This message has been edited by taimedi (edited 23 January 2002).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by taimedi (edited 23 January 2002).]<br><br>[This message has been edited by taimedi (edited 23 January 2002).]</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>blackhair: Thanks. I do enjoy and welcome any of your posts.<br><br>eagle: You might be right. But then, I do not think an occasional phone call maybe once a week will be that much time-consuming. I expect and accept the fact that we will both be busy and have different social circles, but it does not explain why he is avoiding me if we are truly friends.<br><br>ApPlE_PiE: DonÂ’t worry about offending me; I am not easily offended. I prefer people speaking out their minds than beating around the bush. Well, if friends come and go easily, then it does seem useless to meet more people and end up feeling hurt? To quote RuthBaby, Â“Why bother?Â”, it seems that it will only make you feeling emotionally drained and tired in the end. I find it hard to accept that statement.<br><br>You offer some really good advices, and I will try to cross the hurdle and get over it for my own good.<br><br>Devil1976: I know that he is fine and doing well, from the little news I got from my friends now and then, when they saw him on the streets. I have given up trying to reach him, not because I have not done my best, but I believe for a relationship to work, both sides have to take the initiative. If this is fine with him, then so be it, I have no qualms about that, although I do feel sad about the whole thing.<br>----<br><br>Thanks for all the replies. I guess the reason why I have taken this up badly is because I have never told anyone about it, not even to my close friends and gf. I already feel better just by writing this out. I think this is a really great way to release some of the pent-up feelings I have.<br></div>
