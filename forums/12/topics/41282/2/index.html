            <div class='col-md body'>I heard that it is very common among women to have pimple outbreak due to hormonal imbalance.<br><br>Other factors include:<br><br>Stress<br>lack of exercise, this afeects the hormon levels too..<br>lack of sleep.<br>unbalanced diet<br>personal hygiene habits<br>skin products that don't suit you,includes make-up<br><br>Also, if you are considering going to the National Skin Center, they will treat your condiotion in two common ways:<br><br><span style="color: red;">antibiotic treatment</span><br><br>this will last from weeks to months. However, this is not advisable as in the future it MAY affect your immune system. For example you might need stronger antibiotics than your normal dosage for a common cold. Normally doctors won't advise that.<br><br>Another will be the revelutionary drug <span style="color: darkred;">isotreptinem</span> . This drug boasts capabilities to 'cure' pimples. However, during the course of medication of six months, the person is not allowed to have direct contact with sunlight and cannot be pregnant.<br><br>My friend actually tried the treatment and sure enough his skin cleared in six months , but now which is about a year later, his pimples still come back now and then...but not that much already.<br><br>I suggest you check with your GP before seeking any of the above treatments.<br><br>Hope I am of some help and if I do have any wrong facts, please enlighten me.

            <div class='col-md body'>Well fen ci is actually a skin condition that causes your skin to have certain 'flaws'. Although, there is no known product that cures it, but there are measures to prevent it. If you put on make-up, make sure you remove it completely everytime before you go to sleep. Try not to wear heavy make-up, as that also contributes to the condition. Most people who put on make up do not take proper care to remove them totally. Therefore, 'things' stay on the face and develop as they sleep in the night...You should not worry too much about your fen ci. With proper care, your skin will recover by itself in time. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If you pay look closely on the chemical make up and directions of Nixoderm..it is a highly oxidising compund and use to cure many other skin conditions besides pimples. Take care in using it, as I tried using it before and I always get this thick and burning sensation. I think it is too strong for some skin types.<br><br>Wherelse, Oxy, is made to cater to pimple problems. What it does is that it oxidises the affected area, drying it and eventually causing it to dry, shrink and peel off. Generally speaking, Oxy should help most pimple problems for most people. That is why it is selling so well. However, if you do have any condition that is not curable by prescriptions such as Oxy off the shelf, I would advise you too see a dermatologist instead...For extreme cases only I must emphasize.<br><br>Like all medications, pimple creams are also prescriptions, so it does not mean if it works for person A it will work for person B. Take caution in what you choose, after all it is your face... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Again, I would like to say if any of the above I mentioned is incorrect or misleading please correct me. Thanks!</div>
