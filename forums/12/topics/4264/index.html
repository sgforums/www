            <div class='col-md body'>Ya, I believe in friendship after relationship coz afterall I am experiencing it now. It's hard and hurting but there seems to be no way I wanna lose her in any way. Still kinda hoping she would come back to me someday, when she has made up her mind. Right now, everything I do seems more of a friend than an ex, though funny at times, but at least I know I can still be with her, even as a friend.<br><br>------------------<br>Spaces between our fingers are there so that another person's fingers can fit in them, I wish they were yours</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>ya Giggsy, sometimes to just be together with the person you like/love is just enough, cause if you two are together again, you never know whether it will kill the chemistry, it's just so hurting everytime.<br><br>can't stand it...<br>i hate loneliness....<br>=~(<br><br>------------------<br>Spaces between our fingers are there so that another person's fingers can fit in them, I wish they were yours</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i dun believe in long lasting platonic friends. I used to have quite a few close guy friends which i thought that we can be good friends forever. But somehow not long after, they want to be more than friends. But i am the kind of ger who draws a clear line between friendship and relationship. And so in the end , both of us felt so odd(especially me) that we eventually drift apart.<br>I do not know why but i have always encounter this problem. That is why until today, i dun have a close guy friend.</div>
