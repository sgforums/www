              <p>There a fat girl in my CCA. The thing I hate about her is that
                  she's always like posting "cute pics" of herself(which made me
                  puke), she's thinks she's like, so pretty. I think she looks okay,
                  but she should take such "cute pics" of herself.</p>
              <p>Somemore, she's very mean! She rejects me in the CCA group work,
                  saying i what "draw very ugly". She doesn't seem to like me much,
                  and she calls me ugly!! When i want to help to paint a star, she
                  rejects and ask me what i am doing there. So in the end, I have
                  nothing much to do.</p>
              <p>She thinks i am ugly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But i don't want to be mean like her! I also don't want to show
                  her that i am a pushover!</p>
              <p>should i spread her "cute pics" to the entire internet and shame
                  her online?</p>

              <p>What's wrong with acting cute and taking cute pictures ?</p>
              <p>People act cute all the time.</p>
              <p>It's just the person.. you don't like... whatever she do.. or say.. will irritate the shit out of you lah.</p>
              <p>So, now you posted her photo.. to "shame" her... do you feel good about yourself now ?</p>
              <p>Does it make life better now ? Does it make you feel more superior now ?</p>
              <p>What you did.. just revealed how <strong>ugly</strong> you are inside.</p>
              <p>Sure.. you're better looking than her.... so what.. there's many more people more prettier than you... does that means they can criticise everything you do ?</p>
              <p>Do you dare to tell her off in front of her face.. ?</p>
              <p>Only chicken shit people like you do bad sneaky things behind people's back.</p>
              <p>Frankly.. I'd rather be hanging out with a not so cute face acting cute.. than see a pretty face like yours with such <strong>ugly personality</strong>.</p>
              <p>Just because you think you look good.. doesn't means everyone must like you. OK ? Good.</p>

              <p>I really cant understand the kids of these days.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Jiani, i cant help but feel you are a person who is very self centered, tends to harbor hatred, meek and very cowardly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Last time you were complaining about your friend and now you are complaining about your classmate. If there anyone you do not complain about?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And come on ...i was already 10 times more sensible than you are when i was your age. During primary school there were those who tried to make fun of me and push me around, and guess what? I walked up to the fellow, threw the first punch and i never held back. I keep punching til i beat ppl twice my size into a pulp. Yeah, our parents were called in and we were sent to the principal's office. So what? I didnt care and i never felt guilty for anything. Those weasels got what they deserved.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Now look at you.. you hate someone and all you can do is post funny pictures of that person online? Thats the best you can do? What purpose does it serve anyway? Is it supposed to scare and humiliate her into not bullying you any longer? If the person doesnt see it, she could still make yr life in school a living hell. If i were her, i wont be phased but only laugh at your stupidity.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are such a coward. Things happen and all your know is to hide behind your keyboard and attempt silly things like that. Thats absolutely a very childish and chicken thing to do.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are really pissed with somebody, go tell it to her face !! Whats the use of you hiding back here and being a keyboard warrior ? </p>
