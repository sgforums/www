            <div class='col-md body'>Hi everyone, if you may, I have an anecdote that I wish to share with you guys and hope that this incident that happened in Perth will give you guys an significant insight on the psychology of an average Australian.<br><br>When I visited Perth last year, I was adversely affected by a group of thugs that rode past me and shouted Â“Go homeÂ” at me. After which they sped away before I could verbally defend myself, laughing all the way as if they were riding rain-deerÂ’s instead of driving a car. Anyway, I referred this matter to a elderly acquaintance whom I met at the nearby hotel earlier at day and his immediately remark was rather pragmatic and made no attempt to justify their behavior by producing some preposterous excuses. I was deeply impressed.<br><br>From him, I learnt that why they had held Asians in so much contempt. The reason was because they thought we were there to steal their riches away from them..well in this case their education. (Places in their university) So it was conceivable why they were to react this way. Just like I held those Chinese from China in contempt because I think they were uncouth and taking up the universityÂ’s slots in Singapore. The other reason that the elderly man told me was that unlike Sydney where literally millions of tourist visited there annually, seldom tourists visited Perth. Perhaps exposure plays a part.<br><br>From what I noticed, I believe the thought of racism in Australia is caused mostly by the minority of teenagers from several Â“shyÂ” states such as Perth whom they seldom interact with foreigners. I donÂ’t think it is right for critics to classified Australian as a bunch of racist thugs. Their services is definitely better and more courteous than those of SingaporeÂ’s. LetÂ’s not let so few affect our judgement on so many. Thank you for your attention, goodnight. Long live Australia.<br></div>

"Go back to China" in the middle of the night in Melbourne CBD in the first year that i was here. They were young Yobos trying to act tough. I said, "i'm not from China, you F head and get it right next time and f off".  Same as all the wogs yelling and whistling from their cars. I show them the middle finger.<br><br>In all honesty, the only reason one might experience discrimination is when they are not willing to assimilate. I'm a migrant of Australia, I have been employed in local firms during my Uni days. No one has told me you can't speak English, no one is gonna give you a job. Or look at me funny when i'm at job interviews. Most of my friends are Ang moh, I go to local pubs that Aussies go to. And all of them talk to me, not cos i'm a female. It's because i want to talk to them.<br><br>All overseas students here, think of your asian counterparts or yourself. Do they hang around other asian students and speak in their own language and not english? How do you expect to be accepted by the Aussies when you dont even want to talk to them?<br><br>In my opinion, there is more discrimination against Aboriginals, wogs and White Trailer Trash than Asians. The incident might have been gang related and could have been done by another asian gang.</div>
