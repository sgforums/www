Female, yes...I would like to welcome you and here would like to introduce to you Tom, Dick and Harry who are still single.

And my Indian friend's uncle who is a Singaporean is working as a psychologist here and has been here since the 80s'.<br><br>My goodness, with all the prejudice against Indians, if he can get a job. Any guy can.<br><br>OH PLS!! You're even worse than Pauline Hanson by being so judgemental and angry about this issue. My GIRLfriends can't find a job in Melbourne or perth. One has a Masters in Accounting and CPA qualified and with all the accounting jobs advertised, you think she would get something? You probably don't understand that it isn't about having a Masters or Honours. It is more important to gain industry hands on experience than getting HDs. Maybe that is something that Sgreans is not used to.<br><br>The thing is, there are success stories. Until you've lived in a country, you can't judge what it is like. It's like me blind shooting at Hong Kong that it is a dangerous place cos they are always producing gangster flicks.</div>

It's the classic loser mentality.<br><br>He says he's never been to Oz but he plans to migrate there.  Does it look like he thinks things through?  Obviously he hasn't read any of the threads about living or working in Oz, or the debates about New Age colonisation.  Why even bother discussing the issue with someone who's brain dead - it's not that he'd bother taking in your point of view unless it validates his own.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by men_@_arms:</div><div class="quote_body">Australian Prime Minister is racist, he's making it harder for Asians to get into Australia for PR and employment.<br><br>Anywayz, people should always remain in their own country, none of this globalisation bullshit, because it just ends up in more suffering in the end.</div></blockquote>OK, I wouldn't go so far as to disagree that Little Johnny is a racist - he sure is right-wing.  On the other hand, are the tightening of migration requirements racist?  I don't think so.<br><br>For example, a few years ago, the immigration department realised that the cutoff for the skilled migration points system was too low.  They have annual calculations of how many people they can take in every year, and they found that the original 95-point minimum was being exceeded by way too many people.  To meet the quota, they had to reset the threshold to 110 points.  Hopefully those facts will place a bit of objectivity in your view.<br><br>As for globalisation, suit yourself.  You're the one refusing to acknowledge the reality of the current situation, so don't whinge about being left behind.</div>
