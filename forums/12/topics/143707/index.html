            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Kimosabe,<br><br>Tell you a secret: You're Not alone in feeling that way, so don't need to feel bad about this : )<br><br>Let's put it this way.  My guy's ex was average-looking, etc, but I was sooo insecure about myself, as I remember he was so nuts over her once, &amp; he'd told me he was gonna wait for her his whole life (when we were still just best friends).<br><br>After we got together, I'd always harboured the doubt about his ex.  I sat him down &amp; told him how I felt.  He reassured me at that time, but I told him that he'd been so in love with her, he'd told me he'd wait forever for her.  So, I asked him to be patient enough to let me get over my doubts.<br><br>Whenever I started feeling that gnawing insecurity, I'd let him know, &amp; he could then comfort me, ruffle my hair, pull me into his embrace, etc.  Now, after time, I'm pretty much alright, &amp; I know that he'd wait his lifetime for me.  I also know that I mean more to him than she could ever mean...<br><br>However, each person is different, I can't guarantee you'll get the same reaction from your guy.  It's a delicate issue, &amp; you have to be careful so as Not to make him feel you're doubting his love.  What I told my guy was that I knew he loved me heaps, but there was something bothering me so much, it was driving me crazy.  But before I told him, I wanted him to know that it's Not because I doubt that he loves me, but I love him so much that I want to remove all the little traces of doubt about an issue.<br><br>So, he was willing to talk.  And then everything, became ok : )<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Kimosabe:</div><div class="quote_body">I have this wonderful boyfriend, but his ex is so pretty, so hot, and way more appealing than i am...she's got alot more going for her...so...I'm not sure if she's the best he's ever had and all that, because he doesn't really talk about his feelings...but I'd rather be hurt by the truth.

I know maybe material things don't really count, it doesn't of course, but I would love to give him something. I folded some cranes for him, but I ended up throwing it out one by one. Maybe that's not something valuable. Maybe if I sell some stuff I have, can get money and buy something nice. Instead of lame cranes.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>pats pats<br><br>you are thinking too much far too much.<br><br>From the way your bf does things for you, I really belives that he loves you a lot.<br>Sometimes is not how much u spent on someone but how much time you spend with him.<br><br>If you really love someone and the someone gives you a paper crane that he had folded by himself will you be very happy?<br><br>If you do not love the person, even he gives you 999 roses, you will not be happy too right?<br><br>My ex did something for me which I still treasure very much. She do not have much money back then but she took a one dollar note and folded it into a heart shape. On it she wrote nice and cute messages for me and she kissed it with her lipstick.I really missed her alot but she had already pass on and there was nothing I could do to save her back then.<br><br>I kept her love dollar note in a safe in the bank till today. As you can see it is not how much you spend on the person you love that counts but the thought behind it.<br><br>You have done your best for your bf and I believe he knows it deep inside his heart. I do not see the point in getting jealous over his ex.<br><br>Believe in yourself that you can be better then her, you may not win her in terms of looks but with a pure heart and giving your bf tender,loving care when he needs them, is more important than anything else.<br><br>I believe you can do it.
