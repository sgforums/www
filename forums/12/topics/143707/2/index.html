            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks guys....I've been thinking so much these days...I read his Aunt Agony threads when he broke up with her...surprisingly I wasn't angry...I actually wanted to cry because a part of me really felt his pain...I know this sounds rather cheesy but I really cried after reading his poems and knowing he was so in love and left alone. I only hope, although perhaps I may not be the best of the crop...I can give him whatever he needs at least... That's all I want to do now...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Kimosabe,<br><br>It takes a generous &amp; big-hearted girl to want to get to know your bf's ex.  I don't think I could ever do that <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  Whether it's stupid or Not, is Not for anyone to judge, &amp; only time will tell.  Anyway, it sure beats the ridiculous catfights between say, Penny Lancaster &amp; Rachel Hunter (Rod Stewart being the lucky man in question).<br><br>Your gesture, as I've mentioned, is uncommon, &amp; it shows your depth of character.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Kimosabe:</div><div class="quote_body">Guess what??
