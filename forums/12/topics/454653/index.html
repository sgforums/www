              <p>I just met somebody online and after some chat, she ask me out. She is china girl.</p>
              <p>I am afraid tho. I hear a lot of scam story. What if she is out for my money?</p>
              <p>If I go out on  a date with her then after that, on my way go back home, what if she hire  a few guys to kidnap me and ask for ransom?</p>
              <p>Or is she ask me to go back to her place, then go there I get ambushed by some of her male friends to extort my money.</p>
              <p>That is short run.</p>
              <p>Long run - she could make a story about she needing money for her business or need me to be her guarantor. If I hear all this kind of thing then I better discontinue.</p>
              <p>Ok maybe I am paranoid but all this scam stories from china girls make me nervous about the date.</p>
              <p>My question is:</p>
              <p>1) What precaution should I take?</p>
              <p>2) what will raise alarm bells in order to tell whether my online date is genuine or just out to con me?</p>
              <p>3) Is it safe to arrange to meet at a crowded public place such as a restaurant or hawker center? When is it safe to go out to more personal places like her home or watching movies with her?</p>
              <p>4) I am afraid that she may have jealous ex-boyfriends who may attack me.</p>

              <p>Meet her at densely-populated coffee shop. The minute she starts talking about "needing some money", you can start creasing your eyebrows like Jeremy Renner does his involuntarily. If you are bringing her home to exchange life stories, make sure your family is right there at the adjacent room. Should she have an entourage laying siege nearby and she's holding the family hostage, at least, you have the assurance of backups - your family - who know their weapons (e.g. cooking utensils like pots and pans, prep utensils like chopper, knives, pounder and such; kids with their Nerf pew-pew blasters, skipping ropes and baseball bat) well. Excuse yourself every 3 mins on pretense you are talking to a business associate when in fact, you are transmitting data of current situation. Remember, your live is greatly dependent on this person for your ticket to survival so repay him or her with a nice treat.</p>
              <p>Good luck and have fun playing CSI.</p>

              <p>1. If she asks you for money, get out of there. </p>
              <p>2. If she asks you for money, get out of there.</p>
              <p>3. Always meet at a crowded public place.</p>

              <p>If you don't go, you will always think of it and regret.</p>
              <p>If you go, you might learn a lesson, but never regret.</p>
              <p>If you go, you might find a wonderful person.</p>
              <p>Therefore it is better to go,  and take the chance, than to be afraid, and achieve nothing.</p>

              1) What precaution should I take?
              Condoms
              
              2) what will raise alarm bells in order to tell whether my online date is genuine or just out to con me?
              You'll never know until you get con.
              
              3) Is it safe to arrange to meet at a crowded public place such as a restaurant or hawker center? When is it safe to go out to more personal places like her home or watching movies with her?
              Public place is safer relative to her choice of location
              
              4) I am afraid that she may have jealous ex-boyfriends who may attack me.
              Keep this up and you'll never find a wife.
