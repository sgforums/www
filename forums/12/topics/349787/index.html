            <div class='col-md body'><p>sounds really kinda complicated. But if she has decided to leave her marriage for you, I think you should help her along with it, give her advice, be by her side, since you mentioned her r/s w her husband is not a happy one and her kids are starting to show problems. i'm not married so i can't tell you what's the proper advice. but i believe as a mother, maybe she can do some moderation with her drinking and clubbing, not so good influence for her kids if they smell alcohol on her all the time and gradually when they grow up, they'll recognize it.</p></div>

              <p>I dont know her past is kinda big mess up.I dont know to love her or not cause I fear I might be hurt cause I have never encounter such a complicated situation before.</p>
              <p>I am willing to take up responsibilities to care for her.But she has not gone to the lawyer to proceed the divorce cause she cannot afford the fee.</p>
              <p>I do know some woman are those that cannot leave a present relationship till a ship comes along.But I do not want to be the person to break a marriage.</p>

              <p>Your feelings are strong but imho, you need to fight them. At least for now. Because it paves the way for mutual trust further down the road.</p>
              <p>When it comes to the heart, tread with care and decide with mental clarity. Be tough and don't shortchange yourself.</p>

              <p>Please lah, she and her husband must argue it out in court before a judge. She must prove to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">that</span> judge, not me or anyone else, that the marriage has irretrievably broken down. She must prove she cannot <em>tahan</em> anymore, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">to the judge</span>.</p>

              <p>That's the problem with life, gives you scars.</p>
              <p>The bad part about your situation is, she needs time to be emotionally
                  ready for her next relationship. The good part is, it sounds like so far she hasn't let you down.</p>
              <p>You understand her history but do you understand her personality? Get to know her on a deeper level, find out more. Spend time together, interact with her children. It gives you the confidence to go further.</p>
              <p>When you're in control of your needs and wants from a woman, there is higher chance for success in the choice you make. </p>
              <p>Start with smaller steps if you're not comfortable with a sudden leap of faith. Just remember, the final answer comes down to you alone and it doesn't have to be now.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>From my view, i think that it is best for you both is to take things slowly. Try to understand what went wrong in the marriage, and if it is really sufficient enough to make a divorce, then divorce. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>BUT!</strong></em></span> I still will advice you to take the time to know her well, not rushing into things.
