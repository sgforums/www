              <p><strong>1) I started to like one of my colleague after one of our annual dinner n dance event...From that point event i started expressing to one of my buddy at work n he assured me in trying to be more closer to her. I am in the outdoor operation side at my company whereas she works in the office.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>2) Feeling unsure, I just out of the blue did my homework n asked a few of my friends who work around her whether she is attached or not. and to my shock most of them said that she has a boyfriend.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>3) The thing is that from the profile I gathered in her friendster and facebook, she claim she is single....and that only a few pictures of her and this one certain guy.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>4) I gathered enough courage to try to start talking to her and she was quite a nice person to talk to when we met in the office.....to a certain extent i did ask her during one of the holiday whether she is going out with her boyfriend or not.....and to my shockness she said she don't have a boyfriend and she really assured me with that serious look on her face.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>5) The problem is that why she keeps updating her profile with this only guy at friendster saying her dear whereby she keeps repeating to me when we met that shes unattached....</strong></p>

              <p><br>Why shall u only leave yrself with option of 2? I help u choose the 3rd option. Continue to befriend her and find out more abt her trhu chit-chat and if possible. Go for outing with her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Why u need to confess yr feeling to her so soon? Who teach u one?  While she called other guys friend as dear may due to habit or what(Although its not very good to do it that way). It doesn't really comfirm she got bf. Unless u see photo of her in friendster hugging like glue with that guy.  Give yrself and herself more time if u really like her. Exercise caution when dating her.</p>

              <p><br>It's not abt she got a bf and u back off. It's abt LYING! If she really got a bf but keep denying it. Do u think u will have a good start if u really started with her?  What u mention is contradicting.. U say r/s is abt trust. Where is the trust when she's telling a lie, not to mention start a r/s with her.. Do u think u can trust her???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>TS don't jump to conclusion too fast. My advice if she lies, forget abt her. This type of gal good at mind games, U are no match for her.</p>
              <p>If she don't have bf, good for u.  Find out more abt her first before u makes yr next move.</p>
