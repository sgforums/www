              <p>i have been thinking this year round after my ord. why i'm so burl, 
              slow, not smart then others.i was a retail assis and a few days ago a so
               call western customer say something to me. she's say '' what are you 
              working here for ? and don't know anything'' . it is because she is 
              asking about the size that is already the smallest of all outlet. so she
               ask again what ever place got sell the size etc. but some of the 
              customers asking for direction from me but i really don't know. just 
              because of this not to know anything, and it reflect back alot and alot 
              of my past time. i once still remember while on my ns service. my 
              intruster say to me that ''is not you don't wan to know, is you lazy to 
              know '' while on lecturing time.i can say that i'm a sensitive person 
              but how to be smart to know everything? how to stop being lazy to know 
              everything? i'm worry about my future ahead is rotting just because not 
              to know everything and sure always be the loser. how to be smart in 
              everything or to know everthing? is already no point to look down on 
              myself because already look down on myself even i was born. but now how 
              to change myself? you see i already so stupid and cockster. i'm really tired being like this...really tired.</p>

              <p>I will say that you are not dumb, in fact to be frank I personally think you are pretty smart considering you know that you need help and you are seeking for help now, that is an excellent start!</p>
              <p>Now, do you have a degree or a diploma? If you don't I strongly suggest you to take up studying as in Singapore, a degree is extremely important otherwise you will have a tough time here and your whole future, you will be stuck as just an assistant.</p>
              <p>Lastly, believe in yourself! If you keep believing that you are dumb there is no way you are going to be smart. Look at the problem to you have and work on it, who knows one day went you have worked hard that you had became the Chairman of Apple Inc. who knows?</p>
              <p>Never under-estimate yourself, lastly do not believe in luck, there is no luck, if you can do something and you think it is by luck or chances you are wrong, you have the capability to do it. Remember:</p>
              <p>Find your skill</p>
              <p>Prefect your skill</p>
              <p>Capitalize on your skill.</p>

              <p><br>If you finish army and already 20+... then maybe studies is not the best course to undertake. Its costly and if you already have the thought that you might give up halfway...don't.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Singapore education in my biased perspective... try your best to stay mainstream... once you fall out of it (i.e. O's - A's/Poly - Degree) then your only other realistic choice is to study overseas which costs abit. If you have already fallen out of it then try industries that value experience over education.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I reccomend... sign on army/navy/police, civil service, or study nursing (highly reccomend) or some technical skill that is not too lowly paid in Singapore.</p>
