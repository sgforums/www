            <div class='col-md body'>Just finished your Orientation in J1? Haha, don't worry, a lot of people face such problems. I can safely say I'm one of them, because I'm not exactly outgoing, and I don't usually talk to others unless needed or the situation demands it.<br><br>For now, I'd suggest you just hang out with your OG during breaks. If there's no real need to say anything, don't do/say anything which you might embarass yourself with. Watch, listen and offer some stuff at times.<br><br>You'll meet all sorts of people in life. A lot you will notice to be shallow, but remember, that's their problem. When you say the girls are immature, maybe it's because they're talking about things you find to be mundane, and there has to be a Lowest Common Denominator in conversations. Obviously, the mundane stuff will get to everyone, and so that could be why they seem to be getting along well with everyone else.<br><br>Your OGLs are J2s. They've got a lot of things like lectures and tutorials to worry about, so it might make them seem aloof. I know, because I'm a J2 myself and my OGL friends are all panicking and fretting over work. I suppose that's what separates the good OGLs from the rest of the heap; the ones who can worry about the new juniors are the better ones.<br><br>Take your time. Besides, you'll be having a class to hang out with soon, and I assure you, making friends in class is a lot easier than socializing in your OG.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i think that for a person, there are certain groups of people that cannot click with you though.  i do not know you so i can't say for sure on the reason why though.<br><br>i guess then i will talk about me then. i'm quiet around people that i do not know very well and around people that i cannot click with but on the other hand i can quite talkative and joke around with people that i'm comfortable with or around with people that i can click with though.<br><br>so i guess just be more open about yourself so that other will open up to you as well. Even though you do not understand those jokes or anything, i guess just listen and try to get to know them more. communication is quite important though. dun look it as socializing but look it as you want to get to knoe someone better. If you are really sincere to know someone, they can feel it though</div>

Then work on it!<br>I beg to differ the part about cliques, you sound jealous.<br>If being immature will get you to know more people, then why not! You are not a working adult... enjoy when you still can! So what if you are 16 and still immature! Its much better then being 50+ and immature right!??<br></div>

What is their name.<br>2. What is their favorite food.<br>3. What is the name of one of their friends.<br><br>The rule is you cannot ask them outright. Instead you have to find ways to get them to volunteer the information.<br><br>This game has a time limit of 10 minutes. At the end of 10 minutes thank them for their time and leave.<br><br>Doing this periodically will help you develop your skill in social interaction.</div>
