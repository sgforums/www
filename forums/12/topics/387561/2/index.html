              <p>you sound too easy and head over heels for her. girls don't want someone who is showing signs of being clingy before they date the guy.<br><br> i think you should really back off for hmmm 3-4 days and she will start wandering what's up and want to talk to you. try to show to her that you are a man because girls like that. <br><br>try to live your life without involving her in it and she will start to beg for attention. she will also miss the way that you used to talk to her everyday and so on because no one else does that for her.</p>
              <p>also: if she starts coming back to you because you don't give her as much attention...don't make the mistake of giving her lots and lots of attention because she will think you haven't changed at all. only give attention if she gives it back = balance.</p>

              <p>it take both party to clap . When a girl dun like u. she will give BILLION reason. One of the most common one is... charactor dun match... different thinking... blah blah.. when a girl really like u... even if ur skin is totally black and her is so white she will said it's okie la...Come on la.. girl are famous for indirect rejection. If u try to clap and she dun clap. find another who is willing to clap. U get the meaning or not.Simply mean u need to find the CORRECT partner. Obviously now what u need to do is to realise that she does not like you and you are going to forget her and find another one. She is not your prospect.</p>

              I think u should give her more space instead of being so persistent. Chill out and just stop all contacts with her for a week or 2. Not even an sms or an email. I know its hard but you just got to try. And even after 2 weeks, she's still like this... i think its best for you to move on.
              
              No point making her even more ticked off by your persistency ( No offence ) and ending up to lose a potential good friend. Just my 2 cents.

              <p>There are several possibilities....</p>
              <p>1. She accepts your love.</p>
              <p>2. She does not accept.</p>
              <p>In my opinion you must be prepared for eventuality number 2.</p>
              <p>Of course there is also a chance of her accepting you.</p>
              <p>It's hard to say.</p>
              <p>In my opinion, this is like water finding its own level.......the path of least resistance....</p>
              <p>So what do you think? You can probably guess from her personality.</p>
              <p>If the path of least resistance, and water finding its own level, is for her to stall and decline....then, you have to be prepared for this and then move on. Just respect that.</p>
              <p>It's the same like you, you were not ready for a relationship for 4 years. People also have their own issues and their timings and comfort level. If she is not ready and doesnt want to, then you have to respect that.</p>
