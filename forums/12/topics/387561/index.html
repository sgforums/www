              <p>Dear TS,</p>
              <p>i feel yr pain, well here's the thing,people say being persistant will bring success as for relationship it might differ, i guess your at yr prime age now right?</p>
              <p>well i guess if you really think she is the one you have been seeking for all this while? stay by her side, be her frien i think somehow or someday you 2 will be together.</p>
              <p>but still think positively, i'm sure there are better girls out there, do you think u can find someone with her characteristic? Yes people are unique, it takes time to forget about her and move on. but that's reality. Accept it and Move on.</p>
              <p>what i can see from your side is that sometimes the girl is trying to avoid you, that really isn't on the good side of things. well why dun you give her sometime to think about it?</p>

              <p>Walk away....Love cannot be forced.</p>
              <p>Walk away...with your head held high, if indeed you had done your best to make the relationship work. She is just not ready or find you compelling enough to share a life with, a choice and a right she is entitled to, for she is slave to no one.</p>
              <p>Walk away..She is being fair to you for she doesn't want to lead you on any further.</p>
              <p>Walk away..and let the relationship remain as friendship, with both of you equal rights to your own privacy, time and life.</p>
              <p>Walk away..Nothing is ever wasted. Your time and efforts had been a great lesson, now that you know pain, and should never, ever inflict it on another who loves you.</p>
              <p>Walk away...Emotional pain while hurts, can be cured, but only IF you yourself allow it, by not dwelling on it too often,but to instead find happiness in other things that matter in life, as this is a reality for life holds more than one form of joy you presumed can only be found in a relationship. - friendships, work, hobbies, charities, religion, etc, etc issues where you can derive joy as well. Take time to get over it, but get over you must, if you seek for sanity and a normal life.</p>
              <p>You owe it to yourself to be happy and bring joy to others around you.</p>
              <p>Take care.</p>

              <p>tsk. The more you are afraid of losing her, the more likely you will. Take it naturally. Oh, and human beings have memories for a reason, it seems unnecessary for you to remind her all the time that you'll be waiting for her to accept you.</p>
              <p>Just continue with your NORMAL lifestyle and be a little more emotionally independent. It's up to her to make her decision now.</p>

              <p>I think she feels pestered by you. She already hinted you to give her up from the bf that she mentioned.</p>
              <p>Put yourself in her shoes. Two guys chasing her at the same time? man, if it's me I'll probably feel so confused...just give her some time to think about everything. Like who's really nice to her and everything.</p>

              <p>Your problem is that you expect her to respond according to your expectations. Grow up and learn that people don't always respond accordingly.</p>
              <p>Heed her advice and don't think too much.</p>
              <p>Just take her as a acquaintance, like she take you as.</p>
              <p>You are just one of her many choices. She is playing the field and can choose. She is doing the smart thing.</p>
              <p>You on the other hand, limit your choice down to one and only one, and target that one. Which is not smart. Try and have at least three prospective girls to choose from.</p>
              <p>And choose wisely.</p>
              <p>At 37 you appear a despo, to your target girl, who hasn't written you off yet.</p>
