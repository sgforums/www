            <div class='col-md body'>Now i don't think its just pure irrational fear that got hold of TS. It wld be harsh to just continue piling the blame, or impose on him our own judgements based on how we would react being in the similar situation (which then again is only often based on our own NS experiences)<br><br>My guess is that the TS suffers from social anxiety problems... which in this particular scenario may involve having intense fear of being evaluated, and being potentially embarrased by others. This fear brings about much mental and physical discomfort to the TS, therefore inhibiting his normal social behaviour. Normal social behaviour would in this situation be the various tasks he would have to perform in NS. His recursive thoughts of being humiliated, though often inaccurate and self-defeating, would bring about panic attacks such as (most commonly) heart pulpitations, blushing, stammering, nausea....and in his case 'breaking out into cold sweat'. To simply avoid the whole trauma of being at the mercy of his panic symptoms (which can be really severe) and to avoid being really humiliated in the NS, he chose to shy away from everything altogether. This final act is called social avoidance.<br><br>To attribute this completely to not being man enough or being too pampered would be plain oversimplication and ignorance on our part.<br><br>While whether or not TS's scenario actually took place is contentious, I do affirm that it is possible for somebody with social anxiety to take such a route.<br><br>But above all I think the issue here would be to what extent would MINDEF hold psychological disorders such as obsessive-compulsive disorders, tourette's syndrome, social anxiety disorders, depression, or even just simple phobias etc, in similar regard as tangible medical injuries/illnesses? One argument would be that diagnosis of psychological disorders can be subjective as their effects vary according to circumstances. But it is also possible to suggest that there is still not much awareness of such psychological disorders yet, at least within our community. Any ideas guys? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
