            <div class='col-md body'>This is superbly pathetic. This is definitely a hoax. I was an instructor before. Firstly if I am on duty and have to book in with the recruits after x'mas holidays, I definitely will expect lots of recruits missing whether for any valid reason or not. I am damn pissed because I have to be on duty when all other instructors book in next day or even next yr so i don't bother to call recruits who are missing so just let them suffer, if their reasons are not genuine, not supported by mcs or other evidence, thats what law is about.<br><br>My time was way different compared to now. NS 2 years instead of 2.5, 5-day week, no hardcore chin up regime etc so much welfare because Singapore is now a complain country...what can u ask for?<br><br>There are 2 conclusions, either this guy is an attention seeker who has no life but to tell hoax or he's the biggest shame of the male gender. Both ways please shutdown or even erase this whole thread thank you. Let Singapore know that all fighting fit men in this country are really.....men in heart and soul and not otherwise.</div>
