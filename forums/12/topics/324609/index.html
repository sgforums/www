              so recently a guy asked me out. we went out 2 times. i barely know him because hes a friend's friend, and one fine day, after making sure i was single, he just asked me to go for a movie, so i did. 
              
              the first time was kinda weird cuz we didnt really know each other and there wasnt alot to talk about. but the second was better. hes funny and gentlemanly, and hes starting to make me feel comfortable ard him. he would occasionally msg me to ask me how my day was, what i was doing, or whether i was interested to catch a movie and stuff. or just to tell me what he was doing. 
              
              the other day he told me that he feels only really happy hanging out with me.
              
              so is he interested in me?

              <p>hmm  . ..     sounds like he is interested.   Good news for you!   <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>You two have a good start.    What he is doing now may path a way for further development in the relationship.   What do you expect from this present relationship (friendship) with him?</p>

              <p>Perhaps, a more pertinent question would be "are you interested in him?"</p>

              hes 25, and im 20. the prob is i dont think im interested in him yet. i use the word yet cuz i dont wanna be so sure abt anything. i go out with him with the mindset of hanging out with a friend. its just scary cuz i dont think i really know him. it takes time. 
              
              we come from really different backgrounds, and maybe i havent gotten used to it yet.
              
              yes, i admit im enjoying the attention he gives me. but im pretty sure we are just friends in the mean time.

              <p>Hey take your time. He is def interested in you 100%. I'm a guy so I know that what he is doing is all pointing towards interest. Not all guys are into just getting into your pants, like some people are saying on the board. It is possible that he is after a real relationship so don't think all guys are sleazy.</p>
              <p>However if you are not interested in him, then don't take advantage of him. I'm sure you don't want your heart broken, neither does he. So my suggestion is for you to decide what you want.</p>

              <p>hes 25, and im 20. the prob is i dont think im interested in him yet. i use the word yet cuz i dont wanna be so sure abt anything. i go out with him with the mindset of hanging out with a friend. its just scary cuz i dont think i really know him. it takes time.</p>
              <p>we come from really different backgrounds, and maybe i havent gotten used to it yet.</p>
              <p>yes, i admit im enjoying the attention he gives me. but im pretty sure we are just friends in the mean time.</p>

              <p>I suppose only you can answer the root cause of the ambivalence that seems to hold you back somewhat.</p>
              <p>You don't think you're interested in him yet you're enjoying the attention from him? With due respect, are you sure your claim of not being interested in him is not a mode of living in denial so that you won't feel letdown if nothing comes of this?</p>
              <p>Either way, I suppose you'd get a better idea of where this is heading if you could be certain of your romantic interest (or lack of) in him.</p>
              <p>Good luck!</p>

              <p>so recently a guy asked me out. we went out 2 times. i barely know him because hes a friend’s friend, and one fine day, after making sure i was single, he just asked me to go for a movie, so i did.</p>
              <p>the first time was kinda weird cuz we didnt really know each other and there wasnt alot to talk about. but the second was better. hes funny and gentlemanly, and hes starting to make me feel comfortable ard him. he would occasionally msg me to ask me how my day was, what i was doing, or whether i was interested to catch a movie and stuff. or just to tell me what he was doing.</p>
              <p>the other day he told me that he feels only really happy hanging out with me.</p>
              <p>so is he interested in me?</p>

              when he asked me if i felt weird about going out with him. i told him i was okay, cuz i didnt know how to say no. and i really didnt mind going for a movie with a friend. so since my other friends wanted to catch that movie too, i asked them along. but he didnt turn up cuz he had something on. 
              
              then after that he wanted to make up for it. so he asked me out again. my friends were not in singapore, so i went alone.
