            <div class='col-md body'>hey astrogirl,<br><br>the main point here is that u were the first to fall for him. something must have told u that maybe he's not that suitable, that's why ur "like" for him faded.<br><br>also it could also be a defence mechanism that you have sub-consciously put up, where once u start falling for a guy, u immediately stop urself, because of previous heartaches.<br><br>if he is a patient guy, then if u would just talk to him about ur uncertainties and see how things go. if u're afraid that by telling him all ur apprehension he might "leave" you then you're not really being fair to the both of you. at least let him know where u stand and then he can take it from there, depending on how much he really cares for u and whether he's patient enuff to wait till the uncertainty passes. of course he'll also have to know that there are no gaurantees that u and him will end up together.<br><br>how honest have u been with him about how u feel?</div>
