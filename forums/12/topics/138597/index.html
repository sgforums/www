            <div class='col-md body'>For your housing loan, I would advise against taking loans from banks. Just take it up from HDB is a better bet. The reason being, at the end of the day, if you can't repay the housing loan, HDB won't mortaged your flat away (they just wait patiently for you to clear up your debts), unlike banks which they do.<br><br>Hope that helps!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm why not just live simply?<br><br>We got a 3 room HDB flat. After downpayment, every month we pay about $200+++ each from CPF cos we took the longest lease plan. Before we paid the downpayment, we put aside an amount of money in our CPF for rainy days (in case lose job, watever) so that for at least 1-2 years, if ONE of us lose our job, can 'tahan' a bit for some time. THink up to now I feel its the best decision we made. We don't NEED a fancy house but we need the mobility. Kids won't come till a few years later, a smaller house means less housework.<br><br>Phase out your appliance buying and renovation. Buy ONLY the most impt ones first make sure a few months in between each phases. And no matter how much you KNOW you want that plasma television, don't buy it until you are COMFORTABLE.<br><br>I don't see the point of starting life together desperately in debt. You should be spending time with each other, not slaving your life away trying to 'build' the perfect and ideal lifestyle.</div>
