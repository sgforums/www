              <p>What will you do when you buy food for colleagues and she refuse to pay?</p>
              <p>In the diplomatic way, I told her the amount she owed.    She did not pay.    I gave her a few weeks' grace.   Few weeks later,  she bought food for me and asked me to pay her money.    I ceased the opportunity to tell her make it a contra, so we need not pay each other.    She was annoyed I did not pay her and made noise that she did not know she owe me money, in her own way she contemplated to make me feel I am a problem.</p>
              <p>Several days later, she purposely left me out.    There was once she tricked me that she will buy food for me and came back only to tell me a packet of duck rice was too heavy for her to carry.    For her size, big and fat i doubt she has problem with it.  </p>
              <p>She will try her best not to buy food herself but always ask people to buy for her.    <span style="line-height: 1.231;"> </span><span style="line-height: 1.231;">I do notice she does not like to move around much, she prefers to be sitted around most of the time.   Her top favourite is sit down and eat even when working.    </span></p>
              <p>Later, I have other colleagues telling me she also did not pay them when they buy food for her.    But when the boss buys food for us she pays her immediately.</p>
              <p>Last week, she knew I was going to buy food and she tactfully guarded near the entrance and told me to buy food for her and I refuse.   She took her sweet revenge on me later. </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>================</p>
              <p>I told her victims that I will not mind to let her eat for free if I am a millionaire.   My colleague told me it is not about money it has to do with one's principle.    When she asks people to buy food for her she has to pay.    My other colleague said we did not tell her we are giving her a treat so she should know she has to pay for it.</p>

              <p>No.</p>
              <p>Basically, she admits the parents pamper her very much.  She was so proud to boast she does not need to do housework and all expenses at home she is not paying all paid by her parents.  Her boyfriend also complains she is too pampered and does not think for others.</p>
              <p>I suppose she expects the same treatment from us tat is we pay for her everything when she is out working.</p>

              <p>She is super ambitious and wants to be second to the boss that
              is why she is so sore with the colleague who is second to the boss.
                 I happen to be working very closely to the colleague
              before and she is using me to get info about this colleague.

              <p>I did tell her off that day when she tried to make me feel bad.  I told her off I was back before 2 pm and it was still lunch time and she was a little taken aback.   She tries her best to thumb me down.   She is too full of nonsense but not good in her work.    She will always find ways to skive in order to eat.     Fat and big !</p>

              such bad colleagues exist everywhere because of bad bosses who are either really blind to see the truth or chose to be blind (ignore)...
              
              if no one can do anything to her, just gotta wait for heaven to teach her a lesson (she will get her just retribution in a way or another one day)....but sometimes seems that these people don;t get their just desserts also...don;t know why....maybe in their next life or next generation...
              
              actually these people are very pathetic because deep down, these people are very insecure, that is why they chose to put up a brave front (in terms of acting like a bully) so that they create a shield for themselves to protect themselves....
              
              sorry i don't have concrete solutions to suggest, hope SJS won't ask me to buck off from the discussion here.

              and all expenses at home she is not paying all paid by her parents.
