            <div class='col-md body'>It seems really ridiculous but i always develop that special feeling for that someone when i least expected it.why???i really dun know.now i hv fallen for a girl that's currently going thru a terrible stage in her relationship.when i told her my feeling last nite,she was kind of shock.<br>I told her i was not expecting anything by telling her how i felt.i juz want to be fair to me and her.it's really not a gd feeling hiding ur emotion.<br>I know that it may take a while b4 she settle her problem.i told her i will wait.but deep inside my heart,i hv this feeling that she will reject me.i hate to say this but my instinct is abt 90% correct most of the time.i hope this time round,it will be the other 10%.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Birdbird,<br><br>Well you didn't do the wrong thing. To me, if i was you, i will also let the girl i love know of my special feeling. Of cos, i wun push her, but instead, wait for her to accept me slowly.<br><br>At least it will make you feel better, then to keep it deep down inside. Also, its a form of respect to her also i believe. What will fail will eventually fail, and what will come yr way will.......so at the meantime, do yr best lor, treat her well etc. I am sure one day yr effort will paid off, and even if it doesn't, i am sure u will have no regrets.<br><br>All the best~!!!<br><br>------------------<br>nOthiNg iS ImpOsSibLE In tHiS wOrLd<br>EvEn tHe wOrD ImPoSsiBLe SaYs "i'M pOsSiBLe"</div>

Correct me if I m wrong, the way she often talk abt her r/s created a feeling in you that you thought she's trying to imply you that she have once a feeling for you, <strong>BUT </strong> on the other hand, she maybe just needs a guy friend to listen to her troubles.<br><br>If she really have feelings for you, well good enough, you hv showed it out and she knows abt it. Let time takes it course. Good Luck.<br><br>------------------<br>"A relationship is like a rose,<br>How long it lasts, no one knows;<br>Love can erase an awful past,<br>Love can be yours, you'll see at last;<br>To feel that love, it makes you sigh,<br>To have it leave, you'd rather die;<br>You hope you've found that special rose,<br>'Cause you love and care for the one you chose."</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i'm now still waiting for her call but i'm not expecting anything.whatever the outcome,i will definitely still treat her as my friend.as what sad soul mention,she did tell me abt her relationship problem but it never created any feeling in me that she might be implying something.it's only when i went oversea that i started to realise something is not right with me.initially i try very hard to deny it but i guess it's no use lying to yourself.</div>
