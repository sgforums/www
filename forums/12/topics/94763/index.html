Ahhhhh. i kept missing her .. sigh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote>as i ve mentioned, it will be very very TOUGH...for u n for her as well to be together.<br>How old are both of u?<br><br>if u want to be with her...then u ve to take whatever COME with it, e.g. fustrating all the time for nt being able to communicate so often n a lot other restrictions, obstacles n difficulties that most normal relationship wld nt face.<br><br>COMMUNICATION is one of the most IMPORTANT elements when u start a relationship, or actually in a relationship all the time...Without MUCH communication, u can't get to know each other more and to build the feelings, eventually the bonding....<br><br>as i have said also, on the another hand, the emotion involved MAY nt be that DEEP afterall. The ties are lesser. Based on that, if u want to end it early, ask u urself wld u regret nw n down the road?<br><br>You have to make a decision. Know its definitely tough to decide now, but u ve to do this on your own.<br><br>I have gone thru what u are going thru now. I have heard countless advices n comments frm many ppl. But I made my own decision in the end n am now happily together with my present gf. Of cuz, after going thru many hard times... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
