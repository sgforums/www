I like her a lot and spending time with her and she feels the same too.

I've been thinking about this and I think I should wait. I've kinda mentioned this in passing to her too. This seems to be the most feasible option right now but at the back of my mind there is this lingering thought that I could just get together with her for now and see how it goes.

I've only known her for the past few weeks, and I agree with you.  I think it would be difficult for a long distance relationship, and especially if it were to <span style="font-style: italic;">start</span> with the long distance.  I think I'll leave the relationship as friends for now, and leave the options open till we are back in singapore i guess.
