JC is all about books, whereas poly is more of a hands on but ITE has the most hands on experience among all 3. after A lvls go uni then uni fail ho say liao, remain with A lvls cert or retake uni, time wasted. wana come out find job also hard cos A lvl nia. The work society brand A lvls as only know theory duno practical. Straight and think like a blockhead which is not flexible. Poly student go uni even if they fail they still have a diploma cert to support them in the working society cos more company rather employ a dip holder than an A lvl cert holder.<br><br>even if u pass uni as a jc student, like what i say u guys are all theory no practical. ask u all do hands on nia scared this scared that macham machine will eat u up like dat. really bunch of pussified snobs.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is easy to say that the most important thing is that we love each other and happy together but have you ask yourself what is needed to make you happy and what is needed to stay together?  Money! Its not about materialistic but rather REALISTIC.<br><br>Like it or not, education does affect one's level of income.  Better education will give you better job.  Better job give you better income.  Better job also give you better time management and time for each other.<br><br>On Sunday afternoon, at Orchard Road, would you rather be the one doing shopping with your family or the one looking after the shop to serve customers?  If you don't have much of education, which one will you be?<br><br>I was working in the bookstore a few years ago and once I was working on Sunday afternoon, suddenly I felt this pain and sadness when I see a family with all their children reading and playing together.  I told myself that what I want to do on Sunday afternoon, spending time with my family rather than working like a dog.  I moved on to an office job less than 3 months later. Was I able to move on easily back then without my education?  I don't think so.<br><br>Your parents is concern that one day you will end up marrying your bf whether is planned or by accident and they worried that you will suffer in the future.  They are parents, its their job to worry about your future.<br><br>Whatever decision you make, its yours.  Nobody can take it away from you but you have to bear the consequences.  Take care.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi threadstarter! First of all, I know it's kind of a dilemma when parents step into your private life. It's good that you are not affected much by his educational status. Your mom is wrong to judge people like that but it is always the case here in SG. People always tend to judge by the educational status. But in any case, you are her daughter and she only has your best interests at heart. You should have a good heart to heart talk with your BF. And also have one with your mom.</div>
