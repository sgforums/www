I'm sure your mom is thinking of your future, try to step in her shoes. If you really can SEE a FUTURE with this guy you love, then go ahead. Bottomline, just talk to your mom about it, since you're in poly... i assume you're probably too young to talk about marriage yet? lolx..</div>

Get more friends, go out with more friends. It's sensible and has nothing to do with how much you love that person or not.</div>
