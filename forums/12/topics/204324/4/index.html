Regardless of whether a person is a ITE drop out or a university grad, regardless of whether a person is changing tyres OR a manager - what's important is what does he really want to do with his time, present and future?<br><br>I know in your position, I won't split up with a guy becos of what my parents say. Which is why i gave my parents DAMN a lot of headache. For a long time I thought my parents were snobs who could not accept ITE  folks(I was dating one when I went to uni), of course then I didnt give a damn but the rship didnt work out. However I was very concerned that they would disapprove of the man I eventually married (he also graduated from ITE)... yet, when they met him, they liked him a lot, and supported my decision.<br><br>That's when I realised that perhaps it was something ELSE they felt but did not know how to explain their discomfort - and ended up griping abt certs and all - because that is a lot more solid than griping abt character/first impressions and all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Don't think it is an education level problem, it is very common hearing ppl give this comment, other than age, income and background. The real worry for parents is yr future. Considering too much doesn't really help, as there are alot of issue involve in building a relationship. Infact, in real life the major reasons for a r/s breakdown are incompatible and they don't really know how to handle a relationship, and it involve handling of money, family planning, personal emotion and other risk factor.<br><br>Having a good cert is a good start, but when come to love it can be blind. He/she can be IQ 100%, but come to EQ it's a big qusetion mark. One thing is when you are in a relationship, other ppl can see yr problem more clearly than you did. They can be wrong but a comment given is normally good to take into consideration.</div>
