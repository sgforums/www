            <div class='col-md body'>Thank you everyone! I've had some time to think this through and talk to some of my friends. And I've realized that I somehow misled myself to think I was in love with her because I had been feeling kinda lonely lately, and we had been spending more time going out as friends.<br><br>But yeah, this isn't the love that I felt with other girls before (which is prob why I got confused too). And part of it is also because I guess I'm feeling a little desperate and lonely these days.  Seems like everyone i know is getting married, engaged or attached heheh  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Anyway, i know there really isn't a point in being desperate, but i guess its just a passing phase (with all that many weddings i've been to this year).  I'll just wait around and be on the look out for that special someone  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br>But anyway, thanks to everyone for being so eager to advise! Have a Happy New Year! Time to party the year away and usher in the new year!!</div>
