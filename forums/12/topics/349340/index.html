              <p>anyway, don't say that the flame is dying so you are going to end the r/s. I once heard someone said that a r/s is bound to have less passion after  sometime but its up to us to rekindle the flame.</p>
              <p>An old r/s is like a glass of plain water. Tasteless but you just cant live without it. Don't blow it dude. Take one more good look at her. Think of why she attracted you in the first place.</p>

              <p>after such a long relationship, sometime you have taken each other for granted. So it's time for you to find the spark to light up your relationship again.</p>
              <p>That is if you still feel for her but not because of responsibility. Sometime, it may be marriage or parenthood that is the spark. It is for you to find out</p>

              <p>Well... Personally, i can't readily give you a definative advise because... There are many factors that you haven't mentioned. And i don't know both of you first-hand.</p>
              <p>So rather then giving reckless advises to you i'd rather you read a post off my blog. Its an anology i came up with. Though its rather long... This is something concerning your life... So... You can't really complain can you.?<br><br>http://itsjustnc.blogspot.com/2008/12/chocolate-bars.html<br><br>It should be able to help you make your next move. Hope this helps.

              <p>well... give it 2 years.. something major at least is gonna happen ma. lol..actually i hope nothing major happens. But true like u said, something major happens n pulling it off together definately will prove the strength of the r.s .</p>
              <p>I just saying at least.. not necessary have to get married, but if considering marriage.  cause its moving up to a more commited relationship.</p>

              <p>How to ? your heart must have the desire first or passion in it ,,, does it means those of you, you married are not the ones you love most ann , how do find the spark again , my heart died 3 years ago , i do not know why , during the 1st two years it wasnt like that , i was so happy with her then , now i only feel is an obligation i am angry with myself and i really dun want to hurt her , as i just marry her to fulfil my responsibilty , can someone share his /her experiences ,,, i do not want to make a mistake it may be painful to part with her and it may be more painful for both of us if we were to get marry</p>
              <p>Some of my friend broke us with their ex as they said they said lost the feeling , i am very sad that i am in this situation ,,, i was thinking i may stay single for the rest of my life but this may be a better thing because i really do not want to hurt her and destroy her future happiness which i may not be able to provide</p>

              <p>sometimes i think it depends on ur perception to the rs...some couples can jus be together as couples, somehow with the marriaged instilled, they get divorced..yet when they stay as couples, they r ever so loving..</p>
              <p>mayb ur love faded coz u waited too long to settle down..but den again, to marry due to pressure is so nono...better end it now den after u get married.</p>

              <p> if you get bored with people just after a few years... i guess marriage isn't for you because even you have found a new girl... perhaps after a few more years you will get bored and lose interest in the r/s again...</p>
              <p>But frankly speaking, how to me in honeymoon mode all the time??! Things do fade....eventually</p>

              <p>yeh bro, maybe marriage just isnt for you? You looking for a new pussy all the time? (no pun intended) If you are, better not get married.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You know..... u look at our grandfathers and grandmothers, their marriages were arranged and they lived with each other till old.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Your heart died 3 years ago....if u ask any long time married couple, they will tell u their r/s are like brother and sister....a loving and having sexual relations one, that is if u know what i mean.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If u really feel u cannot do it, then just break her off. But u may regret as i can alrdy feel u do in your post. And then when u r off with another girl, u may feel ur ex's the best. Those are all possibilities and guess what, you've got a triangle to deal with by then.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Then again, if ur just horny and getting tired of a woman after 3 mere years, then just stay single and screw the hell of ur lifetime. Dun even talk about 30 years bro.</p>
