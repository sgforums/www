              <p>A little self introduction here. I'm Secondary 4 this year, I think I've been a good student so far. By good student, I don't mean all A1s for my exams or always handing up my homework on time. I mean behaviour wise, I've never broken any school rule or law. Basically, my school's DM did not know I exist untill Secondary 3, when he became my English teacher. While I was still in Sec 3, I was playing my computer games till late at night a lot, so I was always late for school. I was late for more than 20 times in that whole year. There was no punishment for coming late, so many students were late every day(I am not the worst). Soon, the DM came up with a new punishment. All students have to write an essay of about 350 words on a random topic that changes everyday before going back to class. My class has a few late comers that are considered obedient but are late very frequently, so even though my class is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NOT</span> in terms of late coming nor are we the most defiant/naughty class, my DM said whenever a person from my class is late, the word words required for the essay would be 500-900 for NA and Express students. NT would only need to write 250 no matter what(they are the class with the MOST late coming if I'm not wrong). And in class, if you are late for the day, he would use sacarsm to joke about you in an effort to make a joke for the class. I don't think he means to insult the student, but all I can say is he tries very hard to make jokes but fails all the time.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So this year, I've improved a lot. I don't come late that frequently any more. On a school tie day, I forgot to bring my tie. There were about 4 classes with students who did not bring ties, but he only punished 3 including mine. Why? Because he does not check class by class. The rule is that studentswho did not bring his or her tie has to wear the tie for a week, but he wanted to piss the students off by saying that the whole class has to wear the tie. Because of this, I've gathered some hate from my classmates. Luckily, I have supportive friends. Then on last week, I was late once, and I was not the only one who was late. There were students from a total of 8 different classes from different levels. But because he knows me, he said that my whole class would have to wear the tie next week, just because I am late. I ignoroed him and tried to not show any emotions. I took out my paper and started writing my essay.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm not sure why he is doing this, but I am sure that this is a fom of biasedness, or even discrimination. I need someone to tell me whether this is right or not, and it must be from a reliable source.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Thanks for reading/helping.</p>
