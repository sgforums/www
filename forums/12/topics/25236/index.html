Jesus will descend like the second coming described in the Bible at the end of the world. The one who saves their(Muslims) soul is their own faith between God, not somebody else.<br><br><strong>So are the followers of Christians blinded and following a murderer ?</strong><br>Not a murderer.

            <div class='col-md body'>Below passage were taken fm Sura 4:157-158<br>'We killed Christ Jesus the son of Mary, the Apostle of God', but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but so it was made to appear to them, and those who differ therein are full of doubts with no certain knowledge, but only conjecture to follow. For a surety they killed him not: Nay, God raised him up unto Himself, and God is Exalted in Power, Wise.<br><br>These words are spoken in response to a boast of the Jews that they had killed Jesus Christ. The Quran, however, denies either that Christ was crucified or that He was killed although it's explanation appears somewhat ambiguous. 'but so it was made to appear to them' ....  some orthodox Islam interpreted as such.... God has made someone else looks like Jesus and that this person was crucified instead. 'this person'... some Islam writers and traditionist suggested it could be Judas Iscariot???? (loophole here! unsolved difficulties - the misrepresentation by God and the execution of an innocent victim.) 'God raised him up unto Himself'  are taken to mean that Jesus was raised alive to heaven without dying.<br><br>Questions:<br>1. if God chose to raise Jesus to heaven, why was it necessary for Him to satisfy the Jews by victimizing an innocent bystander? What's their purpose?<br>2. Substitution: What kind of character does God portray? Fraudulent and no love for an innocent bystander.<br><br>Why Islam believe in Jihad?<br>Islam teaches that on the Day of Judgement one's good and evil deeds will be weighed on a scale. Good works are heavy and evil deeds are light. Thus the person whose balances are heavy with good deeds will go to heaven, while the person whose scales are light will go to hell.<br>The Muslim assumes that his chances for heaven are good if he:<br>1. accepts the Muslim God Allah and his apostle Mohammad<br>(contradict to Christian's belief - persecution unavoidable)<br>2. does good works and all that is required of him by Allah<br>3. predestined to Allah's favor, choice of mercy (coz there is no<br>substitutionary atonement for forgiveness of sins)<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>
