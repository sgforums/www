              <p>My husband has been working for DHL for seven years. He is a very hard-working employee who hardly falls sick and apply leave unnecessarily. As the government encourages singaporeans to have more children, we supported their program and now we have 3 kids age ranging from 6 years old to 5 months old. A couple of weeks ago, my youngest child fall sick and my husband had to take urgent leave. His boss was unhappy with him for taking urgent leave. He even told my husband that since i'm not working, i should be able to handle my 3 kids alone. From my point of view, when my child is healthy, it wouldn't be a problem for me to take care of them single-handedly, but when they fall sick, i really need my husband help and support. Is he really not entitled to all the perks such as child sick leave when we have proof of our child being warded. Or is it because DHL is a private company so singapore government policies don't apply. Is this fair ? please enlighten us on what we should do. thank you.</p>

              <p>Your boss is either a empty nester for a long time or no child in his marriage. Abviously a total control freak. You stay at home or not it's not his business to know and not his business to dictate leave based on your family situation.</p>
              <p>Work for a boss who is also a parent and you will not likely have this problem. They tend to be more understanding to family issues/emergencies.</p>
              <p>Some boss likes to throw their weight around.. even when your employment contract includes paternity leave.. they can make life difficult for you later , if you insist on taking the leave when he refused to budge.</p>
              <p>Send a note to HR and have this documented, just in case.</p>

              <p>TS, bear this in mind. It is the employers world. Business doesnt care a damn on employees so long as the company makes profits. True that GM, CEO, COO wants teamwork or cooperation o more interaction among the staff, the root of problems usually lies with the department manager behaviour approach.</p>
              <p>They are the one who makes the staff suffer, cannot take mc, cannot take urgent leave, cannot take half day leave, cannot clam ot this and that. And yet, he and his apple are able to.</p>
              <p>That is the real world. Face it and move on TS.</p>
              <p>I am sorry to hear your plight. I am sure many pple out there are facing the same problems as you.</p>

              <p><br>Huh, woei! sista, I am a boss ok, so you calling me axxhole ar?? Not all bosses are axxhole, me very good to my subordinates one, if family got problem, not say urgent leave, i personally send them home or go hospital with them. Cos I believe a caring employer bring about good employees.</p>
              <p>Along the lines, some of these line management are promoted from the rank and file, soft courses will not change their way of managing, it is therefore important for bosses to promote the correct people, and usually they promote the one who carried him, can get job done but very weak in leadership. Technical skill does not imply that you are good in leadership skill, unfortuntely, in most organisation i been thru, they feel to identify the right person with true leadership skill, end up getting a person good in technical work to be leader/manager instead of making him a enginneer or special skill worker which suit him perfectly.</p>
