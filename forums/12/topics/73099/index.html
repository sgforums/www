There are couples who have been together for long and still as loving - because their relationship undergo constant flutuation of events, sharing of inner emotional feelings and blending of lifestyle in reality.<br><br>Woman in love are generally 'cumulative upkeep' while man are declining version. Man, being hunter, will slack the minute they felt their goal being achieved. Security is there, stability is there - so what else is there to work for the relationship? Everything seemed to be so well organised and in place. You must make your man feel that his goal have not yet achieve - there are more things to be done in a relationship than before having one.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I) Explore alternative mutual lifestyle. New surprise, new environment, new stuff to do will trigger new possible interest and could give new reason why this relationship should continue to go on, instead of riding on the waves.<br><br>II) A soul talk. Man, generally, will not know what is happening in their relationship unless their partners tell them. A huge percentage of man who lost their relationship never knew what actually happened/contribute to the eventual downfall of their love <strong>until they lost them</strong>. Let him know and work out a good agreement with each other. Nothing is more loving than a partner who's willing to work out a good path for the harmony of the relationship.<br><br>Cheers</div>
