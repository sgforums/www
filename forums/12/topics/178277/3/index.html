            <div class='col-md body'>Starpuppy I know how you feel I was in the situation last year. While all my friends got 14 and 15 points, I got a D7 for my English and ended up with 22 points. I was so sad. I now only could get into all the lousy courses. But i had worked so hard for my emaths and gotten from an F9 student (i was the worst student in my class) to a B3 for my o levels and I did not want all my efforts to go a waste just because of my stupid English. So I decided to retake even though my parents did not want me to. Besides English I had to retake another subject. It was either biology or combine humanities (I got C6 for both this subjects) but I hated this two subjects to the core and I knew I was not going to do well if I retook them. So I did some research and found out that most students found the subject Principles of Accounts a very easy subject and could score high grades (I also wanted to get into the accounting course really badly) so I went under the odds and took this two subjects. Many people thought I had got mad for taking a whole new subject which needed 2 years of study and now I got only about 7 months to study. But I did not give up I asked my mother to arrange for me private home tuitions for both the subject (it caused her $400 per month but my mother said she would not mine as long as I study) so I stay  at home and studied unlike in school I now had plenty of time to study .I studied in  from 8am to 4pm (when no what was at home) then I played.<br>I did the TYS and asked help from my cousin and make sure I knew everything there was to know about POA.<br><br>And now<br>English D7 to B3<br>POA B3 (with just seven months of study)<br>From 22 point I got 15 points<br>From being rejected from the accounting course I am now probably going to be the first few whoÂ’s going to get in).<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My advice is repeat the subjects you fail as private candidate. I retook maths and science and art (additional sub since i too free) + i still had spare time to work part time. Now my L1R4 good enough to get into business course in TP and i'm awaiting my posting letter  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> plus i got loads of cash to spend from all my part-timing.<br><br>I had the choice to do higher nitec and several poly courses but i chose to repeat cos i don't want my Os cert to look like crap.

            <div class='col-md body'>ya a lot of ah lians.<br>guys go there to sian char bors only.<br><br>firstly, I think what was mentioned above is quite untrue. In my studies in Uni, I did meet a gal who was in bishan ITE, who studies till she became my course mate. so I know for a fact, there are guys &amp; gals in ITE that really want to do something.<br><br>now Starpuppy,<br>1) what society offers is not a good answer. If you notices, the trend moves ever so often, before it was IT, then it was electronics, then now it is life-science.<br>How you know what you doing is what society wants when you come to work? Answer, you won't cause no-one can know the future. So, you have to do something you like cause with that interest, then you can find something you willing to explore in the field that you like.<br><br>2) ITE does have mechanical engineering. why not give it a try? hey, it may fit you like a duck to water.<br><br>I don't want to sound negative, but nothing in what you posts tell me that you want to study for yourself, and nothing tells me yet, why you want to study.<br><br>To re-do, means you need to have real mental stamina to do it. you do know that you are using one year of your time and this time won't come back to you. By re-do means, you will have to either study at your school, take private   (study on your own) or etc, it will means a lot of self-motivation.<br>If your family allows, do arrange for private tutions, at the very least, it ensures you are on the right path.<br><br>And finally, the ugly truth, if you re-do, and don't do well, it will means going into army late, coming into society late, and finding out your salary may never match your peers. Time is really precious, I do hope readers to this topics really treasure their youth.<br><br>Look at the colourful postings in this topics, who can give you THE answer? One year later, you make it, or you don't, you still have to face up to only yourself, not to your family, friends or even people in this forum.<br><br>so think hard, it is your own future you are molding, make a good choice, and i wish you success. I have walked these roads before so I know.<br><br></div>
