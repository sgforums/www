I didn't study again and fail all the theory subjects again.. Lucky for me, i manage to pass my english and attain a place in the poly..<br><br>but if think back, i wasted time and money.. time is around 1 year+ cause u have to wait again for the release of the O's results..<br><br>my advise for u, if u're retaking urs O's, please take it seriously.. or ITE isn't a bad choice too.. i have frens studying in poly from ITE.. They have good practical skills..<br><br>the choice is urs..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Many of my ex classmates went into ITE and also retake maths.  But end up quite a number of them were not confident enough to retake maths, and so they stay put in ITE.  And also, they have found new frens and happy with what they were learning...some got very good results in ITE tho not in O level.<br><br>U might want to consider retaking English coz I believe u can do better.  Retake Maths and put in more effort in it.  Why drop chinese?  It's a stupid thing to do.  Chinese is so easy to score.  I dun encourage u to retake Humaninites tho.. it's very dry.  I retake History also, and got worse results. haha.. but i passed both times anyway.<br><br>In short, go into ITE and retake ur O levels (few subjects).  Like that u wun be wasting time.  If u happen to score well for ur private O, then good, u can quit ite and go into poly.  One ex classmate did that.  he was the only one who passed maths and got into Singapore Poly months after studying in ITE with us. ITE HNITEC is only 2 years, depening on wat course u choose.  Instead of wasting ur time retaking O level again (touch wood* and again..) why not spend ur time wisely and learn something useful?<br><br>I was not smart enough to enrol into ITE earlier, wasted one yr.<br><br>I can help u with ur chinese if u want.  A few of my sec sch classmates got A after going thru peer-tutoring with me.  </span></div>
