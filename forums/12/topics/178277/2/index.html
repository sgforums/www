Its a better way to go.. or you can go on from ite to poly lo... but its gonna be long la... there are many choices la actually.. but the choices sucks la.... yeah so... its up to you la...</div></blockquote>Millenia Institute will give you probational entry and let you retake your math in the meantime. I am not sure about the current policy but I believe if you appeal the teachers - HODs in particular may sympathize. The principal isn't too bad so you can attempt talking to her too. MI will equip you with skills that you would not regret having.<br><br>At the same time, do realize that going to MI does not give you a sureroute to uni. That said, education is never wasted. Realize that the percentage of MI-ians who make it to uni are not as high as they would like it to be. A lot of MI-ians (save for some) will later enrol in SIM. MI's strength is in Literature and General Paper. I'm not terribly sure about the sciences but that requires hard work. MI is strong in economics as well.<br><br>If you play any sport well, hockey in particular, MI is likely to want to take you in. Do not despair. Look to your CCAs and see if that can help you in anyway. All in all, I think MI is worth a try. All the best!</div>
