While all my friends got 14 and 15 points, I got a D7 for my English and ended up with 22 points. I was so sad. I now only could get into all the lousy courses. But i had worked so hard for my emaths and gotten from an F9 student (i was the worst student in my class) to a B3 for my o levels and I did not want all my efforts to go a waste just because of my stupid English. So I decided to retake even though my parents did not want me to. Besides English I had to retake another subject. It was either biology or combine humanities (I got C6 for both this subjects) but I hated this two subjects to the core and I knew I was not going to do well if I retook them. So I did some research and found out that most students found the subject Principles of Accounts a very easy subject and could score high grades (I also wanted to get into the accounting course really badly) so I went under the odds and took this two subjects. Many people thought I had got mad for taking a whole new subject which needed 2 years of study and now I got only about 7 months to study. But I did not give up I asked my mother to arrange for me private home tuitions for both the subject (it caused her $400 per month but my mother said she would not mine as long as I study) so I stay  at home and studied unlike in school I now had plenty of time to study .I studied in  from 8am to 4pm (when no what was at home) then I played.<br>I did the TYS and asked help from my cousin and make sure I knew everything there was to know about POA.<br><br>And now<br>English D7 to B3<br>POA B3 (with just seven months of study)<br>From 22 point I got 15 points<br>From being rejected from the accounting course I am now probably going to be the first few whoÂ’s going to get in).<br></div></blockquote>how did you study for english ?</div>
