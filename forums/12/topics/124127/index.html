            <div class='col-md body'>I join a company together with a fellow co-worker last august.<br>It was a total new experience but never the less, we manage to learn quite fast within a span of 3 months.<br>Our in-charge was a female supervisor who had been working in this company for 4 years alone.<br>In the begining, she taught what was necessary for daily business.<br>She would take long annual leave from time to time.<br>But when she is away, there are always bound of have something screwed up.<br>Things that she hasn't taught us, we took our own initative to find out how to manage the problem.<br>When she came back from her vacation, she would always scold and nag at why we did this and that.<br>She would also e-mail behide our backs to the upper management regarding what happened and made it look like its isn't her fault.<br>She never taught us what to do and we did it with our own initative but in the end, there was no appreciation.<br>During working hours, she told us that no personal work or calls can be entertain.<br>She is also hiring new supervisors too but she can't transfer out due to some complications.<br>Now days, she is being very bo chap about her work and just throws it on us.<br>But on the other hand, she would do all that she said couldn't in front of us.<br>When she throws a lot of work at us while we still have to manage our daily tasks... and when a customer walks in, all she would say is "Good Afternoon" and that is our cue to go and attend to the customer while she sits there and shake legs.<br>Anyway, not much can be done because upper management would believe her over new staffs.<br>Sigh...<br>Now we are under a one year contract term and we found out that the company is hiring new staff but we don't know if it is to take over us.<br>Feel damn sad...</div>

IF you can be positive, you will find you have a long to gain in future.  That this woman as a test on your patience...   Like what they say, what could be worst, lost the job..  Not happy you leave, also got no job, so stay to learn, stay to be strong.. don't let her win by quitting....  I was in your shoe...  I stay on in the company for 13 years.  The experience I gain, give me lots of opportunity.  The new boss recognised it and I was up into management level in less than 3 years ...<br><br>I wish you luck..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
