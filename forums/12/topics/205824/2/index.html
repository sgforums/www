It doesn't mean we eliminate consideration and avoid taking calculated risk just because we won't know.<br><br>P.S: Our love life doesn't have a destination. In fact, the destination depends on the route we opt to take. If we could turn back time and pick another choice, everything else will change and we see ourselves in new 'destination/s'.<br><br>If we have to meet a few 'Mr/Ms Wrong' before a 'Mr/Ms Right' - being part of the equation, shouldn't the 'wrong' be 'right' because eventually, we still believe that it does lead us to our 'Mr/Ms Right', isn't it? (Like mathematics, the solution lies not just merely in the answer, but also the component/s of our working steps before we derive the eventual answer). <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers    [/b]</blockquote>cannot deny more  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>there always no wrong in any relationships : only till u step into it ,even though can be in the case of Romeo n Juliet scenario where u just met &gt;&gt; it doesnt  mean there is  RIGHT relationship when both know each other well n even close friends ( have seen cases gd friends breakup )<br><br>Share some personal anedotes &gt;&gt; u like someone becos there's something special &gt;&gt; that ur attracted to him/her  which  is different from being friends &gt;&gt; then u want to take to next level of relationship when u can share with ur love  all things but please do not take relationships as a game ...<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
