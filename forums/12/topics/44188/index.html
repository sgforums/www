Three years gone. *haiz*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>Anyway, about your problem. What u are facing now is LDFs or Long Distance Friendships. LDFs are very hard. I will tell you that right off the top,often they don't work. First, you have to decide if you want to make it work because if you're with him out of pity or because you're afraid to tell him then you're not doing either of yourselves any good. Everyone's life is like moving through a fog without destination,you never know where your going or how you're going or where you'll end up. You have to have a plan on where you'll end up. Look at it as the lighthouse in the fog, you still have the fog albeit the uncertainty of the future but now you have a goal to shoot for. Now you have direction because you're following the light house. Stupid story hor  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Now that you've got direction you need to figure out ways to bridge the gap. Maybe go visiting him if u got the money and time <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>The key to making sure you survive is to stay busy and not to neglect your on-going life. As long as you continue to hang out with friends, attend family functions, play games or watch movie or come to sgforums <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>To keep in touch with him, write lots of letters, send him little things that make the letters extra special. Maybe some <strong>clean</strong> pictures  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> or a postcard?Like most of us. we're very lucky to be in the age of computers that we are. Email, chatting via icq or any messaging clients help us to contact anyone in the world without any hefty price.<br><br>Friendships happen naturally and you will find another really close friend but keep in touch with the friend that moved.He is miles away but you can still continue the friendship. It's all about outlooks and with a negative one you will close yourself from all the good things someone might offer you not because they didn't try but because you didn't listen and open your heart <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>IF you are a girl, I think you really have a crash on him.. and I guess likewise too, both of you lost when on line. unless both of you open out.. soon its all gone..<br><br>I used to be very close to this friend of mine, for years, we have been together thick and thin, even after we left school into wroking life and he lived just one street behind me.  ALmost everynight we chat until late, typical  1-2am and on weekend, almost into the dawn hour.<br><br>Tehn sudenly, he decided to married and leave the coutnry within few weeks... gone that's 10 years.  Initially we kept contact and talk on line, each way about 1 hour, then soon the bill mount up... soon ..the talking became lesser.. then gone.. once in a while.. but thats' not good enough.  once he came back for his brother's wedding... guess what, we had an argument over my work schedule.. as he could not find me. Manage to get him before he left, nd since then, no contact what so ever, he didn't want any disturbance, not even me...<br><br>He came back few years ago... but everything, is never the same, I suppose he had changed...although we are still in contact... its never the smae</div>
