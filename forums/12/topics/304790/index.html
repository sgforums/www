            <div class='col-md body'>If you truly treasure this relationship, you would make the effort to meet her at a place which is convenience to meet up, and beside, tampines isn't that far, if you love her, then you will take the initiative to meet her up, instead of, keep on whining it here, and beside you are only 17 at most, i doubt you have any idea what is love and sacrifice, so do yourself a favour, focus on your studies, finish your NS, then talk about love, beside right now, you are just a little kid, who can't even provide for anything, and still depends on your parents for pocket money to go on date, if you consider tampines as far, then malaysia must be wah seibez far, if you keep on having this sort of mentality, don't get a girlfriend, or you will ruin another girl life. I am sick and tired of reading all the little kid whining about, not having a girlfriend, or about their girlfriend, instead of self reflecting on themselves on what can be done, please take a good look at yourself, what can you offer to the other partner, now you are still a kid who can't even feed yourself and depends on your parents. What can you provide for your girlfriend!<br><br>I DOUBT your age can even understand what is love all about!</div>
