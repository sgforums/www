              <p>It's not very far what if you travel by train. I have a friend who, at 17, stayed in Changi but sent his gf home every day to Bishan- even stayed there with her for an hour just for the few extra minutes, thus forcing himself to catch the last train home very hurriedly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It's how much you're willing to put into the relationship- if she doesn't strike you as worthy of your travel time, then why are you even bothering dating her?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But anyway, 17 years old.. many better options out there ;D</p>

              <p>I find it so funny.. singapore is way too small, if making a trip to see ur so called love ones.. u complain so much, yes, I agree tat <strong>u both should break up....</strong>I supposed u all r too childish to quarrel abt distance.. theres nothing more to say.. no amount of love can compensate these differences.</p>
              <p>I rem always travelling to see my ex bf... u feel the anxiety of seeing him when u get there, probably, the feeling is wat we regconise as love..</p>
              <p>We broke up due to stupid issues... suspect this n that.. finally I told him, dun continue this rs since u dun trust me.. For a year after, he did so many things for me, prep breakfast for me, etc, become so awfully sweet..... but I told him, yes.. its all too late..</p>
              <p>I tripped n fall and picked myself up... tats why I found a better man for myself.....</p>
              <p>He, who trust n respect me as a whole....</p>
              <p>And he too, found another gal.... I also happy for him...</p>
              <p>Its memories tat will nv be forgotten... and it will stay in our hearts forever...</p>

              <p>i think .. if ure bothered abt it..</p>
              <p>1) make sure the times u have tgt are QUALITY time. dun waste it anyhow</p>
              <p>2) meet up more at convenient places for u two..a couple will compromise with each other if they love each other.. and yeah sg is not big..</p>
              <p>3) break up. ure still young</p>
