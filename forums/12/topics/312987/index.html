              <p>It is equally important to voice out yr opinion in work of unreasonable workload. Have u notice somebody work less and somebody work more? Being good in yr job is important but being able to voice out yr justify unhappiness is equally important in working field in balancing yr emotion and cope with stress. </p>
              <p>I know its not easy to voice out but I think u just need to take the first step of stopping this nonsense and salvaging the situation. No matter how u like yr job and or environment if u don't have a caring and thoughtful boss, u will still hate it. Slowly and unknowningly, u will lose control of the stress heap on u and u will break down! </p>

              <p>No use struggling over there when u noe precisely u can't cope with the tons of workload u have and no one's helping u..</p>
              <p>I think u need to voice out ur unhappiness to ur in-charge, and see if he responds to u. If he doesn't do anything to resolve this situation, then jolly well quit this job.</p>
              <p>U dun need to stay here just because u noe how things work here, yet u have a serious issue of time management.</p>
              <p>I was once in a company which has poor management, and there's only 4 person in my team, which means each of us has to handle a whole lot of shit work and even the manager in charge of us has to take the shitload. I dun find myself being happy working there, so I quit.</p>
              <p>If u really felt so unhappy working there, u can always change another place to work. No big deal.. Dun need to suffer so much and get suffocated..</p>
              <p>All the best yea.</p>
