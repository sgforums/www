            <div class='col-md body'>I sympathise with you, having given much but yet found none to reciprocate...<br><br>firstly, you have to understand the following:<br>1) You barely know your ex gf for a long time (I'm putting it as '<strong>ex</strong>', becoz I considered it a as past r/s, anything good that comes outta it in future will be a brand new r/s to start with.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> )<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> it means, she may find that you're not exactly the one she's looking for after having spend some time with you. When she agreed to go into a r/s with you, she could be doing it bcoz she finds it hard to reject or she did it on a moment of impulse, bcoz you are there. (Of coz it can happen to anyone else at that moment, I may be wrong though) This means. she's on the rebound after the previous r/s, thus she's diverting/transferring her affection onto you, whom she though is the right one.<br><br>2) Having said that, please bear in mind, she said she did have a 'crush' on you. Crush here means attraction of the opp sex, mostly becoz of outlook/physical appearance, etc etc, attraction that most probably will fade with time. (I may be wrong on this). When she told you she'll prefer you to be her friend after 11 days of togetherness, you should be glad she didn't drag it any further. For chances are, you'll feel more tormented and the impact will be 100 times or even 1000 times more greater.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I will consider her to be mature enough to put a stop to a r/s which she considered fruitless (probably at this moment in time, bcoz she's too confused and is not able to commit becoz you're putting in more than her). She's being frank with you by telling you not to treat her so nice and that you're putting in more effort than her. The reason she's telling you that is becoz she don't want you to be shortchanged. I bet with you not many girls can be as frank as her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>I will advise you to bid your time of coz. WHY? Simply becoz if you advance any further, you will ruin the chance of her knowing you better, and probably not allowing the friendship to grow and deepen. She may feel pressured into withdrawing away from you, by then I don't reckon you have any chance at all. As of now, it's still a 50-50 that you guys might end up together after she manage to sort out everything.<br><br>Take heart, bid for your time.
