Its a bank account, if you credit it once in a while, there is still something to debit from. If all that happens to the account is debit. Then it will empty out one day. Perhaps the account is kept around for old time sake but who knows. If its not being together, its to be apart. This world has simplified things very much.<br><br></div>
