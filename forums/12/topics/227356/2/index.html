Everyone on this planet do not simply just exist here or by accident. We all have a purpose and we have a duty to make ourselves live a life, be ALIVE.<br><br>I do not know how to handle such situation if I were in your shoes, but I know that communication is a must to clarify certain issues and problems. You are married with someone, that means you trust him with your life and secrets and everything else as he trust you the same. You are no robo maid or something. You have feelings. You have joy, fear, warmth, cold, etc, etc.<br><br>A marriage is possible because both parties decided to share their lives with each other and trust each other with their lives. If you are unable to tell him your concerns or he is not listening, I have to ask: how did you came to agree to the marriage in the first place?</div>

I was so rebelious that I wanted to disown them. Yes no kidding, i wanted to leave them. After some time and communication, it did not bore fruit but the r/s is still abit sour.<br><br>Only after the appearance of my younger brother did our r/s got better. He bridged the gap. Even though it took a long time and its still repairing as of today, I am glad my brother who was not only given life, but also the joy of our family and I thank God for that.</div>
