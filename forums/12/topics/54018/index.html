            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: darkred;">i am one person who can get a full time job anytime, yes it comes with cpf and etc etc benefits. but at the same time working in my line requires much OT, and usually it will be OT without pay. i really dowan to live that kind of life. yes i need money, and i am not earning as much as i would if i am working full time. i am now working as a freelancer designer, and for that i work a maximum of 8 hours a day.<br><br>i take instructions from people who works in the office, help out in one project, then when the proj is over i am off to find the next job.<br><br>yes there is no security in this job but for the moment i like it this way. the best thing i like about such jobs is the working hours. my designer friends from my same batch are working an average 12 hours a day, for a no big deal pay (my sucks more i know). But i get to sleep my 6-8 hours daily. my point is, why work longer, sleep less, earn more but later spend the amount on cosmetic surgery to remove eyebags, wrinkles and such.<br><br>i had a dreadful life in poly working average 15 hours per day, now that i've graduate, i can count back on the presents i recieved from studying the course.<br>1. skills<br>2. knowledge<br>3. migrain<br>4. depression and panic attacks<br>5. lack of friends<br>6. eyebags<br><br>really, what's the point?? i'e got frens who work 8 hours a day, and they live happily. and they have time to do what they want. it is not the amount of time u put into ur job that counts, it is the effort.<br><br>honestly, anytime i want i can work 12 hours, or even 15,16 hours, but after the first 8 hours i am no longer efficient in my work. so the next 8 hours i work i am only working 4 hours worth, and when i turn up for work again the next day, due to tiredness etc, i will not be able to perform my usual efficieny for the 8 working hours.<br><br>so please la, everybody, after 8,9 hours, like what honeybunz says, go home! dun stay and try to do work and create more mistakes for people to clean up later...very disgusting leh!!! </span></div>
