              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> It appears to me that you might not be emotionally ready for marriage and if you decide to go along with your plans, you might have to pay a higher ticket price for 'future changes'. Though painful as taking ownership of your choice might be, it is still far better than sweeping it under the carpet and thinking that things will just go away.</p>
              <p>Because ultimately, you just can't run away from yourself.</p>
              <p>The fear of being alone is common. However, if the relationship is led by fear and not by love, you would have a lot of self convincing to do when there is presence of 'competition' - even if you are already married by then. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="icon_exclaim.gif"></p>

              <p>You do not seem like you are ready for marriage. It seems more as though you are afraid of being alone and somehow u probably felt that getting married to this current bf solves the problem of being lonely.</p>
              <p>I believe you should first be clear whether marriage is by love and what you wanted. Stay focused on the person you are going to marry and try to see if thats really what you wanted.</p>
              <p>" I have carried a torch for Another guy for a long time. But I know he can't be with me cos of other personal reasons" If you have already carried a torch for another guy a long time, why did you still agree to marry your bf? what is going on in your mind when u agreed? I would suggest you be clear about what you want rather than to still head on to marriage with an unclear mind. Dont do your bf and yourself an injustice.</p>
              <p>Assuming that guy is able to be with you, will u be jumping ship to him? and when you are with him, if you feel the same wa again, will you search for someone and jump ship again? Problem is your confidence of being alone.</p>

              <p>Are you saying that you're only getting married (or even dating this bf) because you're afraid of being alone? I think you should break up with him because I don't think you truly love him. </p>
              <p>You really should be single for a while, enjoy singlehood and love yourself before you decide whether or not you need someone to spend the rest of your life with.</p>
