            <div class='col-md body'>i see evry one's fore leaving the guy.... but just a piece of my thoughts ... the guy had alot of free time before when u were not interested or probably had not even known him yet! now he realised that he shouldnt waste his Time and decided to focus on his carreer... but that doesnt mean he is not interested in a relationship .... and he may be busy and too involved in his work now.. but that doesnt mean he will be forever or if he gets into a relationship .... I think the most important is not whether he is workaholic but whether he likes you anot? I think we all are too focus on that (workaholic ) rather then he's feelings.... ( his feelings is wat it the most important ) you must find out or make him love you den you wont have problems le  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  just my thoughts...........</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's very likely that he isn't aware of your affection for him rather than playing dumb, considering your claim that he's a workaholic.<br><br>Drop him subtle hints and gauge his reactions towards those signs. If they're favourable, proceed onwards. If not, try something different.<br><br>The best thing you can do now is to find out his goals in Life. If marriage/a relationship are on the cards, then it's possible that you will see another side of him besides the workaholic one, after the two of you are more familar with one another.<br><br>Cheers.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Guys uses terms like workaholic, busy and other excuses to politely rejects girls that they are not interested in. You know, when a guy is interested in you, no reason in this world can stop him from accepting you. Why is that so? Cos guys definitely would want to get physical with the girls that they are interested in...to the extend of dreaming about it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>One thing for sure, he's not interested to get physical with you. I hope he is not gay...*touch wood. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>What obvious hints have you hinted to him? Maybe he wasn't paying attention to you during those times and he was probably thinking of other matters which is more important than the hints you are giving him? Some guys will think about work, but every guys will probably spent half the time during a day to think about girls...which is true to what I know of. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

I guess he just wants a "friend" without commitment, if you know what I mean. Sort of like someone he can hang out with when he has a bit of free time, but he doesn't want to commit because he has other goals he want to pursue at this particular point.<br><br>i.c.y<br><br></div>

Dun fall into his trap.<br>either u play his game -- play hard to get, be aloof, juz like he is (in this case, it is more of a test or revenge); or quit the game -- tell him that if he is not interested in a real rship, then stop calling u.<br>hope u find all these helpful.</div>
