" in an angry tone like ah long type of tone.<br><br>Guys plkease give me dvice on wat to do? Should my mother just divorce him and just leave for good?</div>

It is important to get your own place in your name, or arrange to get rid of him.<br><br>However, if things get desperate, you and your family are to not complain publically about him ever. This must be carried out for months, when the time is right, you have to get rid of him.... you get my meaning?
