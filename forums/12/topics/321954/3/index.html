              <p>Has anyone has so much dreams about a particular person that one day you woke up feeling confused and yet sure that you haven fallen in love with that person???</p>
              <p>I think it could be because we have been spending too much time together and thus the dreams? OR maybe I have been praying too often for GOD to help him?</p>
              <p>To summarise from beginning to present, he's a friend of my friend. And after hanging out one too many times, he confided in us about his struggle in his love for another girl....and cried and depressed and out of compassion and being super-nice as usual, I volunteer to fulfill his wish to help the girl on his behalf, without the girl's knowledge of course. So ..... maybe we did got closer on the friendship section, but he is definitely so not my type cos he gets emotional and weeps too easily and often...I can't stand crying guys by the way. So I ended up praying for GOD to help him everynight....to take away his pain, sadness, frustrations and worries and replace them with joy, hope, peace and love. It worked and he was also confused when he woke up and realised that somehow all his depression has went away, so I told him about my little prayer (We all need divine help), and he was quite thankful to me. And....we still hang out often as usual, maybe a little bit too often maybe? GOD knows why we still do that despite the fact I think he has already overcame his depression...maybe that's because we're closer friends now?</p>
              <p>Anyway, he's been appearing in my dreams too often and I'm confuse. So I ended up waking up with this feeling in my mind, heart, soul and body (Yes it's body, all you guys go wank off ok?) that I.....unbelievable me...might has fallen in love with this guy???</p>
              <p>Should I accept my feelings for this person or should I act indifferent and slowly pull away from him?</p>
              <p>How can I stop all these nonsense that is happening to me?</p>

              <p>Not surprising that you dream of him often even if you're not in love with him because you spend lots of time with him...? Moreover thinking of the endless possibilities of what might be or might not be between you and him... Not surprising that you often dream of him at all.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If I dream of my dad or my teacher often, does that mean I'm in love with them?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I know how the feeling's like to fall for someone.. Yet at the same time knowing most likely that it just won't work out... But nothing's absolute in this world.. Maybe one fine day he might just change.... Or you might learn to accept him as he is....? If not? Perhaps you might just have to learn the hard way...? But still, it's a learning process....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>To me personally, the worst is not to have failed.... But to have 'failed' without even giving it a try when you know ya want to.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>

              <p><br>whatever, but later dun go back to regret about it, just like why you accept it so easily without building a relationship as most do. It your life, you made the decision, but there is alway an option of rejecting, just like my granny said, if love struck, you can opt to stay at home and reject it completely or you can prepare to get burnt and electrify over it.</p>
