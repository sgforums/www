              <p>how many times have hope became something you wanted? how many times you landed in false hope?</p>

              <p>Falling in love with someone is one thing, but is the other party feeling the same for you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Many things we might not have expected nor planned in our lives, but that doesn't certainly mean that they won't turn out fine?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What is 'knowing'...? What is 'known'....? What is 'considered'....? Have you considered the fact that even if there's someone who you THINK you know, might actually turn out to be quite a different person from what ya know....? Or even the fact that someone you really know as he / she is might just change one day into someone you barely know....?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Personally I'll say.... If it has to come, it has to come.... If you purposely avoid it because you think it might not end well, how do you really know that it's gonna end better by your act of avoidance....?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you have to regret by the time your house is full of children, it probably won't matter too much if this person is already within your 'consideration' by this point.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Unless you're talking about a 'shot gun' case....</p>

              <p>Has anyone has so much dreams about a particular person that one day you woke up feeling confused and yet sure that you haven fallen in love with that person???</p>
              <p>I think it could be because we have been spending too much time together and thus the dreams? OR maybe I have been praying too often for GOD to help him?</p>
              <p>To summarise from beginning to present, he's a friend of my friend. And after hanging out one too many times, he confided in us about his struggle in his love for another girl....and cried and depressed and out of compassion and being super-nice as usual, I volunteer to fulfill his wish to help the girl on his behalf, without the girl's knowledge of course. So ..... maybe we did got closer on the friendship section, but he is definitely so not my type cos he gets emotional and weeps too easily and often...I can't stand crying guys by the way. So I ended up praying for GOD to help him everynight....to take away his pain, sadness, frustrations and worries and replace them with joy, hope, peace and love. It worked and he was also confused when he woke up and realised that somehow all his depression has went away, so I told him about my little prayer (We all need divine help), and he was quite thankful to me. And....we still hang out often as usual, maybe a little bit too often maybe? GOD knows why we still do that despite the fact I think he has already overcame his depression...maybe that's because we're closer friends now?</p>
              <p>Anyway, he's been appearing in my dreams too often and I'm confuse. So I ended up waking up with this feeling in my mind, heart, soul and body (Yes it's body, all you guys go wank off ok?) that I.....unbelievable me...might has fallen in love with this guy???</p>
              <p>Should I accept my feelings for this person or should I act indifferent and slowly pull away from him?</p>
              <p>How can I stop all these nonsense that is happening to me?</p>
