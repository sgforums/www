            <div class='col-md body'>Well, no point going head on either with your sis, since both will only result in further drift of the family.. You could try being less harsh on her as someone said, it's worth a try, but I have my reservations because of the initial fight on the same matter..<br><br>One thing I can say is not to care for what she is doing, but still love her as a sister and part of a family. As we get older, we want to be less comtrolled especially when your sister is not even 21. There's the rebellious stage. In life there will be a time when most of us will be tested on. One thing you can do is to get on with your stuff, but always be there for her, so that when there's a chance, she understand she still have a family to return to... Sometimes, people need to touch the kettle to learn the lesson, and not just mere warning them that it is hot. =)<br><br>Take a step back... Relax... She's happy with her life, you're happy with yours.. that's good.. you can't change a person, it has to take shape by itself.</div>
