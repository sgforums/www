              <p>If the rhythm guitarist is your best friend, he should not be leaving the band just because of an argument. Best friends don't just leave best friends in the lurch.</p>
              <p>At this important juncture, the band is the most important.</p>
              <p>If you're the leader of the band, then its time to take charge because there is a crisis now.</p>
              <p>Call for an emergency meeting. Be polite but firm and tell them they have come thus far and it is important that all stick together to finish what all has set out to do - that is to perform at the prom. Once that is over, they are free to disband. Reunite for one last time.</p>
              <p>If your best friend still insist on leaving, then he should no longer be a member of the band and neither should he be your best friend. Then someone has to take over the job of the guitarist or can you do without a guitarist.</p>

              <p>Now that the situation has become this bad, the best thing you can do is to actually leave your best friend be, and continue without him. </p>
              <p>I understand that you really truly care for him and hope that he can continue the dream of the two of you together. </p>
              <p>However, I believe that even if you manage to convince a few band members, there will still be others who will not accept him. In the worst case scenario, the band may even want you to get out of the group.</p>
              <p>You can try to get both your friend and the rest of the band to get together to talk, but you will risk losing your position in the band as well. If you are willing to take such a risk, and put your dream at stake, then by all means go ahead and get everyone together and talk.</p>
              <p>You can and you should seek your band's teacher-in-charge in getting everyone together though, as I am sure not that everyone will want to come and talk to your friend.</p>
