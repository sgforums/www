              <p>im currently working as an intern in a company. so for the first few weeks, my job is doable. doing excel, data entries, researching. quite reasonable and easy to do. then after about 3 weeks  of working, my boss confronted me and asked me if wanna try and do telemarketing. she said its just temporary, for exposure, i will also be given extra comission.she said she would respect my decision if i dont want to do telemarketing as it is not the actual job scope that they offered. but then i agreed since it was just for exposure and hey, i get extra comission.</p>
              <p>after 2 weeks of doing telemarketing, i realised that i wasnt interested in it as i had to call ppl from japan, korea, india, new zealand. my boss even gave me a target of 80 calls a day to do, that will take about 4 hr plus to do.and i will always get bad results after all the calls.its just wasnt my cup of tea.so i emailed her that i wish to stop, but she said i need to continue doing. she also told my teacher back at school! i was so fed up as it was affecting my grades badly! i dont know what to do, i feel trapped. i really wanna stop this telemarketing bullshit as it affects my grades badly, but i cant. bo pian lor.</p>

              <p>See that highlighted part? Well, there is no such thing as easy money.</p>
              <p>The best thing for you to do now is to ask your techer to step in and help you out. Paint him/her the full picture and beg him/her to help you. If you have offended him/her all the time, the only thing left for you to do now is to suck your thumb.</p>
              <p>Your boss probably couldn't find anyone else to hook up, but you shown up, and was thus hooked up with the bait of extra $$. There is another way to save yourself, and that is to replace someone else on that hook. That will be a very wrong thing to do, and I seriously suggest that you do not do it.</p>
              <p>And don't bother with speaking with your boss, the more you made her fed-up, the less likely that you are going to get away from telemarketing.</p>

              <p>But you didn't knew beforehand, hence your boss easily hooked you up with the bait of $$.</p>
              <p>As for your teacher, he is probably one of those who looks out for their own interests more than others. I wouldn't say that he is wrong, but I will say that you are not going to get much help from him.</p>
              <p>Your boss is just trying to make you stay for as long as she could. I highly doubt she would let you off the hook during your internship period.</p>
              <p>Well, you could ask someone to help you do part of the phoning to lessen your load, though I highly doubt anyone will help you out. Even if they do help you out, odds are they will give up soon enough after realising how troublesome and time-consuming it is.</p>

              <p>Hey, define LAZY properly. Doesn't mean that someone who refused to do things he don't want to means he's lazy. TS has stated he suddenly do not have the interest to complete it.</p>
              <p><br>Imagine yourself being asked to wash the toilet when you should be doing office work. Will you be happy about doing it?</p>
              <p>Yes, this world is too real. But, as a human, we have the rights to reject something. When you say "given shit task to do jolly well do it well", i can confirm your life is too dull, just like a big plains with black grass, flowers and sky, trapped in the plains forever without ever finding the right path.Come on, life should be as colorful as the rainbow, doing things that would make you believe in making a better day. If everyone got the same mindset as you, then this should not be the 21st century. It should be the ancient dinosaur era.</p>
              <p>Next time, please. Put yourself in someone's shoes. Life ain't the army commands.</p>

              <p>Hey, define LAZY properly. Doesn't mean that someone who refused
              to do things he don't want to means he's lazy. TS has stated he
              suddenly do not have the interest to complete it.</p>
              <p><br> Imagine yourself being asked to wash the toilet when you should be
              doing office work. Will you be happy about doing it?</p>
              <p>Yes, this world is too real. But, as a human, we have the rights
              to reject something. When you say "given shit task to do jolly well
              do it well", i can confirm your life is too dull, just like a big
              plains with black grass, flowers and sky, trapped in the plains
              forever without ever finding the right path.Come on, life should be
              as colorful as the rainbow, doing things that would make you
              believe in making a better day. If everyone got the same mindset as
              you, then this should not be the 21st century. It should be the
              ancient dinosaur era.</p>
              <p>Next time, please. Put yourself in someone's shoes. Life ain't
              the army commands.</p>
