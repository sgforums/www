            <div class='col-md body'>There must be <strong>mutual</strong> attraction in order for friends to advance to lovers.<br><br>After you've declared your feelings for her, is her response positive or negative?<br><br>If she said, "Give me some time to think about it," there may be hope. Assuming that she DID say that, you'll really have to give her some time to think about it.<br><br>"Some time" usually means 2~3 weeks(for most girls), but there are some who will take 2~3 months. During this period, you can still keep in touch with her, but DO NOT ask her for a r/s.<br><br>When "some time" is up, it's time to prompt her for an answer. If she still says, "no," then I suggest that you should just move on.<br><br>(Note: My suggestions are made on the assumption that your girl is the normal type who has less than <strong>2 ex-boyfriends</strong>.)<br><br>However, if she said, "Let's just be friends/I'm not ready yet/I want to focus on my studies," then forget it. If a girl doesn't like you from Day 1, she will never like you. That's because you're in her 'Friends' list, not 'Lovers' list.<br><br>And unless you're as suave as Pierce Brosnan or as charming as Brad Pitt, it's impossible to jump list.<br><br>Conclusion: <strong><span style="color: red;">Either she likes you, or not.

Awkwardness derives from shyness, the inability to express emotions. A common thing in guys, whose early childhood have been taught to mask emotions instead of expressing them. Asian values contributed to this as well.<br><br>And in fact, most people hesitated in face of love because of fear; the fear of rejection, the fear of mis-handling and the lack of confidence to pursue a relationship, having doubts and fear to experience failure ultimately.<br><br>***<br><br>What do you want?<br><br>What do you wish to pursue?<br><br>How can you achieve it?<br><br>Then do it.<br><br>You already reached to a stage where the iron is slightly over-heated and before it gets cool down, <strong>you had better know what you want</strong> and know what you ought to do.
