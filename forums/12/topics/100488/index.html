Usually girls expect guys to initiate it. SOme daring girls will confess it but usually no. Most do not say out and just wait. When it doesnt happen, they let it go.<br><br>I just wana say, its aready the 21st century, wats the difference if a girl intiates or a guy initiates? Girls, if u like a guy and hes available, just go ahead and tell him. Same goes for guys too but i htink guys will have less of such a problem.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It has always been the guy who does the chasing.. to the point dat it seems only right for a man to do dat. When a gal takes on the role &amp; initiates, she has to be open minded enuf to let go all inhibitions &amp; prepare herself for rejection.. or worse.. being called names like "slart", "desperate", "err xin"?<br>haha..  but for guys of coz they won't mind la... more gals confess means more "pop" ma... For gals cannot.. we haf to maintain our image &amp; value... very important!<br><br><img></div>
