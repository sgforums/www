            <div class='col-md body'>"Anyway our rs kinda of a quasi r/s. We goes out together many times but we never hold hands. Lots of ppl thinks we are a couple but we never acknowledge ourself as a concrete bf/gf r/s(she once said she not ready for a stead). I just don't feel I'm getting any closer to her despite all efforts and frankly my passion have ran out"<br><br>Did you ask her to be your gf?<br><br>Did she ask you to be his bf?<br><br>If you have not even started something then why you need to end it?<br><br>If something really started then act as a man and face it. Breaking up is the toughest thing for anyone to do but would you rather face a moment of pain then years of regret?<br><br>"And thats why I don't want to ask her out. I'm totally lost when someone start crying in front of me. I wish theres a easier way to do this"<br><br>Be firm man you are no longer a boy anymore. Life will throw you more harder things to decided in the future. There is a few ways other than the direct way.<br><br>1) stop all contacts. change hp number, every email from her is to be ban...every photo you have with her is to be throw away.<br><br>2) ask friend to tell her.<br><br>3) sms her to break up with her.<br><br>4) call her hp and say you want to break.<br><br>5) write a letter to break up with her.<br><br>6) sent email to tell her.<br><br>The above methods are the so call "easy" methods but is still not as good as the direct method.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>in fact u already made up ur mind to let go b4 u post ur thread here. Am i right?<br><br>But there's juz something holding u back. Cuz i assumed u r the type who dunno how to express ur feelings. And u r afraid to be stuck in this kind of crying scenes. Well, i supposed every guy in ur situation will get vexed and confused when ur gf cries in front of u...creating a scene that u do not know how to settle.<br><br>Avoiding her is not the issue anymore. If u wana out, u gotto be frank &amp; firm. I know it's hard and harsh.. it's easy for a bystander to comment... But that's the only way to relief urself.<br><br>Hurting her now is better than dragging it on... for another week..month..year..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Most of the time when people enter a relationship, they only look at the good side of someone and ignore the bad side. This is what we call the honeymoon period. Once it is over we tends to realise that the person do have lots of bad habits. If their relationship is to last, both side must be able to accept each other bad habits and work together. If not they will blame each other and will try to force their partner to change. Once they realise that they could not change their partner, they will get angry and want to end the relationship asap.<br><br>Is up to both side to make the relationship work but if either one side tries the easy way out by trying to change the action or habits of the other. Most of the time the relationship will end as there is no short cut in relationship building.<br>It takes time and tender loving care to change someone, if you rush into it, it will only force the other partner to hate the change.</div>
