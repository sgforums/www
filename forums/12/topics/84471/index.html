Just don't behaved like a couple in front of the shipping guy, but behaved like you are going after her again. Think you can see clearly what kind of animal is hidden under the skin of that shipping guy. I can guess...wolf.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Let her know that you are jealous and she should know what to do.

As long as she doesn't cross the line with other guys....by the way, she has already cross your line when she allowed other guys to get so close to her. Do something about it, but please be nice...very nice and polite about it. Don't be a wimp, stand your ground when it is absolutely necessary. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck....... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Seventh_Son:</div><div class="quote_body">Today, one guy from one of the company that my gf laise with to get her company shipement out called her and asked her out for a drink.  She told me that later she will be going drinking with the shipping guy. And she had asked her best friend to join her too as this is the first time she is meeting this shipping guy.My frist reaction was....huh?<br><br>Of course I would feel jealous and unhappy about this. But other then that, thats nothing much that I could really do. I told my self not to get jealous over this kind of thingy. Must have trust in my gf.<br>But sometimes its not easy to do what you preached.<br><br>I asked her "Why you said YES to his invitation?" She said " My company is on budget constraint so maybe after meeting him up as<br>a friend the cost would be reduced" So I told her, when there is once there will be twice and followed by many many times.<br>And she told me she would always asked her best friend to go along with her.<br><br>Sometimes I do feel very insecure. I know there are other posts like mine. She got more male friends then females friends. And of course everyday she would get sms from all these male friends.<br>Which she do not really know them very well. Sms like...how are you to more mushy sms. She did show all the sms to me when I was with her.<br><br>I admit i am jealous over all this. But hey I am a human afterall and I have emotions too.<br><br></div></blockquote>You are a human.<br><br>You are entitled to feel what you feel.<br><br>But is it neccessary or rather even doing the relationship any good for if I am the competitor, this is exactly what I would do to kill your relationship and <strong>you are effectively walking into my net</strong>.<br><br>Jealousy is something that exist and has little avenue to channel out. If one were to be angry, to blow one's top or even whack the wall is common. If one is sad, to be depressed or cry is common. If one is jealous? You can rant, but in the end, you can only untangle this knot yourself if you wanna feel better because trust me, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">none of the above methods will make you feel any better.</span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> In the end, it is a matter of preception, trust and self esteem.<br><br>Do you even realise that if she wanna walk out on you - she could ANYTIME declare this relationship dead and leave just like that? She doesn't have to have more guy friends or whatsoever. If your relationship is going to shake because of this, you are going to have a hard time.<br><br>P.S: Internal problems breed from inside is ten times more tricky and difficult than external problems crashing onto your love.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
