From what I have read, both of you are in a very dangerous period. I'm not guessing and<br>I'm not trying to be a wet blanket or being pessimistic. As what Imperfect said, a promise is a promise. Moreover, you not only had broken her trust in you, but also indicated tt you were not willing to share your woes with her. Sorry to be blunt, hitting objects is rather an immatured and insensible way to vent your fustrations. That's another reason why your gf is afraid of you probably doing the same dangerous thing in future. Who would want a partner who is violent, breaches trust and not willing to share everything?<br><br>You have to learn to control your anger or fustrations. You must and you can do it.<br><br>You have to start telling her all your feelings if you really want to be with her. And both of you have to spend more time together ironing out every problems(whoever's faults in them) and what had happened and why they happened.<br><br>take care and wish you all the best for both of you.<br></div></blockquote>i think i have to thank you for pointing out the negative part of me.<br>right now i am learning to control my temper step by step.<br></div>
