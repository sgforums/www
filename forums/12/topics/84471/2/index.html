Sorry for this very late reply....<br><br>By the time I get to read this post of yours, I don't really know how to advise you... I mean... What you said.... What you did.... You could be right, you could be wrong... I don't know....<br><br>DO YOU REALLY KNOW <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>But... !st thing I would like to tell you... SOCIALISING.... With friends.. Colleagues... Business clients or partners.... It's PART of of life... Some people know it... Some people don't... Some people BELIEVE DEEPLY in it... Perhaps not so important for the other people....<br><br>Well... IT HAPPENS... Work-related 'entertainment'... Though you're not the boss, it'll do better for the business.. Things get better for the company... Things probably get better for almost everyone in a sense? Rather making it a 'painful' or stressful position.. People nowadays prefer to come out... RELAX.... Make friends... Some call it 'connections'... Others call it 'ties'.... I don't know... Whichever term you prefer?<br><br>If you care for my opinions? Your story.... Come come... Let's look at it....<br><br>2 MAJOR 'mistakes' you've made... In no position to comment on your judgement... Like I've said... You could be right... You could be wrong... But your MOVES...<br><br><strong>1. ANGER.</strong><br><br>Whenever possible, always try not to communicate with you're at the peak of bursting the blood out of your head.... Your pressure's probably too high... You can't think... You just wanna EXPRESS and give the other party a piece of your SH|T... Now... Let's look at the other party standing down there RECEIVING the SH|T... Get a CLEARER PICTURE now?<br><br><strong>2. 'DRILLING'</strong><br><br>Lousy communication... On top of the 1st breakdown mentioned above, you SCORE a 2nd MAJOR... You were 'talking on a lousy reception line'.... Ever experienced talking on a mobile line when the signal connection is BAD? Now that's BAD... Because ALOT of the time the other party just don't catch you...<br><br>The SILENT gf.... I'm not sure how her 'party' turned out to be... But probably like you've said... She was TIRED... Let's imagine 2 SCENERIOS??<br><br>1. She was HAPPY and ENJOYED herself...<br>2. She was not happy and working her sh|t through...<br><br>On account of SCENERIO no. 1, she was already TIRED... But it's not difficult to imagine whatever you've told her, MOST of the ideas won't get across... But IF there's really an EFFECTIVE FORM of communication during that time, it should have been body language and EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION.... Body language is OUT because she can't see you.. But as far as I'm concerned, you should have NO PROBLEM sending over the OUTBURST of DISSATISFACTION and ANGER... IRREGARDLESS.. of whether your contents have went across... And BELIEVE ME... If she's gonna be SOBER and recalling about that night... It would pretty much be about your ANGER... <strong>MARK THAT.</strong><br><br>Now let us come to SCENERIO 2... She tried to work the SH|T out of things... It didn't pay off... And WAIT!! Things could have been WORSE? Perhaps like you've mentioned, the OTHER GUY might have really been INTERESTED in her..? At this point, I would like to make another DARING 'ASSUMPTION'....<br><br>The guy is a SUPER HANDSOME guy with (or only with) GOOD CONDITIONS (may be WEALTH or what...)... And like you've said, your gf's thinking of 'EATING OUT' on ya... AND...?? HAHA! I see NO PROBLEM with that...? Should have been a 'perfect match'... 2 WILLING PARTIES... HAPPILY TOGETHER...? Hey... Who's complaining..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The OTHER case... The guy's a PLAIN IDIOT out there trying to take advantage of your gf... Your gf 'fights' him off...<br><br>Ya ya... She called in her close friend... To accompany her in case such an idiot appear or to go enjoy with her... WELL... Like I've said... I DON'T KNOW... But GEE... AT this point I'm starting to wonder... How do you LEARN about she asking her friend to go along anyway...? Oh well..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>AND YES!! I AGREE with the some OTHERS that IF she've got NOTHING to hide, WHY don't she bring her BF then?? But then again, if she've really got nothing to hide why CAN'T she bring her CLOSE FRIEND...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  It's really how you look at it... REALLY....<br><br>But bringing partner to meet friends and for business occasions... REALLY... THEOREOTICALLY it'll SOUNDS GREAT.... LOVINGNESS should be SHOWN with such 'TRUST' and blah blah blah... But IF you're really one of the 'insiders'... You'll know that not all occasion would permit that...<br><br>AND.... BACK TO SCENERIO 2!! A meet up which didn't pay off... A lousy guy... Ok ok... What ELSE?? THINK... THINK REAL HARD.... Make her day EVEN WORSE!!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  YEAH... I KNOW... How about we GIVE HER a GOOD DRESSING UP from her BF...?? That's would be PRETTY COOL now... WON'T IT....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Hey.... I really don't know about your gf... I don't know you... And I don't know who she goes out with... But if you really see a problem to that... The least you can do is try to work things out with her in appropriate way(s) if you're still interested in her and the relationship... At the rate you're handling things...?<br><br>GOOD LUCK... Cause you'll be needing PLENTY OF IT.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Make friends... Some call it 'connections'... Others call it 'ties'.... I don't know... Whichever term you prefer?<br><br>If you care for my opinions? Your story.... Come come... Let's look at it....<br><br>2 MAJOR 'mistakes' you've made... In no position to comment on your judgement... Like I've said... You could be right... You could be wrong... But your MOVES...<br><br>[b]1. ANGER.</strong><br><br>Whenever possible, always try not to communicate with you're at the peak of bursting the blood out of your head.... Your pressure's probably too high... You can't think... You just wanna EXPRESS and give the other party a piece of your SH|T... Now... Let's look at the other party standing down there RECEIVING the SH|T... Get a CLEARER PICTURE now?<br><br><strong>2. 'DRILLING'</strong><br><br>Lousy communication... On top of the 1st breakdown mentioned above, you SCORE a 2nd MAJOR... You were 'talking on a lousy reception line'.... Ever experienced talking on a mobile line when the signal connection is BAD? Now that's BAD... Because ALOT of the time the other party just don't catch you...<br><br>The SILENT gf.... I'm not sure how her 'party' turned out to be... But probably like you've said... She was TIRED... Let's imagine 2 SCENERIOS??<br><br>1. She was HAPPY and ENJOYED herself...<br>2. She was not happy and working her sh|t through...<br><br>On account of SCENERIO no. 1, she was already TIRED... But it's not difficult to imagine whatever you've told her, MOST of the ideas won't get across... But IF there's really an EFFECTIVE FORM of communication during that time, it should have been body language and EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION.... Body language is OUT because she can't see you.. But as far as I'm concerned, you should have NO PROBLEM sending over the OUTBURST of DISSATISFACTION and ANGER... IRREGARDLESS.. of whether your contents have went across... And BELIEVE ME... If she's gonna be SOBER and recalling about that night... It would pretty much be about your ANGER... <strong>MARK THAT.</strong><br><br>Now let us come to SCENERIO 2... She tried to work the SH|T out of things... It didn't pay off... And WAIT!! Things could have been WORSE? Perhaps like you've mentioned, the OTHER GUY might have really been INTERESTED in her..? At this point, I would like to make another DARING 'ASSUMPTION'....<br><br>The guy is a SUPER HANDSOME guy with (or only with) GOOD CONDITIONS (may be WEALTH or what...)... And like you've said, your gf's thinking of 'EATING OUT' on ya... AND...?? HAHA! I see NO PROBLEM with that...? Should have been a 'perfect match'... 2 WILLING PARTIES... HAPPILY TOGETHER...? Hey... Who's complaining..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The OTHER case... The guy's a PLAIN IDIOT out there trying to take advantage of your gf... Your gf 'fights' him off...<br><br>Ya ya... She called in her close friend... To accompany her in case such an idiot appear or to go enjoy with her... WELL... Like I've said... I DON'T KNOW... But GEE... AT this point I'm starting to wonder... How do you LEARN about she asking her friend to go along anyway...? Oh well..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>AND YES!! I AGREE with the some OTHERS that IF she've got NOTHING to hide, WHY don't she bring her BF then?? But then again, if she've really got nothing to hide why CAN'T she bring her CLOSE FRIEND...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  It's really how you look at it... REALLY....<br><br>But bringing partner to meet friends and for business occasions... REALLY... THEOREOTICALLY it'll SOUNDS GREAT.... LOVINGNESS should be SHOWN with such 'TRUST' and blah blah blah... But IF you're really one of the 'insiders'... You'll know that not all occasion would permit that...<br><br>AND.... BACK TO SCENERIO 2!! A meet up which didn't pay off... A lousy guy... Ok ok... What ELSE?? THINK... THINK REAL HARD.... Make her day EVEN WORSE!!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil">  YEAH... I KNOW... How about we GIVE HER a GOOD DRESSING UP from her BF...?? That's would be PRETTY COOL now... WON'T IT....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Hey.... I really don't know about your gf... I don't know you... And I don't know who she goes out with... But if you really see a problem to that... The least you can do is try to work things out with her in appropriate way(s) if you're still interested in her and the relationship... At the rate you're handling things...?<br><br>GOOD LUCK... Cause you'll be needing PLENTY OF IT.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> [/b]</blockquote>Ok...after that nite she was not mad at me for being angry with her.<br>She told me if I am not happy with the whole thing I could tell her instead of<br>of keeping it to myself(something I always do, But I will reveal my feelings to her after sometime)<br><br>When I am in anger of stress up. I would always like to vent it out on something. Trees walls or what ever that I came across. That night, I did it again. And had cuts and bruise on my hands. When she saw it the next day, she was totally mad and got nothing to say to me cos I have told her that I would never do it again. And yet I did it again.<br><br>She told me she was dissappointed in me. And up till now she is still angry.<br>She as did sms me, called me but she is very cold and got nothing to say.<br>When i asked her why is she like this. She told me she is still very angry about me venting my anger that way.<br><br>I asked how can i pacify u? She said let it heal by itself...<br><br>Right now this feeling really sucks man!<br>Slowly i realised that I am such a loser...<br><br></div>

If he had reacted to her in the appropriate way, wouldnt all be solved???<br><br>Yes I agree that he dont have to pacify her, coz its of no point, but he really needs to knowhow to tell her his problems instead of venting it out physically... from the way that she wants him to tell her his problems and not get hurt, you know she cares for him. And its his action that hurt her and not vice versa... in my opinion... though her action triggered some reaction from him, but if they were the right reaction ( telling her instead of venting it out physically) there wont be this problem...<br><br>Remember this : A promise is a promise...</div>

Moreover, you not only had broken her trust in you, but also indicated tt you were not willing to share your woes with her. Sorry to be blunt, hitting objects is rather an immatured and insensible way to vent your fustrations. That's another reason why your gf is afraid of you probably doing the same dangerous thing in future. Who would want a partner who is violent, breaches trust and not willing to share everything?<br><br>You have to learn to control your anger or fustrations. You must and you can do it.<br><br>You have to start telling her all your feelings if you really want to be with her. And both of you have to spend more time together ironing out every problems(whoever's faults in them) and what had happened and why they happened.<br><br>take care and wish you all the best for both of you.<br></div>
