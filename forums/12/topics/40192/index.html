            <div class='col-md body'>wow... 14 years old... sec 2?<br><br>this is the time when the world revolves around infatuations. i'm quite astounded that u spent 100 bux on his gift. i don't think i could have afforded that ooh... 13 years ago?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>lil sis, i hope u can try to kerb ur feelings. it's hard when u're young (i remember when i was ur age). i'm not saying u cannot have romantic feelings for guys at that age, but it's the lack of self-control that i'm probably referring to.<br><br>now, some advice for all ages, i don't feel it necessary for a gal (or guy, for that matter) to throw oneself at another. he knows u like him, which is to me, is a good thing! now the so called "ball" is in his court. it's up to him to react, and u can only see how he does, WITHOUT continually throwing urself at him. he ALREADY knows that u like him, he doesn't need to be reminded.<br><br>now, back to the age thing. there is a high chance that he has NO IDEA how to react. yeap, he is probably acting cool and all that, but inside totally excited and confused. he also most likely has no idea how to communicate back to u that he does like u, or doesn't. i assume he's around ur age. mind you, many pple much older still have NO CLUE....<br><br>i feel u have to pull back. yes, he knows u like him, but those stares and gifts and stuff have to stop, if not hidden. ur heart may be beating double time everytime he's within a 50 mile radius but do not let him know that. pull back, let him notice ur nonchalance, and then u may be able to "extract" a reaction from him. he's just basking in ur attn now, and doesn't need any action on his part. make him work hard for that attn!<br><br>of course there's the probability that he doesn't like u at all. you'll have to be able to take that, stand strong and move on. it doesn't mean that u're no good, it just means u're not right for him.<br><br>btw, try to listen to ur frens abit more. they sometimes tell us things that we cannot see. blinded by love is a common phrase, but i still think blinding by infatuation is much more dangerous.<br><br>also, do heed winboi's advice, ur studies should be one of the most important things in ur life rite now. that comes b4 a reln with a guy ok?<br><br>best wishes to u and it's quite heartening to be reminded of my childhood pains. i'm sure u'll be fine!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

How does he know about you like him?? Through spreading by friends?? Or you told him you like him??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You both used to SMS and chat often before.. but once he knows about the liking you have for him.. he starts to avoid you and always "act" infront of you... There might be 2 possibilites to this..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>1) When he found out that you actually like him.. he doesnt know what to do... Cos you have been friends for almost a year (i guessed) and have been chatting like any other friends.. He may treat you as someone who is very close to him.. but not to the extend of BGR! Someone who is always there for him.. listening and caring.. jus like a platonic friend..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>He feels very comfortable talking to you.. But when he got to know about the news of you liking him.. He suddenly doesnt know how to react.. In his mind.. he might be thinking.. "all the while have been so good friends.. but now you've come to me and said that you like me!! Well, i only can say.. i dun believe this.. and i've always treated you like my "sister" or a very good friend of mine." He "act" cool simply becos he wanna treat it as if nothing has happen.. And He wants to tell himself that the truth about you liking him wasnt even real AT ALL!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Since he cant take it.. This maybe the reason of why he is avoiding you and keeping a distance away from you.. The eye contact made becos he still feels that you are his good friend.. He dun wan to lose such friend... The birthday gift you gave is a little too much.. Hundred over dollars for someone who you doesnt even know he's worth it or he likes you anot.. Moreover he din even come to say/SMS "Thank you" to you.. I bet he really dunno how to face you...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>2) He knows he likes you.. but he jus simply dunno how to express himself.. He's avoiding you becos he's scare that if he take actions maybe things wont come out as what he wanted or wish for.. So he somehow back off a little.. ANd he may find it hard to accept the fact/reality he's facing now.. So slowly take your time..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>When he walk pass you.. and sees you.. He cant run away or what.. So he take it that you are invisible.. BUt actually deep down in his heart it was pumping so fast.. and of cos.. embarassment, blush, whatso ever..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>He knows you are peeping him.. cos he himself oso does that.. when comes to eye meet eye.. both jus stared into each other's eyes.. as if you 2 have fallen in love.. As for the gift.. i mentioned is too much.. he may wan to say thanks.. but he got no courage to come up to you...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Now that you have make it know to everyone you like him.. And definitely people around him will give him pressure and stress.. by making fun of you and him together and blah blah all that things... The worst thing is that it seems like is only one-sided.. Noone knows whether he likes or dun likes you..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>_____________________________________________________<br><br>So how?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You both are still very young.. 14 years old only.. HOw well you know about love? how well can you defined love? And how many relatioinships you've been thru?   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>When comes to a relation is not as easy as you think it is.. Is not jus liking each other and that's about it.. You need alot of communications (which both of you now seems to have problem with), a good listener, chemistry and feelings (applies to both parties) and compromising with each other.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>I know you get to see him everyday in school.. if you really want to give up.. face it.. and have determination on doing it.. tell yourself you can do it.. You have to go on with your life.. Remember your life doesnt only CIRCLES around him!! Get yourself occupied.. Got time do something useful or something you like instead of staying at home thinking of all these useless stuffs.. Have some confidence in yourself.. dun make it sound like you don't worth a single cent!!! Stop crying and move on ok?? Afterall maybe he's really not worthy for you.. and not "HE's Too good For you"!!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Right now.. i suggest you to concentrate more on your studies.. This matter you can jus let it rest.. If it was meant to be yours.. Someday, somehow, somewhere.. it will come back to you..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Down the years maybe you'll find another better guy than him.. He's not the one only in this world!! Someone might be there waiting for you.. to love and care for you more!! Wait patiently for the day to come.. This kind of thing cannot rush one.. Let nature takes its course!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
