As this may come too sudden for him, he don't know what to do or how to react towards you. He will start to act strange or even like you say act cool infront of you to cover up his own fear. Maybe he just don't know if he like you also. Give him some more time. Some guys do really take a long time to react to something, esp a relationship. I don't you wan a guy who can casually accept a gal when he is been break the news to right...But one advise, of he still didn't react after sometimes, then forget about him and find someone else..</div>

Case you didn't realise while you all were happily playing mind games wif each other... you become insidiously unattractive... due to the depletion of what i call emotionally anticipative energy... wah i tell u dat one like mojo man... anyway, if face offs are not your cup of tea, why not drop him a line? Calling him is both intimate, conveys your sincerity, gives both of you to clarify things ALONE, and most of all, he'll feel honoured and you'll have his undivided attention( at least for a while, huh!). I believe wat you're going thru now is called a Crush, and they call it that simply becos you're not suppose to enjoy it( sucky feelin rite?) If he rejects you, then you'll just have to put on a facade and pick up whatever's left of your dignity and move on...(hey how do you noe if someone else you see everyday isn't having the same feelings for you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> ?)
