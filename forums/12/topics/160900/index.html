But it come to the point that she protected her while she is jobless for a long time and only talk about money to me when she needs it.  It is not the first time she mention that the house will be my sis's.  Each time they need money, I can't say no, who else can help?  I think our relationship has changed alot.

She probably thinks I'm married and have a good life and I'm always there for them financially.  She does not panic when sister is jobless for many years.  No matter how much I argue with her, she will side with sister.<br><br></div>

At least you have a sis to help out.  Your mum is probably leaving the flat for your brother for wedding purposes.  She reckon you two will be married off.<br><br>I'm like the sole breadwinner of my mother's family.  I don't need her flat.  Just hope she can begin to be financially dependent on her hubby or her other daughter.  I also hope her other daughter will be more concern and responsible enough to bring them for health checks.<br><br></div>

Things won't be easy for your kids and hubby.<br><br>As for your mum and sibblings, just do what's necessary within your means. You can never reach out, devote yourself totally and wish to satisfy some people who can never be satisfied...
