            <div class='col-md body'>TS i think yours is a case of "familarity breeds contempt" becus when you live tog with another person for some time people tend to start cutting ends on courtesy and tolerance i know cus i live with a roommate in a hostel as well. But basic rules try to talk things over, secondly always remember basic courtesy on your part and if the person you are living with as too many differences that irreconcilable with you then it may be time you find a new roommate. Anyways good luck and try to resolve and talk things out   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
