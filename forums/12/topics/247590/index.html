            <div class='col-md body'>yo i think the tension between TS n her colleague escalated over the easter holiday.<br><br>1st off living with a friend will show his/her true colours. something u dun get to see in the office everyday. sometimes we gotta give n take abit. working together is hard but living together is even harder, especially when the colleague 's bf crashed in.<br>2nd imo the timing is not very proper to ask abt her bf accommodation prob when both of them r in a rush. it'll create unnecessary tension as when pple r in a rush we tend to not think in a calmly manner. especially with this sensitive issue where by under normal circumstances fight will break out let alone when the mind is in a "un-calm" state.<br>i hope both of them will calm down talk it over instead of shouting at each other like a cat fight. being angry wun solve anything. it'll jus create more misunderstanding. living in a strange country is hard enough, making life difficult for both of u is even worse. misunderstandings wun disappear by itself it gotta be sorted out. small misunderstandings will accumulate into big misunderstanding. clear up whatever misgivings u have for each other n all will be well.<br><br>IMHO the bf should jus F off n get lost <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

Whoever is early, go first.<br><br>As to cooking, agree to a system like, you use the microwave first on Mon/Wed/Fri and your room-mate uses it first on the other days. I've skipped out Sundays as I think both of you might have your own social activities bah.<br><br>One of the probable reasons why both of you are getting at each others' nerves could be because of the unwritten rules both of you have about leaving for work together, eating together, etc, etc...<br><br>Even in marriages, if the couple gets too sticky to each other, there's bound to be arguments and resentment.<br><br>Maybe my 2 cents' worth of suggestion MIGHT work, maybe it might not.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> </div></blockquote>OK i think u gave me a pretty gd perspective.<br>but .. i seldom use the microwave. jus that day only.. coz my chicken is FROZEN like mad.. and i need to prepare my dinner ma..<br><br>haiz.. we dun stick tog.. we jus live tog.<br>we dun talk.. coz she talks to her bf. if not. most of the time she shut herself in her room.. we DUN talk realli<br><br>i tried talkin to her in a civilised manner. but its really hard .. or near IMPOSSIBLE.. she jus shouts or being rude..

            <div class='col-md body'>Y do u take into ur heart for what u say?? Mmmm the things u mention here seems small to me but i will not tolerate ppl who dun show me respect and shout back. Try not to talk to her too much and avoid sharing things with her. Since now u r living together, u need to point out the rules set between u 2. Share the housework so there will be nothing to complain. If sharing things like microwave is so hard to her and she wants to chu pattern, tell her to buy one herself!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Living together needs patience and understanding...maybe its just a start that y u two have a conflict...try the point above who knows maybe she will understand and change later....Sometimes u also need to understand from her point of view too, i cant comment too much cos i dun know u and her well, but sometimes stepping a step behind might makes things work.<br><br>But if she after a while if she still do things that u really so stress that u cannot live with her anymore( cannot live with her means u felt like killing urself if carry on), Pls do urself a favour, complain to ur boss. Tell him/her to find other place for u.<br><br>Anyway is only 6mths, it will past very fast <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
