              <p>hmm.. my advice will be for you to do what you feel is right.. stick with your decision.. and when the time comes for him to leave, have no regrets.. and you would have made the right choice.. if u just do what the general population(or us in this case) will do, you may end up regretting ur decision, because it's not your initial choice afterall..</p>
              <p>be firm in ur decision, be strong against the outcome..</p>

              <p>I know I'm not helping out much with your predicament (if you want help, ask my girlfriend; she's experiencing the exact same thing, except that we don't co-habitate), but what universities did your male friend apply to? Any request for financial aid, and how much?</p>
              <p>The good news is that it's not easy to gain admittance to a good US university, so he will probably stay back like 80% or so of Singapore applicants to the United States.</p>
              <p>What is your nationality? I'm a scholar too, from RJC, your batch. Are you a PRC scholar?</p>

              <p>None of us have the key or the answer to the future. So you should not count your chickens before they are hatched. I think you will need to think what you want to do with this r/s, even if you want out -- I think it will only be rightful for you to speak to yourÂ  b/f.</p>
              <p>You need to let him say out what is on his mind. Remember this is a r/s and you need to hear his side as well. I think you are practical by anticipating what is ahead but a r/s is not one sided and if the he is sincere and committed - then who is to stop him except you. You may not have confidence in LDR but please be realistic as well, as people staying together does break up too.</p>
              <p>I think you should take things 1 step at a time and see how it goes. There's a saying: "Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained." So, do give him some thought and if possible the both of you sit down and have a talk.</p>

              <p>just break up..even if you both liked each other , r/s is not goin to work easily when another party is at another country.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>and since the chance of him staying there forever is high, its best to just keep this r/s as good memory,</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>hm, sory i dont see any point if you can continue this r/s with him. better break up than dreaming to be with him when hes not coming back( or he will? )</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>one last thing that u can do is just wish him good, yea u can cherish your time with him while hes here.</p>

              <p><br>I agree.. U almost have sex with u and he never even gives u the title as gf? He just treatÂ thisÂ r/s with uÂ as flirt. To him now, his number one priority is education. I don't know where u rank in his eyes. Luckily u never let him claim virginity. I believe it maybe just all yr one side affection for him. I think u are still too young to do what is right! I afraid u will regret yr action in future. Some guy student who do very well for their A lvl are very cunning. Beware!</p>

              <p>I agree with forummer CannyOng on this issue.Â  It doesn't look like you mean very much to him in the first instance.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>Beware.Â  Now that he knows he is leaving, he might very well take full advantage of you.Â Â  Why not right?</p>
