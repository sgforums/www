Time difference, plus my busy schedule, plus the fact that i was hardly at home during weekends (partying), yet he stuck through and i appreciated having an anchor so rock-solid. Once i returned home, its been different, my feelings are different. Even he commented that i dont like to cuddle up anymore etc etc (you know..). And i come up with some lame excuse &amp; yet he accepts it. I don't know where im headed. My parents wouldn't approve of him as hes not the academic sort, but my family is REALLY academics-oriented (Harvard, MIT, Cornell, and for me- Purdue). So i always tell myself that IF i want to end it, i better to it now before i'm in too deep.<br><br>Yet, i'm so confused because i don't want to throw away this relationship based on the fact that 'i don't love him anymore' &amp; also because i don't want to hurt him.

            <div class='col-md body'>I think what you are going through is no fault of yours. Feelings cannot be force upon and even though someone may have done lots for you, it definitely takes more than just actions. It's the whoile package of intellectual connection as well. YOu have been overseas opening up new horizons and exploring new things while he is in teh navy...seriously, what can being in saf do to one's intellect. If you were that simple, then maybe the both of you can still be together in heart and soul but unfortunately or fortunately, its up to you to decide what you want in life. The critical point is when you are young. Feelinsg changes the fastest at that age group where we start to find our way in life, be it saf or studies...you call it teenage angst.<br><br>I was once in that situation but am no more cause I seek out new things and am boldly going where no one has...<br><br>cheers<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, i think this is happen to many couples that had long term relationship. Sometimes either party will take for granted and felt the love is lost. Because so get used and comfortable to each other side, the feeling of love to the other party is numb. This is most especially for people that have a very outgoing characters.<br><br>Is easy, when lost it, then you will know how important this relationship to you. Untill you lost it, you will never know. But by then it will be too late to regret.<br><br>Is all in your mind, to love or not to love. to keep yourself to one or to have fun. Frankly true love is all about appreciation. If one do not know how to appreciate, love cannot stay long. and you will be in this circle keep coming back to the same point.<br><br>My advice is that, you both pak to too long, the feeling is not subsided but felt numb only. To start a new relationship is easy, to maintain needs determination, to be forever needs commitment.<br><br>Try not to have own circle of friends and activities, let's each other do things together, know each other friends, join each other activities and enjoy happy and exciting events together instead going out with others.<br><br>Love needs spark, and is both your responsible to make this spark. One side will never work, needs both hands to claps.<br>Believe me, I went through this, don't let it something bad happened then only regret because it will never be the same again.<br>Sincerely wish you and him the best.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>vivasg, that was brilliant.<br><br>I truely understood what you were trying to convey. Especially the part where you say that the love may be gone, or it may have just numbed. And the only way to find out is if you end the relationship, but by that time, it'd be too late. That is just too true. That's exactly what i feel right now.<br><br>Furthermore, he loves me unconditionally, &amp; i doubt i can ever find someone like that. Although he has his flaws that really gets on my nerves, i find that i have a great time when we're out. Especially so, since i'm an outgoing person, it's become so comfortable with him, just like what you said, vivasg.<br><br>I think i will just stick it out. Will try incorporating out ativites together, to get that spark going again. I'm determined to give it another shot, because i don't want to regret my decision if we split up.<br><br>Thank you both!</div>

That is y i say need determination. So sometimes we need to prevent ourself to making a bigger hole, so be very careful when going out with other opposite sex cz at this stage is easy for you to fall for others.<br><br>I believe since you both alrdy 4 yrs relationship, that show u both can adapt to each other and definely there's love. do u ever heard that true love never run smooth... so needs commitment <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>So I'm a simple guy, using simple method. Just try do something new things together. or try go for some vacation together in other place which is both new to you two(not necessary an expensive one) or even can just go east coast camping <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">. The flow will create itself <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Happy moments will rekindle all the feelings.<br><br>man and woman are like this, there is some chemistry of mutual attraction. So just enjoy ur outing with him and make some new changes to both of you.

But lately i have realized that i no longer have the same feelings i did when we first started going out. But at the same time, im so indebted to him, cus he gave me so much support when i was studying in the States, and he was in the Navy. Time difference, plus my busy schedule, plus the fact that i was hardly at home during weekends (partying), yet he stuck through and i appreciated having an anchor so rock-solid. Once i returned home, its been different, my feelings are different. Even he commented that i dont like to cuddle up anymore etc etc (you know..). And i come up with some lame excuse &amp; yet he accepts it. I don't know where im headed. My parents wouldn't approve of him as hes not the academic sort, but my family is REALLY academics-oriented (Harvard, MIT, Cornell, and for me- Purdue). So i always tell myself that IF i want to end it, i better to it now before i'm in too deep.<br><br>Yet, i'm so confused because i don't want to throw away this relationship based on the fact that 'i don't love him anymore' &amp; also because i don't want to hurt him. He's told me so many times, not to leave him ever, that he will marry me, &amp; so much stuff that it really hurts me to even THINk that my feelings aren't there anymore. I need help &amp; pronto!<br><br>Thanks ya`all. I really appreciate the time you took out to read a little part about my life.</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You are probably subjected to your family's influence regarding their expectation of a son-in-law and that may constitute partial reason why you are demoralize about your own relationship (minus the fact that your relationship may be long and sunk into habitual/routine mode), but ultimately, the man whom you would be living with for the years to come is you... not your family.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>They think what is best for you, but they ain't you</strong></span> - only you know what is suitable and best for yourself, for you are no longer a little girl and you must learn to make decision for yourself.<br><br>That would bring us to another point: if your feelings have vanished, I don't know if you could allow yourself to be with a man you have no feelings for. Chances are, it could be temporal; maybe you should allow yourself one good shot at rebuilding this relationship, before deciding that love is truly gone.<br><br>NEVER love for sympathy; that's extremely cruel for his growth in love. You don't want to have a scene when he embrace you... with you in his mind while your soul isn't around or worst, is with another guy. A decisive break up may tear him apart emotionally, but certainly, you don't want to waste more of his 'investment' unto something that is returning pseudo-dividends.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You could just be delaying the inevitable. </strong></span><br><br>If you want to have a good shot at this, learn to talk about your relationship in a more wholesome picture, than engaging in conversation that spells fear or 'don't-leave-me-or-I-die' sort of thingy. It's negative communication and that usually backfire all efforts to change an impending doom. He must know that he has to help this relationship, by assisting you to have a good shot at rebuilding or it would probably be a one-person effort and you will succumb to passiveness after some time.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>He must know that this relationship has hit an iceberg and repair must be done.</strong></span><br><br>P.S: Humans are so often self-absorbed - they think so much about themselves that they wouldn't bother what their love truly needs. If love was enlightened, maturity would have understood that love that must go... will go... and that everything that coerced it to remain will be futile.<br><br>First sight of love... last breath of wisdom...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Kicking in his own set of doubts and confusions for the relationship...

            <div class='col-md body'>sassysapphire86, this issue somehow strikes a very deep chord with me and I hope the insight I could offer will help somewhat.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Just thought I'd give a brief account of myself for you to draw any parallels that might be applicable in your case.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> In my case, she was someone I knew in my teens(in fact, since we were both 14) and I guess a reason I never committed myself to her - in spite of the numerous hints she dropped along the way - then(make that throughout our teenage years) was the question that shrouded our future : literally in every sense of the word from whether she was what I wanted for a soulmate to more practical issues like what would happen a decade from then(I mean not too many teens could actually pan out a career/life they see themselves having 10-20 years down the road, could they?) and whether we could find a consensus as to where we would like to settle down(we both did not see ourselves staying in Singapore for good, although we could never seem to agree - or maybe we hadn't really given that a serious thought then - where we'd like to call home) if we ever got together, among a host of other issues. In truth, I never had doubts she'd excel in her academics and life(and as I found out after we got together much later, neither did she harbour any doubts about my academic potential) even at 14, so academic concerns were never much of an issue here. Nevertheless, we did become very good friends, but we were never - not officially by mutual consent, anyway  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> - romantically involved until we were in college.<br><br>That said, when we eventually got together, it was still sort of a long distance relationship(well, maybe not as far apart as yours in question, but I'm pretty sure you've got a rough idea of the distance between Philadelphia and California - more specifically, between UPenn and Stanford - considering you've been studying in the US), although I must stress in my case the fact that both parties wanted to try and make this work made a hell of a difference - the relationship's still going strong now. More importantly, in retrospect(and this is a perspective I hadn't thought of in my teens), I'm glad we never actually got together in our teens as - for one reason or another - I think chances of a relationship working out would have been much slimmer and had that happened, we would probably have lost each other a very good and capable friend too. Perhaps, to put it succinctly, had we made a commitment when we weren't really ready for the relationship, we wouldn't have given this a fair chance of working out. (Feel free to PM me should you need an opinion on how to keep a long-distance relationship going)<br><br>I suppose your case isn't all that alien in that you accepted him knowing who he was - now, it's just a matter of reassessing your priorities and decide for yourself whether you've got a future together. If you figured you'd be better off parting ways, I suppose you've got to let him know somehow(regardless of how badly you think he'll react). That said, if you both figured there's actually a future for you, I suppose it'd only be fair that both of you did your darnest to make this work...</div>
