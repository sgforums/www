How goth is related to metal?<br>why is there gore? why the blood bath? whatever angst intrigued?<br><br>i digress..<br><br>c'mon, sg is so conservative. and regarding the music scene - radio statins are one of the worse pain to the ears. They play mainstream and are totally annoying.<br><br>kids go mcr when the stations play; but  do they really know what is emo, emocore, metalcore and such?<br><br>No; they don't. but the worst are the fuckin' cheenas, the mats and minahs.<br><br>how sad.</div>

How goth is related to metal?<br>why is there gore? why the blood bath? whatever angst intrigued?<br><br>i digress..<br><br>c'mon, sg is so conservative. and regarding the music scene - radio statins are one of the worse pain to the ears. They play mainstream and are totally annoying.<br><br>kids go mcr when the stations play; but  do they really know what is emo, emocore, metalcore and such?<br><br>No; they don't. but the worst are the fuckin' cheenas, the mats and minahs.<br><br>how sad. </div></blockquote>Come on, MCR ain't emo to speak of and they are too mainstream. And singapore radio play all is those very very very mainstream rock bands, so boring. If the rest choose to be poseurs, let them be they are just lost sheeps following the crowd on what's the lastest trend, which make them no identity and just following what's 'in'. And goths scare me, I am afraid of them.....</div>

So in rock it's better to be unmainstream.</div>
