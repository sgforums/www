            <div class='col-md body'><br>Recently, i got a temp from a particular agency to work  for a company, which has directly hired me b-4. However, this agency has set a condition that we have to work beyond a 44 (9hrs * 5) hrs a wk in order to claim the balance OT pay.<br><br>This leads me to a few issues. Firstly, the normal working hr is from 8.30am to 6.15 &amp; if i start work on wed, &amp; let say if i work beyond to 9 or 10pm (OT), from wed to fri, 12 hrs per day including of normal working hours &amp; OT hours which only accumulate ard 36 hrs for 3 days. This mean that 36 hrs is only based only on my basic pay /hr &amp; are not inclusive of my OT charges. In another word, the agency will only pay me under normal rates.<br><br>Secondly, if that a day in week happen to fall on a PH, which mean to acheive a minimum of 44hrs in order to claim our OT pay is seem almost impossible. Example, 9hrs* 4days = 36hrs.<br><br>Previously, when i was working with this company, the calculation of pay is rather direct &amp; explicit, which easily differential bet normal working hrs &amp; OT hrs, but now they outsource their HR to the agency, things is never like b-4, for instance, they do not hav the minimum 44 hrs condition.<br><br>I yet to speak to the person in charge of this job, as i hope to gather more knowledge &amp; reference b-4 i can proceed to argue on the behalf of my employees as well as for me.<br><br>Here to seek ur advice.</div>

The reason why i feel exploited because i used to work directly under this company, without contraint of a 44 hrs week. So given a example, from mon- thu, if u working continously 10 hrs daily (inclusive of 1 hr OT), &amp; fri is a PH, which is not required to come back for work, thus the overall clocking hr is only 40 hrs.</div>

If according to what u say, the company have the right to disallow its temp staff from working OT, if the staff does not produce satisfactory performance or right working attitutde.<br><br>It's unfair to say the temps can just work for a few days &amp; work to cliam OT. It's the comitttment from the start that make the company hired u.
