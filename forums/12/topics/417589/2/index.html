              <p>since he attends dating events, it means that he got a pool of women to choose from<br>so he will have a list of women he is interested in</p>

              <p>I joined a dating event recently. He contacted me after the event, stating that he wants to know me better. However, he has never asked me out. During our online conversation, it was just purely casual and he didnt ask me many questions to know me better. However, he would often flirt with me online and hinted that we could hang out one day. I thought he was interested to know me better and had some romantic interest in me. But the date invitation never came.. He only attended a group outing. Many times, he gave excuses.</p>
              <p>I thought that he wanted to go out with me. Hence, i asked him out for dinner, hang-outs on 4 to 5 occasions. He will declined me politely. There was once he agreed but he played me out at the very last minute. Yet despite his rejections, he still continue to suggest that we could hang out some day.</p>
              <p>I am very unhappy and frustrated. He asked me to consider going out with other guys and that why i feel he is suitable for me. I am upset because he hasn't know me in person and yet, he has already written me off based on our 10 minutes conversation in the dating event. In that case, why did he choose to contact me after the event, and still flirt with me? if he is totally does not want to go out with me on an one-to-one basis.</p>
              <p>I thought he is a nice guy and I could know him better, even as a friend. But, he hasnt even know me well and has already rejected me as a person, and totally dismiss me. or the idea of us going out. I am very sad. why is this so?</p>

              <p>1) He apparently isn't interested. This might probably affect your ego a little ;-) but it has happened to most girls, even the really good looking ones.</p>
              <p>2) It doesn't have to be the "looks" of a girl that makes the guy disinterested. Sometimes a guy approaches a girl because he is in fact, attracted by her appearances, but decides later that she isn't suitable afterall. The rule of the dating game for girls is to keep your dignity.</p>
              <p>3) A consolation - If he's pulling a partner out of a list he's made and has already crossed you out, then consider yourself lucky. Because this is just the first step in a relationship and you have a long way to go. If a man is not extremely interested in a woman and simply accepts her basing on her "merits" on his list, he might turn his back on her later on in the relationship once problems start to occur. And problems will definitely occur in relationships. It's only when a man truly loved a woman that he will try to overcome the problems.</p>

              <p>I joined a dating event recently. He contacted me after the event, stating that he wants to know me better. However, he has never asked me out. During our online conversation, it was just purely casual and he didnt ask me many questions to know me better. However, he would often flirt with me online and hinted that we could hang out one day. I thought he was interested to know me better and had some romantic interest in me. But the date invitation never came.. He only attended a group outing. Many times, he gave excuses.</p>
              <p>I thought that he wanted to go out with me. Hence, i asked him out for dinner, hang-outs on 4 to 5 occasions. He will declined me politely. There was once he agreed but he played me out at the very last minute. Yet despite his rejections, he still continue to suggest that we could hang out some day.</p>
              <p>I am very unhappy and frustrated. He asked me to consider going out with other guys and that why i feel he is suitable for me. I am upset because he hasn't know me in person and yet, he has already written me off based on our 10 minutes conversation in the dating event. In that case, why did he choose to contact me after the event, and still flirt with me? if he is totally does not want to go out with me on an one-to-one basis.</p>
              <p>I thought he is a nice guy and I could know him better, even as a friend. But, he hasnt even know me well and has already rejected me as a person, and totally dismiss me. or the idea of us going out. I am very sad. why is this so?</p>
