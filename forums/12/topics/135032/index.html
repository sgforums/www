            <div class='col-md body'>hi pple. uh.. ok.. a short story of mine. ive been going steady with this guy for 6months already. in school, we seldom talk. when we see each other, we jus walk RIGHT PAST. no hellos or anything. yea but of cos we do meet after school and go out together. the problem is.. well i think he is spending really alot more time with his friends than me.. which leads me to feeling neglected. i've never felt this way before.. its like.. well, things were fine for the first few months.. only recently..<br><br>last month, he went out with girls, and he didnt tell me. okay i admit maybe im holding him too tightly, i hate to see him with girls, and vice versa. but still i found out, and was pretty pissed. but i already told him i'd changed for him.. i'll be more reasonable, i'll let him go out with anyone he desires as long as he tells me where and who is he with. thats all i needa know. im tryin to control my jealousy here. and he used to be a casanova.. even when he's got a gf, he still go around sms, call girls 'dear' and more. but now he changed already, for the better.. i hope.<br><br>weeks ago, something happened and we broke up. but after that, we patched again. since we patched, we had never meet up. cos chinese o was coming. we had no time for each other. and im glad chinese o's over now. then.. i told him i feel that we're really distant now.. and we really should meet up one of these days to catch up.. i miss him alot. and he said yes, he feels it too. but he donno wat to do.. okay fine, den i told him we'll jus go on, let time takes place and see wat happens.<br><br>but.. well.. i still do feel a HUGE HUGE gap and insecurity in me. im afraid he'll go back to his old ways, im afraid he'll do unfaithful acts behind me. not that i dont trust him, but he DID it before.. im jus worried. sighs.. and i really don like him spending so much time with his frens.. i do feel neglected. i told him all about how i felt, all he said was sorry. i cant bear to put him down, i dunno why. he seems less interested and doesnt pays much attention to me anymore.. i really cherish this r/s.. as much as i love him, i don wish to end it..<br><br>sighs.. i think his heart's already half dead.. and the things we do when we meet, are pretty much of a routine. each morning i receive his sms.. den sometimes like nth much to chat about, unlike other couples. i think now we're still together he's only 'fu yan' me.. yes i know.. it reali hurts.. but.. i cant seem to let him go..<br><br>what do i do.... i feel and fear this r/s might be ending soon.. sighs..</div>
