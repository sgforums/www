I have studied correctly. The main problem is what i faced is during the exam. What i have study went blank in my mind, out of sudden. i am back to old one.It is torturing to sit for 3 hours, staring at the paper, while other are scrible their exam. I feel so scared it happen again.  I really make my effort to study before and i am not stress during exam. I can't recall anything. I hold my pen. I couldn't write. Even if i manage to write, i can answer those not so complicate questions. I hand out with a almost empty paper.

Bach, Einstein and Shakespeare were all geniuses in their own rights(and very much only in their fields of specialisation) if their IQ's are anything to go by, but that hardly means they would have thrived in Singapore's education system where diversity and an being a good all-rounder are essential keys to surviving the system. Hence, I don't think you're stupid just because you aren't doing well in your exams.<br><br>Truth be told, I think you're just placing yourself under excessive - and unnecessary - pressure to excel and have used the results/standards of your classmates as a benchmark. It's important to understand it's not necessarily a healthy thing to use others as a yardstick for you to match in terms of measuring your achievements as failure to match such standards will often only result in the pressure you place on yourself intensifying - and this becomes a vicious cycle. Honestly, you should just prepare for exams as best you could and look/analyse your own failings rather than how others are doing(ie.go through the questions and try to understand why you got them wrong so that you really learn something from it rather than plainly condemning yourself just because you've got 20 marks shy of XYZ).<br><br>Of course, in the process, another thing you ought to look at would be your method of studying - no one method works perfectly for everyone and no one ever assured the chap who spent the most time studying of the best grades. Hence, it's absolutely essential that you work smart - rather than hard - and try to discover the method which works most effectively for you to try to help you study more productively and effectively.<br><br>Last but not least, there really is no point feeling pessimistic, hopeless or being a defeatist - you could certainly start by first believing in your own abilities and have the confidence to believe your goals are attainable. Afterall, hard work can never compensate for pessimism and a lack of self-belief... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, general exam tips are great, but if you want to improve your writing style and critical thinking, the only way to achieve this is by reading.<br><br>Start with newspapers, novels, or anything you can get your hands onto. Once you get into the habit, it'll be a great alternative to watching soap operas, or other such time wasters. I find that Singaporeans seldom read anything but self-help guidebooks or their required textbooks. Having a good command of english can often mask inadequate exam preparation. Trust me, I should know.<br><br>Never to late to start as well. I was in the bottom of my classes in sec school, but turned myself around. Now I'm finally done with exam week and just waiting for my graduation ceremony getting my BA.<br><br>Cheers,<br>Kivi</div>

Just take it as that. (A lot of people told me this actually, but it didn't help me, however I hope it helps you.)   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>Listen to Baroque/classical music when studying, if possible before your exam day, or just before the exam. Works for some people. I wasn't a great performer at school but everytime I studying I had classical music in the background to help me relax. Then when I sat for the exam, I could sort of imagine that music playing in the background, it helped me relax. I recommend Pachelbel's Canon in D.<br><br>You could also suck on a sweet just before the exam, it may calm your nerves.<br><br>You can also reinforce yourself with positive thoughts during studying and during the exam. Don't condemn yourself. Just keep saying things like, "This is easy," "I can do this..." "I know this, I just have to think it through a while and it will come to me..."<br><br>Regarding passages, I think all you need is focus. Skim throught the intro and conclusion to get the main point of the passage, before you go on to the body. Write down your thoughts as you read. Similarly, when writing something, think of your conclusion first, write it out. What do you want to tell the examiner? The main points? Then you can work upwards from there.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I think one way to help yourself study better is to reward yourself. Reward yourself with treats like your favorite chocolates or cakes when you finish an alloted section of your studies. It worked for me.<br><br>Ok, I know I'm being selfish by asking you a question completely non-benefitting to you. Would you mind if your bf or somebody you like calls you out of the blue?</div>
