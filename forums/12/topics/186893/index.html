Mind went blank because the questions asked is not what I expected.<br>I was stunned for 30 mins before I can write something out of nothing.<br>I did studied and prepare well for this paper, but the flow is not there. I guess it's quite similiar to your situation right?<br><br>What I think for many students are trying to pre-prepared answer during the exam. Trying to memorise some answers from the past year papers and when the question in the exam tries twist and turn, you find yourself unable to adapt to the situation.<br><br>For certain universities, they are much particular in the way you tackle the questions, you have to answer to what the question asked, otherwise you are considered out of pointers or wont get you very much.<br><br>For example if question asking for As, but you give alot about Bs and few As, that wont impresess the examiner.<br><br>In fact, all of us including have fears and tends to be stiff during the exam and I understand how you feel as I'm one of them also. Just be calm and don't be too nervous, get sufficient sleep the night before the exam. Don't give yourself too much pressure and try to relax as much as you can. Try to read and understand the question and know what the quation is asking for. U can always write in point forms on your question paper and slowly explore and expansion your points into essay type.<br><br>Maybe, you can try to practise writing some essay as it will make your writing more smooth and less stiff.<br></div>
