              <p>hi,</p>
              <p>Im a chinese guy in my 20s. i have been secretly crossdressing since i was about 14 years old, and have been leading this sort of hidden identity for all this while.</p>
              <p>I started getting involved with men sexually about 2 years back, and I wouldd say that I love men more than anything else in my life at this point of time. I simply wake up each day, looking forward to dressing sexy n getting men into my bed.</p>
              <p>The thing is, I have been hiding this hiiden life all this while. I feel very tired of pretending to be a str8 guy. Furthermore, Im tired of having to meet guys secretly, such as when no1 is home...blah. In short, I amtired of hiding. I have not many friends, so I am not scared of losing friends. I am only afraid of telling my family.</p>
              <p>My partners have been encouraging me to come open, but I m afraid. I know my mum will never be able to accept it if I told her... and I love her, so I dont want to hurt her. But I am so tired of hiding...</p>
              <p>What should I do???</p>

              <p>Your undoing is your fear(s) of being rejected by your family and society. It is understandable but if you do not risk in spite of rejections - it is going to never end.</p>
              <p>Also, repression is extremely unhealthy cos it causes a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">split</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">within one</span> and one may pretend, ignore or deny - but for how long? As it is, reading your .... it split within is palpable.</p>
              <p>Hence, it would be wiser to unlearn what you have been taught ''to be'' to ''fit'  and be you.</p>
              <p>It is telling of what you assume to be love when it is not. Lust is not love and considering your age - it is not wrong but acknowledge it as lust.</p>
              <p>Your claims of you ''loving'' your mother is not love lah, but the ''need'' for validation, the ''need'' to be accepted that has been misconstrued as you loving her. If you love her, what she or others think of you - no longer matters. Of course, it presupposes that you are <strong>self-fulfilled</strong> and courageous to be you. When another fulfils you or something ''outside of you'' fulfils you - it is not self-fulfilment but ''other-fulfilment" which would eventually derail and anxiety would be the mainstay lah.</p>
              <p>Anguish is always of the past and anxiety (fear) of the future. Reconcile to these dichotomizing polarities and allow yourself to be.</p>
              <p> Unless your being u or doing something encroaches on another space to be or do. If the latter is true in your experience - unlearn and not repeat again lah</p>
              <p>How can you love someone when you are so confused, feeling ''guilty'', feeling that you are ''hiding'' .... love does not hurt, it is the expectations of what was or what it should be (expectations) and comparing and most of all the ''compromising'' that is bandied about as love.</p>
              <p>As to whether you want to be you and risk and still be you it is up to you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>PS - There are only two types of people in this world - one lives out of love n the other lives out of fear. On the surface, it may not show but in situations/circumstances it will reveal and exhibit and manifest what one is all about.</p>

              <p>It is better to seek professional advice on what are your options. But just to let you know, our society is not liberal enough to accept what people call homosexual. Your past experiences may have also affected your opinions on love.</p>

              <p>Test water first. If your mother can't take this sort of shock. Then keep it from her first.What I'm going to say is most probably not going to go down very well with most people here.</p>
              <p>Think for yourself and for your partner. Mummy is not always going to be there with you for your entire life, your decision would surely be faced with a lot of objections, but ultimately, I believe mothers always wants the best for their child, and ultimately, for them to be happy.</p>
              <p>Though everyone of us are being tied down by filial piety, your happiness is equally important too. If you are able to forgo your happiness and be filial, go ahead. You would know better in what you want for life. =) </p>

              <p>When one lives with what is ''right'' or ''wrong'' - one never gets to live.</p>
              <p>Of course, the easiest way is to keep your escapades a ''secret' and enjoy both worlds - one of ''family'' and one of the ''other''. Rite or wrong - no such thing - as LONG AS what one does or be DOES NOT ENCROACH but it takes lots of courage to be able to juggle and still maintain an equilibrium of sanity!</p>
              <p>Also, there would come a ''time'' when resentment would build up for what u cannot express or be if u choose to be secretive or deny that longing to be you. It is easier to apportion blame but remember that all said and done - it is self-created and yours to own.</p>

              <p>If you want to let your mum know without giving her a heart attack, start small first.</p>

              <p>thanks for ur replies. nothing happedned to me when i was 14. i just grew up to feel i was more feminine than manly. i admit, i am not very proud of wat iam, but it is not something i can control.  i have talked to some of my frens, who have also warned me abput going open about  my hidden self. i also admit that i am scared, rather than unsure of being what i am.</p>
              <p>In agree that i am actually more concerned about my fears. i have so many things i want to do openly. but i am scared.  actually after reading what TYING replied, i sort of agreed that menr more important to me in life. i know that without my mum, i can live well, but without men, i do not think life is meanigful.mayb i should just goahead n tellher te truth?</p>

              <p>hi,</p>
              <p>Im a chinese guy in my 20s. i have been secretly crossdressing
              since i was about 14 years old, and have been leading this sort of
              hidden identity for all this while.</p>
              <p>I started getting involved with men sexually about 2 years back,
              and I wouldd say that I love men more than anything else in my life
              at this point of time. I simply wake up each day, looking forward
              to dressing sexy n getting men into my bed.</p>
              <p>The thing is, I have been hiding this hiiden life all this
              while. I feel very tired of pretending to be a str8 guy.
              Furthermore, Im tired of having to meet guys secretly, such as when
              no1 is home...blah. In short, I amtired of hiding. I have not many
              friends, so I am not scared of losing friends. I am only afraid of
              telling my family.</p>
              <p>My partners have been encouraging me to come open, but I m
              afraid. I know my mum will never be able to accept it if I told
              her... and I love her, so I dont want to hurt her. But I am so
              tired of hiding...</p>
              <p>What should I do???</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> You got to consider your overall intention well because once you decide on your course of action, there is no turning back. Knowing your real identity is important, but you must be prepared that once you open that first door, all the other doors will open by itself because words will definitely travel and you cannot control them, even if you told only your mother/parents. </p>
              <p>Some people can continue life in this fashion, while others have a need to make it open so as to 'reveal' this real identity of theirs. In reality, there is no easy solution, only decision that you are comfortable to undertake after you put in serious consideration.</p>
              <p>Be prepared for backlash should you decide to tell.</p>
              <p>The cost of liberty is often much sacrifices. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>My signature previously was "Your misson in life is not to be without problems, your mission is to be excited." This quote is from one of Andrew Matthews books.</p>
              <p>You are born into a situation. Your mission is to deal with it. Not curse it. If you are defeated by your situation, you are going to feel worthless.</p>
              <p>Your situation gives you a goal in life, and that is to overcome it. Do that and you will become stronger and wiser.</p>
              <p>What do you want?</p>
              <p>I only see fear fear fear in you.</p>
              <p>The opposite of fear is not courage. Courage means acting in the face of fear.</p>
              <p>The opposite of fear is love. Love makes you grow, fear restricts you.</p>
              <p>Love yourself first, and get for yourself what you want.</p>
