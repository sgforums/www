Your life is in a mess.<br>She is sympathetic but at the same time, your plight serves as a much needed Â“ego boosterÂ” for her.<br><br>She needs to rebuild her self confidence after a failed relationship. And there is nothing more satisfying to see how much you are affected by it.<br><br>Now she can feel that the tide is turning, that loss of power over you frustrates her.<br><br>So CuriousOrange is saying that she is sympathetic but seems to be "gloating" over your misfortune at the same time.<br><br>Sounds ironic doesn't it?<br><br>But most of the time, humans cannot help but react subconsciously to situations presented to them.<br><br>What IÂ’m trying to explain to you is a subtle but important difference.<br><br>She wants that control she has over you but it doesnÂ’t mean she still loves you.<br><br>If you ask her to patch up with you again, she will most probably say no.<br><br><strong>Life doesnÂ’t have a rewind button.

I just answer her questions and turn away.<br>I find it very wierd that she will be affected by the fact that i talk to other gals thats y i was hoping if there is any way to find out if she still likes me. My instincts not very accurate so i dun want to risk asking her cos there is a possibility that it is coincidence that she banged the things.</div>

Sometimes i know the answer but just need others to knock some sense into me.  I was fine over the last two weeks or so hanging out with friends but now her behaviour at work is unsettling me.<br>She used to be the guai guai type but recently her mobile keeps ringing at work and she will talk very near me to let me overhear her meeting ppl. One of her reasons for breaking up is she has no time for me but now i always hear her meeting her friends over the phone. Dunno if i am sensitive or she trying to play mind games very me. How come some one u think u know very well can become so different after breaking up? Dunno wat she is thinking any more.</div>
