Even though it might be no coincidence that she banged the things while you were on the phone with other girls, it certainly don't have to mean that she's interested in you.<br><br>And remember the depression state you were in. Depression is certainly no joking matter. Chances are things won't be anywhere too near to the bright side. I would personally say it's not worth any of the venture at all.</div>

Though this might not be exactly the picture, but it's probably not too far off from the truth?<br><br>Of course, I would have to add on my personal comment that there're quite alot of facts which you've decided to hold back from us in the 1st place? It won't be quite fair for us to give a proper overall advice for you based on that fact alone. Anyway.. If you feel that all's in the past and you would not like to talk about them anymore, I would respect your decision for that? But in any case, do keep them IN your past?<br><br>It would certainly sounds weird and funny if you've decided to let your past comes out and back to haunt you while hiding things from us..? I don't see how much we can really help based on that?</div>

Accept these reasons and donÂ’t dwell further into the matter.<br><br>That msn incident is a catalyst, not a cause. The red light in your relationship with her appeared in the first 2 months. You were oblivious to that until now.<br><br>The more you dwell on things, the more confused you will be.<br>The less thought you give this question, the faster you can move on.<br><br>I sympathize with your current plight more than anything else. Complication sets in when you have face this person everyday. That is why you requested her to resign.<br><br><strong><br>But out of sight does not mean out of mind.<br>Try to detach yourself from the possibilities from now on.
