For your case, I noticed some incompatibility there....based upon what you found out about her, its gonna get much worse problems....you see, you discovered more about her everyday....more to come....Give it a try....if you really got issues with what you found, then let go....</p>

              <p>After knowing her as a friend, he was shocked that her personality was so horrible! The moral of the story is: you'll never know a person until you been with them for quite a while...even that, there's no guarantee you'll like what you've found out ! Many people put on "masks" to hide their true identity....the face they put upfront for people to see...it maybe a defence mechanism...so its wise to invest some time into knowing her well...before you plan about marriage...</p>

              <p>I have a friend who sort of have an infatuation problem...the
              fact is he has been liking this girl for at least 2 years before he
              plucked up enough courage to talk to her....guess what?</p>
              <p>After knowing her as a friend, he was shocked that her
              personality was so horrible! The moral of the story is: you'll
              never know a person until you been with them for quite a
              while...even that, there's no guarantee you'll like what you've
              found out ! Many people put on "masks" to hide their true
              identity....the face they put upfront for people to see...it maybe
              a defence mechanism...so its wise to invest some time into knowing
              her well...before you plan about marriage...</p>
