When you have them.. you won't cherish.. when you lose them.. you treasure it so much.. but afterall.. what's the point... chances have been given to you.. but you never cherish it.. never wants to correct the mistakes you've done..<br><br>Go to the place you are going.. during these period of time.. let soul come back from the painful moments you had.. Reflect yourself and learn from the lesson that had taught.. never to let history repeat ever agian! find your own living.. and start fresh ahead..<br><br>If she's living happily.. let her go.. this is the best gift you've given to her.. if ever you meet her anywhere.. give her the best smile.. and the best wishes to her.. she will feel glad.. and happy for you.. at least.. both won't remember the hurt that much.. and being as friends will be more easier.. she's happy.. you too will be happy.. when you are fully awake from all these miserys~<br><br>Cheers.. pal..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

If can, include one of her favourite picture of the two of you together and...apologise to her on the back of the photograph by writing some lines in it.
