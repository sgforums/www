However, it's not with your sister being possibly lesbian - it's with the fact that you are in a position to think this way.<br><br>To clarify that last sentence, it appears that there might be a two reasons for you to think that there is a major problem:<br>1) you believe that your parents will see lesbiansim as a bad thing, and that you will ultimately be held accountable by them for any outcome<br>2) you yourself believe that lesbianism is a bad thing<br><br>In the first case, you have been put in that position, and in the second case, you have taken that stand up by your own volition.  Whoever is responsible needs to realise that at the end of the day, they're really not in control of such things anyway and passing judgement on it will do more harm than good.<br><br></div>

If she's sensible enough, she'll understand and try not to hurt your parents again lor, but I think it's hard for a 14 yrs old to understand that lah. What i'll do is keep it from my parents and hope that she'll grow out of it fast lor.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i love my parents too and i do not advocate being unfilial to them, but the thing is i have experienced 1st hand, the effects of misguided, misinformed and biased "guidance" from them, and it near alienated me from them. Simply put, things are never black and white. If u decide to rule with an iron fist, regardless of your good intentions or your views and beliefs, then prepare for some really nasty fallout.</div>
