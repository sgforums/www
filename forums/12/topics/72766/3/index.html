Despite their best intentions and their blaming themselves, they placed a judgement upon you - make no mistake about that.  There's the problem that you need to focus upon, because, as you can see, their judgement led them to take corrective actions that had a very negative effect on you.<br><br>Attending to the symptoms of the problem instead of the problem's source is about as useful as sticking a band-aid on a cancer patient.  As you can see, it may have cleared things up between your parents and yourself (with dire consequences for you), but because they did not attend to the cause of the problem the last time, they now have to go through the whole thing again.  And after this is done, what next?  Will they then have to go through the whole rigmarole all over again if you or your sister happen to be pointed in a direction that they don't approve of?<br><br>Focus on the source of the problem and get it out of the way once and for all.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Invaa, with all due respect, one cannot afford to oversimplify this matter.  Remember that what we have here is a girl who is in the stage of developing her identity.  This is the worst possible time to risk damaging her belief that she can make her own choices and form an identity that is entirely hers, rather than something that is imposed by someone in a tenuous position of authority.  You would be risking a long-term loss in favour of a short-term gain.</div>

It's not a matter of being pro- or anti-lesbian.<br><br>You can't deal with this issue by taking the short view, because what you're dealing with here is a matter of a person's identity.  Besides, shopgirl has already described how her family has dealt with such issues in the past, and as you can see, the dyke issue was "fixed", but not without causing a whole lot of damage, which in my view was unnecessary.  Over and above that, there is the question of what right one person has to impose values on another, even if they are family members.<br><br>In light of these three issues, I hope you can see how the presented issue of lesbianism is in fact only the tip of the iceberg.</div>
