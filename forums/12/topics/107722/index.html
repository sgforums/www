            <div class='col-md body'>Meh. last week my "mother" and i were supposed to go on holiday. But i dreaded going with her coz we would argue. Over here in sg, we always argue in the car most of the time over some pathetic trivial request she makes of me which i have absolutely no interest in. And she would shout and get LOUDER, and eventually when she stops i would get out of the car to escape it all, getting nearly run over.<br><br>Once she kept going on and on while driving, meh.. women can multi-task, that i got so pissed off i kicked the wind screen in to get her to shut up. It shattered and that got her only more furious lol. THat was one time i nearly lost my life getting out of the car and running away from her. Nowadays, my dad nor me go with her in the car, not even for short lifts. I only went last week to get my passport with hers on the same day, and we argued over the prices of computers in beijing.. or something ffs.<br><br>On the night of our departure, i was supposed to go with her. Trouble is the night before the departure, she and i had some fucked up arguement. I was packing my suitcase, and she was packing food ffs lol, god knows why, and she couldn't squeeze all of it in, and she was trying to get me to pack "her stuff".<br><br>I was like, calmly, "no, this is my suitcase, i want to pack only my things in there.." then she gives this asian uncomfortable silence thingy,, and i go back to my room to pack, then i hear this asian SHRIEKING voice "No point in going! Blah blah blah."<br><br>I come out of the room, and tell her "LOok, we haven't even left and already we are argueing, maybe i should not go if you are going to behave like this..i mean... ok fine, how about i give you my suitcase, and i pack my things in my own sports bags, oK? Happy?"<br><br>Then she's like "FOrget it! Don't go, don't go!!" So i say fine, its ok with me, i stop packing. Then throughout the night she smses me to pack my things and all, i say no, coz i don't want to get into fucking arguements, a holiday is a thing where you go with people you LIKE, otherwise its a HELLIDAY, am i right? SO in the morning she went alone, coz she apparently could not promise what i requested "normal civilised non shouting behaviour, no argueming and very little communication with me if i go".<br><br>Then throughout the week, she tells me i should go coz i am missing an experiene and stuff, she also promised to be nice and not talk to me unneccessarily as i requests, basically the promise i asked her for the night of her departure. So i am lik WTF!?!? Why NOW? ffs, i have plans, go out with people and all? And now this shit? Jesus christ.<br><br>But then i start thinking, i guess the things i can do here with whatever few friends i have, my productions and stuff, can be done when i return from this trip. Whereas i may not have another chance to see beijing again, especially when i go into the army. SO i decided to go, got my ticket re-valued and leaving soon.<br><br>Do i sound weird?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Nope. Not at all.<br><br>But i'll still be a bit weary if i were you. Sometimes its hard to understand people who are double our age. They change their minds, and their moods at the drop of a pin.<br><br>But you're right, you'll probably not going to see Beijing anytime soon, and i would go too.<br><br>Remember to take more pictures!
