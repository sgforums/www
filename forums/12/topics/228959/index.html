            <div class='col-md body'>... but it'll make me feel better. I need to let it out, the words struggling in me deep down.<br><br>Here goes..<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">It doesnÂ’t matter the things IÂ’ve done, or the things IÂ’ve chosen not to do.. because whatever IÂ’ve done, I musta done something right to end up with you..<br><br>Im sorry for the times you felt neglected. But why didnÂ’t you tell me so? WeÂ’d always said to talk things out, to open up more, to communicate, to understand. How come we never get them done?<br>How did we ever end up like this? I really wonder how you are now.<br><br>I regret not telling you how I feel deep down always, that now, it is so hard to even try to open my mouth and speak to you. Friends say I should stop hiding myself in one corner, I NEED to VOICE OUT. I need to make myself more significant. But I donÂ’t know how.<br><br>For the moments we had together, I daresay I truly cherished every bit, deep down. I know I may not say it nor even show it out... well, doesnÂ’t matter as long as I know.. it was a path we took together I felt worthwhile.<br><br>My actions and words have made you numb, I wasnÂ’t feeling exactly fine too.<br><br>Tears welled up. Guilt-ridden. Mutual Feelings. Pain. The lonely times. Sorry.<br><br>YouÂ’ve asked for a time-out. Alright. For the past few days, IÂ’d been thinking a lot. IÂ’m scared, IÂ’m afraid. This feeling is almost so familiar. The kind of restlessness and fear.<br><br>You have no idea how much I missed you. As much as I wanted to spend the past few days with you, IÂ’m sorry I donÂ’t have the courage to even ask. What should I say when I see you? How should I behave? Normal? Pissed? Like strangers?<br><br>So many doubts on my mind. I never know the right way to handle them. I always run. I always pretend that everythingÂ’s alright. IÂ’ve always thought that by keeping quiet and just close my eyes, itÂ’ll all go away, and things will be better the next time round. ButÂ… IÂ’m wrong.<br><br>Weakling. Yes, I am.<br><br>Now, keep me anticipating. Set me thinking. Till the time-outÂ’s timeÂ’s up. Till we do THE TALK. Till we can try together againÂ…<br><br>ElseÂ…I just hopeÂ… I will grow from this...</span><br><br>Thanks for letting me 'rant' out, guys.<br>And... I know, zillions &amp; millions of people have said this many many times before, you won't find it true YET. It may just be another sentence going in from your left ear, and out your right. BUT, until you get to realise the true meaning of the quote, it may be too late already.<br><br>That is, CHERISH YOUR LOVED ONES BEFORE THEY'RE GONE.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>sigh........</div>

Everything seems too late now.<br><br>Very very often, I think keeping quiet is the best. If I were to say anything, I find myself thinking so much about the consequences, how will it affect anything then, all that "what if I said ___ and then you ____ and then ____" and it goes on and on.
