Dun say i neber teach u ar!!!! You stay like this u 4eva single. Yes, liking someone does not mean you need to be with her. But liking someone is also being true to urself. If you can't even be true to urself you can forget about being in love for the rest of your life liaoz la. Not sending her home when she sick does not mean end of world ok? Dunnoe phone number. so what? You need some confidence man. Have faith in yourself.</div>
