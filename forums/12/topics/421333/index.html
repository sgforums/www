              <p>Your father got write will or not. Or money given to your mother as survivorship ?</p>
              <p>You know the meaning of inheritance? Both of your parents are still alive, they cannot give you inheritance until they are dead.</p>
              <p>So, when you keep asking your living parents for "inheritance" you are essentially rushing them to their death. That's not a nice thing to do.</p>
              <p>Please gather all your facts first. Ok ? Good.</p>

              <p>You want money from your parents because you cannot work and want to be well provided for ?</p>
              <p>May I ask you, are you going to take care of your parents when they are old and frail ? How are you going to do that when you expect them to take care of you for life ?</p>
              <p>Mentally ill does not means you are physically handicapped or retarded you know. Even the retarded and physically handicapped  are trying their best to find a job and support themselves.</p>

              <p><strong>The more you keep begging from them, the more they wont give to you.</strong></p>

              <p>Edit: A will if done correctly through a credible lawyer, chances are, it will be legit.</p>
              <p>When you go do your Estate planning/Will, a good lawyer will explain what you can or cannot do with your Will. And he will craft the Will according to your wishes but within legal boundaries, taking into account the ISA.</p>
              <p>Other than a Will, CPF nominations, property ownership, Insurance beneficiaries are also to be considered as they are, each stand alone means of asset distribution.</p>
              <p>However,</p>
              <p>So sad to see all these "children" harrassing their own parents for death money.</p>
              <p>Family members fight with other family members for their "share", when they never had to work for it. This sense of entitlement is a <strong>failure</strong> in our culture.</p>
              <p>Since I cannot control who my own money goes to, what's the point of setting up a Will ?</p>
              <p>A whole generation of VULTURES we breed. Circling the sky and swooping down to devour whatever is left of the carcass.</p>
              <p>When I die, I want to die a poor woman. So no one needs to fight over money.</p>

              <p>How are you going to divide it among your children ? Your siblings ? Your relatives ?</p>
              <p>If you have more than one set , multiple ex-spouse, and children from different family... who is going to get what ?</p>
              <p>No matter what you do, your family will never be pleased with the distribution.</p>
              <p>Everyone will think they deserve more than the other recipients. They will justify to themselves why they deserve a bigger share of the pie.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Money will destroy family ties. That's a true hard fact.</p>
