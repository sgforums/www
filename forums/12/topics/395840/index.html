              <p>Boy A and Boy B are best of friends since secondary school. Boy A is my ex-boyfriend.</p>
              <p>My boyfriend has met both of them but decided that he can't take it. My bf doesn't like being friends with Boy A (because he's my ex) and my bf doesn't like me to contact him. Okay, so I don't often contact Boy A but I still contact Boy B.</p>
              <p>Recently, Boy B tells me that he likes me and wants to jio me when I'm single.</p>
              <p>Now the problem is, should I be honest and tell my boyfriend that Boy B said so? Or should I hide from him?</p>
              <p>Why I should tell:1. We have a honesty policy, to share our feelings and not hide anything. 2. Whenever I see my bf, I realy feel like telling him. It's hard to not tell.</p>
              <p>Why I shouldn't tell. 1. I'm not sure if Boy B means what he says. 2. I'm afraid that my bf would become upset and jealous and somehow, don't want me?</p>

              <p><br>Both of u aren't married yet, therefore he has no rights take control over ur decision as to contact ur ex or not. if he gets pissed over every guy who are friends with u and are close to you, then he is a control freak. honesty works only if ur partner is very understanding and has high level of tolerance.</p>

              <p>I'm sorry. I didn't said that I just broke up. I've been with my boyfriend for 7 months already. My relationship with Boy A was nearly 4 years back when I was in secondary school.</p>

              <p><strong>HELLO PEOPLE. :) An update.</strong></p>
              <p><strong>My relationship have ended. Indeed it was the boy who brought it up, but I'm glad. I wasn't happy in our relationship. Now I feel happier and free, like <span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="font-size: xx-small;">è§£è„±.</span></span></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Although it wasn't a best ending, it is still a happy ending to the love story. We're still friends. And yes, I miss him, especially when walking pass the areas that we always hang out. But I know I'll get over the emptiness because I know that both of us are happier in this way. :D</strong></p>
              <p><strong>So people. thank you for your useful advice and everything. This a a closure. :)</strong></p>
              <p>or u went back to the same guy whom u broke up with???</p>

              <p><br>aiya.. its so easy to find ur thread.. just click on ur own username and u can find it...</p>
              <p>B is a plain scheming person la.. targetting u when u are at ur weakest moment... Tell B not to be so despo. U are the only gal in this world meh? Chinese said never touch ur friends wife/gal.. dunno wat the hell is wrong with B. I still believe tat he already wanna u while u were with ur bf.. i wouldnt dare to imagine myself going out with my best fren ex.. </p>
              <p>Honestly i think eventually u'll not last long with ur bf one la... ur bf is younger than u or wat? U in uni (i presume yr 1) already he haven even go NS.. MEans after NS will lag behind u by 3 yrs.. ur earning power etc will all supercede him.. furthermore got so many more matured NSmen in uni.. i m sure u will be attracted to them one la.. since u mentioned u always hang out with guys in ur previous thread... </p>
