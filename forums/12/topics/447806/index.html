              <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>My gf has moved overseas for her studies not too long ago, I'm happy for her and encouraged her to do so because she's doing what she always wanted to do in life. Initially, we decided to put our relationship to rest because her journey there will take probably 6 years, plus a few more years of bond, probably 9 to 10 years. But her her mother spoke to me and said she was disappointed in me told me to hold on if I really loved her. I thought about it and decided to give it a try. So now we are in a LDR</p>
              <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>She's now overseas for about a month plus, but I'm not happy at all. When she's in SG, no matter how tight our schedules were, we'll at least dedicate some time to give each other a call everyday to have some quality catch up. But now, even if free overseas call are available thru viber or skype... we barely even talk in a week. If it's not that she is tired, she'll say she is busy...even during the weekend. It doesn't feel like a relationship at all... Whenever I try to call her to tell her to spare some time for us because I really want to talk to her, it'll turn out to be a fight because she says I'm unreasonable.</p>
              <p><span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>I need some advise and pointers, am I really not understanding and unreasonable?</p>

              <p>Between you and me, here's what I would do. It's not necessary good advice, in fact it may be bad advice, I don't know but here's my honest opinion about what I would do if I were you.</p>
              <p>There is a gap now in the relationship. The gap wasn't created by you. I will find other girls to fill that gap. These girls don't necessary have to be sexual in nature, but usually it will turn out to be so be aware of it. Don't say no lah you can control or what shit, the girl touch here and there and very hard to control ler.</p>
              <p>Also, this softens the pain if one day the girl tell you that she found somebody else. Also it softens the pain of silence where the girl was busy and unable to spend time with you, but you already so many girls, so obviously you won't feel the pain at all.</p>

              <p>How long ago did she move overseas...?</p>
              <p>The reason I ask is because........maybe she still need time to adapt and to settle down....and maybe indeed she is busy..? Probably she need to do her course work, do laundry, cook food, buy new books or new clothes, etc etc......There are many things that are tough when a person move overseas alone.</p>
              <p>Maybe try to be more understanding ?</p>
              <p>After all, your settings and your environment remains the same.....but she has drastic change, so maybe she indeed need more time to settle down, maybe she is still in frantic phase, and just try to give her the space and time and try to be understanding.</p>
              <p>Anyways.....LDR maybe can work, but you must know when the two of you can meetup.....like during holidays, and so on.....if you guys can meetup regularly I believe there is a chance it can work........Regarding the location after she graduate, that is a bit more complicated but that is years from now.......plan so much also difficult.....</p>

              <p>I did tell her how I felt, but she only says I'm not understanding. I tried fixing a time with her, but it doesn't work. She'll either miss the timing or she'll say she's too tired to talk.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>She's actually a Malaysian. When we were tgt, she was initially in Singapore. Now that she's graduated, she's taking up a one year course in Malaysia before heading over to Australia. So I don't think she needs time to suit to the new enviroment because it is her own home.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yet, I really don't understand why it's so hard just to talk to her. I myself am studying, and equally tied down with my work. I am willing just to put aside my work just to catch up with her for a short while to maintain what is left...but y can't she? The total amount of time i talk to her since she went over is barely even 3 hours...</p>

              <p>She's actually a Malaysian. When we were tgt, she was initially in Singapore. Now that she's graduated, she's taking up a one year course in Malaysia before heading over to Australia. So I don't think she needs time to suit to the new enviroment because it is her own home.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yet, I really don't understand why it's so hard just to talk to her. I myself am studying, and equally tied down with my work. I am willing just to put aside my work just to catch up with her for a short while to maintain what is left...but y can't she? The total amount of time i talk to her since she went over is barely even 3 hours...</p>

              <p>Let me share with you about my feeling and thoughts.</p>
              <p>If she cheats on you, she's losing someone important and not worth your time. You could find a better one over here. Give her the benefit of doubt. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif">  Only until you have sufficient evidence to prove that she's cheating on you, then it's not too late yet because you have not commit deeper into marriage.</p>
              <p>A quote which remains in my deep in my heart for quite some time "<em>Never put all the eggs into a single basket</em>". This is an investment quote, but I find it able to apply to both you and my situation. Maybe to put it in a correct manner is, try socialising more <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"> you will gain healthy social life.</p>

              <p>6 years, probably 9 to 10 years???</p>
              <p>You got to wake up man. Where is the future of your relationship heading to?</p>
              <p>One of my close friend was in a long distant relationship between malaysia and singapore for 10 years but at least he goes back to singapore once a month to see his girlfriend. They are now married with two kids.</p>
              <p>But the distant between you and her is too great.</p>
              <p>You must ask yourself - what are your plans for both of you? Do you want to be eventually married? If you keep on going on like this - there is no point.</p>
              <p>Long distant relationships are very tough and hard. My brother also have a girlfriend in Australia. I don't want to divulge too much info but it is not easy.</p>
              <p>I think having an argument over the phone about when to call is very normal.</p>

              <p>Yes, it bye bye time, oversea, especially in the west, there are many nice looking and yet very romantic caucasian guys, your gf is sure to sway away.</p>
              <p>I think before she sway one side, you try to look for another gf first, those that will not go oversea one.</p>
