              <p class="MsoNormal">Long distance relationship won’t work. I have experienced it
              myself.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">My ex-wife went to Australia to further her study just 2
              months after our ROM several years ago. I sponsored her 4 year course.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">Everything was fine at first. We kept in touch frequently
              through phone calls and MSN. I even visited her about 1 year after she went
              there. We were very happy.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">But things started to change by her 2<sup>nd</sup> year
              there. We contacted each other less and less frequently. And the time we spent each
              time talking on the phone or on MSN became less and less. She said she was
              busy. After a while she didn’t call me or initiate MSN chat anymore. I was the
              one who continued to try calling and initiate MSN chat. Many times she did not
              pick up the phone or didn’t reply my MSN messages. She also got <span> </span>easily irritated and annoyed each time we talk
              on the phone if I ever able to get hold of her.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">During her 3<sup>rd</sup> year there, after unable to get in
              touch with her for a few months, I went to Australia to look for her. I went to
              the apartment she stayed the last time I visited her and found out that she had
              moved out more than a year ago. The current tenant gave me her new address and I
              went there to look for her.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">But to my disappointment, I found her living with another
              man there. She introduced that man to me and told me that they were in steady
              relationship. She asked me to just go home. I told her we were still officially
              husband and wife. But she told me she will go back one day to settle this
              matter. I was heart broken and left.</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">She came back 2 years ago to file for divorce. We are now on
              the 3-year official separation and waiting for divorce next year. She’s now
              with yet another man and few months pregnant.</p>

              <p>My gf has moved overseas for her studies not too long ago, I'm
                  happy for her and encouraged her to do so because she's doing what
                  she always wanted to do in life. Initially, we decided to put our
                  relationship to rest because her journey there will take probably 6
                  years, plus a few more years of bond, probably 9 to 10 years. But
                  her her mother spoke to me and said she was disappointed in me told
                  me to hold on if I really loved her. I thought about it and decided
                  to give it a try. So now we are in a LDR</p>
              <p>She's now overseas for about a month plus, but I'm not happy at
                  all. When she's in SG, no matter how tight our schedules were,
                  we'll at least dedicate some time to give each other a call
                  everyday to have some quality catch up. But now, even if free
                  overseas call are available thru viber or skype... we barely even
                  talk in a week. If it's not that she is tired, she'll say she is
                  busy...even during the weekend. It doesn't feel like a relationship
                  at all... Whenever I try to call her to tell her to spare some time
                  for us because I really want to talk to her, it'll turn out to be a
                  fight because she says I'm unreasonable.</p>
              <p>I need some advise and pointers, am I really not understanding
                  and unreasonable?</p>
