            <div class='col-md body'>Panda....<br>What i think is..the girl must make up her mind..."Does she want to wait endlessly for a guy who might never again reciprocate her feelings?" or "Does she want to give another relationship a chance?"<br><br>If she say yes to the first one...then she is foolish...from what i know..guys who cheated on their girlfriends always cheat on them again! It's really not worth the wait...<br><br>If she says yes to the second..then she should put a stop to meeting GUY A ever again..since GUY B is uncomfortable with the idea.Ending the meetings with GUY A will show sincerity to GUY B which i believe will meant a lot to him.<br><br>However, like you said..she is still confused abt the whole thing..I suggest letting her have some time to think about it.<br><br>It is unfair to both the girl herself and GUY B to plunge into a relationship when she still has not let go of GUY A....<br>It will only ends up in a relationship whereby both of you ends up getting hurt and scarred again....</div>

There is a tinge of jealousy at first but then again a r/ship is usually started after an initial stage of good friends. So why not revert to that stage if a r/s cannot work out? Of cos both parties must be willing and it may not be easy but it can surely be done.</div>

My ex and I are still close frens. We still chat over the fone, still go out together... I admit that it's hard to get over the initial stage of awkwardness. I mean there's this memories of both of u holding hands, etc etc. But I think after going out several times, it's all back to normal.<br><br>I think even when both of u are frens already it's a happy thing that both of u get another partner. But there will be a tinge of jealousy, or rather envious though, but this kind of feeling is normal and alright. But if it's the other case of one ditching the other becoz of a 3rd party, I think it will result in anger and not just jealousy.
