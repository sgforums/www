One way is that we all have the three minute fever for something some times right? or a desire to fulfil/get something in life. By attaining these things, which your other half never thought was around before, you can keep his interest in you going, as he will know that he still have not discover you enough, and so both will not get bored.

I would want to go out with my gf and best frens...I would be too tired keeping a watchful eye seeing who is being attracted to who...it happens because pple are never satisfied with wat they have (or at least this applies to pple who stray...)..so there is not way to prevent this from happenning at all.... if it happens then its probably good cos you will know who your frens are...fack them...</div>

Like, take your example? 1 out of 3 points is 'governed' by you... And point 2 somehow there MIGHT be something you can do about it... No hard and fast rules here... You DO have a part to play in the whole picture.. It's not about BLAMING. It's about getting things 'right' and getting things done... Especially for your loved one and the relationship?</div>
