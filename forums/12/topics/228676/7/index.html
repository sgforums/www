To whoever who said it is 'face' thing impt nowadays, and not looking like mummy boy, should there be a balance? If u could join ur families on maybe, X'mas n new year countdowns. Maybe join them for CNY or some other festive seasons. There 11 public holidays for us to mingle with frends and strengthen family bonds at the same time.

            <div class='col-md body'>Imagine how your mother will feel - you volunteer to accompany her, she is so happy. However, the moment you feel that you had the opportunity to 'escape' from this but your sister did not give you that opportunity, you feel aggrieved and upset that you are doing something that SHE could have done.<br><br>It all boils down to - I want to do it, because I love my mother. And if given a choice, I rather spend this time at the RC with my mother THAN my friends, because it means more to me. THIS is the crux of the issue. It is your relationship with your mother that matters, not your sister's relationship with your mother.<br><br>EVEN if your sister is bored at home, don't want to do it, why should you be so upset? It had been your decision to accompany your mom, not hers. Whether she is available or not, whether she wants to nuah at home watch TV or not, what's the issue?<br><br>You can be upset with ur sis about her general state of inconsiderateness and perhaps lack of filial piety. But I feel that from your post, it is not so much her lack of desire to accompany your mom, but that she has the time to do so, but chose NOT TO and THEREFORE deprived you of spending a better time with your friends. Next time try to do things you really willingly want to do, then you will feel that life is so unfair.<br><br>Anyway, like a friend of mine who spent time with his family this year tells me when we asked him out for countdown - New year's eve only what! Every year also have!<br><br></div>
