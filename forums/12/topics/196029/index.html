It's easier said than done whenever people says time will heal all wounds and so on. He will always have a special place in your heart whether you like it or not, all you can do right now is to keep yourself as busy as you can...so that you won't be reminded of the sadness. We felt emotional pain cos our curiousity (silly EVE) subconsciously forces us to seek it and think about it. Crying helps alot...but I don't want to cry alone anymore.<br><br>Feeling sad right now too...why is it that I can help anyone whenever they're having problems but none of them is able to help me when I'm lost?<br><br>I probably already know the answer to my problem....just needed someone to tell me my answer. Guess I've to keep myself busy or sleep till Monday to see if I can feel better.<br><br>No mood to do anything at the moment, just wanna borrow this space here to let go of my frustrations.<br><br></div>
