            <div class='col-md body'>Guardx,<br><br>Most of what the forumers posted here are correct and useful analysis, but may not register well with you...<br><br>Before I propose a solution to you, let's simplify your situation:<br><br>You are an self-proclaimed average guy (in looks and earning power) who wants to be in a relationship with a "good" girl, and doesn't mind "putting in a lot of effort" (to you, that means giving in a lot and buying what she wants  and satisfying her material and physical needs..)<br><br>You are afraid to lose your current gf. After all, you have put in so much effort already (in terms of time and money). Besides, getting another good girl is hard these days, and if your current relationship falls through after so much effort, a future relationship (even if it is one where you put in double the effort) may jolly well be uncertain...  and you attribute the "unfortunate" scenario to the typical moans of an average guy, .... because average guys have to work harder and also fall harder in a relationship..<br><br>==========================<br><br>Based on the 2 above summarizing points, we can infer the following points. Well maybe you would disagree, but I think the forumers here would agree with me.<br><br>You are insecure, because you are afraid to be seen as a failure in any relationship AND it doesn't have to be about your current relationship (one strong clue comes from your own suggestion "how to find another gf fast" )<br><br>You don't truly unconditionally love your gf, like many sensitive forumers like rainee are quick to point out, because we can see that you are fundamentally too insecure to give unconditional love. Insecure people find it hard to love another because they frequently require and demand "ROI" (return on investment) in ways that may NOT seem demanding and unreasonable to them ("after all, I did so much for you, i'm just asking you not to go out with your friends, is that so unreasonable), BUT is downright unreasonable to their partner ("i love dancing and chilling out, why is he so controlling, i hate it" )...<br><br>There may be other factors which we know nothing about, but to summarize....<br><br>Your gf doesn't feel secure with you, because you can't even feel secure with yourself. You meet her material and physical needs, not because you love her but because you are afraid. Hence you do not meet her emotional needs...<br><br>Have you really tried to understand her, like one forumer has put it earlier..<br><br>You didn't say this in your post, but we can guess. It is a possibility that you have been trying to control her actions and justifying it, which she resents a lot.<br><br>==============<br>Your solution IS<br><br>Focus on your own character deficiencies and try to improve them.

After all, you have put in so much effort already (in terms of time and money). Besides, getting another good girl is hard these days, and if your current relationship falls through after so much effort, a future relationship (even if it is one where you put in double the effort) may jolly well be uncertain...  and you attribute the "unfortunate" scenario to the typical moans of an average guy, .... because average guys have to work harder and also fall harder in a relationship..<br><br>==========================<br><br>Based on the 2 above summarizing points, we can infer the following points. Well maybe you would disagree, but I think the forumers here would agree with me.<br><br>You are insecure, because you are afraid to be seen as a failure in any relationship AND it doesn't have to be about your current relationship (one strong clue comes from your own suggestion "how to find another gf fast" )<br><br>You don't truly unconditionally love your gf, like many sensitive forumers like rainee are quick to point out, because we can see that you are fundamentally too insecure to give unconditional love. Insecure people find it hard to love another because they frequently require and demand "ROI" (return on investment) in ways that may NOT seem demanding and unreasonable to them ("after all, I did so much for you, i'm just asking you not to go out with your friends, is that so unreasonable), BUT is downright unreasonable to their partner ("i love dancing and chilling out, why is he so controlling, i hate it" )...<br><br>There may be other factors which we know nothing about, but to summarize....<br><br>Your gf doesn't feel secure with you, because you can't even feel secure with yourself. You meet her material and physical needs, not because you love her but because you are afraid. Hence you do not meet her emotional needs...<br><br>Have you really tried to understand her, like one forumer has put it earlier..<br><br>You didn't say this in your post, but we can guess.

Other than that I have to disagree on the issue of unconditional love. A lot of time, many girls like to talk about unconditional love. Im not going to disagree on that but it's not going to be a happy relationship when the girl/guy is the one who just sits there and let the other party is the one putting in all the effort. This is not good in the long-run. Sooner or later someone will complain again of putting in too much into the relationship(usually it's the guys).<br><br>In other words, if you find yourself giving in too much while the girl controls the direction and not putting in some effort as well, you are going to suffer in the long run.<br><br>doko</div>
