However, though you probably felt trapped, simultaneously, you felt that wasn't any other perceived alternatives without having to compromise on your current status quo.<br><br>Your writing reeked of envy to people who seemed to score better in the looks department. It seemed to me that you might subconsciously hoped to find someone else to alleviate your misery, so that you could safety leap ship and resume your journey in love. But in comparison to loneliness - you rather choose to remain with a known evil than an unknown future of single hood.<br><br>So much insecurity that it really makes me wonders if you are in a relationship for love or mere companionship.<br><br>You are what you think you are - if you think you are humdrum and average, then it will manifest into reality for you.<br><br>Love thrives best when led with moderation - it's not about how good you are or how much money you splurge on her. In fact to me, your 'goodness' is seemed to be due to your belief that you have to work twice as hard to compensate your lack of looks.<br><br>It may not be intrinsically part of your personality to do so.<br><br>Love might be the driving force behind it.
