You can't force her to not go clubbing and enjoy with her friends. After all, it's her life not yours. She's not your pet.<br><br>Always listen to her and follow like a dog? Are you the man ? I think you spoiled her from the beginning, that's why she doesn't care what you think because she lost the respect for you. Think about it. You treat her too well? Does she deserve all the pampering?<br><br>doko</div></blockquote>She started from young, we promise each other that we will stop all this and start a better life, but sadly she did not keep her side of it.<br><br>Agree she is not my pet, I seems to be hers. looking back I feel like I am so dumb doing so much things for her.<br><br>I am a man no worries about it. I am what you call the good type where one loves and takes good care of my gf no matter what others says.<br>Agree I spoiled her, I treated her too well and she totally do not deserve any pampering at all.</div>
