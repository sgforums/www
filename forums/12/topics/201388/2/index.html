            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by shirurinu:</div><div class="quote_body">Well.... Pregnant women are really insecured and sensitive to the husband's changes. So we shouldn't say any negative things to make matters worse.<br><br>Forget Me Not might be helpful in a way, but suggestion is not suitable in this scenario for a pregnant mother's state of mind.<br><br>She is already stressed over the pregnancy and the obvious good feelings of her hubby towards the ex colleague. A good feeling might not be feelings between man and woman. Often we have good feelings to people around us cause of various reasons, their looks or characters resembles someone we hold dear too, their sense of responsibilities, or even just because they treat the one we love sincerely with no pretence. It's too shallow to judge based on what factor that your husband has on her. But 1 thing is for sure, that he loves you and your baby, otherwise he won't be talking about the name of the child that you and him have created.<br><br>He might be just excited about being a father but have no one to express his excitement. He might not be comfortable sharing his excitement to his male friends cause of Men's act tough ego, and it happens that they have been exchanging emails that they brought up this issue.<br><br>Don't be eager to sentence him guilty because you are already getting personal in your judgement.Because of your constant displeasure of him contacting your ex-colleague, you see it as it was her influence to make him change his mind about the name. Her comments might just have been a catalyst of the doubts that he already have.<br><br>I would advice you not to think about such issues as it is really not healthy for your mental state that i'm afraid you might have pre-natal depressions or lead to post-natal depressions. Both are equally daming to both your physical and mental health, not to mention a strain in the relationship between your husband and yourself. Please do seek professional help in counselling rather than the advice of normal by-standers whom most of us have not have the experience and knowledge of psychology.  </div></blockquote>NICE.</div>

This fact is very disturbing.<br>U should question him why the need to do so.<br>Let him know u are not comfortable with his being so close to someone of the opp. sex.

Many times than not, you do give pretty good advices...<br><br>Somehow it could be quite closely linked to the true intention of the person giving that advice... And also, the whole idea of a forum is for various people to contribute in the areas and ways they could throughout the advices...<br><br>The only pity is that there are also people who try to 'fool around' at the expense of others' needs and time...</div>
