              <p>true, but adjusting his schedule doesn't mean that his life revolves only around her. he has to plan his limited time and not neglect any area of his life.</p>
              <p>some girls think that when they say "adjust his time", she's actually meaning that he should spend most of his time with her.</p>
              <p>but i am sure this is a give and take situation - a real man is a man who knows his piority, and spends his time wisely, and is able to balance all areas of his life, and not let one dominate and upset the balance.</p>
              <p>it's not about living the single's life. after all he's already attached for 5 years, i'm sure he's used to being attached already. previously maybe he's giving her 1/5 of his time (b4 NS, alot of time mah, so it seems like alot, and she is satisfied) but now he is in NS, and the amt of time he has is drastically shortened. He is still giving 1/5 of his time to her, but obviously it will be alot lesser, and she has to accept that. he isn't shortchanging her, it's just that the amount of time he has is lesser. and i think girls in general forget that.</p>
              <p>if i have a whole cake, and i give you 1/5, it seems like a pretty large serving, but if now i only have one slice, and i give you 1/5, it is of course alot lesser.</p>

              <p><br>If he had shorter time, he should then explain to his gf and make her understand, we dun ask guy to spend time with us, what we want is to spend time together, if he needs to stay home with parents and rest, we can go to his house and stay with him, if he needs time with friends, we can go along too, cos we love our guys. Imagine after 5 years of our love and time, isn't it a waste to just dump it out?? Or simply the guy as in usual cases, of getting tired of his girl??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes, maybe our love hv overtaken us, but that is because of our emotion in love is much greater in most guys that we wish to be with our love one forever.</p>

              <p>problem is, we don't know the situation. for all you know TS is upset because her bf wants to spend time with his parents, and she wanted him to herself?</p>
              <p>also, another thing about going over to his place, let's reverse the scenario, would you like it if your bf parents want to tag along on all your dates?</p>
              <p>i guess for me, if i want to spend time with my parents, i want my attention to be focused on them. i don't want to be embroiled where my gf has to fight for my attention etc.</p>
              <p>yes i agree.. 5 years is a waste to break up over smth so petty.</p>
              <p>but another thing i want to point out. it also depends what character the gf has. is she the quarrelsome type? if the bf wants to rest at home, it wouldn't be restful if everytime meet also she show black face or unhappy abt smth?</p>
              <p>there is alot about the relationship we don't know</p>
              <p>the cake metaphor is good, but i don't think it ever occurred to her that the reason why she felt time wasn't enough is because he has alot lesser time to divide up also. i hope she reads this and realise it.</p>

              <p>It is a must in a relationship that the guy has to spend time
              with the girl wat...of cos once in a while if he can't due to some
              other more important commitments, the girl must understand. But if
              everytime the girl asks the guy to spend time with her the guy also
              say cannot then that shows the guy is unable to balance his time.
              So it will do him and the girl good to not be in a relationship

              <p>of course it's a must. but i don't think that is the issue. she said that she kept complaining that he isn't spending much time with her. she didn't complain that he didn't even spend ANY time with her.</p>
              <p>the problem is TS isn't satisfied with what she has now, it's not that she isn't getting any attention from him, it's just that she isn't satisfied with what he has given her, and due to circumstances, it's hardly the bf's fault.</p>
              <p>she has to be more understanding, if she can't even exercise patience and understanding at this point, then next time is gonna be worse.</p>

                  understand you , not u don understand him.He just using this as a
                  excuse . He is seeing his army friends for what .. like 5 days 24
                  hr ? but for you .. You only meet him for like what 1 and half day
                  or even not able to meet him for the weekend. What wrong for
                  "Sticking"with him ? Nothing .. He should treasure the time with
                  you , not blaming you about it.</p>
              <p>Somemore is a 5 year relationship .. He can give it up like tat
                  so easily ..Fuck lor ..Don wait for him ba..</p>
              <p>Btw , i also almost same as you ba, I also very sticky to my bf
                  . But he got no choice to accompany during his book out ..but you
                  must also know when to let him go out with his friend , don neglect
                  your your friend too. ..</p>

              <p>i think... both parties should be concerned over the needs of the other party over their own needs. it takes two hands to clap ya. if the girl wants the guy to care for her needs, she must also coorperate to take care of his needs. if he's too busy fighting for his "rights" and "space" and "needs" he definitely no energy to love her.</p>
