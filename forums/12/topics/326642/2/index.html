              <p>if he is unable to divide his time between his family, friends and his girlfriend, then it is clear that he is not ready for a relationship at this moment.</p>
              <p>TS is not selfish to demand for time from her bf. That's what a bf should do, spend time with his gf. What makes her less important than his family and friends until she should take second place compared to them?</p>

              <p>my bf of 5yrs recently broke up wif me, citing i wasnt understanding enough. he's in ns now and only book out during wkends. as a gf, i of coz will miss him and wanna spend more time with him mah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>he said i'm too "sticky", he wants to have his own freedom, and sometimes wanna go out with other friends instead of me.. but i really not understanding enough, keep insisting on meeting him and he feels that his life is v.restricted and he cant do the things he want.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>we broke up 1week ago, but 1mth ago he still asked me whether i'm willing to wait afew more mths for him before he ord. and i told him i will wait for him. the problem is, i think we both still love each other, but i dunno why he still wanna break up?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>he keep saying i dont appreciate wat he had ever done for me.. and i'm not understanding enough, coz i keep complaining he dont spend much time with me.. and he ask me dont waste anymore time on him, it's not worth it.. haiz.. i dunno whether wat he said is really frm his heart or not.. i dunno whether i shd continue to wait for him or not.. but he did mention, "i thought our r/s was v.stable this time, and i thought u will understand me, but u didnt.."</p>

              <p><br>When u are talking abt more time, u nvr really mention it 1 or 2 days, when he book out there both sat and sun (How I wish during this is during my serving time).  If u expect that he spend both days with u, I can understand the problem he will be facing, he need some breathing space with friends (outside his camp) and family.  But if u expect like 1 of the weekend and he still can't make it then I think he is a bit too much.  I been through the my NS and that time is even worst where we have only 1/2 days in Sat and if include all the time spend coming out all this, mostly reach home at 2-3 pm already, and I had a few groups of close friends that dun see eyes to eyes with each other (the ah beng type and the a level style) but I am quite lucky/or unlucky being single at that time.</p>
              <p>Same problem will occur when he is working, at least in army most of the weekend still free unless kenna duty, for some work, weekend will be burnt when workload is heavy, boss happy happy ask u to go overseas outstation for a few weeks.</p>

              <p>Normally, I would ask you to listen to your heart. But he does not reply your SMS, so i'll say, give it a few, lets say 1 month, if after one month still no SMS,then give up.</p>
              <p>Oh by the way, if a friendly guy comes along, be a little friendly. But don't be too friendly yet.</p>
              <p>Waiting for just a while is the way to go. Since your heart insists upon it.</p>

              <p>true, but adjusting his schedule doesn't mean that his life revolves only around her. he has to plan his limited time and not neglect any area of his life.</p>
              <p>some girls think that when they say "adjust his time", she's actually meaning that he should spend most of his time with her.</p>
              <p>but i am sure this is a give and take situation - a real man is a man who knows his piority, and spends his time wisely, and is able to balance all areas of his life, and not let one dominate and upset the balance.</p>
              <p>it's not about living the single's life. after all he's already attached for 5 years, i'm sure he's used to being attached already. previously maybe he's giving her 1/5 of his time (b4 NS, alot of time mah, so it seems like alot, and she is satisfied) but now he is in NS, and the amt of time he has is drastically shortened. He is still giving 1/5 of his time to her, but obviously it will be alot lesser, and she has to accept that. he isn't shortchanging her, it's just that the amount of time he has is lesser. and i think girls in general forget that.</p>
              <p>if i have a whole cake, and i give you 1/5, it seems like a pretty large serving, but if now i only have one slice, and i give you 1/5, it is of course alot lesser.</p>

              <p>It is a must in a relationship that the guy has to spend time with the girl wat...of cos once in a while if he can't due to some other more important commitments, the girl must understand. But if everytime the girl asks the guy to spend time with her the guy also say cannot then that shows the guy is unable to balance his time. So it will do him and the girl good to not be in a relationship until he knows how to prioritize his time better.</p>
