              <p>Oh how typical of a selfish man.</p>
              <p>Sure he wants you to wait for him.</p>

              <p>he clearly doesnt understand that loving someone is a commitment, and not just an emotion. commitment means that you'll do your best to make things work even though its against what you "feel" like doing. giving reasons like that for a breakup shows that he thinks relationships are only about emotions and feelings</p>
              <p>well i think for you you've got to be more independent and do things by yourself. he clearly does not show that he has a maturity to be a good partner in the future.</p>

              <p>Its perfectly understandable that you as his gf will want to be with him for as long as possible over the weekend given that you don't see him for 5 days a week.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Well, it could be that he is in a state of dilema whereby he wants to spent his precious bookout timings with you and yet also wanting to spent sometime with his friends so at the very least he does not loose contact with them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think you should wait as firstly you've nothing to lose, since its his lost for not appreciating your care and concern. Also a few months is relatively little as compared to the 5 years you were together with him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Give him time and space for him to think things over, who knows it might turn out fine after that.</p>

              <p>He is doing his NS, so how old can both of you be.</p>
              <p>You are young. Take the opportunity, to discover other options. You don't have to be committed to you plans of settling down 2-3 years time.</p>
              <p>Don't let what he says affect you. Just bear in mind what he said. Later you need to recall such things to assess him inorder to decide your future with him. In the meantime you have some measure of freedom. Use it. Go travelling, meet more people, enjoy life. Take the opportunity, while stock last. Don't be lovey-dovey wait for him. When his NS is over then, review YOUR life.</p>
              <p>He, he will review his life when his NS is over. He will decide about you only at that point in time. I don't know, you don't know, he also don't know, nobody know what he will decide. So don't waste time distressing yourself.</p>
              <p>Destiny is in your hands.</p>

              <p>my bf of 5yrs recently broke up wif me, citing i wasnt
              understanding enough. he's in ns now and only book out during
              wkends. as a gf, i of coz will miss him and wanna spend more time
              with him mah.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>he said i'm too "sticky", he wants to have his own freedom, and
              sometimes wanna go out with other friends instead of me.. but i
              really not understanding enough, keep insisting on meeting him and
              he feels that his life is v.restricted and he cant do the things he
              want.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>we broke up 1week ago, but 1mth ago he still asked me whether
              i'm willing to wait afew more mths for him before he ord.
              and i told him i will wait for him. the problem is, i think we
              both still love each other, but i dunno why he still wanna break
              up?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>he keep saying i dont appreciate wat he had ever done for me..
              and i'm not understanding enough, coz i keep complaining he
              dont spend much time with me.. and he ask me dont waste anymore
              time on him, it's not worth it.. haiz.. i dunno whether wat he said
              is really frm his heart or not.. i dunno whether i shd continue to
              wait for him or not.. but he did mention, "i thought our r/s was
              v.stable this time, and i thought u will understand me, but u
              didnt.."</p>

              <p>Since he does not want to commit, then wait for him but go out with other people.If someone else wants to commit, then stop waiting. If he wants to commit, then stop going out with other people. Nobody says life is easy. If you are not happy, relationships don't work well.</p>
