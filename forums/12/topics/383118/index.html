              <p>I am not sure if you are the same 15 year old guy who create clones, but if you the same, then my suggestion to you is that you are not alone.</p>
              <p>Just continue to post here, so long as the administrators allow your numerous nick. It is free and harms no one actually.</p>
              <p>The problem with you is that you crave for attention, and yet not prepared to do what it takes to get such attention,despite the efforts by many others here.</p>
              <p>You see not advices, but post count. A response is like an applause for you. No where else in the real world could you get it but here. If inflates your self worth. So if it helps, then continue on what you are doing.</p>
              <p>No one can look down on you. Only you do that to yourself and you are doing that here. It's just so sad to see you like this. You had been the fortunate one, gifted with precious life and yet spurned the efforts and advices and help offered by many - your parents, your relatives, your teachers, your friends and people here.</p>
              <p>In the end, only you can help yourself, if you want to. No one else can. You already know what it takes for you to be happy and rejoin society.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>I humbly apologise for my mistake then. No proof is necessary.  Here on AA many only wish to share and help others, regardless of whomever you are.</p>
              <p>You are never alone. Never will be, as long as you are willing to make friends with others, let others know more about you and share the journey of life together.</p>

              <p>Nope, no hunting down here. Not many flame others here.  There's one 15 year guy who is really in despair and I just feel sad for him. He turned down many offers of help, even from our ever patient Dkcx here.</p>

              <p>when i was in sec school in the late 1990s, this clique thing already existed way back</p>
              <p>its normal TS, but during my time it was like everyone was wild , trendy and its important to be part of a group .. more so than now. partly because:</p>
              <p>in those times :</p>
              <p>there no facebook, msn chat or anything on a big level yet , and lan gaming still in its infancy made people go out and socialize more People were more carefree , likes to party and mix around more. We had more $$$ , things were cheaper and more free time as well. We used to have frequent outings and BBQ session in ECP, nigh scene and clubbing. As Singapore fell into recession , people's priorities have changed and the entertainment thing now is not that much among locals .  Go out and look what u see are foreigner people gathering around in groups, locals got more lonelier. Like they say No money,No honey.</p>
              <p>And socially things have changed quite a fair bit too. Everyone has become more self centered and lonelier now. Even among the matured aged group.</p>

              <p>Firstly, you got to watch what you are thinking. For what you think affects your personality, your behaviour, your speech, your tone. All these will project an impression of you to those around you. Pleasant thoughts, project a welcoming image. Hateful thoughts, presents an angry sight.</p>
              <p>Are you always hating what's going around you? (<em>people in my school are crap)</em>Always criticising people, always thinking that others have ill-will against you. Always wondering why things don't work out for you,(<em>All my friends have abandoned me</em>) etc, etc, etc. Simply put, your thoughts are all negative. Your thoughts are quarrelsome, hateful, full of disdain. People will notice that (<em>they say they hate my attitude</em>).</p>
              <p>There is no overnight cure for you negative feelings, and it will not be easy (<em>I don't know how to approach anyone else</em>). But you can overcome, I know that because you <em>"have made so many changes for them"</em>. The problem you are going through is natural, considering the circumstances affecting you.</p>
              <p>You must take charge of yourself. Your thoughts are negative, this happens easily to many people, I don't know why, but they do. So you are not alone. Do not let your thoughts run automatically into the negative, the hateful, the scorn, and all  things bad. You have practiced this manner of thinking for so long that it would be difficult to break it. But you must attempt to change this one thing. Think positively, seek out the good, comment on it. Give compliments where it is due. Smile more often. These are only a few things to get started on, only remember to dwell your thoughts on the good things around you. As the saying goes: Count your blessings.</p>
              <p>Things won't happen overnight, but work on it, and the effect will be there.</p>

              <p>From what you have posted, i see that the problem lies in you. You are just looking at the negative side of things. Obviously, if you are in sg, you aren't in a crap school. What makes you think that the people in your school are crap? How do you know they aren't saying the same about you? As you can see in your first post, there are so many things you want. But what are you doing to change this situation? Nothing, you're just sitting behind your computer complaining. Teachers aren't biased, you must have done something to make them dislike you. It's not that you don't know how to approach anyone, you just don't dare to take the first step. I'm very sure your parents will be happy to listen to you if you approach them <span style="border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 17px; line-height: normal; white-space: pre;  ">politely, if not, you can always approach your school councillor.</span></p>
              <p>Once again. Your are in this state only because of your own doings.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Well, in my school I dont really fit in... In a way, I'm not like those girly girls who keep talking about how they look and how their boyfriends look. I'm also not the type who studies hard to maintain a good grade but I still pass with an ok score. But the thing that bothers me most is my CCA. I'm in guitar and I have alot of music background including guitar. So normally the first time you go you dont know anything about guitar. I'm not boasting or anything so please dont get me wrong. Anyway, when I first went for my CCA I just played my own songs cause the rest was learning basics. That set most people off cause they told me that I was "Showing off" and stuff like that. I really did'nt mean to bother anyone... I helped the people who could not play, taught them some stuff, and what do I get in return? They said that I was really bossy and proud... BTW I did not like boss them around. I asked them if they needed help. They nodded then I helped. And now the whole group is turning their backs on me. I really dont know what to do...</p></div>

              <p>I know a girl like whom I assume is like you (but she is extremely good looking), in fact too good looking that others get jealous about. Strong-willed, smart, capable and determined..., people think she shows off, when in fact, she's the most modest person you'll ever meet, if you just dug deeper. don't settle with less than average people or pine for their company - you will eventually meet people and perhaps a guy of your stature... don't pine for their attention - i know because my talents is pretty up their but I often pine for the company of the normal people... it's like the grass is greener and the music is more fun over the side. Don't worry about it. Things will work itself out. Happens to the best of us (and I mean the best).</p>

              <p>"You'll never walk alone" indeed. :) I understand the clique thing being a hindrance and an obstacle to friendships and all. Why? Because I've been there and done that before. Know this, never ever make a drastic change just to adapt or fit into a clique. Because this is not the real you. Always ask yourself, will you feel comfortable when you are being someone you are not? It is true that some people are different &amp; unique in their own ways but this is their identity and what defines them! What makes you YOU. Just like Ris Low's "It shouts me!" ;P If your friends can't accept you for who you are, then it is their loss. Never yours. You can always find other better friends out there who accept you for who you are. Get out more often. See the world. And since you love music and your guitar, I believe you can touch others and find others with the same interests as you. Reality, though harsh has some light to it after all. You are bound to find nice people out there in this world, just like how most of us here will always be here to listen to you and help you out.</p>

              <p>Joining cliques will bring more problems than not having one at all if its not a healthy one. Its just a passing phase in yr life, So TS dont worry, if u dont have one, u save yrself a lot of trouble. I have a fren who is a loner, but yet he is enjoying his life without frens.</p>
              <p>He goes to geylang, goes to pubs to drink , alone. Who says u need to join cliques to be cool?. In any way cliques forming people are usually posers and cowards who need to be safe in company.</p>
