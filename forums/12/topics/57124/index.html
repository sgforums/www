            <div class='col-md body'>Today, i went to a wedding dinner. My brother in law's elder bro's wedding dinner.<br>WEll as usual...i'm not really into restaurant's food. Makes me feel like a 'Tam Jia'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>But i went anyway, cos it's a new Tung Lok outlet, it's known to have almost first class chinese food served. Heavenly! The Imperial Restaurant situated at 7th storey of Nee Ann City Building.<br><br>My dad parked his car and we had a fun time looking out for the entrance. Till i found it....it was very familiar. Familiar venue...it seemed like i've been there before.<br>It was until when i got in...all those memories came rushing into my mind. the atmosphere, climate, people, her....<br>Thought it's a restaurant now...but those memories were real. In me. Only i know how much it meant to me.<br>The structure of the place didn't change much, except tat it has renovated into a Tung Lok restaurant. I still remember the Techno section....the pop section...and the place which i saw her. The very VIP table. Ha! So ironic....i thought to myself.<br>Those smile, Ohhhh....it's so heart wrenching.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>It all became a memory. Breathless...i just couldn't believe it. Really....it didn't hurt, but those heartfelt memories just kept haunting me. Wonderful memories i wished i could put behind cause it hurts so much.<br>The place which i met a very special girl became a restuarant??!?!?<br>It didn't change in my heart.<br>It didn't change a single bit.<br>I was brought back to the night...that very special moment. It all became so real<br>And wish i could be there for the rest of my life.<br><br>Shall i continue dreaming<br>Shall i seek for an answer?<br>Is there a door which leads me to understand?<br>Should i stay on<br>Or should i open the door?<br>I wish i know the answer that leads to the next door.<br>Until i find you again....I wish you love, happiness and peace.<br><br>With Love,<br><br>Ben</div>

Makes me feel like a 'Tam Jia'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br>But i went anyway, cos it's a new Tung Lok outlet, it's known to have almost first class chinese food served. Heavenly! The Imperial Restaurant situated at 7th storey of Nee Ann City Building.<br><br>My dad parked his car and we had a fun time looking out for the entrance. Till i found it....it was very familiar. Familiar venue...it seemed like i've been there before.<br>It was until when i got in...all those memories came rushing into my mind. the atmosphere, climate, people, her....<br>Thought it's a restaurant now...but those memories were real. In me. Only i know how much it meant to me.<br>The structure of the place didn't change much, except tat it has renovated into a Tung Lok restaurant. I still remember the Techno section....the pop section...and the place which i saw her. The very VIP table. Ha! So ironic....i thought to myself.<br>Those smile, Ohhhh....it's so heart wrenching.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>It all became a memory. Breathless...i just couldn't believe it. Really....it didn't hurt, but those heartfelt memories just kept haunting me. Wonderful memories i wished i could put behind cause it hurts so much.<br>The place which i met a very special girl became a restuarant??!?!?<br>It didn't change in my heart.<br>It didn't change a single bit.<br>I was brought back to the night...that very special moment. It all became so real<br>And wish i could be there for the rest of my life.<br><br>Shall i continue dreaming<br>Shall i seek for an answer?<br>Is there a door which leads me to understand?<br>Should i stay on<br>Or should i open the door?<br>I wish i know the answer that leads to the next door.<br>Until i find you again....I wish you love, happiness and peace.<br><br>With Love,<br><br>Ben</div></blockquote>If I were to chose between sweet, hurting memories or nothing but the calm wave route - I would chose the first option.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You may have lost something, but certainly you gain as well.
