But if they asked me for money, then I'll give them a flat no.<br><br>He's blind right? So maybe he could be left at that location everyday by one of his heartless-should-burn-in-Hell children, so that they won't need to hire a maid specially to assist him and also no need to waste money to feed him everyday...they just left him there and pick him up later. It's sad but also very  true that most people around us are very capable of doing such things to their parents.<br><br>It's just food/drinks and it's not that he's trying to scam a dollar out of you. Don't think anyone will wanna beg unless he/she is at their most desperate ends. Moreover it's just food/drinks that he's asking for. Giving him monetary stuffs will put him at risk for getting robbed/mugged.<br><br>Anyway I don't give money out to strangers regardless of how pitiful/old/crippled/ill-stricken that person it. But I'll gladly pay a meal for anyone who need to fill his/her empty stomach anytime. Cos not being able to feed yourself is the most dire situation that can possibly happen to anyone compared to having no money at all.<br><br>Buy him a meal next time if he asked for it, food is still cheap in Singapore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

What is a can of drink to u?  If he's the type who strives hard, i might even buy him food everyday.  But some people if given this kind of treatment, food comes without having him to work for it, they will take it for granted and it becomes a bad habit to ask for food and money, and dun feel the need to work for it. </span></div>
