I labelled them point (I) and (II) consecutively.<br><br>I) Lost her feelings - there are two types of people when it comes to losing feelings. The first type are those who lose easily and is able to regain back as quickly. The second type is those who don't lose it easily, but once they lose it, its gone forever.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Understanding which type of girl your ex is would prove very important and give clue about how great or slim your chances of getting her is.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>II) Make her love me - You CAN'T MAKE people love you. Love is free will and because its free will - you can only influence and hope for the best. In the end, it revert back to point (I) about your chances.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Sometimes when love is lost - do not panic, cry out for your longing and determined to recover the relationship. Its wise to understand and ponder over the reason and background of why you have lost it - afterall, everything happens for a reason. <strong>Knowing why you have lost, is more important than salvaging a relationship without realising why you have lost it prior before.</strong> Because if you don't......<br><br>...... chances are, you will lose this relationship again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

I labelled them point (I) and (II) consecutively.<br><br>I) Lost her feelings - there are two types of people when it comes to losing feelings. The first type are those who lose easily and is able to regain back as quickly. The second type is those who don't lose it easily, but once they lose it, its gone forever.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Understanding which type of girl your ex is would prove very important and give clue about how great or slim your chances of getting her is.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>II) Make her love me - You CAN'T MAKE people love you. Love is free will and because its free will - you can only influence and hope for the best. In the end, it revert back to point (I) about your chances.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Sometimes when love is lost - do not panic, cry out for your longing and determined to recover the relationship. Its wise to understand and ponder over the reason and background of why you have lost it - afterall, everything happens for a reason. [b]Knowing why you have lost, is more important than salvaging a relationship without realising why you have lost it prior before.</strong> Because if you don't......<br><br>...... chances are, you will lose this relationship again. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers  [/b]</blockquote>last time we broke off b4, but it's just one day affair, i talk to her lots of things then she was back to me again. but at time she will be veli  metal teeth......<br>she is a kind of woman who keep thing to herself, i try digging out the problem, but she kept say she will forget the problem, but when thing happen again, she will bring out the past and shoot me again</div>
