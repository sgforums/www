            <div class='col-md body'>No one said recovering from a heartache is easy... yet no one said it's impossible as well.<br><br>Like what Alvin mentioned, if you have any pent up feelings, please go ahead and release them. There's no law stating that guys cant cry.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  Cry if you have to, wipe your tears and life goes on. If you have to feel vulnerable, yes then it's what you have to feel for the time being. Then hibernate for a period, when you're done with that, you'll come out to be a better and stronger person.<br><br>You are not alone and it's a fact. Many people suffer from heartaches, and yes life has to go on no matter what happens becoz  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong><span style="color: blue;">The world doesnt stop revolving becoz of one person. </span></strong><br><br>Talk it out if you cannot handle. It's always better than keeping it within yourself. Having someone with you to listen through even though no solutions can be found will be better than you fighting that battle alone.<br><br>Know that once you start to get swallowed in self-pity, everything halts. You won't want her to call you a 'whim' and one who cannot survive without her. All the more you have to lead a life better without her, becoz before she made the entrance into your life, you did fine and well. So why should there be any difference now that she's gone? If everything has to be back at ground zero then please jolly well make it a better one than before.<br><br>Be positive, this mindset can last you through difficult times.<br><br>Of coz, not forgetting one of my fav quote<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> <strong>Tough times don't last, Tough people do</strong><br><br>You'll be well.... Help us by helping yourself.<br><br>Cheerz...</div>
