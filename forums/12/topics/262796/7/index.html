You used incorrect grammar to create an escape clause (i.e. you meant that "maybe" the described people were religious fanatics).  I pointed out that grammatical error to show how your excuse does not apply, and therefore that your argument is still incorrect because it fails to address and logically exclude other possible reasons for people wanting to lead perfect, disciplined and careful lives.

If you acknowledge that standards of "good" arguments are an unrealistic goal and treat others' arguments accordingly, I'd be happy to accept that, but if not you open your writing to the scrutiny that any first-year undergraduate's work is fairly subjected to, by virtue of the standards that you have proposed yourself.<br><br>As for the omniscience angle, I'll agree with you but it's irrelevant because you've just painted yourself into a corner chasing red herrings.  By your own standards, people who condemn on AA know everything, so they would claim to be capable of explaining the Theory of Relativity as well.  Well and good, because we now come to the point where factual proof can be called for.  Where, pray tell, has any of these people claimed to know how to explain the Theory of Relativity, much less everything else?  If you cannot provide any examples, then your conclusion that these people think they are gods is simply fallacious on grounds of unsupported premises.<br><br>You've just put yourself into checkmate.</div>

I'm not asking what they are like, I'm not asking for examples, I am asking what they <a href="http://are" rel="nofollow">are</a>.  If you can't answer that simple question, why be surprised when you fail to get your point across?<br><br>For somebody who claims to know about "good" arguments, it's disappointing that you have missed this very prosaic point.<br><br>You're still not thinking clearly, you're still not expressing yourself clearly, and you still haven't addressed the issue of what you you think makes a "good" and "bad" argument.<br><br>If I may make a suggestion, you seem to be going into a lot of irrelevant topics and examples, and that appears to be confusing you.  Why not keep things simple and address topics directly?</div>
