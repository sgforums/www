In law, jurisdiction (from the Latin ius, iuris meaning "law" and dicere meaning "to speak") is the practical authority granted to a formally constituted legal body or to a political leader to deal with and make pronouncements on legal matters and, by implication, to administer justice within a defined area of responsibility.</strong> Do you have the "jurisdiction" to condemn?<br><br><strong>2. Omniscience is the capacity to know everything infinitely, or at least everything that can be known about a character including thoughts, feelings, life and the universe, etc. In monotheism, this ability is typically attributed to God. This concept is included in the Qur'an, where God is called "Al-'aleem" on multiple occasions. This is the infinite form of the verb "alama" which means to learn.</strong>If you cannot know "everything" are you sure that your condemnation has taken "everything" into consideration?<br><br><strong>3.

In law, jurisdiction (from the Latin ius, iuris meaning "law" and dicere meaning "to speak") is the practical authority granted to a formally constituted legal body or to a political leader to deal with and make pronouncements on legal matters and, by implication, to administer justice within a defined area of responsibility.</strong> Do you have the "jurisdiction" to condemn?<br><br><strong>2. Omniscience is the capacity to know everything infinitely, or at least everything that can be known about a character including thoughts, feelings, life and the universe, etc. In monotheism, this ability is typically attributed to God. This concept is included in the Qur'an, where God is called "Al-'aleem" on multiple occasions. This is the infinite form of the verb "alama" which means to learn.</strong>If you cannot know "everything" are you sure that your condemnation has taken "everything" into consideration?<br><br><strong>3. Rules of evidence govern whether, when, how, and for what purpose proof of a case may be placed before a trier of fact for consideration.</strong>Are you so sure that the evidence that you use to condemn someone complies with the "Rules of evidence"? and whose "RULES"?[/b]</blockquote>Having to explain every little thing to you makes me feel like I am talking to a kid.. *haiz*  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
