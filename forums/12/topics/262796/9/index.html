It was so obvious that it was a typo... the reason I even brought it up was as I explained above.<br><br>Did you also think that I was serious when I asked:<br><br>"Is there hope for humanity? Are we all doomed? Is the end of the world at hand?<br><br>Just because he made a typo?</div></blockquote>Let's see ....  you're not being serious while in the middle of a debate about logic not taking anyone seriously ..........  not showing the least amount of respect towards others<br><br>by doing that, how do you expect anyone to take you seriously ??<br><br></div>

So this is the mistake i made and corrected on.<br>This I suppose is the mistake I make.<br>I made no mistake about clerifying the parts on logics, and neither do I claim to be God like. Only U insist that I am god like.<br><br>I dont think anyone here makes a fool except u.<br><br>Still my statement remains clear, if u want to argue with me about logics, u dont stand a chance. I did not wasted my 4 years as a math major for nothing.<br><br>And read ppl post clearly, obviously u are trying to twist ur way out without even picking on which technical part of error I have made on logics.<br><br>Ur so call humour and sarcasm doesnt work. Simply saying, U are not a good writer.<br><br>For someone who cannot refute my posts on logics and stoop so low just to pinpoint my typo error, U really have no substance.<br>This is the lousiest trick I ever seen.<br><br>No one here claim to be god like, but we do have basic understanding on logics and logics being a branch of mathematics is consistent everywhere in the universe. Here we are trying to tell u the basic and correct forms of arguments and u claim that we are god-like?<br>U are living in ur own world and refuse to accept the knowledge on logics which were created by Giants of the past. They were the true geniuses and I pale in comparision.</div>
