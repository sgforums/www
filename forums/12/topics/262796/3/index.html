The person who condemn will not feel a pinch, because they don't care about the person they condemn.<br><br>Nobody makes condemnation a habit or hobby.<br>Because there is nothing to gain, other than rantings of anger.<br><br>Same as cussing, you cuss at someone, does it hurt them ? No. But maybe you feel better .

But its not going to possible for everyone to give advise your way.

Who's to say that the harsh way is negative and your way is positive ?<br><br>And you believe that the brain is so unreliable, so can I safely say that even your point may not be the correct way as well?<br><br>And if I'm not wrong you mention we should not enforce our way of thinking onto others ??<br><br>You are doing it now, forcing others to see things your way.<br><br>No offence, I could be wrong.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

That is to say, you presume that you know everything and can weigh everything and are truly rational and and have perfect understanding.<br><br>To be able to classify someone as "Good" or "Evil" you have to know everything about that person so that you can balance all his "Good" against all his "Bad".<br><br>You have to be able to not just say what "Good" is and what "Bad" is but be the authority to set the standards. You have to be "GOD"<br><br>So for all those that think they are "GOD"  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>=========================<br><br>If you are constantly condemning everyone around you and classifying their behavior as "good" or "bad" and think that people must classify you and your behavior as "good"....

(Condemning people)<br>"This is very bad behavior because...."  (Condemning people's behavior)<br><br>"I will not do this because... (Giving others their opinion)<br><br>=========================<br><br>My opinion is that those that like to condemn people and other people's behavior should go to BAR and do it....
