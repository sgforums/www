Live a perfect, disciplined and careful life? Maybe, if you are a religious fanatic that hopes to get to heaven.</div></blockquote>Where's your proof that living a perfect, disciplined and careful life makes you unhappy?  You haven't mentioned anything before this statement that would imply that people living such lives were unhappy, nor have you explained why they would be.  Why would you suggest this if there was nothing to support it?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by AndrewPKYap:</div><div class="quote_body">If you condemn the person and classify him as "Evil" or "Bad" you are behaving like a "GOD".<br><br>That is to say, you presume that you know everything and can weigh everything and are truly rational and and have perfect understanding.<br></div></blockquote>Complete rubbish.  Judges condemn people - are they gods and do they claim to know everything?<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by AndrewPKYap:</div><div class="quote_body">You have to be able to not just say what "Good" is and what "Bad" is but be the authority to set the standards.

Do governments and lawmakers claim to be gods?<br><br>Okay, Andrew, I've pointed out your errors - your original argument in this thread holds no water because it's based on these errors.<br><br>Now, are you going to leave your argument as the rubbish it is, or are you going to address and correct your errors?<br><br>My money is on you coming up with irrelevant bilge like "okay, you win", fireworks, a whole lot of empty puffery and an exit with your tail hidden between your legs.

Could it be because you utterly fail on the other part?<br><br>Valid arguments are only half the story, the other half being soundness to make up cogent arguments.  To make sure that what you're writing isn't BS, you need not only ensure that the argument is valid, but that the premises are true as well.<br><br>An entirely valid argument can be based upon untrue premises.  You've given us plenty of examples of that, what with your nonsensical claims about people believing themselves to be gods and other such tripe.<br><br>To put it simply enough for you to understand, a valid argument is complete BS if the premises are not true.<br><br>By the way, that's a neat little trick there, starting with talking about "good" advice and changing midstream to valid arguments and *ahem* "formal language".  What was the objective there?  I'm guessing that if someone picked you up on the "no good advice" claim, you'd jump over to the "valid argument" part of that post, and vice versa.  Nice little parlour game you got going there, talking a lot but saying nothing.  You ought to be a politician. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>It's sadly amusing how you try to make yourself sound educated with things like "formal language", when you only know half the story.

To make sure that what you're writing isn't BS, you need not only ensure that the argument is valid, but that the premises are true as well.<br><br>An entirely valid argument can be based upon untrue premises.
