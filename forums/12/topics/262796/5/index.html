Secondly, the judge has the statutes or LAWS of the land to guide him/her as to what is right or wrong and so he/she can "condemn"<br><br>In AA, and real life, if you condemn others, what LAW or STATUTES do you use to say that someone is "right" or "wrong"?<br><br>What LAW or STATUTES do you use to say that someone is "good" or "evil"?<br><br>Non Christians are not under the authority of the ten commandments. Non Buddhists are not under the authority of the Buddhist precepts.<br><br>So how do you condemn people if you choose to? What is the yardstick you use?<br><br>If you do not understand things like "acceptable" evidence and you have to condemn against a statute/law; is it not fair to say that people that condemn others are stupid to do that?<br><br>They do not understand that they need "good" "solid" "acceptable evidence" and they need a "Law Book" that is applicable to all in order to condemn.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>AndrewPKYap, I believe all these arguements you had with other forumites are due to the part whereby <span style="color: red;">your replies are misleading</span>.

There is no sense of seriousness and alot of double meaning in it.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from"><strong>I am just pointing out to people that condemn others that they have a major flaw in their thinking... you cannot condemn people simply because you cannot know everything and you yourself are not perfect.<br><br>You can voice your opinions and you can give suggestions... and I have said many times that people have different opinions.<br><br>When you condemn you are insisting that your opinion is right and correct and underlying that must surely be that you can see, know and understand everything perfectly.... otherwise, you give your opinions and your views and respect other people's opinions and views and do not condemn anyone...</strong>[/quote]<br>[quote]Originally posted by AndrewPKYap:</div><div class="quote_body"> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> Since when did I say "Disagreeing " means condemning?<br><br>I wonder if you should go back to school and learn "comprehension "  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"> </div></blockquote>Just take a look at the above reply. Your 'wondering' already has elements of condemnation since you 'wonder' if the forumite's intellect or 'academics' is below par to understand your comments.
