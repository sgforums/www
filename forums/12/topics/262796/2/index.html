            <div class='col-md body'>Nobody is condemning anyone in this forum. Remember, this is an open forum and any Tom, Dick and Harry can get excess to it. This AA is not like other AA where no one else can make reply other than the appointed 'counselors'.<br><br>You have to understand everyone have different views, different perceptions, different opinions. Some may sound harsh to others when in actual fact they are using reverse psychology to help tackle the TS's dilemma or problem.<br><br>I am pretty sure you have come across some TS that only wants to hear what they want to hear as they feel their so-called problem is the biggest problem in the world. This can make those that gave advices frustrated and annoyed with TS behavior for refusing to at least consider the advices rendered but continue to make a nuisance of themselves. A very good example was the post concerning a 27 year old married woman who rather spend time alone travelling or with friends and go out partying leaving the poor hubby all alone at home. I don't think anyone is condemning her. Just that the way she post irritated the hell out of everyone when she still insist she is right by spending time with friends rather than hubby <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thats why threadstarter should be as honet as possible when telling about his/her situation. Because we can only give the best possible solution based on the circumstances that the threadstarter has described. So some people may give real advice , condemn or some give advice based on thier experience and thier experience.<br><br>I do not see why we cannot condemn some advices or TS for thier advices. Because not all of them or thier adviecs that give , is good.. or even sound. We are not bound by 1 type of characteristics but many.Unless he/she explains why he/she advices that way , i dont see why we cant condemn another if they do not explain in more detail about it.only by explaining can we know why he/she will advice that way and the TS can see whether it is even close , or apply to his/her situation.<br><br>Ppl react differently to different ppl and situations, how are u all so sure that yours will work? Maybe u can give him the most optimum but still staying in the nice comfort area. While i see alot of advices given are all towards the safe and sound area , what about risking , and being more aggresive in your approach ?<br><br>Although simple condemnation by calling ppl names and giving totally no constructive advices should not be tolerated. But in this world , we will recieved praises and condemnation and we have to live with it and accept the fact that this is not a world where all things are the way u want it to be. To recieve both the negative and the positive and actually helping the person to think more in-dept then to give him false hopes or allowing him to miss the opportunities that he should've grasped. While i  agree that we should give some comfort to the threadstarter and maybe tell him to be more positive in his/her outlook.<br><br></div>

"jeers, condemnations and the likes" are totally uncalled for.<br><br>People must be expected to be polite "in public". It is not only common courtesy, it speaks poorly of the person making the "jeers, condemnations and the likes". It speaks of a lack of wisdom and experience in life. It speaks of people that think the best way to change people is to scream at people.<br><br>We should condone people making the "jeers, condemnations and the likes" and tell people not to post in AA?

The example you state is about how you manage interpersonal skills. Not about judging of individual.<br><br>Do you expect us to reply to someone's thread objectively, when that person's thread is asking how he can steal someone else's girlfriend? Judgement has already been made then - this guy is attempting to steal another's girlfriend. And he's still justifying his actions.<br><br>That alone is enough reason for us to voice out our judgemental opinion - "If you steal someone else's girlfriend, you can expect someone would happen to you. There is karma!"<br><br>Yes. It takes a lot of maturity and control to view things objectively.

            <div class='col-md body'>quote:<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br>Originally posted by Xiaozzhen:<br>Andrew, I know where you are coming from. Your advice is sound for situations where the negative and positive are grey areas (certain ones, anyway).<br><br>What I am talking about is more like this example:<br>If you like to smoke and it makes you happy to smoke. In fact if you don't smoke, you get withdrawals.<br>But if your smoke gets to me, I'll be unhappy, as I don't like the smoke and it doesn't quite make me sick, it makes me mad.<br>So I will not tolerate it. If I can get away from the smoke, I will. If it is an enclosed area, must I tolerate? What about the people around me, including young children who do not know how to protest or get away, because they have not learnt the skill?<br><br>So is your advice : the smoke does not get to me too negatively.. live and let live... and I'll be a happier person? I don't see it!<br><br>It is always difficult to give sound advice, especially one that encompasses so many areas.<br>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by AndrewPKYap:</div><div class="quote_body">Obviously the smoke affects you very negatively. What I am saying is that if something does not get to you too negatively, just tolerate it.<br><br>If almost every little thing gets to you very negatively, then I would think that there is a problem... which you might not recognize.<br><br>You said: <span style="color: red;">It is always difficult to give sound advice, especially one that encompasses so many areas.  </span> Which is why we should not condemn anyone but simply offer our opinions in as polite a manner as possible...<br><br>I started this thread also to remind people that like to condemn others that they are not GOD and that they do not know everything and so they should tone down their condemnation or give up condemning people altogether for I have observed that such people have many problems with their relationships.</div></blockquote>You just proved my point.<br><br>When a problem becomes specific and the feelings made known clearly, like the smoke problem, it is easy to give a specific answer.<br><br>It is indeed difficult to give advice on a wide ranging topic, like what you are experiencing here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>

"Better for you to go after another girl you like that is lonely and not attached for I think that you will have more success than for there are lots of girls around."<br><br>No condemnation and yet, good advice.<br><br>If you advise him...

It is easier to learn from a real life example.
