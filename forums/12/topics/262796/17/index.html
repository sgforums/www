If you wish to quote someone, you don't use parentheses.  Parentheses are used to denote interruptions in a sentence, represent options and enclose numerals in a multi-point passage.  Quotes are enclosed by inverted commas.  That's why inverted commas are also called quotation marks - duh! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Now if that's not clear enough for you, I suggest you go back to school and take the English lessons that you slept through.
