I recommend it to all of my students (most of whom are writing their Honours theses), and it explains in very straightforward terms the elements that constitute cogent and sound (in your terms, "good" ) arguments.<br><br>By the time you're past the first two chapters of Govier, you'll find that you haven't been constructing reasonable arguments yourself.  In your first post, you equate living perefct, disciplined and careful lives with religious fanaticism, and also condemnation with one's self image as God.  Neither conclusion is supported by any logical path between the premise and the conclusion, and because of this simply become labels that you arbitrarily choose to assign to people.  The same goes for labelling people as "pitiful and sad" - you have not provided any basis upon which you explain how one might reasonably describe people as such.  None of the above demonstrate either soundness or cogency, both conditions are technically required for a "good" argument.<br><br>If you're going to hold everybody up to standards of "good" argument, speaking from the perspective of someone who teaches people to construct arguments that stand up to the tightest scrutiny, you've got a fair bit to learn yourself.</div></blockquote>For someone who doesnt even have simple foundation in LOGICS, ask him to read susanna 1st.
