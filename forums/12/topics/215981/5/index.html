Or the teachers fault?<br><br>Ya i agree with u, it goes the same with my parents, I attain good results and my dad would den cut me some slack. But sadly, its almost impossible for me, not that i did not put in the effort. To add on, before exams I frequent mcdonalds, fast food chains to revise with friends, my dad had doubted me and scolded me even when i explained to him, he kept on thinking I spent the time enjoying myself outside. I sat down and had a cool talk with him and he did not believe me. So what the hell right? I actually want to study and plan time and make the effort to go out and try to study, got friends to teach me certain formulaes and this is how i get treated, fair?</div>

I dont think so, I did put in the effort, and the results were not ideal. For example take one of my subjects Geography, out of 37 guys in my class, none passed, does that mean its out fault? Or the teachers fault?<br><br>Ya i agree with u, it goes the same with my parents, I attain good results and my dad would den cut me some slack. But sadly, its almost impossible for me, not that i did not put in the effort. To add on, before exams I frequent mcdonalds, fast food chains to revise with friends, my dad had doubted me and scolded me even when i explained to him, he kept on thinking I spent the time enjoying myself outside. I sat down and had a cool talk with him and he did not believe me. So what the hell right? I actually want to study and plan time and make the effort to go out and try to study, got friends to teach me certain formulaes and this is how i get treated, fair?</div></blockquote>Not fair, but whenever that happens, I SNEAK OUT LOR.
