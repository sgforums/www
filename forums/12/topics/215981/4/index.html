Oh, and try to be calm and talk nicely. You would need to express your opinions in a mature manner and ensure that he understands your situation, otherwise, he would just continue making decisions which he thinks is good for you...

But at home, I studied and did my homework.<br><br>Even then, you must at least prove that you are old and mature enough to handle yourself. And dropping from Express to N(A) is not one of the way to do so.

Watch tv kp me also. I go out with mum, he also come ask me stay home study. wtf, even if i stay home at most i stare at book, wont even absorb anything. Might as well let me go out and see the world and learn things the hard way. Doing that will only make me hate him more la.</div>
