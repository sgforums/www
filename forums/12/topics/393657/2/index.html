              <p>I think it better you pay a visit, intro yourself and ask them to walk more light footed.</p>

              <p>Theres been several such cases like this before......</p>

              <p>If it is consistent, I would say,</p>
              <p>It is not a result of human behaviour, but really the result of

              <p>For human behaviour, logically the timing, location, and

              <p>Many people find the same problem like you btw. So this is real

              <p>I think the neighbour lived above you will continue to do the same thing, may be not so often coz I'm speaking from experience.</p>
              <p>I lived in 2nd floor, bcoz my other half scared of high floors LOL</p>
              <p>oops.</p>
              <p>The neighbour who lived in 3rd floor, hang wet laundries like men boxers, ladies old fashion bra (I seen it so that why I didn't win any lottery).  When I tried to write email to town counci / NEA / call police or whatever also no use,</p>
              <p>I confront them 'hello, can you hang dry your laundries @ balcony? water-dripping from your wet laundries.  Did you throw rubbish out from the window?  Did you kept dog at home?  I always heard some sound from your unit at late night.'</p>
              <p>A auntie answer the door gave reply was 'Oh I don't know, can not hang wet laundries huh.  What?! only wind blow the rubbish towards your balcony direction!'</p>
              <p>I understand how you feel.   Such people don't admit it's their fault.</p>

              <p>i got this problem too....threatened them with police(the dude wasnt frightened)...threatened him with HDB officers(slightly frightened).apparently he must have been quite skilled with hammering on someones ceiling in past and got away with it!used bamboo poles to knock at spot where he was hitting too but things showed no improvement n got worse1</p>
              <p>maybe best thing and only thing to do now is to walk to the nearest GRC office where you get to meet your local minister of parliament.they usually have a meet your mp session every week highlighting grieviences from killer litter to bad neighbours from hell.</p>
              <p>try at your local mp meet your local area mp...make a call...but i dun think its needed...just walk in at the allocated times...usually 7pm or something.after telling them your problem...they would pay a visit to neighbours from hell upstairs.</p>
