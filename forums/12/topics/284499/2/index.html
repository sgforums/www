            <div class='col-md body'>Hi TS,<br><br>If u canÂ’t do anything on your hubby, how about making some changes on yourself? You said u are not working right? How about spending some time reading up stuff on the sport that he like?<br><br>There are Book on Indoor football or wrestling in the library right? Go find out what are the rules of the game, which are the well-known player or wrestler at the present. What are the strategy that u need to apply while playing indoor football to win and so on. I guess the more u know about sports, the more u will be interested in sport too<br><br>From then u are able to talk to him about sports, go watch live football together with him and so on. I think in doing so, at least both u and your hubby will cold down a bit and the relationship will not be getting from bad to worst. After all, You said you still love him right?<br><br>Wish u best of luck<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ShyShyCat:</div><div class="quote_body">We've been married for 2 years and things got a lot worst. Before we married, he paid a lot of attention to me but recently he rather focus on sports than his sexy wife.<br><br>All this problem started in the beginning of the year when his friends invited him to watch a football match at mamak stall. Since then, he went out almost every night to join his friends play indoor football (futsal?) and I don't mind with that because it's good to attached with some sports.<br><br>Last 3 months, he started to watch wrestling and bought a lot of DVDs. He became less caring towards me. Example, when I broke my glass in the kitchen, he just don't even bother to take his butt up and to see what happening. He just stick his eyes to the wrestling program.<br><br>Then last month, he bought a lot of posters (football, wrestling and basketball) and football bedsheets to decorate our room. He suggested that we should take down our wedding picture on the wall and replace it with a footballer named (Alex Ferguson?). He said it's a very inspirational poster and he want to frame it. We argued about that and at last I gave up for the sake of his happiness.<br><br>And what really upset a lot is during our anniversary recently, i bought him a nice watch and he give me a Nike football shoe as a gift. He said the shoe is pretty therefore he bought for me. Then, previous week is my birthday and his present for me is a DVD of wrestling. He said the DVD is great and I should watch it whenever I'm free.<br><br>Yesterday, I was preparing dinner while he read his sports magazine. I called his to take his dinner and he said dont disturb him. And out of my mouth I said "Eat magazines can already, no need to eat dinner!". He was very angry and shouted "You dont talk to me like that, I'm the game and king of kings in this house. If you keep talking a lot, I'll give you a shut the f**k up!". Then he grunted something like "Humaka?". I cried and ran into the room and we didnt talk since then.<br><br>Dear members, what should I do to save this marriage? I really love him a lot but recently he changed a lot suddenly and I had a really hard time to be with him.<br><br>I dont know what to do....<br><br>Thanks for reading such a long whining story of mine and i apologize for my weak grammars.<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br>ShyShyCat      </div></blockquote>SMLJ.... haha  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It is common for men to be crazy in soccer, but not till the extend that he neglects his wife, married only 2 years.<br><br>i think you should let him know, since tensions are high now probably not talking(unless u really find the right time with the right atmosphere.) you can try writing notes and stuff.<br><br>He gave u a nike shoe, i think that is acceptable, it is still not that overboard to giving you a soccer ball actually. But giving u a wrestling DVD is a lil overboard in my opinion. But perharps he meant well, trying to share or introduce his interests to you.<br><br>I think you have a few things you can do...<br>- TRY to watch soccer with him...wrestling i won't say you'd like..i mean even as a guy i don't like it myself. Maybe as you watch soccer you can try to strike up a conversation..or maybe if you really didn't like it..try to tell him.<br><br>- As i mentioned, tell him straight, maybe write a note if you can't open your mouth. If you're going to tell him through the mouth..it'd say try to find the right mood and atmosphere. It's pretty hard to do so, so i'd say write a note.<br><br>I think the problem's not that big yet..so you dont really have to refer him to some psychologist or what...but maybe when you raelly cant take it, and he agrees, you two can see a marriage counseller ( spelling?). As always, you can try seek opinions from forumers, but of course, read wisely and follow wisely..<br><br>Most importantly you have to be honest with your husband, tell him what you don't like and stuff.<br><br>EDIT: From what i read about you saying his friends...if there's a sudden change of attitude, it's probably the influence from his friends..there you can tell him how you don't like him treating you like this...if it's influence, tell him..he'll realise it.<br><br>Just my few cents worth, good luck.</div>
