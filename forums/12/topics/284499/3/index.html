Before we married, he paid a lot of attention to me but recently he rather focus on sports than his sexy wife.<br><br>All this problem started in the beginning of the year when his friends invited him to watch a football match at mamak stall. Since then, he went out almost every night to join his friends play indoor football (futsal?) and I don't mind with that because it's good to attached with some sports.<br><br>Last 3 months, he started to watch wrestling and bought a lot of DVDs. He became less caring towards me. Example, when I broke my glass in the kitchen, he just don't even bother to take his butt up and to see what happening. He just stick his eyes to the wrestling program.<br><br>Then last month, he bought a lot of posters (football, wrestling and basketball) and football bedsheets to decorate our room. He suggested that we should take down our wedding picture on the wall and replace it with a footballer named (Alex Ferguson?). He said it's a very inspirational poster and he want to frame it. We argued about that and at last I gave up for the sake of his happiness.<br><br><span style="color: red;">And what really upset a lot is during our anniversary recently, i bought him a nice watch and he give me a Nike football shoe as a gift. He said the shoe is pretty therefore he bought for me. Then, previous week is my birthday and his present for me is a DVD of wrestling. He said the DVD is great and I should watch it whenever I'm free.</span><br><br>Yesterday, I was preparing dinner while he read his sports magazine.
