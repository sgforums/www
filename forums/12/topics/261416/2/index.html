Look at Priscelia Chan and Alan Tern, the Mediacorp couple. They were best friends too, they know each other inside out, were with other people at first. But then, something happened to Priscelia's family, she turned to Alan, and hey presto, the rest is history. They are now getting married.<br><br>So I should say that there are indeed cases where the gal can be best of friends with a guy for some years, and then they get toether. It just so happens that it didn't happen to me. I personally had relationships with people where I know the person for less than 4 months, and we got together. Of course it didn't last long, and i suspect it is because we never really got to know each other well. That really got me thinking about wanting to know a person well enough before deciding to take the plunge. Because the more u know about someone, the more easy it is for me to decide if i can be with that person for long. At least, that's what I felt.<br><br>It just so happens that the girl I am best friend with(and the one I like for so long) feels otherwise. She don't want to look for someone who knows her well enough. She <span style="color: red;">feels that if something should happen between us, it would have happen a long time ago. In short, she's the type who loves to see the fireworks and sparkles in the sky, but fail to see the sky that is still there after the initial sparks and fireworks are over. </span>Hope u guys can understand the analogy.<br><br>Anyway, I am sure there's girls who would look at guys around them, or their buddies even after being friends for a few years. It just so happens it never happened to me. </div></blockquote>I have known my boyfriend for more than 6 years, and we got together only recently.<br><br>some choose friendship over love,<br>others choose love over friendship<br><br>depends on whether u dare to take the 1st step into making things happen. Sparks don fly upon chance, but feelings do develop.<br><br>i do agree that if "it's meant to be, it should happen long ago".. But somethings need time to realise... after ups and downs, den u'll discover who's the one.<br><br>as a gal, i do admit some gals are too into fairytales ending. I was guilty of it once also.<br><br>blame it on korean drama la.. lol</div>
