She finfds that is better for them to be friends cos she will need to care about his bad habits at all due to the fact there are friends only.<br><br>Case 2<br>gal A knows guy C for only a few months and guy C asked gal A to be his gf. gal A agreeds. All the way gal A feels she cannot stand his habits and breaks off with him. Guy C refused and they quarrel and fight until they broke off badly and never ever be friends again.<br><br>Sometimes it may not be bad for the guy if the gal rejected him cos the girl knows that she cannot accept his habits or actions during the years as friends.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I dont do research on these things .... lol<br>But I believe to start a stable relationship ... u need to have 2 criterias met...<br>They are : Understand and passion<br>Understand and passion are interlink... With understanding, u r able to create passion between both... With passion, u r able to open up one's heart then able to understand one... So, it is just a chain reaction...<br><br>For example, if u and him or her being friends for too long, u understand him or her more than a newcomer... But however, if there is no passion between u and him or her, u cant expect him or her to say "yes"... Since, u understand him or her, it will not be difficult to give him or her surprise, sweet talk, cause emotional stir, make her happy and blah blah...<br><br>For example, if u and him or her just started due to passion, him or her feels for u more than normal...  But however, if u dont understand him or her, it is difficult to maintain these feelings... Since, he or she feels for u, he or she usually opens up his or her heart and tells u everything that he or she thinks. And thus, u build up the understanding...<br><br>In short, if u understand him or her, u need to build up the passion<br>if he or she feels for u , u need to take the chance to understand her<br>Very tiring ,rite??? haha... therefore, u can only apply these concepts naturally... If it is destiny that both of u are together, u willl be together no matter what circumstances...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Girls can be long term friend with guys.<br><br>Because they do not have that special feeling towards the guy.<br><br>In a friendship...<br>They feel comfortable to be with them, as they can be themselves.<br>There's no obligation to give them preferential treatment.<br><br>Unless the girl has feelings for the guy, and the guy is interested in her.<br>The sparks can fly.

I believe the real reason for most of these failure of friends failing to convert to couple is due to the fact. They believe being comfortable with each other is key to a r/s.<br><br>Being comfortable with each other coomfortable of cos is important in a r/s but is not the key! The way u behave,acts and thought is ciritcal to the affection she has for u. Being as friend,the critiria is much lower compare to lover. Therefore they close one eye on many issues and bring themselves closer and being relax with u AS A FRIEND ONLY.<br><br>The closeness as friend might give u the wrong impression that u got the chance to be with her as an item.

If only...<br><br>You're right, there's probably no chemistry at all in the first place. Not that it matters anymore. She has found someone to be by her side now,although this relationship is not seen as "normal" by some parties. I think all along I know she will never be my to begin with, but somehow, i just can't let go like I did for my other relationships.

            <div class='col-md body'>Google for ladder theory....<br><br>The ladder theory is a funny, scientific explanation of how men and women<br>are attracted to each other. It also covers such topics as why women<br>sometimes just want to be friends but men always want sex. It is based upon<br>many years of sociological field testing, and was first conceptualized in<br>1994 in Exeter, CA by Dallas Lynn with acknowledgements to Jared Whitson for<br>his role in formalizing the theory.<br><br>Sally: We are just going to be friends, OK?<br>Harry: Great, friends. It's the best thing...You realize, of course, that we can never be friends.<br>Sally: Why not?<br>Harry: What I'm saying is - and this is not a come-on in any way, shape, or form - is that men and women can't be friends, because the sex part always gets in the way.<br>Sally: That's not true. I have a number of men friends and there is no sex involved.<br>Harry: No, you don't.<br>Sally: Yes, I do.<br>Harry: No, you don't.<br>Sally: Yes, I do.<br>Harry: You only think you do.<br>Sally: You're saying I'm having sex with these men without my knowledge?<br>Harry: No, what I'm saying is they all want to have sex with you.<br>Sally: They do not.<br>Harry: Do too.<br>Sally: They do not.<br>Harry: Do too.<br>Sally: How do you know?<br>Harry: Because no man can be friends with a woman that he finds attractive. He always wants to have sex with her.<br>Sally: So you're saying that a man can be friends with a woman he finds unattractive.<br>Harry: No, you pretty much want to nail them, too.<br>Sally: What if they don't want to have sex with you?<br>Harry: Doesn't matter, because the sex thing is already out there, so the friendship is ultimately doomed, and that is the end of the story.<br></div>
