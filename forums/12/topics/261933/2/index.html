Has he ever  hinted to you in anyway that he wanted more than just what you two are having now? Did he have the tendency to hold your hand when crossing the road? (Take note, sometimes my single male colleagues hold my hand or elbow when crossing road because they are just being gentlemen. So, even if he does that, it really doesn't mean anything special too. Some do it spontaneously because it is in their nature to care). Did he took special care of you as what a guy should do for a special girlfriend? If not, then there is no case. He only wants a friend, a platonic friendship.<br><br>For those who said your friend is irresponsible, I really don't see what so irresponsible about his attittude or behavior when all he wanted was a close friend of a different sex to have just a non commital relationship.<br><br>It was you who develop a different feelings for him. Just because you both go out as friends and you started to think of something else, which I wouldn't say was wrong too since you are single and wants a relationship badly.<br><br>Sure, if you want to ask him to have a committed relationship by all means but are you prepare to face the embarrassment if he said he only wanted friendship and nothing else. Are you willing to continue with the platonic relationship after being rejected outrightly? Can you face the rejection?<br><br>Ask yourself all these first before you take the plunge and then embarrass yourself for nothing and on top of that lose a close friend</div>

Please be more specific. Going to movies, dinner or even just simply holding hands doesn't qualify as bf/gf. Some guys are more physical that includes holding hands but that doesn't mean he is treating you as someone special that he wants in his life. Don't make the same blunder as World Peace and give us the run around. Clarify your stance clearly.</div>

I really dont know how he feels.</div></blockquote>So, are you saying you two actually engage in sexual intimacy? Let's get this straight. Even if you two engage in sex doesn't mean he wants you as someone special in his life. It may sound harsh what i'm going to say next but you were just being stupid for giving in to him without clarifying your own stance in the first place. Some guys only want a sex partner, an outlet for their sexual desire and when he initiated sex with you and you didn't object he would have mistaken that you don't mind having sex with no string attach with him.<br><br>As a woman, we must make clear our intention and position. You cannot just take for granted 'oh, if he have sex with me that means he must be treating me as his gf'. WRONG thinking! And do you know how much unnecessary problems you have created for yourself?<br><br>If you ask him about your status in his life now and he said he only wants you as a confidante and an occasional intimate partner, how are you going to react? Feel angry, sad, frustrated, cheated? You wouldn't have to feel all these if you have lay down all rules beforehand. But if he said 'oklah, then we be togatherloh' like very reluctantly and unsurely then it's not truly what he wants because you have force him into a corner now and he has no choice but go along since now he feel obligated to you. Do you know an obligated relationship ends up nowhere and may spiral into even bigger problems?<br><br>Either way I think you are screwed. Be wiser next time sister.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>An uncommitted relationship? Or a friendship with physical intimacy?<br><br>Think of it this way:<br><br>Would you rather spend the time with someone whom you love and also loves you?<br><br>It is within your rights to ask him for his stand. Why are you hesitating to even verify your position in his heart?<br><br>You are afraid of the answer. Yet is this state of uncertainty better?<br><br>If all that you are to him is a toy, you will be discarded by him anyway, sooner or later.<br><br>If you aren't, then congratulations.<br><br>Isn't this finality better than mindless guessing while he continues to enjoy the physical intimacy <strong>without</strong> any stirngs attached?</div>
