I mean it's just these few incidents that is sort of pretty major... but aren't there smaller or minor things in life your parents have done to show that they love you?? Haven't they bought you your favourite food or cook your favourite dish?? these are minor things which many of us tends to overlook?? even having to wake up early every morning to make breakfast for the family is a sign of love as well.<br><br>consider looking at other prespective... and not be a victim of the self-fulfulling phophercy, as it just brings unnecessary unhappiness<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)
