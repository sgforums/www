              <p>Economy is bad so being out of job is not uncommon but you should also rethink why that happens to you. If your performance is not up to standard, why is it not and what can you do to improve it. Being depress won't get you a new job nor improve your job performance.</p>
              <p>Results are only important for the first few jobs you apply for, later all people see are mostly your experience. GF you can always find in time so whats the problem. You are not the only guy in SG who is single at 25.</p>
              <p>Friends don't come by just sitting at home and talking about it on the forums. Go out and know more people. Some people suggest games and thats a good way to socialise and get to know more people from all over the world. As long as you can control yourself and not become a game addict, games are fine ways to pass time and get to know people of all ages and background.</p>
              <p>You are only as useless as you make yourself be. There are many people in this world and even in SG alone in circumstances worse than you yet they still have the strong will to survive so what reason do you have to even think of death?</p>

              <p>Y not, i don't see anything wrong in that. Sometimes volunteer work can change a person and make them appreciate their lives more. If you have no volunteery experience and don't understand how important volunteer work is and how it can help change people, don't crap.</p>

              <p>u male or female? Staying @ home in the weekends isnt a bad thing. U can also go out to Orchard if u want to. I like to sometimes go out alone because i feel a certain pleasure in it,</p>
              <p>Lonely in singapore is  nothing man. I had it worst than u , i stayed in OZ for 3++ years <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">ALONE</span></strong><strong> </strong>while studying in UNI. The place i was in was Tasmania, its a ghost town. My source of entertainment was just DVD, TV and game console. Did not talk to anyone except my Uni classmates. I also had no close R/s with them as they were all ang moh.</p>
              <p>Singapore is in fact best suited for lonely people coz, u will have company such as cinema, shopping centres, clubs and entertainment. I found out These are your real "friends". They are always there for u anytime of the day.</p>
              <p>Think in this way and u will not be lonely. Even if u thik u are, u still have so many chances to socialise Dont think u are the worst cause therehave been people who are more lonely than u in other countries, and they dont get the chance to socialise at all.</p>

              <p><br>Life is full of up and downs. Applicable for commoners like you and me. Also applicable for people who are marked for great things.</p>
              <p>Why compare who has a worse experience than the other.</p>
              <p>You have been watching so many history documentaries/movies/stories of China. I am sure if you watch carefully (as compared to simply passing time), I am sure you can learn something for those history stories.</p>
              <p>Many who started a new dynasty rose from simple peasants .. so who say only those born with a silver spoon in the mouth are meant for great future? But again, great dynasty will also one day come to an end (I am sure you know by now).</p>
              <p>So move on with your life. If  you are not destined to die today, then it means you have a tomorrow and another tomorrow once you passed today. It's not that bad yet!</p>
              <p>Tomorrow is Sunday. Why don't u visit a church near where you live and listen to what ever message that is being preached. May be there is something installed for you there...</p>

              <p>There are a few millions of people out there who are in a worse situations than you.</p>
              <p>Everyday travel from JB to Singapore to work for that meagre amount of money. Waking up 4 am and reaching home 12 am every farking day.</p>
              <p>Left homeland to go other countries to work for also another meagre amount of money. Just to reach there and get insulted and criticized by the people over there.</p>
              <p>Parents got involved in an accident and then BOOM, gone just like that. That poor kid will never see his/her parents again.</p>
