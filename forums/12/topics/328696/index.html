              <p>What is the reason for the breakup ? Will those problems you encounter with this guy.. dissapear after the patch back ? Unlikely....</p>
              <p>He loves you.. but hates some of your quirks.. that's why he can't take you back.</p>
              <p>Unless both of you takes a 180 degree turn into another person with none of the problems of your previous self... else.. the relationship will always be running in circles.</p>
              <p>Like I love my Motorola.. but hates the keypads.. I ain't gonna buy same model after this one breaks. I move on.</p>
              <p>That's why there's such a feeling call "nostalgia".</p>

              <p>Dear, for time immemorial, when a boy loves you, he tells you so and he shows you so through his actions. Cheer up. It is quite clear things are over.</p>
              <p>I know you like him to bits but since he knows you want to get back together and still, he is not making any effort to get close to you, it is his way of saying he no longer loves you. Just let it sink, so you can heal.</p>

              <p>It is in our nature to want the things we cannot have. Boys, before turning into men, have a knack for being indecisive when it comes to matters of the heart.</p>

              <p>I see. Then you have 2 options.</p>
              <p>Either ask him very directly, whether he still wants to be together. Yes or no. Then take it from there. </p>
              <p>Or you can move on and get to know other boys. My advice is the latter, like my cousin always said, "In life you only get one shot with one boy, once in your lifetime."</p>
