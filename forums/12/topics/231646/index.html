            <div class='col-md body'>I think I get a sense of wat u mean. I lunch with my colleauges, and all day long they only talk about their work. Like you, yes work is important but there must be a balance in life. I am still not sure wat to do. But one thing I can suggest, is probably to take it in a positive light. Maybe you should see this as a motivation. e.g. My classmates are concerned about their grades. This is a challenge to me. I shall study harder and get better grades than them.<br><br>In the meantime, when talking...also introduce non-studies related topics. E.g During the holidays you have any plans etc. Or get to know wat are their interest e.g. If comic books, than try to ask them about it. I was not interested in comic books, but my friend was. And although I will never be interested in it, I enjoyed asking her about her interest and it kept our friendship going on.</div>
