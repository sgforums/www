Then, at the designated time, if he never appears, we would somehow wait for him because he is always late. So after about 10mins or so, we would call him, but he would never pick up his hp or his house phone. We would msg him and he would not reply. Then after abt 45mins or so, when we finally tried getting to him, he would tell us that he is not coming or dun feel like coming etc...Doesn't even have the initiative to call us or even pick up his phone.<br><br></div>

He also ps us during those times too.
