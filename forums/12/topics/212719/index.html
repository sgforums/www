So this might spoil the plans...cuz if there was a "fake" outing and those friends told him that there isn't any, then he knows that there isn't any outing, thus he would not go.</div>

Cuz sometimes when i try talking to him about the ps thing, he would reply..."Whatever la, you always think u r right la!" </div></blockquote>I have this kind of friends too.. everytime i organise an outing, the outcast will be him but no choice.. he need to company his wife. So now, whenever i organise outing, i'll organise in front of him but never invite him. I jus told him, "Aiya, no nid to ask u la, u sure go home company ur wife la, ask u also waste my saliva" the next outing, i also never invite him but he show up himself with our surprise...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Unfortunately I can understand how you feel.. I have a friend who is somewhat like that, always like to ps people. Come to think of it... I have 2 of them. Invite them for outings, they dun come,  and dun even call, or even pick up. These people are serious attitude problem, should reflect on themselves and  if neccesary, stick the handphone up their rear so they will know if it rings .<br><br>I think your friend has some serious commitment problem too... like that, he will have problems chasing girls. It certainly isnt enough to ps him personally.. I agree, you should gang up with the girl he likes to ps him....</div>
