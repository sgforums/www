There can be many reasoning for this.. Since you jus met her not long.. why not.. still proceed as friends first.. though you know her for long.. but there's a period of time you both havent met up.. things can change during these period of time..

I was bored anyways.<br><br>Something along these lines.<br><br>But I can be sure if sheÂ’s thinking of A, well, since there is no progress, we must take things back to the beginning.<br><br>And by doing that, ask yourself since you last met her. How much do you know about her? Are you willing to give up this friendship, just to tell someone youÂ’re not sure who likes you, what you feel?<br><br>Once again, judging from what I see outside of the circle (You must often pull yourself out of the situation and look at it, without all the emotions, else your view is biased, and may often bring downfall.)<br><br>Last of all, I have 2 personal experiences that coincide with yours. I used to have 2 good female friends, I liked them, and thought they liked me(at different times of course), so I told them what I feel. I didnÂ’t pull myself out of the circle and think, and that was a very big mistake.<br><br>I lost 2 good friends subsequently, and it was only thanks to God that I got them back, so IÂ’m quite relieved.<br><br>But really, sometimes its better to think with your brain, then with your heart. Whatever you do, make a wise an informed decision, and donÂ’t rush too much when it comes to affairs of the heart.<br></div>

She definitely will not mind you to help her carry her bag for her as you are her friend and she thinks that you are nice and helpful. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>The rest of the points that you have pointed out don't really meant anything as she could be a friendly and polite girl. For keeping the dating as secret, you will need to refer to my worst scenario in the first line in my first paragraph. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Continue to care for her as a friend and like her if you still have feelings for her. Don't think about anything else as they might not make you a happy person at the end of the day...or worse, before the beginning of your date with her. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Good luck...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
