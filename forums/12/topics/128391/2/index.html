            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Desmond<br><br>I have been through this before, and I trully say it is really not my stand to advise whether to tell or not.  But from your message I rather advise you to reassess your business partner again.<br><br>Ask him does he gf know about his fooling?  Does he intend to hide and lie to her?  For how long?  Then you better do something quick and break the business partner relationship with him whether for 3 squre meal or not.<br><br>I can tell you, a man will run his business in the way he run his life.  If he can lie and hid thing from his gf, trust me he can do that to anyone, including you.  This type of people I rather say are mostly no integrity, no responsibility and no emotions.<br><br>As whether to tell her or not, the question will be will she believe you or not?<br><br>Regards<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Desmond Chow:</div><div class="quote_body">I know a friend of mine who is a guy and i know his gf as well .My friend is two timing her all the time and i wonder should i be so k-poh to go tell the gf or just aiya not my business anyway .My friend is going to batam to visit pros and then later he will stay at his second gf house in singapore after his batam trip .As for his first gf ,i think wait for him to come back from overseas lor .she still don't know that her bf is playing outside with pros and have a 2nd gf in singapore though she is his 1st gf .what a bastard i must say .Should I close one eye as his bf is the kind of high risk category people who will kena stds all aids not i splash him cold water but the way he play he also never think of his 1st gf whom i know .</div></blockquote></div>
