            <div class='col-md body'>I am a person who go for facts lor,<br>so I will give you details of what I have found out .<br><br>1) first explore the fact of why the gf likes the boyfriend?<br><br>1a) Does the girl love the guy very much and willing to die for him?<br><br>If yes then forget about even telling this type of girl cos it will not be of any use.<br>Through the years I have seen this type of gals are willing to share bf or husband with any girl. What you do will not mean anything to her.<br><br>1b) what type of girl is she ? conservative type, native type, smart type  or the wild type?<br><br>1b1) Wild type, no point in telling. Maybe she also want threesome?  hehe just kidding!<br><br>1b2) Conservative type, Never have sex before at least she is still safe from the bf. She still can be save and the only type i feel that is worth the effort in saving!!!<br><br>1b3) Native type. wah this type is the hardest. will believe in bf no matter wat you say. Got one case even when the gf saw that the bf is having sex with another gal, keep on saying that they are just playing around.<br><br>1b4) Smart type. just hint can liao, they will know what to do.<br><br>2) Do you think the guy is yao dao and know the art of sweet talking?<br><br>Sadly this is true if the guy is good looking then will attract more gals everywhere he goes and with his sweet talking skills will dissolve any attempt from you to break them up.<br><br>My suggestion is this<br>know what type of girl you are dealing with and think carefully if your advice will have any effect on her. If nothing goes into her head or love is all that she can think of then do not borther. why waste time ?<br><br>Please read on if you think she can be save from her evil bf  or else do not waste your time.<br><br>Ok now that you have decided that she is worth the effort and will at least willing to act once you have hinted her or say anything.<br><br>Then this the part where I will teach the art of hinting :<br><br>1) Girls are very sensitive people. hehe! Oi relax lar, this is  not some XXX story. They are prone to hearsay. just spread among her friends that you saw her bf with girl and holding and kissing the news will spread.<br><br>2) If can try to take photo of 2nd gf with the bf. The next time when he goes batam. You invite her and her friends out for ktv or wat. The idea is to slip the photo into her bag without her knowing.<br><br>3) you know her email rite so just use an unknown email address and sent the photo to her email address.<br><br>4) Use a new number to sms her the full details of her bf misdeed.<br><br>5) This one is the killer blow: Paste the A1 size photo of the bf and the 2nd gf have sex or kissing on her front door. Then siam asap. This method sounds like a loanshark rite? hehe But the effect is the greatest cos her mama and papa will for sure kick the bf ass out for you.<br><br>Final Thought  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br>What I have say here is to be use with caution.<br>You got to think carefully first.<br>I can offer only ideas thats all.<br>The rest is up to you to decide what to do.</div>

Erm, why must your wife meet his gf? Btw, if you tell her that that's your buddy's gf, she will not suspect of you anything one mah. To me, you seem to be afraid that if your wife saw his gf, you will be immediately labelled as 'fooling around'. Sounds to me your wife don't trust you that much? or lack of communication?<br><br>Since you stated that you don't want to be a busybody, all the more it stops you from telling and thus giving all sorts of excuse (like this one about wife not seeing his gf before) If you are really determine to expose him, you should have already went ahead and do it. Oh don't be mistaken that i'm trying to scold you or something, because it's indeed a really confusing battle between you and your 'evil' side.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Since you've her number, i think you can just use a different number to sms her to inform her about her bf's bad deeds. Just say that you're someone close to her, but yet don't want her to know who you are. You reason for doing this is to prevent her from being cheated by that guy. I'm sure she'll appreciate a lot and won't really care about who sent her the msgs.<br><br>However, make sure that there are other people around them that know about the bf's behaviour in batam and such. If not, sooner or later, he'll know that it is u who "bao to".</div>
