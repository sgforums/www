You describe the thai gal more than the sg gal. You are more concern in what will happened to the thai gal when you married her than the sg gal.<br><br>The most important for you to consider is what do they want during marriage life and are you able to support what they want in the future? And don't forget about what they think of you. No point making it a one-way traffic.<br><br>You are going to spend your life with her, so choose the one that your heart tells you.</div>
