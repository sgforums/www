            <div class='col-md body'>Umm,, if they both find out what you are doing here, i think you wouldnt even have the chance to choose between them. Frankly, if you really like one of em, you wouldnt hesitate in blocking other girls from making your decisions waver.. so i believe that you are confused and you dont really like em. And i think your just going for that Thai's pretty face and $$. Well if she has good looks and money i dont think she will stick to you</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thai guys from what I read in a newspaper before (as you know news can be blown out of proportion so take it with a pinch of salt) is that they tend to be violent and unfaithful. The article said that Thai girls has the highest tendancy of giving their husbands the bobbit because Thai guys are huge MCPs and take their girls for granted, expecting them to work and look after all the housework and kids. And while they do that, they fool around with other girls outside.<br><br>Also, can you trust her totally. My hubby's friend was dating this Thai girl. He flew often to meet up with her but he dumped her because he didn't trust her not to meet other guys when he was not around. I would say she is very very beautiful. Big doe-like eyes, fair skin, soft voice. Very gentle and feminine, something which alot of SG girls are lacking.<br><br>Anyway, ultimately the decision is yours to make.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hm..from what u read in newspaper..I gather that its quite true as I've spoke and asked bout why they do not prefer they own guys.. probably like some sg gers who prefer "ang mo" cox they think ang mo more loving huh..<br><br>As for trusting or not, its really up to individual to whether believe or not..as distance plays a part in whether knowing is she meeting or guys or not. Anyway, one never knows, even though she might be pretty, she could be faithful too.<br><br>However, I do believe that, her mindset might change once she finish her studies and starts working in the real world. She's still a student now, so naturally, most gers in their school days would choose love over bread, but as times goes by, bread will eventually weigh abit more than love, in which I personally encountered a sg ger who has this transition of love over bread to love n bread.</div>
