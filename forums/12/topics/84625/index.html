            <div class='col-md body'>maybe what i m gng to say might infuriates you....<br>you said you couldnt trust anyone in the family anymore...I believe trust is built on mutual understanding and communication..What I'm trying to imply is you have to give your mum benefit of doubts(maybe that's why she wasn't sure), given that you have 'history' of 'blabbering' vulgarities at times. You know what I mean? Your 'sinister' sis wldnt be able to set u up in the first place if you havent had this habit. I am not saying your mum is right. Everyone has part in it but that's not important anymore (only very important when everyone is screaming at each other). It's just misunderstandings. I do quarrel with family members sometimes, but it's also a way of understanding each other more.<br>As for your parents' 'jie ti fa hui-ness', I believe it's abit inappropriate for them to do tt with everyone 's head 'on fire', but I can strongly guarantee( till your parents grow old and die) tt they still love you very much, else they can't be bothered how bad you become.<br>And I am sure you will be able to kick the habit of scolding vulgarities one fine day. Cheers and have a pleasant day ahead!</div>

Either you know or you dont know, there's nothing as not sure.</div></blockquote>Oh.. Kay...<br><br>Everyone has their own approach to things. But not all of these approaches are correct. But I'm not saying they are all wrong either.<br><br>Truth is, there is no one single correct way to rectify this kind of problem. I admit, I would have done things similar to what you have done, but others won't, but it will probably build up to the same conclusion.<br><br>Problem solving is both a talent and a skill. And some problems can't be solved in one conversation, much less one night. Relationship difficulties between parents-children usually stems from lack of communication, bonding and favouritism towards one child.<br><br>But hey, it's ur life. Live it the way you want it. Who am I to tell you how to live, right?<br><br>No regretz..</div>
