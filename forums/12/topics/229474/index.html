            <div class='col-md body'>hey dude, this is a realistic world.  You said your family cannot afford to put you to  music school, so the only way, to pursue your interest will be to do it on your own.<br><br>so, finish JC, pass with flying colors or what not, get a scholarship to go U, so that your family need not fork out the extra income.  Do a degree, whichever that you think you can cope, Engineering or something, come back, get a paper pushin job &amp; start saving....being a scholar, you probably be planted in a cushy job that pay you quite well, you shld be able to save aside quite a far bit.  Once you saved enough or after you completed your bond, whichever is later, quit and pursue your dreams....<br><br>I dunno if there is any certification tests that you can take without any lessons, if so, get it.  If not, try to apply for some job that plays the piano, either at a lounge or hotel lobby, usually they will ask for on-site demo, charm them with your skills and you can play and earn some keep.  When there is opportunity, ask company to sponsor your further education in music.<br><br>Of course, the steadfast way is to depend on your own to fulfil your dream.  Its never too old to pursue your music dream (since you are financially constrained).<br><br>If not, you can buy some TOTO or 4D every week and hope to tio the first prize.....just joking.<br></div>

This is the niche, and i will have to agree that a formal education is what it takes to sit in a theatre to play.<br><br>I suppose it's really passion and talent that drives a person?<br>He can't sit in Esplanade to perform doesn't mean he can't do Indoor Stadium for S.H.E?<br>Sometimes we can't just get what we want, not being able to be a musician in Classical Music, the next best is being a musician in Entertainment and Pop Music industry and so on, i hope TS perspective will not be too negetive. It's not the end of the world. There are other avenues to play.<br><br>My bet is, look elsewhere instead of looking only at Concert/Theatre.<br><br>I understand that La-Salle SIA's entry is pretty easy.
