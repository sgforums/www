Meanwhile, it's also time for me to start deciding which course in the university I want to take up, should I clear my A'levels.<br><br>I took a look at most of the courses provided by our local universities, yet, almost none of the courses interest me at all. Physical science, chemical engineering, aero-physics, law, etc etc. All boring courses.<br><br>But of course, I'm not without an aim or a goal in my life. I had actually decided on the one thing I really want to do even before I took my O'levels. I want to be in the music industry (as in like professional concert pianist...not like 5566 or S.H.E that kind)<br><br>I went to take a look at the entry requirement for the local music/arts schools such as Yong Siew Toh or NAFA or La Salle. It was to my greatest and deepest disappointment that my A'level cert. is not going to help me much in entering such instituitions at all!<br><br>Instead, I must have a 'professional musical background' to enter such schools. Meaning, I should have a music diploma or at least a grade 8 in music.<br><br>And the most regretable thing is, my family do not have such financial means to support me a music lesson at all. We could hardly come out with the money to pay for the house, much less piano lessons, or a grade 8 cert.! I self-teach myself piano...but I must say it's really difficult to reach a certain standard without professional guidance and help.<br><br>So at the end of the day, it boils down to one thing.[b] I can't enter the music industry in Singapore because I don't have money.</strong> Worst thing is, it does not matter how hard I study for my A'level, it does not matter how well I score...at the end of the day it all means NOTHING for me!<br><br>What then, is the point of studying so hard?<br><br>It suddenly dawned on me that the so call meritocracy does not really exist in Singapore at all. We are still living in an elitist state after all. I'm so sad.[/b]</blockquote>sorry to burst ur bubble.<br><br>in the professional philharmonic arena...  doesnt mean self-taught piano can allow u to rule... because, u may be playing ur favourite song happily.<br>you are neglecting many things.<br>many things of professional teachings.. like sight reading, blablabla there are just too many.. and maybe when you encounter the words on paper. the taugays. tremble clefs the dictions and all.. u might feel discouraged and AGAIN 'so called boring'~<br>and also... a musician who's in an orchestra... is sometimes a puppet.<br>the score comes to you, and you have to intepret it accordingly.. and bring out the soul of the music. but it depends on conductors... some wants you to do their way. so you have no emotions, u are only a robot playing the music.<br>some wants you to have a grasp of it.. and wander ard yourself.<br>it's not all that glorious..<br><br>but im not discouraging you. im only telling you to venture more.. dont be like some young kid, with inspiring but unrealistic dreams( i wan to be a astronaut  that goes to the sun etc.) know your limitations.<br><br>finally.<br><br>we always say, before a musician starts his career. how far he goes is already predetermined. not by his hardwork. im not saying hardwork is totally not important.<br>but in our field, talent plays like 80 percent... yea.<br><br>cheers..<br>you sound a lil extreme.. and i guess u arent thinkign clearly now.. but anyway<br>all the best.<br></div>

He was a member of a boyband called fanclub. After the group disbanded, Rain was still keen to continue his dancing career and entered many different auditions.<br>Despite his talent, the singer was rejected at several auditions because he was "too ugly".<br>In a CNN interview, he recalled one incident where he was told, "Your dancing is great, but we're rejecting you because you don't have double eyelids" (the fold in the eyelids that makes eyes appear bigger, which many Asians do not have).<br>Finally, Rain entered an audition for a Korean entertainment company, JYP Entertainment. Park Jin Young, JYP's CEO, became interested in the entertainer and took him under his wing.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The music industry has only space for the talented, and none for the mediocrity. Talent must be nurtured young. Are you talented?<br><br>You said it's hard to achieve any higher without professional guidance. How certain are you of this? Say for instance, you have the best pianist as your mentor, do you think you can surpass him/her?<br><br>If you are sure of your talent, I don't know how anyone can help you. You're already halfway through on the wrong road. To start on a new road with half the fuel left, nobody can really say if it's a good idea, other than yourself.<br><br>If you are not very sure, chances are, you aren't half as talented you hope you were. Sorry to burst your bubble. I'd say, work hard, earn lots of money, so you'll be able to nurture your children's talents, and support their ambitions in future. Otherwise, they'll end up being disgruntled teenagers someday too.<br><br>Think about it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Do you really believe that you can be a concert pianist? Because really, there are thousands of people who have had a musical background from young and would still not make it. It's not impossible, but you really need that talent and passion for it.<br><br>And if you agree that it is not realistic, give it up! You can still pursue your passion in music, just maybe not a career in one... No point lingering on lost opportunities. Instead, you probably should look out for the other opportunities in your life, and embrace them.  Don't let a missed chance blind you of all the other ones in front of you.</div>
