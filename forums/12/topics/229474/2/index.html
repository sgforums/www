Meanwhile, it's also time for me to start deciding which course in the university I want to take up, should I clear my A'levels.<br><br>I took a look at most of the courses provided by our local universities, yet, almost none of the courses interest me at all. Physical science, chemical engineering, aero-physics, law, etc etc. All boring courses.<br><br>But of course, I'm not without an aim or a goal in my life. I had actually decided on the one thing I really want to do even before I took my O'levels. I want to be in the music industry (as in like professional concert pianist...not like 5566 or S.H.E that kind)<br><br>I went to take a look at the entry requirement for the local music/arts schools such as Yong Siew Toh or NAFA or La Salle. It was to my greatest and deepest disappointment that my A'level cert. is not going to help me much in entering such instituitions at all!<br><br>Instead, I must have a 'professional musical background' to enter such schools. Meaning, I should have a music diploma or at least a grade 8 in music.<br><br>And the most regretable thing is, my family do not have such financial means to support me a music lesson at all. We could hardly come out with the money to pay for the house, much less piano lessons, or a grade 8 cert.! I self-teach myself piano...but I must say it's really difficult to reach a certain standard without professional guidance and help.<br><br>So at the end of the day, it boils down to one thing.[b] I can't enter the music industry in Singapore because I don't have money.</strong> Worst thing is, it does not matter how hard I study for my A'level, it does not matter how well I score...at the end of the day it all means NOTHING for me!<br><br>What then, is the point of studying so hard?<br><br>It suddenly dawned on me that the so call meritocracy does not really exist in Singapore at all. We are still living in an elitist state after all. I'm so sad.[/b]</blockquote>you life... you play with the cards that you are dealt with....<br><br>there is no point complaining over things you cannot change. think of things you CAN change and work on them...<br><br>continue with you stutdies and when you have money go and indulge in your love of music by learning and playing....<br><br>lamenting about this and that isn't going to help you at all...<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>No one force you to go Jc. Its not like you are so poor and hopeless that you got no choice but to end up in Jc.<br><br>Fact is Music/Entertainment is as much about Natural Talent and Luck as Hardwork. You may work harder, have a greater desire and passion but if you do not have the luck or the talent then sadly the Music/Entertainment field is not for you.<br><br>I feel that this is in no way related to meritocracy. The fact that you say you are poor and yet study in Jc, hoping to make it to Uni is meritocracy in itself.<br><br>If you are really good in music then qualifying for a music school will not be that difficult for you. You have to prove your worth first. Sadly thats Singapore.<br>What more do you think that the system can do for you?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>lasalle is easier to enter as compared to nafa.<br><br>but dont bother coming to lasalle. the lessons are like crap. and from what i heard, the music courses arent very good. basically you pay school fees but you dont learn anything from the school.<br>some people are absent like almost the whole semester but still can pass.<br>the so-called 'celebrity' lecturers are waste of time and money.<br>there's a local celebrirty lecturer who is always late for class, and instead of teaching, he plays his own compositions and ask the students what they think of it, and just show off.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>To be a performing musician, you need many years of practices and training... It's not something that you'll gain overnight, unless you're a talent like Mozart.<br><br>Unfortunately, acquiring musical skills is indeed a heavy investment. Not only you need to invest a lot of money, you also need to invest a lot of time. (Musicians often train every day and every night...) The musical instrument itself is already very expensive...<br><br>There are many times when we dream of something but in the end we cannot get what we what. But life still has to go on. It's always to good to have "back-up plans" and "alternatives" in life. Have you considered what you can do besides music?<br><br>You are still young and you still have some time to decide what to do in life. You're better than many of my friends, who are regretting after spending 3 or 4 years in university...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>TS, unfortunately, you'll have to readjust your dream. Professional concert pianists start training at a very early age and not only is hard work needed (5hrs or more per day practising is the norm), talent is essential too.<br><br>But fret not, you are still on the right path. In Singapore, the cert is a basic necessity. You can carry on studying, get into a uni and after you graduate, get a job and finance your music studies.<br><br>You may not be able to be a concert pianist but you can join a band and enjoy the music. Or you can be a music teacher or church pianist.<br><br>I myself am studying in uni and i'm also generally not very interested in the subjects I am studying now. Physics, chemistry, econs, electronics etc are rather boring in my opinion. But I plan to get a job after graduation and use the money to furthur finance my musical studies.<br><br>Ultimately, I plan to be a music teacher  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Good luck!

            <div class='col-md body'>Just my two cents worth.<br><br>Sometimes it's one thing to have a career and another to have a passion / interest to pursue. It is not always exclusive. Ideally, both coincides but it isn't always the case and you can still enjoy both.  For example, I have a career in science and research, but in my free time, I love dabbling in music. I once was kinda in the shoes of TS with no formal music background, but I really liked it and even wanted to perform.  So in JC I started learning piano by myself - it's not that impossible if you really want to do it. I mean, honestly, even after getting up to grade 6, I knew I wouldn't be concert pianist level without the formal training.  But yeah, I still enjoying playing the piano a lot, and thinking back, as much as i loved it, it probably wasn't practical to head for a career in performance with my background. Sure it was cool, but yet very unlikely.<br><br>Okay, after all that ranting.  I think my advice is: if you are considering a career, be practical. definitely go for something you will like, but sometimes your passion may not be the best career move for you. if you really want to pursue it as a career, make sure you consider all the other things you are willing to give up for it. As always, passion clouds our judgement, so whatever you want, make sure you are not ignoring other options.<br><br></div>
