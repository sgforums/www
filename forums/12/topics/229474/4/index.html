            <div class='col-md body'>hey. let me tell you something. I'm j2 in a jc this year also. I, like you, really like music and i'm really into music. I have a lot of friends in NAFA too and in fact my very close friends(my orchestra clique) whom i knew since sec sch days are all in there. So often i wonder why must I follow my sec sch teacher's and my parent's advice. And like you i really hope that i can really do well in the classical scene in singapore.<br><br>However, on second thoughts, I always remind myself how small the classical music circle(professional performers, not just music teachers) in singapore is and how easy it is for me and my friends to become enemies in the future if we have to fight for survival in this pathetically small country(sad to say).<br><br>But of course i still keep in touch with my friends in NAFA always and sometimes i even sneak into NAFA to practice with them and attend their weekly commuter concerts. And now, I've decided that since i dun have financial and parental support, I shall go to Uni first and at the same time maybe take up some part time diploma in music. My frens who are doing dip in music says that its really not easy especially subjects like music history, sight singing and many more academic subjects like music analysis, etc.<br><br>But i always tell myself that even though i cant be a full time professional player, i can always be a part time music teacher, composer, author or maybe even open my own music sch when i saved up enough money.<br><br>So let's be optimistic and finish up our A levels this coming year! Also, I believe the music education that we received will help us to see things differently in our life, especially in terms of aesthetics.<br><br>so cheers!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mahawarrior:</div><div class="quote_body">Is it wrong of me to insist on doing what I want to do?<br><br>Is it wrong of me to insist on doing what I believe in?<br><br>Is it wrong of me to insist on pursuing what I want?<br><br>Should I give up and take up the easier path?<br><br>Should I give up my dreams for the sake of a better future?<br><br>Should I stop my insistence?</div></blockquote>Hi Mahawarrior, you should take the hard path. Which is your life's challenge. To overcome your financial circumstances to express the music that is within you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>The sad case is that many <strong>people spend much of their lives doing what they don't like, so they can finally earn enough to start doing what they do like</strong>. I say, that's a great way to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">bury your happiness</span> and turn into an <strong>economic slave</strong>.<br><br>Doing what you dislike, day after day, will numb the sense of joy within you. Soon you will feel that your life has <strong>no greater purpose</strong>, and there is <strong>nothing to look forward to</strong> but work, work, work.... You will have forgotten how much fun it is to spend your time doing the things you like to do.<br><br>The formal education system is a linear path to create knowledge workers for society. If that is not your goal, then you should not take this route.<br><br>I know that probably your parents and relatives insist that you finish school and get a basic degree. This is the <strong>security mindset</strong> that most people born in the 50's-70's have... a time when having a degree was a great achievement. Nowadays... everyone has one. Even Masters students are common.<br><br>It's good of you to insist. And keep on persisting in the direction of your dreams.<br><br>The chinese saying goes, <strong>"If you can't take the straight route, take the winding path." </strong><br><br>Many roads can lead you to becoming a professional pianist. At the moment you only see one option... and when that road is blocked, you feel like hope has been cut off...<br><br>Many people get greatly disappointed at this moment, thinking they may never achieve what they want... But let me tell you this.... <strong>The moment you let go of the Hope, is the moment the dream dies.</strong><br><br>So hold on to it with all your might because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">THIS is your soul's calling</span>. The urge to express the music within you.<br><br>Think of ways you can get closer to your goal of being a professional pianist. It might not happen overnight, it might even take several years.... but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">great things take time</span>. <strong>Develop patient persistence</strong> in chasing what you want.<br><br><strong>NOW step back and take a look at your life for a moment... </strong><br><br>Take a BIRD'S EYE VIEW, seeing your whole life in one stretch from birth to death.<br><br>It's actually a long road to walk. Right now you're probably only 20% of the way through... the other 80% still awaits you.<br><br>And within this 80% of time, there are other roads which will take you to your destination. You only need to open your mind to see more options. And when you see an opportunity, grab it and go for it.<br><br>And finally, regarding what you said here:<br><strong>"Should I give up my dreams for the sake of a better future?"  </strong><br><br>You can make money doing anything you want, as long as you are good enough at it. If you seriously want to turn professional, then you've got to be among the best.<br><br>A special suggestion for you is instead of trying to get into a music school, look for a mentor or teacher who sees potential in you, someone who might sponsor or personally groom you.<br><br>Network around, offer to play at different events for free or minimal fee. Create a namecard for yourself... this is how all GREAT DREAMS get started.<br><br>Instead of thinking, "Oh, I need such and such qualification before I can turn professional..." <strong>just START</strong>.  Start playing for people -- public or private functions. <strong>PROFESSIONAL means you get paid for what you DO.</strong><br><br>And this way, not only will you get the joy of playing professionally, you'll probably earn a good side income as well, which you can use to further your music studies.<br><br><strong>PUT YOUR TALENT TO USE --&gt; IT HAS MARKET VALUE.</strong><br><br><strong>BOTTOM LINE:</strong> I think you should not wait to pursue your dreams... at the same time, a basic degree is good security in case you have difficulty finding work as a pianist. Play your cards right and aim to get the best of both worlds.<br><br>Good luck for your future.</div>
