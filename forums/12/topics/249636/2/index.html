You could say they are cousins.<br><br>If you ask me what subjects helps in Psyc, well you will need to take bio psyc. Thus, biology would be a slight plus, but not a lot. A good command of English coupled with good writing skills would be helpful as there are a lot of written assignments. And lastly, Math. Beyond that, work hard and get a good honours because u need that to be a certified psychologist. A degree is not enough.</div></blockquote>Agreed to all of the above.  I went into organisational psych when all of my classmates were going for clinical and counselling - never regretted it for a minute.<br><br>Stats is more than just churning out the numbers.  When I was tutoring Honours students, the first thing I would tell them that what analyses they chose not to do was at least as important as the ones they chose to do - you need to use your judgement to assess the most appropriate approach to what you're studying.  Also, you've got the computer to do the dog's-body work for you.  While you need to understand how you arrived at the figures and how sound your results are, it's useless if you can't work out what the numbers are telling you in terms of the topic you're discussing.<br><br>Biology's a plus if you're going to go into neuropsychology, but it's of limited use elsewhere.  I came from a computer science background and personally I found that knowing computing findamentals made it really easy for me to understand cognition.<br><br>Round my neck of the woods, you can't legally call yourself a psychologist unless you've completed a Master's at least and had 120 days of supervised practice to go along with that.</div>

But to be a full fledged psychologist, you will need a Masters/ post grad minimum. So maybe they are probationary then</div>
