              ok the thing is that i was born from malaysia and came to the u.s when i was 8 and now im 18 and finished high school here.........now im currently living outside in the u.s without a family member here to support me.The place im living in is my FRIEND's Father's house which they rent me 200 bucks a month.Im really close with this friend and knew him for like 8 years and his family was nice to me and all.But recently after i graduated high school ive been looking for a job to support my own life here but the economy is bad so there arent much jobs here.My mom kept telling me to go back to live with them but i kept resisting and couldnt accept the fact that i have to go back to my home country which i need to start a new life.While ive been looking for jobs my friends father kept coming to knock on my doors and telling me to go back to live with my family,i could see in his face that he is kicking me out.He came into my room today and asked me if i bought my plane ticket yet and i lied saying yes and then he said he wants to see it but i said no i dont have it.Then he said he knows i dont want to go back and that im lying about buying the tickets so he told me he wants to see the plane tickets tomorrow.today was like the fifth time he kept asking me to move out,he wants me out so badly.The thing is that after he woke me up by knocking on my door and pissing me off.....ive though about it....Im really not in the mood for someone to bother me and piss me off and now i have this anger in me(REALLY MAD) and ill be waiting for him to come tomorrow cause i am thinking of beating the hell out of this old man.Im actually looking forward to tomorrow.........ive always talked gentlly and nicely to my friends family but its about to change......i might lose this 8 years of friendship with my friend soon.But this is not the point........the thing im confused about is whether i should move back or not(i dont have a much of a choice)............im thinking if i move back to malaysia and celebrate cny and after that i might go to sg to work or study if i can.
              The decision on my mind is whether i should beat the shit out of the old man or not and how my life will change after i move back.Im hoping someone could give a a right answer to my problems.....it would really help

              <p>how long have you stayed there? why does he want you out now?  if his family was nice to you why the change now? if you already knew he wanted you out then why let him ask so many times?(5 times?)</p>
              <p>you're 18, if he wants you out and you want to stay on in the states you can always stay elsewhere. why the anger?  if you feel its hard to find another place then i believe you're not ready to stay there on your own.</p>
              <p>if i haven't read this wrongly you're going to throw away 8 years of friendship by punching your friend's father because you've overstayed your welcome in someone else's house? if you don't want him to bother you then don't stay in his house.</p>

              <p>Ed,</p>
              <p>200 a month for a room is so damn cheap.You should be thankful your friend's father lets you have the room for so many years. The only reason why he lets you have it instead of renting it out to someone else for a higher rentals, is solely because you are his son's friend. I don't see that he is obligated in any way to continue accepting your 200 bucks. </p>
              <p>Either you offer to pay a reasonable market rental or move out. Your friend's father is not a charity.</p>
              <p>Instead of lying to his father.. you could have honestly tell him you are not prepared to move back as you have lived so many years in the USA.</p>
              <p>And since you have graduated, it is time you move out and find your own lodgings elsewhere.</p>
              <p>You don't have to sacrifice a friendship just because you are too cheapskate.</p>
              <p>Even if you want to argue that you are not financially able to move out on your own.. then either you go back to live with your family or you prolly find a job even if you have to clean the toilets.</p>
              <p>Don't try to live like a prince when you are just another pauper like many of us.</p>
              <p>Sure you are thinking punching that old man is justified.. let me remind you that if he had wanted to.. he could have just pack all your belongings and dump it outside his home. That way he wouldn't need to come knocking at your door 5 times.</p>
              <p>A landlord only needs to give his tenants 3 days notice for eviction.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Since you have already decided to leave, just tolerate your friend's dad for a little bit longer.  After all he's doing you a favour of renting you the place for only $200.  Also if you really care about your friendship with your friend, don't make it hard for your friend to play the middle man between dad and you.  Leave the place in good term despite the circumstances. Never burn your bridges!</p></div>

              <p><br>Why don't you buy your own place to live instead?</p>
              <p>People are not reliable in the past and are definitely not bred to be reliable in the present.</p>
              <p>Dependent on others is definitely not a pleasant trip to begin with and if I were you, I would rather be a whore and support myself till I die than to be dependent on people who are not part of my direct family.</p>
              <p>However, the sad part is.....I don't mind if people are dependent on me, cos I don't have the heart to say no and ask them to go and die....with strong exceptions to the retarded trolls and clones in here of course. I will ask them to go and die and they can go and die.</p>
              <p>About beating up the person who have sheltered you for over 10 years on $200/month, can you go and die please?</p>

              thanks for the opinions.....some of ur comments actually made me felt that i was wrong to think like this but still there are some things not explained yet.I've only been living in my friend's fathers house for almost a year and it started last month when my mom stopped sending me money and telling me to move back with them and i told her i needed more time cause i though i had a chance of finding a job here.So i told my friend to go home and tell his dad that i might have to give his dad the rent  a bit later,and this is where it starts.Til now its been 2 months of rent i havent paid and that is pretty much the reason his dad wants me out.........he probably think im one of those people who wont pay back money so he started pretending to ask me to move back when reallys means telling me to get the hell out of here.
              It was this problem which really made me learn about a truth in this world.It me understand how money changes people and how greedy humans and this world is.I've talked to my mom after todays anger on the phone and my mom told me some things i actually believed her cause i never listened to her in the past.This is what my mom told me..........."you are not the landlords son,he has no reason to shelter you or help u with ur problems,there are no such thing as free food or anything free in this world,it wasnt his fault for trying to kick u out because u are in his way of making money for his life and all humans are like that"
              
              It actually made me feel that all humans are greedy and only helps themselves and their family................but it is not wrong and its not their fault,they just want their own life better for their family and themselve.........but also they wont care for anyone else outside their family which is not of any concern to them.
              
              Right now i've decided to not get violent but when he comes knocking on my door today and asking to see my airplane ticket,im gonna say some stuffs that might piss him off and if he talks back then i will not be so polite but to start talking back to him.Im just gonna be standing up for myself and not get bullied by an outsider

              <p>Ed,</p>
              <p>It is not because humans are greedy.. rather.. you have proven to be a very untrustworthy person.</p>
              <p>Do you know what is the meaning of an "AGREEMENT" ?</p>
              <p>His dad agreed to 200 per month of your rental. You didn't pay. What's worst is that ... instead of you going to tell him personally that you in dire financial situation.. you made HIS son be the messenger.</p>
              <p>If I'm your friend's dad.. I will look at you and say " This chap is taking advantage of my family".</p>
              <p>To be honest.. 200 bucks is probably nothing to his dad( what his dad work as ?)  But you have not kept to your end of the deal. Now tell me.. why should his dad even TRUST you ? Just because you were nice to them ? Dude.. being nice is what you SHOULD be doing.. it's not credit worthy . Gettit ?</p>
              <p>You try pissing him off.. when push comes to shove.. his dad can simply call in the cops. Then you can say bye bye to USA maybe for the next 10 years . Don't forget you are not a US citizen , yes ?</p>
              <p>If his dad is really so greedy.. he coulda just say NO from the beginning.</p>
              <p>So dude.. stop taking other people's kindness for their weakness.</p>
              <p>Chill~</p>

              <p>Have some perspective la.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Coming back to your home country doesn't mean you got to stay here forever, you know.</p>
              <p>LOTS of Singaporeans and Malaysians find work overseas (US included!!) if they want to! Even those who haven't spent their childhood overseas!<br></p>
              <p>It's not the end of the road, unless you make it so.</p>
              <p>So instead of being a scared child who lashes out at everyone who's taking comfort blanket away from you, why not embrace the opportunity for a bit of adventure?</p>
