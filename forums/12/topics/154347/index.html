Heard alot of cases about not getting along well with mother in law.<br><br>you only can ren, cause she is still the senior. its best not to live together with a mother in law, it extremely possible to have quarel, hard to live under a roof. she may be jealous that her son giving you more attention all that ah, maybe she wants the best for her son so thats why picking out all the bad points about you and wanting you to change to suit her. Forever hard to please a mother in law.</div>
