I think you made the right decision for staying with your current employer.   Yes, the factory work may have a higher pay now (cos' with OT and shift works) but it doesn't give you any career advancement and it gives little pay increment with the requirement for you to work OT and shift works.<br><br>Staying with your current employer where you are now, on the other hand, gives you an opportunity to advance your career.  Though the pay is low now, one day you can easily earn more than the amount you can earn in the factory without having to work OT and shift works.<br><br>Perhaps, you need to talk to your parents about it and help them to see the long term rather than just the short term.<br><br>Good luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

So if I was to take up a part time degree in say, this November and I quit my current job and join the shift work job, I can only work at most 10 months and I don't think 10 months is enough to gain enough working experience. If I stick with my current job or go into another 8-6 job, it shall have no problems for me furthering my studies in part time basis and earning working experiences.</div>
