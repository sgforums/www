Drives a BMW.<br>Because of that he gets every bunch of new guys to join easily.  Thus enabling him to purchase bigger cars.<br><br>What hurts is me seeing some of my colleagues getting brainwashed and adding to his car payment.<br><br>Today he even suan the guys for waiting for the year end bonus every time.  That hit pretty deep for the rest of the guys. He was sking them to join him and they will get a car in a years' time.  He even commented "how many cars must i change before you guys join me?"<br><br>I have nothing against MLM, in fact i personally think that the system is good but ruined by singaporeans.  I've seen some of my colleagues follow blindly and try to convince ME that the product is good.<br><br>Those around me who used to follow him have been pretty much pulled away by me.  Today I had no answer for that bonus comment, because the rest of the guys ARE waiting for the year end bonus.<br><br>For those who are wondering, I'm not affected by his comments because like him, I do have something outside on my own.  Just that MLM has become such a con job now, i don't like the fact that the rest who join are helping him more than themselves.</div></blockquote>some lessons in life can only be learnt the hard way .....<br><br>I personally knew of chaps in the navy who signed on under the poly scheme and got sucked in by one of the pioneers in this scam, NOP ... they'll keng and twang etc to get as many nights off and days off as they can so they can dress up in a tie and go around calling on friends to join them ... people like the idea of swaggering around in shirt and tie and being (or at least pretending to be) successful ...<br><br>after that scam went bust they meekly got back to normal navy life anyways ... but not before loosing a ton of money from their own pockets and friends who won't even pick up the phones when they call (a'right, I'm one of those ex-friends, I can't help thinking that they're after something in my pocket when they call) ......<br><br>you'll just have to wait things out ... there are only so many suckers the scammers can con before they run out of suckers ...<br><br></div>

I met up a few times with him and realised that it was all the same old MLM crap. MLM only works if you are at the top of the chain. If not, you will probably spend 10years of your life to find 10 people to be 'under' you. After i rejected him and told him that his Amway and MLM thingy doesnt excite me at all, he transformed into a smooth-talking guy into a pathetic salesman asking me to buy all kinds of Amway products like vitamins, shampoos, etc...<br><br>This shows the they are just trying to paint you a nice picture, it is definitely not that sweet. The same goes for the insurance and property industry. Sure you will see these associate managers and other high flyers that earn 20-30k a month. But for every success story, i gurantee at least 50 people had tried and failed.<br><br>If earning 5k is so simple, do you think there will be any needy people left in Singapore??</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's just a facade anyway. I've seen some army friends drive some nice sleek cars but I know they earn peanuts. If you earn 1k and put 1k a mth on your car... you can still have some sleek chio cars... but you might live to regret it. Let them do what they want with their money. Sometimes it is part of the job... you need to look sleek in MLM.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>nowadays, the mlm-ers don like to advertise their companies as mlm, rather they like to use words like "network marketing" or "direct selling" cos mlm has a negative connotation to it...but its juz trying to sound nicer to entice u to join...wat a load of crap...<br><br>juz curious,anyone heard of a company called LongFar Int'l? i hv frens who were in Coslab, then switched to LongFar. Really funny. Can jump frm one company to the nxt so easily. then when longfar is saturated, another company will pop up and they jump ship again...<br><br></div>
