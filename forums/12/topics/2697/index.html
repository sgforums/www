She's not worth the trouble at all but if you've to go through it don't waste as much time as i did.  i think about 3 years... can you imagine what i could've done in 3 years?!?<br><br>just leave her to her own devices, you don't have to warn any of your friends.  they will find out for themselves.  they might even say you're sour grapes for spreading such "rumours".  it's an unfair world. tread carefully.<br><br>also pretend that you've never ever known someone like her.  but admit to yourself that you've made a big emotional mistake, accept the fact, otherwise they'll be back to haunt you.  ;o)  take care.</div>
