But, Depressed...*sigh*, I also realise that you may feel it is difficult to "think positively" because of past hurts. I think it's perfectly within reason for you to feel this way, although it isn't good for yourself in the long run.<br><br>You must constantly strive to think of ways to improve your life. Dragg mentioned not having expectations of people you meet, I think that is a good idea. Whether they like you or not when you meet them, should not matter to you right now. It will be hard to think this way at first, but keep repeating something like "it doesn't matter to me" and I hope in time you'll condition yourself to think this way. I hope it'll help you to relax in the presence of unfamiliar people. You must try to <strong>RELAX</strong>, because when you are tense and guarded, it is very obvious and people find it hard to react you like that. They are also thinking if it is because you don't like them! How to learn to be more natural? That can only come with more practice. A 'safe' environment to condition yourself could be with relatives, and friends.<br><br>One more thing, you say people think you are clumsy.. I'll bet it's because you are feeling stressed and so you tend to be unnatural in your actions. It's not because you are "stupid"..from the way to write, I think you are definitely not.<br><br>There will always be challenges in life. Don't care if some people have it easy, some people have it harder or wat. We just learn to take them one by one. One by one. By and by, we get better at it.<br><br>Just my small piece of advice, all this. See all above replies, got people helping you already. So all is not lost<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

Maybe they don't feel that you are pitiful, but you think they are thinking that way. As I have said, it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Don't be so self-conscious about your looks, as it is not everything. Learn to feel and appear confident.<br><br>You do not need to go for plastic surgery. Simply reconstructing your looks will not solve your confidence problem, which is what you are facing now. Don't need to waste money on plastic surggery or make-over session. Instead spend more time trying to accept and love yourself.<br><br>And don't think so much about what others think about you. Who knows you better than yourself? if you can form a good opinion about yourself, if you can find peace in your heart about your personalities, then you will able to feel happier and get yourself out of this depression.</div>

Get to know them and u will even forget about these thoughts u are having. Part of the problem is that these thoughts in you give u yourself that u are the only one , unique and makes u lonely. If u know another person who has the same problem, the thinking somewhat changes.</div>
