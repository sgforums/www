            <div class='col-md body'>I agree with Yunhaier .<br><br><blockquote><strong>"In real love you want the other person's good,<br>In romantic love you want the other person "</strong></blockquote>Loving someone is to support her unconditionally.<br>Love her without thinking of anything in your mind.<br>And definitely not trying to impress her with the things you do.<br><br>Very often, we always think that what we do is a token of love<br>but is it what the other party is feeling? Probably not.<br>If the other party doesn't feel the love, it is not considered love.<br><br>Love doesn't mean that you can do anything for her and think that she will be happy.<br>It is only in the mind of the giver and not the receiver.<br>Love is doing something that she can feel it in comfort and not pressure.<br><br><strong>A good relationship makes us feel energized.<br>And a bad one make us feel stress out and tired.</strong></div>
