            <div class='col-md body'>Hi. I am asking behalf of my friend who recently has friendship problem with her close friend. Let just name my friend  A and her close friend B. They have been close friends for 1 and a half years, ppl around them, including me, always assume they r very close buddies, those u can confide to.  Once i was helping A with her blog template and settings and so i came across her blog. She told me the address btw so i am allowed to visit her blog. There is this post on friend B. And being amazed by what she meant that she hasn't got a true friend, i asked her for further details. Not so much of a  busybody, but just a concern.<br><br>Anyway here comes the part that she told me this friend, B, aint very true to her and she doubt that she is the true friend she picture B to be. I was very surprised cuz B, who is also a friend of mine, is a very kind, caring, friendly and thoughtful person. She dun harbor bad intentions on anyone and is everyone's favourite person to get along with. So i disagree with A and further explain to her that it may be a misunderstanding. I certainly know its her choice and no one shall force or make decision for her.<br><br>But seriously, B has not done anything wrong and has always given us a positive image. She is the best friend anyone will wanna noe. To add on with, A and B 's friendship has been very very close all the while. B always help A out whenever she is in need and always stand by her, to me at least.  But now, on the surface they seem real close but deep in A's heart, she dont feel the same. And i hope B dun feel the same either. I seriously wish to help them... although its not right for me to interfere. Afterall its their problem. But as a friend, I dun wish to see their friendship end just like dat. I dun want them to end up like me. Any suggestions to help out?

So finding a close friend means alot to her...So definitely B is very impt to her in the first place. I think its not more of jealousy but its more of assurance... she is insecure i suppose since she told me B dont care for her and often left her alone and went off with other friends which i dun see B doing so though</div>
