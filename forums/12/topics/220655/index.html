            <div class='col-md body'>Of course we had attraction for each other... even though it is just a short one mth. We always talk about how come we nv end up together after so long. How to be sure of any r/s unless we hang out together? How to hang out together unless I get her here? Or is it just because air-ticket too expensive I have to give her up even though I like her... that's materialistic. I don't want to hate myself in future that I miss out someone I like just because I don't want to part with my money.</div>
