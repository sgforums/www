How about just invite her to come to visit you without offering to pay for the airfare first?  If she's really serious in the relationship, I am sure she will be willing to spend the money (provided she can afford it of course).   Worse comes to the worst, you can always offer to pay part of the airfare if not all.  This is just a thought anyway.<br><br>Bear in mind that the airfare is not the most expensive part but the living expenses.... I believe she'll be staying at your place so you have already, in a way, paid for her accommodation and when you take her out you may be expected to pay for the stuffs (shopping, dinner, entrance tickets etc) you guys are going to do.  Of course all these depend on whether she has the mentality of most girls - "Guys should pay for everything" or not.<br><br>Good luck!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>

She is not even your girlfriend. Play it cool dude. How can you be sure she really likes you? Take it slow. If you do not, you are making one damn huge mistake trying to suck up to her. If you do, she is going to take advantage of you in the future. Observe her first. Then commit. Date other girls also. Unless you believe in there is only ONE for you, which is a case of being naive on your part.<br><br>doko</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>mid of next year is only a couple more months away.<br>If you guys cannot hold out till then..  what's the point of pushing it now.<br>Sides, as you calculated. you are putting in alot of investment. How about her? Is she expecting you to pay for everything? If that's the case, I would be darn sweet to you over the net too..  Now, put it this way, some of the forum members had also highlighted, that once you start paying out your nose for this trip and if the relationship turn serious. This would set the precedent and standard for all other interactions. ie It might become expected that you are the one who will have to put in the effort and money to make this girl happy of she is gonna mention that you shipped her half way across the globe on your student allowance just to be with her and how romantic if you were to continue this.<br>Take it as a test to see what she really like since you are so serious bout a girl you only met for a month and the rest of the time is online.<br><br>Anyways, you must have a hugh allowance to even think of paying for someone's  vacation. On the flip side, if I am the girl, unless the guy is my bf, I would not take up the paid trip. If I were to go, it would be on my expense. But it depends on the circumstance and the girl. Seriously, we do not know the exact details. So these are just general comments. As another forum member said, its your money. You spend it as you see fit. We can't tell you or guarantee whatever the outcome. But we wish you good luck.</div>
