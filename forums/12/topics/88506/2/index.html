Deep down in your heart, you have already chosen one - that's to leave him. But knowing the shear pain you be going through and the path ahead without him, leaves hesitation and helpless feeling. These alone, coupled with the fact of him cheating on you, have already made you suffer terribly and lose your emotion balance, eventually leading to depression now. You have to know that he is not going to give you any happiness. Even if you want to go back to him, you will be going through a lot more even longer. Just to let you know. Can you take it?<br><br>With all these troubles, the most important thing now is not to make any decision yet. Take a break first. Tell him face-to-face about you wanting to cool-off.....Be FIRM about it.<br><br>That is to give yourself time to control and settle down your emotions first. Confide your feelings in someone, preferrably very close to you. Face-to-face confinement is better than through email or on forum. Go for a nice holiday trip or join some activities to prevent youself from depressing further or thinking too much.<br><br>Take your time to cool down, I guess by the time your emotions more or less settle down, you will be able to make your decision(whether to continue or to break) more firmly than now and with no REGRETS.<br><br>Take good care. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div></blockquote>This is a very good advice.. a clear-minded way of soving the prob..</div>

I used to wanting so much to marry him, be his good wife, take care of him, really to have a family with him. But now I can't see myself there anymore.

(This happened to my friend). He said we can apply for a flat two years later... I don't know why...I don't feel happy at all or excited about it. If he has said this to me before the affair, I tell you, I will surely have felt to be one of the most happiest woman alive. wahahhaahahah.

Let him know your troubles, doubts and confusion right now and y u are firm about cooling off first. If he forces you to make the decision now, well it seems quite obvious that he doesn't care about how you feel.<br><br>Look it this way, cooling off doesn't mean not giving him an answer at all, but it's actually a time not only to give urself a well-deserved break, recover and think carefully, also his chance to prove himself otherwise.<br><br>Real love reveals through test of time.</div>
