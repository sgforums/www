Calling or meeting up with him would not be a recommended idea.. As both of you may end up quarreling or speechless..<br><br>We dunno how long the relationship with you and him are.. But yes, although he has short term goals and had another girl beside him before, think you should think carefully before making this decision..<br><br>But whatever it is, all the best. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Its somehow base on morality and how each of us goes thru which determines the way we behave.<br><br>I personally do come across friends who 2-time 2 gals and got his retribution of getting terrible breakups and endless failed test.. which i was like.. "YeaaaHH~~"<br><br>Secondly, its mentally and morally <strong>WRONG</strong> to two times.

            <div class='col-md body'>It's not that you don't know the right choice. Deep down in your heart, you have already chosen one - that's to leave him. But knowing the shear pain you be going through and the path ahead without him, leaves hesitation and helpless feeling. These alone, coupled with the fact of him cheating on you, have already made you suffer terribly and lose your emotion balance, eventually leading to depression now. You have to know that he is not going to give you any happiness. Even if you want to go back to him, you will be going through a lot more even longer. Just to let you know. Can you take it?<br><br>With all these troubles, the most important thing now is not to make any decision yet. Take a break first. Tell him face-to-face about you wanting to cool-off.....Be FIRM about it.<br><br>That is to give yourself time to control and settle down your emotions first. Confide your feelings in someone, preferrably very close to you. Face-to-face confinement is better than through email or on forum. Go for a nice holiday trip or join some activities to prevent youself from depressing further or thinking too much.<br><br>Take your time to cool down, I guess by the time your emotions more or less settle down, you will be able to make your decision(whether to continue or to break) more firmly than now and with no REGRETS.<br><br>Take good care. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>
