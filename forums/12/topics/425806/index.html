              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">hello everyone,</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">just something i would like you to give your opinion/advice about, because it has been going on for quite some time now, and i believe it is time to address this problem.</span></p>
              <p>for the <strong>past 5 months </strong>or so, my elder brother has been coming into my room, searching for my wallet <span style="color: #ff0000;">(i know this cus he usually walks into my room when im using the computer, starts some random conversation as he walks around my room and checking out what was on my table/opening my school bag)</span>, when he does eventually find it, <strong>he would take some money out of my wallet</strong> <strong>without my permission</strong>. the approx. amount which i think he had taken from me is about <strong>$100</strong>, if not more.</p>
              <p><em>and to dismiss the possibility of my money (though technically its my parents' money) vanishing into thin air by itself, i have hidden my wallet in my room. during the time it was hidden to the time i took it out, the amount remained the same.duh.  -_-"</em></p>
              <p>to prove my other hypothesis, which was the possibility of my brother stealing from me. i had hidden the wallet under my school bag, and then deliberately shown him where the wallet was when he was in my room.</p>
              <p>just this morning, he sneaked into my room while i was asleep, but unforunately for him, the squeaky sound produced by the door as he entered woke me up. i kept my eyes shut, while occassionally opening them to see what he was doing. and <strong>what i saw with my own eyes was him taking money out of my wallet</strong>, then continue to putting the wallet back to where it was originally, and then sneaked out.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">okay, so you're on the same page already, what do you suggest i should do? or perhaps the reason he is doing it? i didn't want to catch him red handed is because i was afriad this would hurt our relationship, neither did i brought it up to him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">although my friends told me to talk to him, which im hoping to avoid, so that's why im seeking other alternatives.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Please help! :(</span></p>

              <p>Very strange.....</p>
              <p>This is unusual.......</p>
              <p>But from what 
              you are saying, I am having a hint that this is an issue about how 
              people perceive money........and how money is handled in the 
              family......</p>
              <p>For instance you said he helped you buy a laptop, but he earned $100 from that ?</p>
              <p>Although
               in different families there might be different values, I would feel 
              uncomfortable with that. In my family, nobody would be earning any money
               or any "commission" from such kinds of help. It is a taboo to earn 
              money from one family member to another.</p>
              <p>From what you have described, I believe this may be the root cause of the problem.</p>
              <p>Somehow your brother does not have the sharing spirit. Does not perceive or understand about family unit in relations to money.</p>
              <p>That is why he wanna earn $100 cut from the laptop deal, and also
               this may be the reason why he wanna steal money from you. Because he 
              sees and perceive things differently. He thinks you are a target and he 
              can take the money from you and then put it in his pocket. Actually it 
              is your parents money, which is his parents money, which is his family 
              money also indirectly.</p>
              <p>Another thing you mentioned is that he does not support anybody but himself.</p>
              <p>I
               do not know about this for sure, but if your parents is not very rich, 
              actually the working children should send some portion of the earned 
              money to the parents. This is happening in my family. It is a sign of 
              piety, as a symbolism, as well as for practical reasons.</p>
              <p>It is not
               good that your brother does not send any money to your parents, wants 
              to earn $100 cut from a laptop deal for himself, and sneaks in to take 
              money out of your wallet.</p>
              <p>It is not good in the sense that the way he perceive money or how to treat money within the family is too individualistic.</p>
              <p>If you are not able to fully digest what I am trying to say,</p>
              <p>Try to talk to your parents.</p>
              <p>This is not something you can talk to him or make him understand.</p>
              <p>Firstly, it is a fundamental issue. He needs someone who is older, wiser, and someone he will listen to. If you talk to him, 
              you wont be able to fully convey the concerns, because you yourself lack
               the maturity, and secondly, he himself will not fully understand or be 
              willing to accept or listen to you, especially since you are younger.</p>
              <p>But
               you need to be realistic also, because even if your parents step in and
               have a deep talk with him........this kind of issue is related to 
              someone's views and someone's inner character.....it is hard to 
              change.......so be prepared that he may not change much........maybe 
              just little bit only.......</p>
              <p>From your part and your family's part.....just try to encourage and display more sharing.......that may help a little bit also....</p>

              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">hello everyone,</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">just something i would like you to
              give your opinion/advice about, because it has been going on for
              quite some time now, and i believe it is time to address this
              problem.</span></p>
              <p>for the <strong>past 5 months</strong> or so, my elder brother
              has been coming into my room, searching for my wallet <span style="color: #ff0000;">(i know this cus he usually walks into my room
              when im using the computer, starts some random conversation as he
              walks around my room and checking out what was on my table/opening
              my school bag)</span>, when he does eventually find it, <strong>he
              would take some money out of my wallet</strong> <strong>without my
              permission</strong>. the approx. amount which i think he had taken
              from me is about <strong>$100</strong>, if not more.</p>
              <p><em>and to dismiss the possibility of my money (though
              technically its my parents' money) vanishing into thin air by
              itself, i have hidden my wallet in my room. during the time it was
              hidden to the time i took it out, the amount remained the
              same.duh.  -_-"</em></p>
              <p>to prove my other hypothesis, which was the possibility of my
              brother stealing from me. i had hidden the wallet under my school
              bag, and then deliberately shown him where the wallet was when he
              was in my room.</p>
              <p>just this morning, he sneaked into my room while i was asleep,
              but unforunately for him, the squeaky sound produced by the door as
              he entered woke me up. i kept my eyes shut, while occassionally
              opening them to see what he was doing. and <strong>what i saw with
              my own eyes was him taking money out of my wallet</strong>, then
              continue to putting the wallet back to where it was originally, and
              then sneaked out.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">okay, so you're on the same page
              already, what do you suggest i should do? or perhaps the reason he
              is doing it? i didn't want to catch him red handed is because i was
              afriad this would hurt our relationship, neither did i brought it
              up to him.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">although my friends told me to
              talk to him, which im hoping to avoid, so that's why im seeking
              other alternatives.</span></p>
              <p><span style="color: #3366ff;">Please help! :(</span></p>

              <p>Stop abating your brother's criminal act. Taking without asking for permission is STEALING.</p>
              <p>Your brother has skewed  sense of entitlement over your belongings. Why, does he feel that he deserve the money more than you ?</p>
              <p>And why you allow him to get away with it when you caught him red handed that day ? He is not respecting your boundaries. As long as he thinks he can get away with his act.. he will continue to steal from you.</p>
              <p>Today, it's $100, next time he will be stealing your girlfriend, your income, your home, even your inheritance. why ? Because he can.</p>
              <p>Family should never STEAL from another family member. But there are also family members who PREY on other weaker family members... this is the stark reality.</p>
              <p>You should talk to your parents about this. Stop enabling your brother's stealing act.</p>
              <p>He doesn't give a shit about you as a brother that's why he steals from you, why are you so desperate for his approval ?</p>
              <p>Learn to protect yourself.</p>
