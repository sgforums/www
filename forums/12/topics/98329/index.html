If sucidal thoughts appear, you are in very depressed mood. DO seek consultation. Doctors in clinics may be able to help. If you notice and worry that you might have such conditions, do go out and do exercises! It'll help boost your antioxidants and pump your adrenaline. Those will help your moods to go up. As mentioned, if still does not work after 2 weeks or symptoms continue to persist, get help. Helplines might be able to help too. Try to get someone who is a professional because a friend will have too much to feel about. Will most likely not be able to help by pushing the symptoms as mood swings and stuff.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Hope these information helps. I've been through it and going through a process of recovering. Seek help fast because depression is likely to attack you again if unresolved.</span></div>

It is abt the way you choose to think about things. Like me, You are obviously a person who is easily influenced by others and the environment. However, I am beginning to realise that people and environment changes consistently and you cannot be in control of it. Hence, everytime you get affected by it you may choose to move to another place and this process may go on and on. The pattern becomes obvious that unless you change yourself, you probably won't be happy. Some things in the environment will change if you choose to change your thinking.<br><br>Give you an example. I miss home alot and constantly tell the world that I don't like being in SYdney and yearns to go home. I tried to make myself feel better by moving from house to house. Yet after my sister and mother came to visit, I came to realise that it was not that bad after all. I missed home and because they came to stay with me for a week that it was them I missed not that this place sucks. It is still not as good as home and SIngapore but it was not that bad. By changing the thought, the days seemed easier to pass. More positive about staying here for the term though going home was still at the end of the agendas. hee.... Hope you see what i meant. </span></div>

How you think has a huge impact on how you feel!!!<br><br>Sounds like you are coping with the changes! take care and start to or if you have already started continue to surround yourself with friends etc.  We are social beings and we need to have people around us.<br></div>

I know how lousy it feels to be like that.  go talk to someone, someone qualified, please see your doctor, he/she can give you some simple medication to just help with your anxiety and help you relax.  Alot of people go through this once a while.<br><br>so take care and seek assistance soon.  find out about seeing a counsellor and the counsellor may refer you to a doctor who is familiar with what you are feeling now.   ya   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
