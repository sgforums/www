              <p><br>JonJon92,</p>
              <p>The answer is simple. Do you want to improve as a person or not? Then make the change now before it is too late, when you start working and bring all your habits into the working place. If you feel you got body odour problem, perhaps you have a weight issue. I knew a fellow classmate who had body odour problem because he is overweight. One way to solve your body odour problem is to exercise more often. Go for jogging, weight lifting and martial arts. Bath 2 times a day on average. Put on perfume or talcum powder to absorb your sweat.</p>
              <p>Got problem mixing? No problem. Get active in extra-curricular activities. Go to Buddhist society, church, youth church, scouts or whatever you can join. Make sure you still excel in your studies.</p>
              <p>I once knew a friend who had problem mixing with people in school but he had good grades in school. Today, he surpass all his classmates because thanks to his good grades he is working in a big company (with big position) and he have beautiful wife with kids.</p>

              <p>Hi jonjon,</p>
              <p>self-esteem is a mindset. And when it gets low, you will find all sort of excuses to keep it low... i.e. it is sort of like a vicious cycle...</p>
              <p>E.g. from you: Body odour. Do you seriously think it is because of your body odour? And anyway, you could get body spray from supermarkets to use to minimise the odour. There are so many ways to solve this problem</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Or if it is because of relationships with classmates, then just forget it! They are just a passing phase of your life, and it is only a short 4 years in secondary school. What matters is you yourself! <strong>Why let others control your emotions or your life?</strong> Take charge! Show them by grades, by fitness, by other things. Confidence comes with building upon strengths, or improving upon weaknesses, or even, exceling in an area you like.</p>
              <p>Looking back, secondary school is a time where many are immature, and usually like to find and target 1 'black sheep' in class for no specific reasons. But as time goes on, I realise that they start to accept the person gradually. The most important thing is you must have strength, you must have your own character, you must never give up. Don't ever follow the crowd just to be accepted. There's a reason for the 80-20 rule that so many talked about.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are still young, still in secondary school. Work hard and score well and make full use of <a class="forum" href="../../2297">Homework Forum</a>. That's your highest priority currently. There are so many other things to do in life than worry about the issues you face, much more than let it affect your self esteem</p>

              <p>Holy gosh ! What has this to do with sex and masturbation? And self esteem is not something you can't redeem back. What you think it is ? ICULS?</p>
              <p>Self esteem is what you think of yourself. People stay away from people with low self esteem. I really think that we need to give this kid some good advice - teach him that self esteem is something he can develop and appreciate himself better. Remember JonJon92, it is not a sin when people look down on you but it is a sin when you look down on yourself. Think big !</p>

              <p>Why sad?</p>
              <p>Let me share with you the inspiring story of a friend I met in NUS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He flunked his secondary school and went to Dover ITE. At Dover ITE, he told his frens there that he will one day be studying at the opposite school (NUS). At that time, everyone mocked at him, and told him that he was dreaming.</p>
              <p>But, he worked hard. After ITE, he went to poly, and excelled that. Eventually, he got accepted to NUS.</p>
              <p>And... he didn't just stop at there. During his NUS days, he part-timed as a property agent. And by his graduating year, he had made near to $100k from handling many property sales (in the 2007 property mania). He graduated with an engineering degree from NUS.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You could be like him too. The most important thing is never give up, even when circumstances might be against you. No use crying over split milk. What's past is past. Be mature, be confident, be motivated. You are you, you are unique. And if you don't help yourself, no one else will help you. Luck and success comes to those who try, who work hard, who believe in themselves and their ability to succeed.</p>

              <p>comeon.obviously im not asking him to talk to himself right?who would be dumb enough to do that?hahas, its just that he got to learn to interact well with his friends and stuff.NO point fading behind and not let them realise about you.Its like who knows they might not be his friend when he grow older?he got to learn how to be a man too lor.this plays a part in life.</p>
