              <p>I first came to know of pornography through the boys. It didn't come naturally to me actually, but it was through them that I came to like and appreciate even, pornography.</p>
              <p>Recently, I also understood the downfall of placing too much interest on pornography and sex through my readings. I deduce that girls who dig pornography are mostly being led by the notion that it is a healthy bodily interest when it's actually not. Girls are also eager to please the boys by taking on to understand boys' interest. Granted that everyone appreciates beauty, and a beautiful naked body with flawless skin makes either gender drools. However, excessive emphasis on merely pornography I've come to realize, does more harm than good. Too much emphasis on sex and pornography removes or rather, <strong>covers up the real need for communication</strong>, which in turn, turns out to be more detrimental than one would expect.</p>
              <p>For example, in a relationship, the true purpose is to understand one another's quirks, habits, likes and dislike, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>how to communicate and resolve conflicts</strong></span>.<strong> What makes many relationship fail is this:</strong> many people rush in headlog for that pleasurable physical intimacy, and spending every possible time to find out whether they are physically <em>"compatible"</em> or not. What many do not realize is that this <em>"compatibility"</em> is actually very <strong>misleading</strong>. How many relationships have you been in that you find you two are sexually <em>"compatible"</em> initially only to end in disappointment or how many sexually <em>"compatible"</em> couples married only to have their <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sex life spiral drastically down after that</span>?</p>

            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>Therefore, it makes no sense to find out whether your potential partner is sexually <em>"compatible"</em> or not because that is not even <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">the key</span></strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> to a fulfilling sex life</span> in a long-term relationship. The real key is to <strong>UNDERSTAND</strong> one another and to learn how to <strong>COMMUNICATE</strong> with your potential partner. And you can't do that when you are too busy "arhhh..." or "mmm..." in a heated state of physical passion.</p>
              <p>Therefore, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">slow down on the physical progression</span>, pull back if you must (make sure to bring up to your partner why, otherwise he/she might have the idea you are withdrawing to "punish" him/her) and <strong>focus more on</strong> the talking, doing things together and see if you like just merely being around with your prospective partner <strong>without</strong> the petting/sex/close bodily contact. See if you like the way your partner handles things and whether you can accept his/her ways.</p>
              <p>The common pitfall, for guys especially, is to treat a beautiful girl as if she's "the one" by plunging headlog into a physical relationship, only to emerge disillusioned when <span style="text-decoration: underline;">her personality doesn't match up to what you had expected (Your ideals of true love)</span>.</p>
              <p>The common pitfall, for girls especially, is to think that a guy is seriously interested in you, especially when he seems physically attracted to you. And then, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in a mistaken bid to <strong>hang on</strong> to his attraction</span>, a girl makes the mistake of being too sexually open to the guy, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in the notion that it will pay off in future</span>, thinking that "he's the one for me". Don't ever do that. If the guy cools off, let him be. If he's really into you, he will not expect more than what you are ready for. A lot of times, girls think that they are ready for a physically intimate relationship when <span style="text-decoration: underline;">in reality they are not</span>. Just think about it, why do you think you are ready? Is it because the guy promised that he will do whatever you need and be there for you always? Did he really say all that explicitly (tacky/vague assurance don't count)? More importantly, did he <strong>ALREADY</strong> demonstrate all these traits? If not, hold back and quit living in your imaginations and false confidence that "he's the one". You will prevent yourself from being hurt, affecting your next relationship with your<strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">"trust issues"</span></strong> and also, you'll be more able to enjoy yourself<strong> in the present</strong> with your partner instead of habouring the past or engaging in fantasies of the future which might never come true.</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>For guys, especially those who are obsessive over sex, <strong>quit treating sex as your <span style="color: #ff0000;">only</span> source of release and fulfillment</strong> (piak piak) and don't ever view a girl good for only that, because it is not true. Channel all that energy into something else such as sports, workout or a good cause. Sex, no doubt is a pleasurable activity, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">becomes senseless and pointless when overdone and without love</span>. Doesn't it feels empty at times? Associating a <strong>fantasy</strong> partner along with a dream body is only going to <strong>push you further away from your soul mate</strong> because you are not living in the moment to want to understand your prospective partner for who she is. Even a soul mate is not without flaws. A soul mate is someone most suitable for you. Like a good pair of scissors for example, it may be your most perfect tool for cutting, but if you do not learn how to use it, poking with the tip of the scissors blades is not going to help you cut anything. So instead of grumbling that it is not working in a relationship, learn what makes a girl happy and what makes her sad. If she is emotional the way she is, can you accept that it is part of her and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not let it get to you</span>? Instead of rushing to get to the physical aspect (which promises to be heaven <strong>initially</strong>... only to turn ugly at the end of a relationship), are you able to enjoy her presence by just merely being around with her? Is she <strong>SUITABLE</strong> for you? And if your girl tempts you to engage in sex before your relationship takes off, are you able to resist the temptation because you know that more are at stake? Are you able to explain to her why?</p>
              <p>Do you want a fulfilling relationship with a constant someone, instead of changing a different partner every night?</p>
