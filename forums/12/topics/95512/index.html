PLS make sure u're calm &amp; not freaking out first.. u need tonnes of reflection &amp; meditation before this option is chosen.. evaluate your inner emotional strength before u decide.. Make sure it's a nice place with romantic ambience as well.. steady ur heart too.<br><br>3. give her a taste of her own medicine.. which is quite child-like.. but fun nonetheless and depends on how old u two are.. &amp; how serious u two r..<br><br>4. let her go.. forget abt it.. liFe is still interesting without her though u may feel some side-effects like temporary heartaches..<br><br>Last but not least.. to commit means 'to bind or obligate, <span style="font-style: italic;">as by a pledge</span>: to compromise.. to give in trust; to put into charge or keeping..' according to my trusty dictionary..<br><br>hence u decide if she's capable of keeping your heart &amp; soul with you and it's impt if she has wholeheartedly pledged to do so.<br><br>best wishes hoh..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
