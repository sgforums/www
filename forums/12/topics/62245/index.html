            <div class='col-md body'>It has been a problem due to me and both my parents have diffrent sets of thinking and way of seeing things. Both my old folks believe that i should work more to acumilate more CPF since i am young, 2 days on my normal schools days and 6 or more days when i am having my holidays but my current rate sucks big time, only 4.50 per hour at a city area 7 eleven.  Its not that the entire family really depends on my income to sustain the house hold expenses but is that i feel that i should enjoy the 7 months of school life b4 the start of my NS b4 i were to start on my career after my NS either as a regular if i were to make the grade...The thing that  really make me laugh is that after i have work part time since i was 14 and i am now 19, my CPF is really peanuts in most ppl sense and i have to wait till 55 then i am able to take it out.
