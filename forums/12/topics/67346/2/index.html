            <div class='col-md body'>hmm... i think after reading all your replies, it does make me feel better. when I first posted here about 2 days back I was in a very low and confused period of my life.

I just felt that his feelings towards me are genuine. I asked myself, do i want to give this up because i cannot convice myself on the morality of it or do i wanna give it up only after i can give myself an answer why i should after trying. I choose the later ofcourse, because at the very least i know i've tried. I dun wanna end up thinking about the "what if" factor for giving up on this relationship now. At least I know that I won't regret for not trying. If things fail, i may end up paying a high price for it, physically, emotionally, time whatever. However I think at the very least it's a path which I've choosen and i only have myself to blame. I understand and know that there are many fishes in the ocean and giving up on this relationship doesn't mean the end. I guess all i can say in my lame defence is this one just feel so right. i not trying to brag here, but I've never been short of male suitors, but he is the only one that can make me wanna be with him. The only one can make me feel love and make me wanna get straight, no longer a les. Simply, he is just different from the rest.<br><br>I'm just glad that I am starting to find myself in this whole mess and I do begin to feel more in control of my life and relationship decisions. That i have credit to all your replies.<br><br>As for the issue of cohabitation, I have decided to stay by myself for now. Just felt it's too soon for me to make such a commitment. i know he isn't gonna be happy about it , but I need to convince him somehow and he just gotta accept it somehow.

I'm not sure that's a really wise course of action, but that's your choice to make. I just have to say though this is not the first "forbidden relationship" I have come across and the truth of the matter is, I have seen how they can crash and burn those involved really badly.<br><br>Personally, on the issue of feeling "right", I'm afriad we sometimes have to step back and look at the issue from a realistic point of view... there have been many times where I have seen this person and thought that this could be it, that it felt right, and started to come up with all sorts of ways in my mind that we could be together... but in the end, at the end of the day, after the smoke all settles, I realized how foolish I had been in entertaining these emotions over my understanding of right and wrong, for they cost me more then I ever envisioned... Before you jump into any conclusions, nothing zia lat happened, for my case, it's just that several of my friendships have been strained and my reputation soiled because of entertaining what felt "right" even when I knew it was ultimately wrong.<br><br>The whole irony was... I was never, and have never been in a relationship, I am still young. So why am I telling you all this?<br><br>Because I know that in whatever you do... when you start out on the wrong foot, you'll regret, and wish that you've never tried in the first place.<br><br>After all, there are rules in how we conduct our relationships, and these rules are there for a good reason, and that is to protect us. Given the history of this man, can you be sure that if you two get a fight one day he would not go out and find another lady? And tell her the same story that he's in an unhappy relationship?<br><br>Believe me, it might cost you a lot more then you are willing to pay...<br><br>Based on what you have told me, I can see little reason for you to carry on... don't worry about the "what ifs".<br><br>If you believe that love can overcome all, then how come love failed him and his wife? Will the same happen to you?<br><br>There's a story in the bible about two brothers, one of which sold out his birthright (inheritence) to his younger brother over a meal.<br><br>In the same way, I seriously advice you to consider your future, rather then selling it away for something such as this. Is it worth it? Or are you making your desision based on the immediate pleasures of feeling in chemical love to be offset by tons of suffering later.<br><br>I don't think you are getting the best for yourself, or for him. Actually, I don't think this relationship is fair for anyone involved in it at all.<br><br>That's why we should never, ever get involved with married people.</div>

Took loads of effort to get him to see things from my point of view. Clearly he was disappointed, but he told me that he will respect my decision because I'm not ready for that level of commitment yet sinced we are barely a month together. However, he wants me to give it some thought and let him know when I'm ready to shift in with him.... the other condition he had stated was he wants me to stay over every weekends, meaning Friday, Sat and Sundays. Both of which are conditions i'm agreeable to. Well... guess it wasn't that bad after all yeah ??

However considering all the factors involve, loveless and long distance marriage, I am still able to see abit of light in it, that's why I'm so strong about wanting to give it a try. He was required to go back and celebrate the CNY with his parents and wife, however he choose to stay here with me, stating that he had loads to do at work and couldn't leave.

Then what about now?<br><span style="color: blue;">&gt;&gt;&gt; yup that's the story, a somewhat arranged marriage. He did disapprove to the marriage, but his father gave him a either take the wife or leave the family option. Though ABC, his parents aren't and they were still a very traditional asian family living in america. They are a family of reputable background and leaving the family for your freedom to love wasn't that sensible a solution either. It wasn't a lose face issue for the parents but more like a I want to you marry a proper asian girl from the same hometown, thus a family friend's daughter. This story was initially an office gossip that became confirm when I asked him about it. I heard about it even before we started working together. I dun know if you understand how difficult is it to stand up for what you believe in (eg freedom to love) in a traditional asian family where the father is the respected and the head of the family... Yes you can always do it, but sometimes it takes more then just personal rights and believes to fight for what you want. More often is easier said then done. As for now, well the parents are not aware of this affair so there aren't any case here. As long as there are no spies checking on him over here, the story won't reach america isn't it? If there are, well, too bad then... it would probably be all over... I'm quite sure about it. Ask him that before and he couldn't answer, just told me he will always love me.... oh well... not really answer... </span><br><br>As many have mentioned not to move in with him now, please really seek this advise. Why is your man so anixously wanted you to moved in with him? Aren't you guys gonna meet each other everyday in office and maybe even weekends? What does he really seeks?<br><span style="color: blue;">&gt;&gt;&gt; I did not agree to move in full time with him. We will just stay together over the weekend be it my place or his. I'm fine with that idea seriously. As to why he wants us to stay together permanently, well he felt that it's kinda silly for us to each own a place individually. Sinced we are always at together, he thought it would be easier for us if we are just staying together. Frankly, if what he seeks is just physical pleasures, he dun need us to be staying together to get it. To me, physical intimacy and commitment are two different issues. I dun wanna stay together coz i dun wanna feel tied down so soon. Staying together is like my whole life is his, like a marriage without the title. I'm sure that's not what i want at the moment 'coz I still wanna have my own personal space and life.<br></span><br></div>

Ofcourse i know that this decision I had choosen is not a favourable one, nevertheless, just like I mentioned before I need to know for myself where will this head. I won't regret this decision because I know that I will regret without trying at all. Most of all, i'm also aware that the chances of a future with him is really slim, unless a divorce is in place, but I still choose to keep. Silly as it may sound, I guess it's the freedom to choose who I love? I will cherish myself and I will definately not be so blinded in love to allow myself to be abused in any manner. I still have in me that amount of pride, at the very least. I sincerely thank you for your concerne. At least i know that there will always be this outlet here for me to voice all my fastrations.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
