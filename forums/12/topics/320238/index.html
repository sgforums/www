            <div class='col-md body'>
              <p>I currently have a girlfriend who is older than I am. Being that as it may, I have no issues with our difference in age. However, she fails to trust me.</p>
              <p>I have a friend, a girl, A, from church. I grew up with her, and I admit in the past we used to like each other when we were young and adolescent. But not for very long. Now she has her own boyfriend, and I have my girlfriend. However, my girlfriend doesn't quite like A. Since I told her about A and I liking each other in the past, her mood changed drastically, and A has been an issue of unpleasant discussion over the past few months.</p>
              <p>My girlfriend observes A, and notices that she attempts to grab my attention. For example, when A talks, she glances at me quite frequently and today, for some reason, A entered the room where my girlfriend, I and another church member was seated. And she kept entering, re-entering, re-entering again and finally stayed put in the room. Each time she entered she made some sort of a din. According to my girlfriend. Although I failed to pay much attention.</p>
              <p>A has been the constant subject of annoyance and displeasure for my girlfriend, and to my girlfriend it seems like A is always trying to get my attention. Not helping is the fact that almost everyone seemed to think for a time that A and I were perfect for each other. I told my girlfriend that the more people tell me to do something, the more I won't do it, and hence she refused to believe that I'm with her because I sincerely love her, but only to prove a point to everyone else that I'm defying their laws.</p>
              <p>Recently, my girlfriend has made an effort to befriend A. In the past, when my girlfriend said hi, A would just ignore her and walk along, and my girlfriend attributed it to A perhaps not noticing her gesture.</p>
              <p>I have explained many times to my girlfriend that I do love her, but she still can't seem to trust me.</p>
              <p>She also mentioned to me a few times that I tend to look at other girls very frequently, sometimes to the extent of compromising my attention on her when she is in the midst of talking. She says my eyes would dart around, but I only look to observe, not to check out. But she doesn't quite take it that way. One occasion, she said that I stared at a girl to the point where I no longer hear what she's saying. I do enjoy observing people because I just have opinions to make, and I never meant to give her the wrong idea.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I am actually very exasperated and I made the mistake of telling her in the past, that if she couldn't accept A as a part of my life, I would find it hard to love her. It was a mistake and my girlfriend still hurts from it, and hence till today my girlfriend feels "disposable". I also admit, I told her that my ex girlfriend was my "bragging right". Because back then she was the hottest girl in school and I got to go out with her. My girlfriend gave me the option to speak freely so maybe she couldn't handle it.</p>
              <p>Just now, I talked to her. We had a long discussion, and I was upset about her still clinging on to the A issue. To my girlfriend, A was clearly out to get my attention, but frankly I really didn't notice. I asked her why does she think A is better than her, and she replied "personality, figure, looks". Then, my girlfriend said that she regretted placing me in a box all this while, and she realized the pressure she placed on me regarding A and my brother's girlfriend. She told me that I could have my old life back. Rekindle my friendship with A, because I stopped talking to A a while ago in order to please my girlfriend.My girlfriend is insecure,but have I contributed to make her feel that way?</p>
              <p>Also, my brother has a girlfriend who tried to flirt with me when we went on a family vacation. She kept looking at me, and it did make me feel akward. My girlfriend was quite upset and we did argue about this. From then, she failed to trust that girl, and whenever she came over, my girlfriend would be very uncomfortable. My brother's girlfriend is young, so perhaps we can attribute it to adolescence. She mentioned to my girlfriend that she wished my brother was as mature as I was. My girlfriend took that as some sort of signal that she was interested in me. I wonder how that works?</p>
              <p>Also, honestly, whenever we meet up, she is mostly the one who comes over, and after work, she would walk to my office because she knocks off earlier than I do and waits for me so we could go home together to my place. In fact, she does offer most of the time to meet and travel over, and she feels bad when I have to travel to meet her. She refuses to let me pay for anything too. I need to know what to do. My girlfriend doesn't feel special I think, but why?</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>What also didn't help regarding my brother's girlfriend, is that when my father was in hospital, my girlfriend didn't visit him much. Her own father had passed away when she was very young and since they were close, she told me she couldn't bear to see my father in hospital. But she did come to bring him a stuff toy and talk to him and play puzzles. One night, while my father was in hospital, I got a little drunk, and I told her that my brother's girlfriend was better than her because at least she made the effort to come and visit my father and she didn't even have a car, unlike my girlfriend, who could just simply drive over. My girlfriend was upset when I said that but she tried not to hold it against me and blame the alcohol instead. But she told me that there is always an element of truth in the things said in a drunken stupor, and I believe she still hurts quite badly. Where did I go wrong? Should I do something about it? What should I do to make the relationship good and my girlfriend trust me?</p></div>

              <p>Thanks =) I really appreciate your replies =) Sometimes I'm not sure if I'm doing enough for her. Maybe that's why she doesn't feel special. I can't change church because my family goes there and we're quite involved there.</p>
              <p>Well no actually I don't think I'm friendly with his girlfriend, I guess I just entertain her to give my brother some face. My girlfriend doesn't like her because my brother's girlfriend is the typical girls' school wannabe type of girl. The "OMG I am like SOOOOO hot" sort. Y'know. Those. But during the trip she really upset my girlfriend.</p>
              <p>Lol yea I know about the drunken stupor thing. That was sort of how we got together actually. But the relationship lasted longer than we both expected.</p>
              <p>I think my girlfriend does mind my past a little, but was how I put it to her harsh? Or is it something most girls can put up with? How do I reassure her to trust me?</p>

              <p>perhaps she feels jealous at times with regards to A and your brother's girlfriend.</p>
              <p>nothing wrong about that. i think there ought to be something wrong with the things you do to lead your gf to feel this way. this whole story is way too one-sided. why not leak out some of the discussion topics you had with her about A?</p>
              <p>your girlfriend treats you so well. she always think about you. she gets jealous for you. what more bro. you want her to bring the moon down for you too? you better cherish her before someone else takes her away.</p>
              <p>have a discussion for a solution. not a discussion and leave things hanging there.</p>
              <p>lastly, i feel pretty sad for your brother having a girlfriend who flirts with his brother <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>

              <p>different people have different kind of "socialising". It could mean that ur bro's gf is friendly while your gf thinks is flirting. and the fact dat your bro doesnt mind could mean that your bro noes his gf de style~ Whatever it is, just know your limits will do. For your gf, your gf must realise that everybody is different and she must accept other people's way, as much as people can accept her way of doing things.</p>
              <p>As for you, dun drink too much la, if you really love her and she really loves you, explain to her and apologize to her, since you are in the wrong~.</p>
              <p>As for A, i tink is a thorny issue, but you and your gf hav to sit down and seek a win win solution~=)</p>

            <div class='col-md body'>i thought you were supposed to be drunk in the holy spirit?....lol.....apparently your girl is not the socialising and the easy-going type...if you want to continue with her then you gotta put up with her insecurities....but i do think you'll be unhappy in the longer term, given your gregacious nature....perhaps you ought to reconsider searching for a like minded partner...not urging you to dump her but just consider your future interactions with all those around yu...</div>

              <p>Nought,</p>
              <p>May I ask... what is it you love about your girlfriend ?</p>
              <p>If you feel that she is not good enough for you, I suggest you find another girl.</p>
              <p>Let your girlfriend go , so she may find someone who knows how to cherish her and not make her feel like she is second class.</p>
              <p>I have many guy friends who are very handsome and rich and talented, but they never hurt their girlfriend like the way you hurt yours.</p>
              <p>If you think you are too good for any girl, then I suggest you remain single.</p>
