              <p>Yeah but at the moment, "A" is the trigger. <br>Maybe in another place there is another "A" character but because there is no existing "dislike" for the person. the GF might just ignore and move on with her life.  Women can be extremely petty and hard to let go of things. I know cause I am one of those.</p>

              <p>A's actions and whoever your girlfriend is afraid of, would be something she has seen happen before. Women, though seemingly paranoid and over sensitive, know their shit. So before you go barking up the wrong tree, treat your girlfriend better. Why should she get all the shit from you when its other people making her upset? I don't give  f*** I'll just tell them off. Friend or not. If they were your friends, they won't behave like this. Imagine in the future what they can do. Irregardless of whether they're pious church goers or nt. Who gives a flying rats arse anyway. They're still people. They err. If you're going to give your gf crap and let A get away with it, then you don't deserve her.</p>

YOU might suck at it worse than her. I know this because my wife is like this. She gives me the worst headaches, but at the end of the day, I find her the most comforting person to go home to. That's why I married her. Other females will listen to me, do all that BFF crap to me, but my wife always gets my priority. I don't care about what other females are willing to do for me, because I have my wife. So don't conveniently blame your gf. BLAME YOURSELF.</p>

We both were at fault, and things screwed up because we both had expectations of each other. She expected me to understand, and I expected her to trust me. I hope this isn't too late to change.</p></div>

              <p>hiya bro...welcome to the world of jealousy...</p>
              <p>We both have the same situation here...at least for me in the past. Have a girlfriend who is older than me...but age doesnt matter...no matter how i say and reassure, jealousy still steps in.</p>
              <p>for my case, B was my very good female friend since sec2. She was my ex-classmate for once...like you, I once liked her alot...but it was only one-sided...after we graduated from sec school, we went to the same ITE, same course, same class. So for the first year we stick quite close to each other because we were friends from before...blah blah blah...</p>
              <p>Then the girlfriend part was that she wanted all connections with her to be broken. Not exactly all lah...still can talk in class, do projects, help each other out, etc. No sms, no calls. Lucky for me was that her boyfriend wanted that as well. This is because she is scared that we will be back together again...</p>
              <p>After graduation we no longer contact each other anymore...occasionally a few smses like on her birthday...but didnt tell girlfriend that is...not even getting birthday present.</p>
              <p>I wouldnt say this is a bad thing. On the positive side, it shows that she really care alot about the guy. Maybe a clean break from ur A would be a last resort solution...where all verbal assurance is of no use, this is the last one.</p>
              <p>After that B is no longer the core problem for my relationship...not sure if i missed out on ur whole story...lazy to read all the posts...</p>

              <p>Wah, your skull very thick leh.</p>
              <p>So many forumers here already advise you what to do already, you still ask this question .</p>
              <p>I tell you what lah. Bring your gf to one of the forumers gathering. Introduce her to the guys here. I guaranteee you, there'll be lots of takers.</p>
              <p>Since you donno how to appreciate your gf, someone else will be more than willing to take over.</p>
              <p>Then after that, you can go and continue your fantasy with A.</p>
              <p>Let's face it lah, A also don want you if you offer yourself to her.</p>
              <p>If you are so good, A would have dumped her boyfriend so she can be with you long time ago.</p>

              <p>there's no need for a scenario, because right now, im practising it.. my life is about my family, my male friends and my girlfriend..</p>
              <p> im not telling u to cut off all contacts with all females, but u should be putting ur girlfriend in higher priority than them.. at all times..</p>
              <p>when it comes to emotions, u should be concerned with what ur girlfriend feels, and not what ur best friend feels.. after u have pacified ur girlfriend and stuff, THEN ur relations with ur best friends come in.. pls do not say that "like that my girlfriend will want more and more', or 'why cant she understand me?'</p>
              <p>this thing involves u AND her, and trust me, after u have pacified her, after u do ur part by being responsive to her feelings, and rightfully and dutifully earned her trust, the naked girls room thing will come in..</p>
