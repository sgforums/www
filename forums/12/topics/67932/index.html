            <div class='col-md body'>Well, ask your friends how NS life was, there's different options, like you can choose infantry(you like the jungle and walking?), armor(you like cleaning a tank?), engr (you like blowing stuff up or building a 100ton bridge?), commando(good at running?), SOF(like to be shot at?), navy(like the sea and can stand being out in the sea for months?), air force ( you like to fly?)..... So many options.<br><br>But let me tell you NS, there's fun times and there's shitty times... very politcal. And if you're not careful, you can be charged easily and go DB. So if you like fighting or destroying things? NS is not a good place for you, you will be sent to DB the first day of BMT.<br><br>Check the pay as well, it pays to have higher qualifications!

As long your studies are screwed up, it's pretty hard to find a job nowdays, given the high qualification levels. Experiment and explore, and you'll find something that interests you.<br><br>Never ever sign on for the money. From my experience, 9 out of 10 regular friends regretted signing on. One friend spent $15k breaking his bond because he couldn't stand the rigidity and inefficiency of the army's system. and many other screwed up things lah.. i can go on and on and on... but the main point is, live your dream and kill anybody that gets in your way.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>u better think carefully before putting ur signature down the contract coz once u become a regular and regret abt it...there is no way in hell they are gonna let you go....unless u are supported by strong reasons such as metal illness or permanent injuries....other then that...they dun give a dame of any of ur own personal reasons<br><br>It is juz like a marriage when u sign on, if u like wat u are doing then good for u...but if u realised that this career is not suitable for u...ur no better off in prison...u'll be simply cursing and swearing day in day out...but wats the point...there is no way out...u simply have to serve finish the 6 or 10 yrs of ur contract...and if u dun do ur job...u'll get charged and put into DB...it is a very controlled environment whereby u simply have to carry out what is being order and there are so many wayang B@#$%^# flexing their ranks ard...so think carefully and try to find out more from ur friends what is it like in the army b4 making that impt decision. Think carefully what u want for yourself..any other things besides the $$....u will onli know that it is not worth it once u start to regret it..Hope my advice comes in handy</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>being a regular no doubt give you a stable income and things like that but if your qualification is low the chance of your advancement in the service will be slim lor.

We regulars(most that i know of) dun wish to earn lotsa money in place of our happiness and freedom. imagine staying in the whole weekdays and doin duty on a weekend! definitely for the first 3-4 years of ur career, u will suffer without much freedom. i noticed this trend also, those lower ranked who earn lesser, work the most while those senior and hihg ranking specialists work very little(sleep most of the time) but earn extremely alot. anyway its ur choice and its just a piece of advise from me.</div>
