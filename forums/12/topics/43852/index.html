Its like when you are sick, you refuse to seek medical help. In the end, when things gets fatal and everyone regrets.<br><br>At least you boyfriends talks about this to you and seek for a mutual solution. Well, you don't see guys doing that generally do you? You wish to maintain this relation and let me tell you the only way to is effort and appreciation - both of them work hand in hand.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You know that you are taking him for granted - improve on this aspect. Don't request yourself to change, because changing habit, characteristic is a slow moving model that starts from improving one self. Don't take him for granted - show your appreciation. Start with small things like encouragement, write little cards, don't show negative words/statement every now and then, etc. When you show you appreciate his doings, or him basically - things will improve.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>When things happen, calm down and thinking rationally as soon as possible. Then take initiative to seek for solution and problem solve together. Problems, crisis, etc solved by the effort of two parties are legendary traits shared by all successful couples.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Watch your studies. You have studied 10 years for this O level and don't waste it because of relations.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>

How can he be a boyfriend if he is so weak-willed and expect you to do all the work???  What kind of substance is he made out of ??<br><br>I think to have a good relationship.  Both sides must be willing to put in an effort.  If he expects you to come up with a solution while he lies back and expect to be pampered then.... WHAT?<br><br>What to do?  Like YunHaier sais - CONCENTRATE on your school work for now.  Relationship should never affect your pursuit of a good education.  It should enhance but NOT drag you down.  Anyway, when you get to Junior College or Polytechnic - there will be more better guys around.  So don't think that this is the end.....<br><br>Above all.... Cheer up!! Put things in perspective.  Ask him to stand up for himself once in a while because you are not his  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> mummy....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br></div>
