I think this is exactly what I have been looking for so long and couldnt find, many of the things written there are so true and helpful.Thanks a million!<br><br>To anyone whos thinking about seeking psychiatric help: its not as good as it may seem. Besides the medication that they gave me to curb my addiction to the internet that works a little, I would say they have not been effective at all. I was hoping they would be telling me some of the things that are featured in the above website, but till now they are only offering me advices that do not tackle the roots of my problem at all. In fact they dont even question why im gay, assuming that I simply chose to be one. I was painfully disappointed to become doubtful of their capabilities then. Both also kept telling me that Singapore is becoming more tolerant of gays and there is nothing wrong in being gay - it may be true, but thats not going to help me is it. Im paying them now because I still want someone to confide in. Think I will show them the articles and hear what they have to say.<br><br></div>

But just as i was holding her in my arms and about to do it, she turned into a baby...God I had to let go of course. But the thing is<br>for the first time in my life, i was turned on so much by a female<br>image!<br><br>The thing is, I just lost my virginity to a man last afternoon. Im sorry, i still cannot believe i went to bed with him, things got out of hand at his house.<br><br></div>
