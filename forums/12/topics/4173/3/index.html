"<br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>Chipguy23, being a straight guy myself (assuming you are straight as well), I do not agree with your view that gays choose to be gay. I strongly believe they simply can't. I was homophobic myself until I found out my best friend is gay. I have accepted him since and been very tolerant about homosexuality after I have come to understand more about their lives and emotions. I would never forsake my best friend for being gay but I would if his character was screwed up which has nothing to do with being gay.<br><br>Nevertheless, even without my best friend's enlightenment of homosexuality, I have my own reasoning as to why I think (strongly) gays DO NOT choose to be gay in the first place. Why in the world would any man choose to be something that society from all over the world so despises? Tell me Chipguy23. Do you understand the trauma and emotional torments that a gay suffers for being gay? I do because my best friend has shared with me. Do you realise the predicament and disadvantages of being gay? Why would anyone choose to be someone with all the "sufferring baggage"? Why do you think gays are prone to suicide? I thank God I'm not gay because if I were I would have a freaking hard time dealing with it. I thank God because I've chosen not to be the homophobic guy that I was (by the way, being not homophobic is a choice, my friend).<br><br>The bottomline is, gays can't change their sexual orientation any more than we straights can change ours. There might be a temporary change due to circumstances, for example, straight prisoners engaging in homosexual activities, but when they are released they resume their straight lives. But that is rare. In most cases, gays are as pre-determined as left-handers are.<br><br>Although seeing 2 guys kissing will gross me out, I don't condemn gays. I accept the way they are. I live my own life they live theirs. I tell my gay best friend, by all means go have sex with men as long as you have safe sex and do not do it in front of me. LOL. Peace. Don't judge because every one of us is not perfect in one way or another.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I would say environment factor (personal experience) and the puberty development (hormones and etc.), both will interact with each other in a complex way, such that causing homosexual behavior.<br><br>By the way, I am one of the PLU, and I have suffered same as the others. Currently, I am still trying to change. Whether successful or not, it is still a big question mark (???).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  Some may claim that I am under this "self-denial" phase, condemning it hard (unable to accept self). But the truth is that the world for PLU is too cruel (random sex, Ons, fresh look, stagnant relationship, no long term relationship, unfaithful partner and etc.) Sometimes we don't have the first choice, but to pick the second choice, which is to change.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Another question that rise is what is motive of the change: Is it<br><br>1) To conform to the society's pressure<br><br>2) Really not happy with the current situation and fully determined to change<br><br>Can one really change to straight? Or change to Bisexual? Or is it just suppressing it?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> But I still don't quite agree that one is born that way, meaning that one's sexual orientation can be determined at the age of 1. If you are PLU, did u recall that you have an erection seeing a guy at the age of 12?<br><br>If you claim that one is born that way, what about those who are born blinded.
