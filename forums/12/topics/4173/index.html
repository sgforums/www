Believe me, I've tried some of the ways to become str8 before, but sadly it doesn't help. I find assf****** and certain gay acts repulsive too, but the thing is I haven't had the slightest sexual interest in females for a very very long time, they don't turn me on sexually like certain men do. I have had very little contact with girls throughtout my life after primary school... the girls in JC and U, or girls, just don't capture my attention. Only the bimbos in movies do (?!), girls like Reese Witherspoon, Romy and Michelle in the movie of similar name...but even then its not sexual.<br><br>Maybe I should really force myself to know more girls. Anyone can suggest any way? Im will be extremely busy once school starts, thats why I have not joined activities that will allow me to interact more. Right now, Im seeking professional help at BMC also, going for first appointment later, please...... let it be good.<br>I hope its not too late to change, and its not easy at all, really, its so difficult...extremely.... Its no wonder why some have given up and simply choose to remain gay.<br><br>Anyway, thanks. Wish you people luck too.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Homosexuality is partly genetic if you didnt realised that. So it wasnt your fault that u r gay or lesbian, its in your gene.<br>Studies shown that during the pregnancy period, sudden hormonal changes in the mother's body may produce homosexual children. BUT homosexual people will NOT produce homosexual child. SO DONT BE SO CONSERVATIVE PEOPLE!<br>Its not wrong being gay or lesbian, if being gay and lesbian is wrong, then there r alot of things that r wrong in this world. Like being left-handed is wrong, being a MAN or a WOMAN is also wrong since all of this is decided by genes.<br></div>
