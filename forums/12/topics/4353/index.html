            <div class='col-md body'>Dear ApPlE_PiE,<br>pls dun ever say tat u r not good enough for him, i'm sure u r a nice ger but relationships are hard to say. After reading ur post, i wanna share wif u my story.<br>I fell in love with my friend, he's those kind of guy whom everybody thinks that he's not worthy of me but actually i think i'm not worthy of him. Anyway, at first i juz treated him as an ordinary friend but actually he's interested in me. One day, he hold my hands, i was shocked but i didn't refused or whatsoever, in fact i felt warmth and comfort when he held my hands. It was as if sunshine was finally shining into my unhappy world(i'm having family and other problems). As days passed, we do things tat couples would do but he still haven't asked me to be his gf and i never mentioned anything abt it. Then one night, he told me tat he's a guy who cannot be serious in a relationship and he said that he'll get tired of it easily, my tears juz flowed down, it was till then tat i realized i love this guy, i can't pretend tat i don't care. We still meet up after tat, i act as if nothing happened, i was thinking if we can remain this way, i can still see him, i dun need to be his gf, i juz want to be by his side, see his smile... I dunno why, he's the one who couldn't take it, i hold him and he sang a Andy Lau's song (tai duo tai duo de bao qian), i cried coz i know from tat song tat my love was too much for him to bear and tat's his decision. I knew we couldn't be together anymore, he din't cheat me, i'm the one who's willing to give my everything to him. We didn't contact after tat, i was in depression (maybe becoz of some other problems), i was mad at everybody and myself, i pratically refused everybody's calls and did a lot of stupid things. Then my aunt passed away, i dunno how and why, i juz felt tat i muz be strong, i can't carry on like this. I spent the whole night thinking over it and listening to tat song and i finally thought it over.<br>In every relationship, you'll learn something good from it. I did, to love someone is to let him go and let him be happy. I was happy with him and now i don't hate him, i really hope we can still be friends although i know he don't want to. I learn to be strong and not run away from reality. Life is short, it may not be perfect but all you can do is to make it better for yourself. You don't have to forget abt ur ex, juz forget abt the nasty things tat he did to u and treasure all the sweet memories tat u both shared.<br>I believe everyone of us will find tat special someone one day, if u keep on brooding over the past, u might let ur true happiness pass u by. Like u, I still love tat guy very much but if i insist on keeping him with me, he will be unhappy and i will be miserable too.<br>Hope u can get over him  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br>~phoenix81~<br><br>------------------<br>Never say i love you if you really don't care<br>Never talk about feelings if they aren't really there<br>Never say forever cause forever makes me cry</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Apple,<br><br>Seeing your nice nick I can't help but post a reply. (hehehe!)<br><br>If one day your current bf find out about this, how do you think he will feel? Your "can't bear your ex" feeling will hurt him you know? If it doesn't matter, then why are you with him now?<br>Having a new bf is already your attempt to move on and not dwell in the past. If you still think of him you will not only hurt yourself but your current bf.<br>Do u think it is worth waiting for your ex? Are you sure you want someone who is always tempted by seductions? I know it is hard to give someone up especially if you still keep in contact, so maybe to forget him once and for all, shut out all contacts with him.<br>Remember, your ex might come patching up with you cause he don't have a gf then and treats you as a sparetyre. He is only making use of you.<br>Try to wake up from this. You are starting actually, or else you won't ask whether you are stupid.<br><br>------------------<br>**I want u to be with me.....<br>be with me in the morning...be with me in the nite...with me when its dark out...with me when its light...<br>I want u to be with me...no matter what we do...just keep this reminder...of how much I love u...**</div>

You can *arbish me all you like  :p<br><br>Apple Pie,<br><br>I want to say a lot of things but I think I tell a story better:<br><br>There was this man who was visiting a magnificent palace.  The decoration, the art pieces, the antiques, the architecture are all out of this world but before he entered the gate.  He was given a tablespoon full of oil and was told not to lose a single drop or his hands will be chopped off.  Poor guy goes around staring at his spoonful of oil but didn't enjoy his tour of the palace.  Sucks, eh?<br><br>Okie,<br>ex-bf = spoonful of oil<br>bf = magnificent palace<br>man = you<br><br>To end the story.  The man was told that its ok if he lose the oil.  It doesn't matter and his hands won't be chopped off.  Now, he's staring at the entire palace, eyes wide open, mouth gaping and thoroughly enjoying himself. The spoonful of oil?  Well, it was lost while the man was enjoying himself.  Geddit?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well it's not easy to forget but dun live in the pass, the memories will still remain and you might still cherish them. Let those just be memories.<br><br>To forget one is to like another.<br><br>Treasure your relation that you have now. Think about all those who are still single and lonely (at times). This will remind you of how lucky you are to have a bf by your side.<br><br>All the best in your life ahead.</div>
