            <div class='col-md body'>Sadly Heng, I agree with you too... MOST guys deserve a kick in the balls, and yes I got a few, but in fights, never in relationships.<br><br>Ladies cling to men who are bastards can be explained, it's all in your programing to breed. Mother nature decided that wild barabric boys tend to make excellent hunters, excellent food providers for the family. Trust me... starting a family with a runt will kill you fast.<br><br>I guess you ladies just need to move around more often... take time to find the right guy, you never know, he could be beside you all the time, the friendly neighbour who opens the door for you, your class mate who makes the effort to save notes for you, your co-worker who buys you coffee when you're tired, your friend who keeps you company when you wanna bitch bout other men... Ladies, we're always there, you just don't see us.</div>
