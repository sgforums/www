And of course once you start giving in, you'd keep doing it right? As for learning new moves, I feel if your gf gives in to you, at least make a real effort to please her! Sounds like to me he's just concerned with making himself happy.<br><br>She is definitely resentful, but she told me its not something she keeps thinking abt (i think she is just burying it).

            <div class='col-md body'>I must clarify-- she seems to love this current guy. Whether because she's given herself to him and thus feels she should marry him or is it because she really loves him--- that's onmly something she herself will know.<br><br>I think the problem with Asian society is that the actions do not match the mentality. Some girls go on and have sex and then when it comes to marriage they have an old thinking that they should marry the person that they gave themselves to-- thus leading to a lot of internal struggles... we;'re not as carefree as our western liberalised counterparts.</div>
