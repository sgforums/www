            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Wallie,<br><br>I can understand ur dilemma. My suggestion is that u think it thoroughly and plan how to best bring up the issue with her, without compromising ur friendship, without making her feel offended.<br><br>I dont think u can keep quiet for long, because ur conscience will bother u. U want the best for ur friend, and u want to help her. Ur conscience will not allow u to disregard an injustice which has befallen ur friend. If u just keep quiet, u will feel troubled. U will feel uneasy. In a way, u will know u have done a disservice by keeping quiet to ur friend's problems, instead of trying to solve them for her. That is what true friends should do.<br><br>This is a difficult matter to tackle. I think the key here is to plan and devise ways to communicate ur concerns to ur friend. You have to convey them with ur utmost sincerity. Ur friend will know that u only mean her good. She will not think u r a busybody. She will get the gist of ur concerns and what ur intentions are. Instead of getting offended or angry, she will be touched and comforted by ur gesture.<br><br>I leave it to you how to do that. Since u know ur friend the best. Like, how to choose the best place, the best timing, how to initiate the conversation, etc. All depends on ur skills and how u use ur knowledge of ur good friend.<br><br>Even if u fail, u fail trying to do a good deed. If u sacrifice ur friendship, so be it. It is a risk u have to take to "save" ur friend. But it need not be. Again, it depends on ur skills.<br><br>Dont mention about the rape charges first, it may confuse her even more. Just mention ur concerns, then let her talk, listen, then develop the conversation further, slowly. Im sure u can do that, as u r her good friend.<br><br>Good luck. And.....thanks for being a concerned friend, u have a good heart. I hope u will succeed. Im sure u will.<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>wah...the thread soo long, never actually seen through...everything..<br><br>But important is INITIATIVE!<br>1). Educate your friend, i mean the guy friend, let him know that his gf does not like it and in order to really "love" his gf, he should stop that as it is not respecting his gf.<br><br>2). Educate your gal friend, let her know that if he ever do that again, stop the act, and no longer engage in it with the guy..tell the gal to tell the guy beforehand when they do or something.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Apparently she's in confusion..... she can't seem to decide that whether what her bf is doing to her is considered as rape, or he is just exercising his right as a bf.<br><br>What I think.... that guy is a total jerk. End of story.<br><br>Sex has to be done with a completely willing partner. If one side is not willing, then it's considered as rape. Maybe she thinks that it's her obligation to give herself to the guy whether she likes it or not - which is not true at all.<br><br>I've heard of such a similar situation before - I once got to know this girl who said that her boyfriend once forced himself on her. She told me that she didn't like the situation - she was silently crying throughout - but she said that part of her actually liked it. She ended up being really loose afterwards, sleeping with guy after guy and doing cybersex in her free time.<br><br>Girls, no guy has the right to force himself on you - not even your husband.<br><br>If he does so, he's a total jerk who deserves no respect whatsoever... after all, he doesn't respect you at all and is using you for his own pleasure.<br><br>Dump him immediately - if he still forces himself on you, contact the police.<br><br>Then at least he won't be forcing himself on other girls for a long time.</div>

Maybe you could take her to see a counsellor or something.

My suggestion is that u think it thoroughly and plan how to best bring up the issue with her, without compromising ur friendship, without making her feel offended.<br><br>I dont think u can keep quiet for long, because ur conscience will bother u. U want the best for ur friend, and u want to help her. Ur conscience will not allow u to disregard an injustice which has befallen ur friend. If u just keep quiet, u will feel troubled. U will feel uneasy. In a way, u will know u have done a disservice by keeping quiet to ur friend's problems, instead of trying to solve them for her. That is what true friends should do.<br><br>This is a difficult matter to tackle. I think the key here is to plan and devise ways to communicate ur concerns to ur friend. You have to convey them with ur utmost sincerity. Ur friend will know that u only mean her good. She will not think u r a busybody. She will get the gist of ur concerns and what ur intentions are. Instead of getting offended or angry, she will be touched and comforted by ur gesture.<br><br>I leave it to you how to do that. Since u know ur friend the best. Like, how to choose the best place, the best timing, how to initiate the conversation, etc. All depends on ur skills and how u use ur knowledge of ur good friend.<br><br>Even if u fail, u fail trying to do a good deed. If u sacrifice ur friendship, so be it. It is a risk u have to take to "save" ur friend. But it need not be. Again, it depends on ur skills.<br><br>Dont mention about the rape charges first, it may confuse her even more. Just mention ur concerns, then let her talk, listen, then develop the conversation further, slowly. Im sure u can do that, as u r her good friend.<br><br>Good luck. And.....thanks for being a concerned friend, u have a good heart. I hope u will succeed. Im sure u will.<br></div></blockquote>yes i am very troubled over this. it even made me doubt my own relationship. even though this kind of thing didn't happen to me (even if i did, i think i'd lash out with one tight slap.. maybe two kicks). i even lose sleep over this matter.</div>

But do not forget, everyone perceives things differently.<br><br>What may be nothing to you, could mean the world for her.<br><br>The only way out, is to perhaps ask her to a beach where its not so crowded?
