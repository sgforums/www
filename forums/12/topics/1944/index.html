            <div class='col-md body'>Yup, I'll like to agree with them but everyone is different.  People have always said I like aunties but I like cute charming girls better.  Goes to show, what crowd mentality does to me.<br><br>By saying older guys, do you know them personally or are they some movie or pop stars you see.  It's ok, all part of growing up.<br><br>My nieces used to like Terence Cao, (Klactovak turns green and pukes very badly...) ahem... excuse me and they are only 5 years old or 7 at most.  Now they see him like uncle (that's me) sees him.  So both nieces and uncle pukes when we talk about the same incident.  Give yourself some time but don't commit any mistakes.  Some of the older guys are really sly, I know... even though I'll be considered an older guy in your books.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br></div>

What was this post about?  Oh yah, I think older guys tend to be more mature because of more time on this earth. Don't believe?  Think back 5 years ago, what were you doing?  Want a flash back, you were quarrelling with another classmate and good friend....<br><br>"If you don't let me play with your power ranger, I PoK! you.  Hng!"... Your friend will go "Don't friend, don't friend lah.  You think you damn big ahhh?".  Don't laugh, that's what I did last time.  Although, I think it was over Macross or Transformers?   :p<br><br>Was speaking to a girl yesterday, she prefers older guys because she said they were more stable.  My answer... NOT all.
