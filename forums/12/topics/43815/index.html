            <div class='col-md body'>sad to hear tis kind of thing happen... wat i tink is tat u shld listen to wat ur fren said... forget him.. even though both of u hv feelings for each other, its not gd to seperate their relationship... jz tink if u were on the other side... his decision to not carry on tis relationship is a gd reason to forget abt him... if both of u carry on like tis, u will be hurt even more... so forget him, move on, get ur frens to help, its not easy, but u jz hv to let time wash it away....<br><br>peace</div>

So, you should not to tell yourself to try forget him, but rather tell yourself, that you are not supposed to be in, in the first place. And let time do the rest of it. Perhaps you'll feel better this way. It may be also true that you stand a chance if one day he stay unmarried. But remember that he has put it to you to give up on him. The more you should understand his stand. If it's yours, it's yours, else, you'll have to face the reality, though cruel.<br><br>Sometimes, love is not all possession. It will be more hurtful to know that someone you love is unhappy with you THAN to know that someone you love is happy with someone else.<br><br>You should know my point.

It's quite evident that he had his decision made long time ago. Just that he had his conscience suppressed when being with you and after a period of time.<br>Conscience is tugging at him again to call for a decision, cos he knows that it's not going to end the way you wished.<br>Refer to Yun's comment -<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Yunhaier:</div><div class="quote_body">Let me tell you: His gf is overseas and the fact that he has make himself clear that he will never ditch his gf for you, means alot of message convey across that you refuse to accept subconsciously. So what if you make breakfast , make soup, desserts, cards, herbal tea..buy vitamins? In the end, he doesn't appreciate it liao, then whats the meaing and use of doing all these? Probably to satisfy Love's urge bah.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>Cheers </div></blockquote>After reading your post many times<br>I conclude that he doesn't LOVE you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br>He just wants company and you happen to be there.<br>Cos in the first place he told you that he's attached and gf in KL,<br>he somehow meant he's ok if you want to be friend so that there's companionship here in Singapore.<br>Secondly, you continue to shower him with love and care.<br>Well, he must be thinking 'why not?' and let you do whatever you want. It's at his advantage anyway.<br>i mean it's nice to have someone showering goodies at you when you don't ask for it and when you're alone. But it's all so temporal.<br>Should he choose to leave you, you cannot blame him for your suffer, cos he never push his way demanding you to love him and do all those things for him.<br>All because it's one sided r/s, it's not difficult for him to let go since he didn't put much effort into the relationship too.<br><br>So you became the victim. OVER.<br>End.<br><br>I believe you noe about this relationship more then any of us here.<br>You noe that he likes you for all those sweet stuff you did for him.<br>You noe that in the end, he'll still end up with his gf or elsewhere with other girls.<br>Don't wait for him....cos you're giving him another chance to hurt you and to take advantage of you again. Yes, that not love, OK?<br><br>I also believe that if you choose to move on, it would be faster then expected.<br>But my advise is, to finish your final exam, concentrate in your future.<br>Wake up, end the confused state.<br>End it all and start fresh.<br><br>Cheers<br><br></div>
