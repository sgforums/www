            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by evildevil:</div><div class="quote_body">I totally agree with Haven &amp; Silas who have elaborated what love is. Some pple's just simply lucky to have the kind of love they want. Unlucky pple like u (Urban^co) and me met such relationship that we don't desire. maybe we're not persistent enough or maybe we didn't put in effort to stop... although i know he's having the best of 2 world now, yet i didn't ask him to make decision all this while becoz i feel that love shouldn't be selfish or rather i shouldn't be selfish, i can't bear to see him in difficult position, perhaps in this way i don't owe him anythg or hurt anybody. I swear i never thought of hurting anybody by breaking up others marriage, maybe until the day he gets married, then i'll disappear from his life for good. meanwhile i just want to be the person who's there for him whether for happy or  for sad, i just want to leave some sweet memories behind, and i believe he'll remember me as he can never wipe off my footsteps left in his life. and in case our relationship can work out, whatever misery that ive been thru will be worthwhile. haha i must be a very irrational person who live in fairy tales dreamland: on one hand i'm hoping for the miracle, on the other hand i'm so negative abt this relationship. I really admire your courage and determination for stop seeing him. I wish you'll success and get out of it asap. may you find the right man in the right time and start the right love... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div></blockquote>thks... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  the chinese saying is right.. "one type of rice feed many different types of people." In general or most of our overall view is rather negative of your relationship. But if you think that what you did is great or do not wish to see him in a difficult position.. well you had actually brought up the point that this man dun even spare a thought for your future. I supposed we could have learnt such experience from some Hong Kong series. In the end it is always the poor lady that lost the battle. It is only after that she started to regret.. start afresh... build career... hahaha. Yes love takes courage, but must be the right man who deserved it. What you have done is just like robbing the poor and give the rich. Dun you agreed?? He had his share of love.. and what have he got to deserve yours??  How old are you now?? How many years have you got more for a well deserved courtship?? It is always people like you that got hurt most and it is always people like you that been taken advantages of.. i dun know you but i do know you are leading a very sorrowful life.. your days are always dark and is only him that will brighten you up... hey! my friend.. we dun live for others. We only live for ourselves... Instead of wish and praying, perhaps you should start something that is trully yours.. sharings always leads to fights.. like Singapore, we used to be part of malaysia.. we managed to get away from it and stay independant. Although we are small with relatively no resources but we have the brain and positive attitude.. see we still made it today. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> Thinking <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea">  and thinking <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question">  will bring you no where..

I had got friends that broke off with their gfs of many many years to marry a gal whom known for a year plus and they are happily married. Love is not all about time, it's just love. If a man really want to be with you for the rest of his life what is another 10 years and 10 years? I wun want marry a gal that wun bring happiness to me. Having to spend time with someone you love is one of the best moment in life. Afterall the choice is his... and you too have your choice. I can see you are a very considerate and beautiful gal.. definately there will be many suitors around.

In this world nothing is easy, important is you do it with a sincere heart. If things will to come easy, i'm afraid not many people will treasure it. Just bear this in mind.. love is an investment too, you must place it with the right person. Culture it with care and shower it with love... it will grow and develop well. Just make sure you dun place it on the wrong person. And NEVER let love blind you. Not forgetting we can't live on love alone, we need bread too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

We learnt from our past, our experiences, our mistakes... Each time we failed and fell, we became stronger again each time we stand up again. The key point is we MUST stand up again. Why let memories live in you and cast a shadow in your life. Life in Singapore is stressful enough, why wanna increase that stress level. I'm not a heartless person but i'm definately a very realistic and down to earth person. Now that you are hungry and penniless, have you got the mind to recall watever sweet or bitter memories? Be rational, who dun have a broken relationship?? Is just how we put ourselves in it... the better one will stand up and be stronger again, the weaker of course takes a longer time to stand up... as for those that never stand up, let's call it a day. The society can only accept strong people... that's how we are supposed to be brought up. If you are working.. is the same. Look at your boss and compare him with the lowest rank worker. I'm afraid the worker love to use phrase like leave life to fate... sway lah.. kana 4D i resign liao... if i'm very rich ... but it's always the same old phrase... and he's forever a worker... building sand castles in the air. Action speaks louder than words.. do and not think and say think and say only... I'm sure life will be much brighter. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

People that escape reality tends to live in a world of their own and most of them dun realised it. It is always thru the hard way they learnt and i'm glad some learnt and managed to turn back. As for those continued to live in their own world.. sad to say by the time they realised it is always far too late. The damaged carried out is so intensive that nothing much can be done.</div>
