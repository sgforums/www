If this man like you claimed really treasure you and love you... sad to say he dun behave like one. I had got friends that broke off with their gfs of many many years to marry a gal whom known for a year plus and they are happily married. Love is not all about time, it's just love. If a man really want to be with you for the rest of his life what is another 10 years and 10 years? I wun want marry a gal that wun bring happiness to me. Having to spend time with someone you love is one of the best moment in life. Afterall the choice is his... and you too have your choice. I can see you are a very considerate and beautiful gal.. definately there will be many suitors around. "<strong>LOVE IS NOTHING BUT TORTURE</strong>"... wonderful phrase.. just like the Japanese carving for the deadly PUFFER fish... it can be very tasty but if the chef made a wrong cut, well you lose your life. Loving a person is just the same as the chef that prepare the fish... loving a wrong person can be deadly too, other than that LOVE is so beautiful... sweet... lovely. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> and the best to enjoy good puffer fish is sake.. not too much or it is as deadly too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Some pple's just simply lucky to have the kind of love they want. Unlucky pple like u (Urban^co) and me met such relationship that we don't desire. maybe we're not persistent enough or maybe we didn't put in effort to stop... although i know he's having the best of 2 world now, yet i didn't ask him to make decision all this while becoz i feel that love shouldn't be selfish or rather i shouldn't be selfish, i can't bear to see him in difficult position, perhaps in this way i don't owe him anythg or hurt anybody. I swear i never thought of hurting anybody by breaking up others marriage, maybe until the day he gets married, then i'll disappear from his life for good. meanwhile i just want to be the person who's there for him whether for happy or  for sad, i just want to leave some sweet memories behind, and i believe he'll remember me as he can never wipe off my footsteps left in his life. and in case our relationship can work out, whatever misery that ive been thru will be worthwhile. haha i must be a very irrational person who live in fairy tales dreamland: on one hand i'm hoping for the miracle, on the other hand i'm so negative abt this relationship. I really admire your courage and determination for stop seeing him. I wish you'll success and get out of it asap. may you find the right man in the right time and start the right love... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
