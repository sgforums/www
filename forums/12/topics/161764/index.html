            <div class='col-md body'>Hi ppl,<br>I need your advise on this matter which i'm very regretful of what i've done and confused about her reactions and feedbacks.<br><br>Last night i went out for supper with this girl whom i like (But she's attached). Things were as normal as before. We chit chat and joked around.<br>It was then when it was getting quite late (1am+) that we decided to go home. I sent her home. When we reached at her carpark, we did abit of chit chat and played with each other (pinching and poking each other).<br><br>It was then when i accidently slapped her on her thigh, leaving quite a big mark on her thigh. I was shocked because i din realised that i've hit her that hard. I apologised and try to massage off the mark on the thigh. She wasn't really angry though. And of course, i allowed her to slap me back. She did a few times, but she did not did it because of revenge though.<br><br>It was then when i was trying to massage off the mark off her thigh, she said that she was feeling tickish because it was quite sensitive. Then we asked each other where our sensitive parts are. She mentioned she was quite an easily-tickish girl whereas, i told her i don't seems to have any. Then she tried to poke n tickle me but it was all in vain  because i don't feel tickish though. It was then when she ran her fingers down and around my ear, it was quite tickish which i told her.<br><br>She then told her that most guys are sensitive around the ear area, so does her bf. Then she said her bf will feel tickish when she soft-blow in and around his ears. And i told her i never had that kind of experience before. So, i requested her to try on me which she did. It was tickish though.<br><br>Then i requested to try on her which she initially was reluctant but gave in after 3 requests from me. And so i soft-blow around her ear. As i gently blow around her ear, she gave out a few soft moans and as i proceeded further, she was getting kind of high and moaning more and abit of loud which in turn, turned me on. My hands ran over her body and it was until when i touched the "sensitive" part, she "awoke up" and asked me to stop. I was too "awakened up". I felt so regretful of what i've done and apologised to her and requested her to give me two tight slaps on my face. She declined to and said that we should keep a distance away from each other and she don't know how to face me the next day and future. I apologised again and asked her if she's angry with me or not. She said "No".<br><br>We then went to the nearby 7-11 and bought some drinks and went to a nearby playground bench and did abit of chit chat. For some which she said that she did not even tell her bf before. Though we were feeling quite uneasy initially when talking to each other, but things got abit off better.<br><br>After that, i sent her home and went home. This morning just received her sms asing me if i've slept well or not. Though it may appear to be a normal sms she used to be sending, but i felt that from her sms, she's beginning to keep a distance away from me.<br><br>I felt so remorseful, regretful and stupid for what i've done last night.<br><br>Now i'm confused about how she feels towards me. I do really like her alot but i do not know if she likes me or not. ( I know that there're quite a few number of ppl whom have such experiences on "u like her, but you don't know if she likes you or not).<br><br>Pls kindly advise and sugguest your views on my situation.<br><br>Thank you so much.</div>

You might have advanced on her physically but she allowed you to.  It takes 2 hands to clap.  If you think you did something wrong, then she is equally guilty.<br><br>2.  Your quote : "I do really like her alot but i do not know if she likes me or not."<br><br>It's obvious that you would want to get more intimate and perhaps start a relationship with her.  If you choose to take action, then I think you have a chance to succeed.<br><br>This is because of point 1 above.  It means she is not that faithful in her relationship.  And the reason behind THAT could be that her relationship isn't that solid/happy, or she's the type who seeks thrills outside of her relationship.<br><br>3.  If you were sincerely regretful about what you did, you would not be here pondering about your quote in point 2.<br><br>If you really had her best interests at heart, you will stop thinking about yourself first (i.e. want to redeem yourself, want to salvage the friendship, want to know if she likes you).   Instead you will put HER happiness and her relationship as priority.   But you're not doing that.  You're confused because you want her.<br><br>Which brings us back to point 2.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  I know you're very gian, right?<br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by icemountain59:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi choco B, pls advise on your above statement. I do not get what you mean, especially of what i've done to her. What i've done has really shown a very bad and perverted image of me which i really never want to in the very 1st place.
