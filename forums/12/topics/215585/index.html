            <div class='col-md body'>1) When a husband starts to be very busy suddenly and coming home late, and often receiving SMSes very late at night, there is a high possibility he is having an affair. Don't you remember we used to talk late or sms each other late at night when we are dating? Guys don't usually message each other so late.<br><br>2) When a guy has no female friends' names on his handphone, there is a possiblilty the guy is smart enough to change the female name to a male one. For example, Joan can be changed to John, Mary can changed to Mark.<br><br>3) When a guy starts to give you the dream of a wonderful marriage in early stage of wooing, be prepared for the worst. Dreams are always too wonderful. Either the man is bluffing you that he is single (but actual fact that he has wife and kids already) or he is after your body and money. They often persuade you to open a joint account to save money for future marriage and often tried to bring you out to holidays alone. Just think of that, what's the point of planning for marriage when both of you still don't really understand each other well especially when just started like less than 3 months?<br><br>4) When a guy starts to message you frequently with sweet night messages with hints of liking you, it doesn't mean you are the only girl he likes. Do remember that messages can be forward to more than one person at the same time. And don't be surprised the messages to drop lesser and lesser once he becomes your boyfriend especially after he gets what he wants.<br><br>5) Never just see and know only the good sides of a guy. Know his bad sides as well. If he is a strong game addict, do expect him to lose his temper on you when he lost his games. Same goes for guys who bet heavily on soccer. Abuses may get worse if he often gamble and drink alcohol alot as you may get punches or kickes as well.<br><br>6) Know a guy's past well not through his mouth alone. Know him more from his common friends and family members. Characters are formed over years, so people who know him for years are likely to know him more. But of course, darkest secrets are still kept in heart.<br><br>7) Be curious enough to take a look in the guy's Friendster list of friends and testimonials. Sometimes, some guys are dumb enough to use their Friendster account to know other girls behind their spouses or girlfriends.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> Don't put the blame totally on the women who seduced your guys as all women want to have good quality of guys. If the guys you loved are so easily to get seduced by other girls, they are probably not really the guys for you.<br><br>9) Body language tells the best during the 1st 3 months of courtship whether the guy is lusting you or loving you.<br><br>10) Shot-gun marriages and rush marriages don't really last long unless both parties really take the time to understand and know each other more. Having babies to save the relationship is always a bad move.<br><br>11) Minor quarrels between couples can be good as it provides chances for each other to know the difference in their viewpoints. Having no quarrel at all however can be deadly as each other maybe enduring with each other alot and one day all may explode out.<br><br>12) Guys who impress you by their wealth and generousity the first time may somehow treat you like toys to throw aside when bored with you.</div>
