            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by foxwalk:</div><div class="quote_body">Given this situation:<br><br>Teenagers are roped in for holiday jobs. Job involves getting people to "buy" charity tickets priced at $5 each, and telling the public that this money will go to charity. In reality, these teenagers are given a commission cut of $1 for every ticket they sell.<br><br>Question: Is this illegal? The company who employs these teenagers are told that they have a "license". Does anyone know if this is legal??</div></blockquote>I dun think it is illegal. But the part on misrepresenting facts is. I was asked to do this b4. but my cut was 20%...too little for me nia. Not worth my time standing at MRT bugging ppl....rather study for "O"s. My ticket cost $2 each I keep 20% Agent 30% Charity 50%. that was what my agent told me. But I truthful lah never say all the money went to charity. Told ppl the truth.<br>those teenagers who misrepresent facts, are greedy asses who like money or are economical with the truth. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  Moral of the story: Use your common sense and logical thinking b4 parting with your hard earned money. Always find out more about the charity which you are about to donate and use your eyes to see the work a charity organization does. DONT DONATE BLINDLY!!!</div>
