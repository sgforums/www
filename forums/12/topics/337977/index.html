              <p>If you were to post this up, I doubt you're in a state that you cannot live without him. Good. Well, you should know 'Beauty is in the eye of the beholder' (classic example).</p>
              <p>I can tell you 8 outta' 10 guys or rather person would repeat their mistake. But you never know if this guy would be one of the 2. So what I would suggest is.. you don't give in to 'temptations'. Temptations like doing things that allow him to malnipulate you, things that will allow him to control how you should decide. You should know what are the 'things'.</p>
              <p>Take YOUR time to decide, but let him know if he likes you, he will have to give you the time to think and make the WISE choice, to make sure history won't repeat itself. This is for YOUR own good, and to save your heart from 'breaking' again.</p>
              <p>Believe or not, no matter how many different people you ask, different answers you get, the decision lies in you ultimately. Think smart, make the wise choice.</p>
              <p>Good Luck</p>

              <p>The other solution is to give it a miss.</p>
              <p>You currently with a guy whom is experienced enough to make you feel like believing in
                                              love all over again. The thing is he's very sweet (because he got intentions, duh) to you so
                                              far, his past also hinted it's going to end with you getting hurt again.</p>
              <p><br>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
              <p>The whole point is, sure you can lay down lotsa enough rules to fill the whole house. But to a player, rules are meant to be flouted; to be played around. End of day, if he were to screw up and you were to ditch him - you still end up getting hurt, isn't it?</p>
              <p>Save your 'feel like believing' for a decent guy please.</p>

              <p>Why does guys need to brag about all this? I don't blame them if they needed to do all that to impress us and show us that they are actually in control and confident about themselves. But I don't tolerate LIAR and LIARS.</p>

              <p>nisi, you are in the best position to know if he is a changed person from the past.  open your eyes big, do not be too swayed by the sweet words, sweet gestures from him.    I believe the truth will unveil itself one day.    I have a guy telling me how good he was but i found out myself that he was not as good as he claims himself to be.  </p>
              <p>Observe him more.  do not hesitate to question him when in doubt.   If his actions and words don't tally, watch out!   But if through time, actions he proves he has changed, good for you.  If not, I suggest you make a wise choice.</p>
