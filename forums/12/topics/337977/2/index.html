              love all over again. The thing is although he's very sweet to me so
              far, his pasts made me unsure about how this is going to end.</p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>He has been with plenty of girls and is easy in that sense, and
              he flirts around a lot as well.. Although this is in his past as
              far as I know, I can't helped but wonder about this when he
              mentions his past occasionally.</strong></span></p>
              <p>Any concrete actions to alleviate/help with this? I know

              <p>Did you ask about his past or that he mention about it himself? He mentioned it himself right? Yes warning. He has hinted to you already. Trust me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="icon_twisted.gif"></p>
              <p>Behavior to continue..? You expect him to change and be faithful from now on? It will be hard. Are you willing to take the risk? It's all up to you but if you were to go for it then I think you should be prepared.. anyway just observe first. Else, walk away.</p>

              <p>The whole point is, sure you can lay down lotsa enough rules to
                  fill the whole house. But to a player, rules are meant to be
                  flouted; to be played around. End of day, if he were to screw up
                  and you were to ditch him - you still end up getting hurt, isn't
                  it?</p>
              <p>Save your 'feel like believing' for a decent guy please.</p>

              <p><br>Transexual parn's motive of coming to this forum is to disrupt discussion.   If you read its post responding to TS, you know it is a nuisance giving nonseniscal, distorted views and comments.   </p>
              <p>It is now trying its best to divert forumers' attention that it is a transexual, tranny by pointing finger to say that I am ah qua.   Ha ha ha.  There are already posts by it that other forumers have posted to prove it is transexual.</p>
