Meanwhile also change ur internal flight to some other day to suit ur international flight.  Unless u die die want to go back on that day.<br><br>I faced much worse suituation than u. I miss the international flight in LA due to delay in American airlines. LL have to wait for the next flight on a waiting list. And it was 11pm flight~! Gosh and they tell me the flight is full have to put me on waiting list. If I miss that too, I have to sleep in the airport to wait for the next flight which is the next day 2pm...Lucky I was able to board it as those who were suppose to take the 11pm flight was also delayed by the internal airlines... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
