            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, my friend got a problem, hes in the middle of a relationship, but the gal is very cold to him, the gal is actually married, but her husband has left her, she doesnt know where her husband is now, and she has given up on her husband already. Before the gal knows my friend, she befriended another guy who she likes very much, this guy has left sg for studies, but the gal has been thinking of him since he left. My friend likes the gal very much, but at the same time is sad cause he feel so empty and lonely. The gal never calls him or msg him, unless he msg her.. Shes not very affectionate also and they just hold hands when they go out, but when my friend tries to kiss or hug her, she will back off.. My friend doesnt know why she is like dat, he thinks most probably is because the gal has juz come out of a failed marriage, and is not ready for a relationship..but this is only an assumption,  which comes to wonder why the gal wans to go steady in the first place.. and the gal had confessed that sometimes she still thinks of the guy who left sg for studies, but say that she and that guy is impossible one.... so wat shld my friend do? break off and remain as friends? or hang on and let her be touched by his true love? Btw, my friend is a very caring and understanding guy, he sends the gal home everytime they go out, even though they both live from one side to the other side in singapore... and he even lets her go out wif other guys, because the gal's husband is very possesive.. and so the gal doesnt want to be tied down anymore..<br>my friend is lost and confused... guys &amp; gals wat r your views on this??</div>

Well, after seeing your comments, i feel very sad for my friend.. Not to mention the $$ and time spent with her.. hai.. he bought her lots of stuff and all the dining is paid by him since shes not working... sigh...

And you mentioned that he spend much money and time on her - although every relationship is an investment financially and emotionally, it shouldn't be 'business-like,' for love is and should be rewarding even if your investment fails. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> I knew that he will fear to talk to her because its like so expected behavior - To fear is to lose ultimately.<br><br>P.S: A talk is essential.

Why u never sms me or call me??<br>Gal: Because i dont have the habit to do that, if u wan, i can call u everyday and ask u how r u, wat r u doing etc....<br><br>**My frd feel it is not her fault and can understand that she dun have the habit, thus can accept her answer, he also feels it is not necessary for her to do that, since itz like forcing her to do it anyway**<br><br>Frd: I feel our relationship is like "friends holding hands", wat do u think?<br>Gal: I hold hands with other friends too.....<br>**My frd is shocked... **<br><br>Frd: WHy? they r only FRIENDS u know<br>Gal: Why not, i only hold hands with them, and not sex, and it is with those im very close with....<br>**My frd is starting to doubt her character...**<br><br>Frd: So how many people do u hold hands with when u go out with them?<br>Gal: 3, 1 is overseas... blah blah blah<br>**So the truth is, she holds hands with the one in her heart b4 he left sg for studies too......<br>**My Frd is sad...**<br><br>Blah blah blah.... my friend talks about how vulnerable she is to those "holding hands" friends, talks abt wats the point of doing it, and tells her she is not young liao, 24 liao, shld get a stable guy, but gal says she got a stable guy friend, den declines to say any further and says... " aiya dun ask me this question la.." obviously, she doesnt wan to settle down....<br><br>**Frd thinks, even ang mos r not so open, holding hands with other friends??? hmmmm maybe real close... inside he still hopes for a chance to revive this relationship... so the last question he pops is..**<br><br>Frd: So wat am i to you?? Someone special??<br>Gal: You are juz a friend....<br><br>**Frd is heartbroken... it had ended....  but for better also.. he knows he cant be with her.... their relationship thinking is totally different...<br><br>Frd: Sorry love is selfish, i want someone who can accept me, and give me the feeling of love...<br>Gal: So we dun see each other liao loh......<br><br>** Frd thinks,is she threatening me? why is god so cruel to him, he cant bear to say he wans to end the relationship, but wat use isit to continue on like this?? **<br><br>*Silence for 10 secs*<br>*Frd thinks long n hard......*<br><br>Frd: LEts juz be friends............<br><br>Frd sends the gal to the lift, and tells her to take care......<br><br>Frd left her house and take a 1 hr mrt ride back home.....<br><br>Along the way, he called me, with sadness still lingering in his voice...<br></div></blockquote>Its better to lose a girl that doesn't love him, then to keep a relationship, thinking that his gf loves him. Its purely one-sided and zero committment and feelings input from her side. Your friend learn one lesson: before you leap into a relationship, understand what you are getting before anything else. I doubt he even know much about her prior before <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Before the gal knows my friend, she befriended another guy who she likes very much, this guy has left sg for studies, but the gal has been thinking of him since he left. My friend likes the gal very much, but at the same time is sad cause he feel so empty and lonely. The gal never calls him or msg him, unless he msg her.. Shes not very affectionate also and they just hold hands when they go out, but when my friend tries to kiss or hug her, she will back off.. My friend doesnt know why she is like dat, he thinks most probably is because the gal has juz come out of a failed marriage, and is not ready for a relationship..but this is only an assumption,  which comes to wonder why the gal wans to go steady in the first place.. and the gal had confessed that sometimes she still thinks of the guy who left sg for studies, but say that she and that guy is impossible one.... so wat shld my friend do? break off and remain as friends? or hang on and let her be touched by his true love? Btw, my friend is a very caring and understanding guy, he sends the gal home everytime they go out, even though they both live from one side to the other side in singapore... and he even lets her go out wif other guys, because the gal's husband is very possesive.. and so the gal doesnt want to be tied down anymore..<br>my friend is lost and confused... guys &amp; gals wat r your views on this?? </div></blockquote>bReak.. remain as fRens.. den slowly touch her heart.. and then patch.. that should be the way..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>like what was said, no point in trying to hold on to a 'relationship' which doesn't even exists in the first place.<br><br>the truth hurts. but it's better now when it's only been a while as compared to maybe 2 yrs later.<br><br>if she doen't like you, she won't. don't be mislead by her cues and have false hopes that one day you'll be able to win her heart.</div>
