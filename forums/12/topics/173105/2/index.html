All sort of self-justifying love and hatred drama-mama throughout your topic (from common heart wrenching phrases to lengthy waits equates to faithfulness) are fuelling this unhealthy emotional engine.<br><br>Your root of problem doesn't lie with her; in fact, the entire cause of this sad plight is because of your own doing. You have serious inferior complex that obstruct you from accepting love and being loved. Likely, this wrecked subconscious derived from your early childhood.<br><br>You are unable to accept Love when it is presented to you and you return Love with nonsensical dealings which will spur resentment and bitter moments. What the fcuk is Love-her-but-I-cannot-tell-her-so-I-make-her-hate-me?<br><br>CHILDISH! I tell you.<br><br>The truth is that you are unable to receive this reality that you are actually lovable and have someone extend care and concern over your life. YOU REJECTED that notion and REJECTED her affection because of your blinded inferiority thoughts that binds you from the goodness that you could enjoy and that this world is actually painted with colours. You dull them with your stupidity, which was breed from poor self outlook.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[b]You kept entertaining yourself with a biased truth </span></strong>- that she will never accept you and you can only be friends with her because you are so afraid of rejection. In the end, it became a self fulfilling prophesy when you MADE her reject you and trigger your most feared scenario... that it became impossible with you and her.<br><br>Now you can only gaze at her dust trail as she sped off into a new chapter in her life. She resisted your attempts to woo her because you have lost the chance she has previously gave to you. There is no reason why she should love someone she has no interest with... now. You panic and gripped her further... resulting in a friendship bleeding and hemorrhage.<br><br>Gradually, you became an unconscious pest.<br><br>This becomes a vicious karmic cycle and when this friendship is gone forever, it trigger your next feared scenario - a complete sever of bonds.<br><br>Do you see a pattern here?<br><br>You thought of something negative... it wasn't like this... but in the end, it became like this when you unconsciously work towards this negativity. Your soul screamed a warning, that this has become a reality and you justify with 'I knew will become this way!!'<br><br><strong>Self fulfilling prophesy. </strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You cannot Love others without understanding that self love must happen before you can extend this love to others. This is a breach in the Sixth law of Love (<span style="font-style: italic;">The best thing we can do to Love and help our partners is to love ourselves</span>).<br><br>She presented a critical lesson here: that if you continue to harbor such definition of love, which resulted from poor psychological state, history will reiterate itself and that it would be difficult for you to find fulfillment in relationship.<br><br>Start loving yourself.... improve yourself... and most importantly, get to know yourself. Banish negative thoughts and quit being an irritant in her eyes. For a start, retreat for a period of time for self reflection and enlightenment. Be a hermit: rethink and preview your situation. It gives you and her some time off.<br><br>If it has become impossible for you and her (Relationship or friendship), learn acceptance and move on. To overly cling unhealthy is a sign of negativity, which also hint at inferiority complex.<br><br>You need to resolve this damaged 'self' problem. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers         [/b]</blockquote>YAR! i agree with u!</div>
