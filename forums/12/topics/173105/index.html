            <div class='col-md body'>alamak, can write a bit properly or not? kind of hard to read and since this is a forum, can don't try to act cute with your english? that and your post is long, its kinda frustrating to actually read and comprehend the whole thing <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>that said, you may be thinking abit too much liao... if the girl u like has no feelings for you, there is no point trying to continue thinking about her and trying to make her like you. just calm down and think it through, a r/s requires both sides to commit, it just can't be forced... go take on some time-intensive hobbies or activities to keep yourself really really really busy, and chances are that you will find that those thoughts and feelings will disappear after a while (it worked for me, though it took a recent song by S.H.E. to clear my thoughts up finally, take a guess which song it is <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">)<br><br>it is those who can get up and move on with their lives that are truly courageous... hanging on to your feelings for her is going to hurt alot more in the long run... this is merely an infatuation, that's all, judging by what you wrote : <blockquote>swear myself i will <strong>try</strong> myself to love her</blockquote>so move on in life, keep yourself busy, and try not to think that everytime she contacts you she is trying to suan you, give you chance or anything, because you are clearly thinking too much...</div>

All sort of self-justifying love and hatred drama-mama throughout your topic (from common heart wrenching phrases to lengthy waits equates to faithfulness) are fuelling this unhealthy emotional engine.<br><br>Your root of problem doesn't lie with her; in fact, the entire cause of this sad plight is because of your own doing. You have serious inferior complex that obstruct you from accepting love and being loved. Likely, this wrecked subconscious derived from your early childhood.<br><br>You are unable to accept Love when it is presented to you and you return Love with nonsensical dealings which will spur resentment and bitter moments. What the fcuk is Love-her-but-I-cannot-tell-her-so-I-make-her-hate-me?<br><br>CHILDISH! I tell you.<br><br>The truth is that you are unable to receive this reality that you are actually lovable and have someone extend care and concern over your life. YOU REJECTED that notion and REJECTED her affection because of your blinded inferiority thoughts that binds you from the goodness that you could enjoy and that this world is actually painted with colours. You dull them with your stupidity, which was breed from poor self outlook.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You kept entertaining yourself with a biased truth </strong></span>- that she will never accept you and you can only be friends with her because you are so afraid of rejection. In the end, it became a self fulfilling prophesy when you MADE her reject you and trigger your most feared scenario... that it became impossible with you and her.<br><br>Now you can only gaze at her dust trail as she sped off into a new chapter in her life. She resisted your attempts to woo her because you have lost the chance she has previously gave to you. There is no reason why she should love someone she has no interest with... now. You panic and gripped her further... resulting in a friendship bleeding and hemorrhage.<br><br>Gradually, you became an unconscious pest.<br><br>This becomes a vicious karmic cycle and when this friendship is gone forever, it trigger your next feared scenario - a complete sever of bonds.<br><br>Do you see a pattern here?<br><br>You thought of something negative... it wasn't like this... but in the end, it became like this when you unconsciously work towards this negativity. Your soul screamed a warning, that this has become a reality and you justify with 'I knew will become this way!!'<br><br><strong>Self fulfilling prophesy. </strong> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>***<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> You cannot Love others without understanding that self love must happen before you can extend this love to others. This is a breach in the Sixth law of Love (<span style="font-style: italic;">The best thing we can do to Love and help our partners is to love ourselves</span>).<br><br>She presented a critical lesson here: that if you continue to harbor such definition of love, which resulted from poor psychological state, history will reiterate itself and that it would be difficult for you to find fulfillment in relationship.<br><br>Start loving yourself.... improve yourself... and most importantly, get to know yourself. Banish negative thoughts and quit being an irritant in her eyes. For a start, retreat for a period of time for self reflection and enlightenment. Be a hermit: rethink and preview your situation. It gives you and her some time off.<br><br>If it has become impossible for you and her (Relationship or friendship), learn acceptance and move on. To overly cling unhealthy is a sign of negativity, which also hint at inferiority complex.<br><br>You need to resolve this damaged 'self' problem. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi strival<br><br>What you are going through is what each of us here had gone through before.<br>I was like you once. While reading your posting it reminded me how silly I was loving someone whom I think loved me because she treated me with some kindness.<br><br>The same thing happen to me in the past, was like you all the way the sleepless nights, the pain in the heart and the effort to make her love me. The only difference is that she finally got so fed up with my pestering and slap me twice on the face. Yeah I deserve it, I never deny she was in the wrong, in fact I grew up from that slap. I learn that love can never be force, the more you force it the more the girl will reject you.<br><br>Can I ask what have you actually done for her? You say you love her but have you ever respected her wishes? She asked for some time off or freedom but you refuse to give her, she ask for you to stop saying i love you, have you done that?  Looking back can you tell me that have you ever seriously listern to what she say? Is always what you want and what you feel like doing but never ever what she wants.<br><br>Loving a girl is simple, listern to her words closely, understanding her problems  and be there always when she needs you. Do not go out with her or force her to do things she does not want or likes.<br><br>"her thinking and her type guy in BGR: is she wan a boyfrez who shown care for u ... give u freedom... who can serious listen wat yur saidingz.. !! a guy who really shown alot of concern for u ... !! sad will cheer u upz.. sometime will give u suprise ritez.. !! and a trusT alsozZz !! also speak in manner.. also must know u quit well .. !! must treat u very wellz... !"<br><br>Look at what she is trying to tell you. You are so lucky that she tells you what she wants and needs. I have seen cases where the poor guy have to guess and guess what she wants and in the end the girl just dump him for not understanding him.<br><br>ASk yourself this if you cannot be what she wants will you give her up?<br>Real love does not means that you must always be there for her and force her to do things she does not like.<br><br>Btw try not to write out her name in forums. Is a form of disrespect for the person and the person will feel offended if she will finds out.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well..<br><br>What I can say is, the first thing you must do is to get on with your life. Don't you see? the harder you try, the worse it gets. Why not give her, and yourself, some breathing space? Sure you see each other in class everyday.. BUt that does not mean that you have to think of her.<br><br>School is for studying. Honestly, studies are much more rewarding than sitting and thinking and worrying over this matter. Relax. Let go a bit. Take one step back. The more you try to close the distance between the two of you, the larger the distance becomes.<br><br>What I can say is.. you blew the first chance. Whether you get a second chance or not, only she knows. but if you do get another chance, I hope you will cherish it.</div>

Where are you studying now?<br><br>1st thing to let you know. A relationship cannot be forced. If there's no chemistry or whatever other reasons (excuses) she wanna use to avoid you, god also can't help you.<br><br>All the bad things you've said about her goes to show that...<br><br>1. You've not noticed. You're insensitive too. And very much the same thing you've said about her yourself? You feel that you're the one suffering, but have you realised that lots of your suffering and hers have actually been triggered off by you? But in fact, you have made the choice for those options but she on the other hand have little choices (to start) and probably could indirectly influenced by what you're done to her in the past. So she knows that you purposely wanted to make her angry and sad the other time? What is hers and your horoscope?<br><br>2. You're too judgemental of her. When you're judgemental of your partner in a relationship, something should be quite wrong. Either at least with her or you? Or it could be just that the both of you are really incompatible.. Have you realised that?<br><br>3. Your love for her is quite blind. Besides, she've already said it couldn't be. You still want her just because you love(?) her? After what she've said to hurt you over and over again... There're few possible outcomes (vast) to all these, and one of them would be even if she accept you.. It could be more like a one-sided relationship... You loving her alot more than you do. And ultimately the reason she choose to stay might not be that she love you at all? You've once chose an option which made both of you SUFFERED for it. My question for you now is, <span style="font-style: italic;">"would you like to do it again?"</span></div>
