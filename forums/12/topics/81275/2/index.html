U r really nothing to her and what makes u think u have the qualifications to do that? U r only a friend to her at the most....<br><br>Come on... have she ever expressed any feelings for u... or its just ur wishful thinking... wake up pls....<br><br>Chatting with u on ICQ doesn't mean a thing......
