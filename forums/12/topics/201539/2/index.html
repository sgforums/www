Ask her out alone first. Dun do anything on the first date. Then you can see the picture much better. If she really likes you, she definitely likes going out with you alone. Also, when you ask her out, you are also giving her hints that you like her.<br><br>If she gives unbelievable excuses, then u may want to try a second time. If second time also like that, forget her la bro. Dun need to keep trying cos it dun always work. Besides, you will come off as a pest which is even worse than before.<br><br></div>

Important thing is whether she likes u or not. Asking her out will cut thru everything and your worries will be finally over. Just msg her or call her although i dun advise u sms her. Calling her on the spot will clear all your questions you have in your mind immediately. The main purpose of the call is to jio her out, not to drag for long hours but no result.<br><br>her reply should either be ''yes'' or ''no''. No ''maybe''. If there's maybe, means not that interested. you may consider another girl.
