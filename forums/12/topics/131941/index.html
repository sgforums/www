            <div class='col-md body'>Lesson learnt- don't sit on people's bed when you are having your period.<br>The maid may be rude &amp; bossy but she is not your concern. It is up to your bf's parents to talk to her. I don't think her behaviour warrants termination.<br>Maybe the blood stain seep into the mattress so very hard to remove.<br>U have to understand her frustration.

            <div class='col-md body'>1 thing I learnt about the behaviours of maids before they go back to their country is, they will be totally different. Their bad attitudes will reveal and they wouldn't hold back to shout at you should they feel unhappy about anything.<br><br>It's not your fault totally. I'm sure all gals dread stains on their menses. But maybe you could be a little bit more careful next time?<br><br>I think the maid is over-reacting. But, let the matter rest.

            <div class='col-md body'>Some conservative Asian women (and men) believe that it is extreme bad luck and unhygienic to touch another woman's period stains. They also believe that it is proper etiquette for a woman to clean up her own period stains. One has often heard many toilet-cleaning ladies complaining viciously in the office about inconsiderate lady staff indiscriminately leaving their "Japanese roti buns" about in the female toilets.<br><br>Don't take to heart the harsh comments from the maid. She probably was brought up in that kind of traditional environment and may also have been spoilt by your boyfriend's family to raise her voice at guests who violate her sense of etiquette. Just ignore her barking, but be mindful of leaving your stains behind in future (make sure you are well-protected against heavy flow days), especially in public places -- you wouldn't want some old grandmother raising a ruckus on the MRT train over a seat you have stood up to let her sit, just because she saw a small cheery "Japanese flag" on it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm?? How come you didn't know when your menses came?? Weird, heh. But it's ok, the maid was too much too. I suggest you forgo the incident instead of dwelling too much. Next time, bring a pad with you, just in case. (I had one similar incident as you, but surprisingly, they didn't scold me o_O , but looking back, I thought it was quite unhygenic of me to leave such  'imprint', I could have run to the toilet to check when I realise my uterus was feeling funny)</div>
