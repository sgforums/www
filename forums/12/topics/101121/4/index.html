So you don't like 'kiddy examples'...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  Well.. Put down into PLAIN FACTS then...<br><br>1. In life, WHATEVER you do... There're bound to be a certain level of RISK INVOLVEMENT... No kiddy example now... Just plain simple facts... Like what people have always said... "Nothing ventured, nothing gained'...<br><br>2. Your OWN beliefs... I can 'respect' that... But seeing things from your OWN PERSONAL point of view certainly doesn't mean that everybody else should start BELIEVING in you just because of WHAT YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED... Everybody has DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE in life and hence rather different thoughts and beliefs... There're no guarantee saying which one is 'more right' than the others... As much as you can HOLD ON to your OWN BELIEFS... SPARE A THOUGHT for OTHERS'... YUP... You have GONE through SH|T in your RELATIONSHIP(S)... But don't necessarily mean that you should DEPRIVE others of 'HAPPINESS'... If you INSIST on digging a hole and covering yourself in a DEEP BELIEF, I won't be stopping you for now... Meanwhile, others don't have to be as 'negative' and narrow as you are...<br><br>Well... Your THINKINGS... Rather EXTREME...? Wonder how old you are...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Guys are selfish...? Well... I guess alot of HUMANS are...? Tell me you ain't selfish at all...? I would like to listen to that....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Misunderstandings and unhappiness are bound to happen in relationships... Alot of times, they might not even be intentional... Just sit down and have a talk? You might 'discover' some things might not really be the way it SEEMS to be.... The last thing you should be doing is to point a finger at the opposite party without clarifying things... And to say that 'majority' of the guys are selfish creatures...? Sheesh... It's as if you've already dated majority of the guys of planet Earth...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Okie... So you like to have 'negative' thinkings...? Big deal... My MISTAKE.. My APOLOGY... PLS CARRY ONE....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>'Warn' them....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  And just what kinda helpful 'reminder' is that...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Okie... Since I'm in the mood, tell you a 'kiddy story'.....<br><br>There was once this farmer who's AN EXPERT and growing BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS... His garden is just like eden and people would flock in just to have a look at his beautiful flowers each year... With his PATIENCE and EXPERTISE, he nurtured the plants... He was a HAPPY MAN... To him, his plants are just like his CHILDREN....<br><br>Then one day, there was this OLD LADY... She told him... "My.. What beautiful flowers you've got? You water them everyday, fertilizer them, weed them, care for them... Just to watch them DIE one day....?"<br><br>The farmer gave that some serious thoughts.. For days he was troubled over it... He thought the old lady was RIGHT... No matter how he care for his flowers, he's just creating them so that they would be 'destroyed'... He felt SAD SUDDENLY.... His flowers just wiltered off and he've decided not to plant any more of them... The garden was closed down and people can no longer see the once beautiful place... No longer smile as bright as the flowers can bring them...<br><br><strong>And the MORAL of this 'kiddy story'?</strong> Life is to END, there's no stopping it... Just like some relationships would.. In one way or another... Just because it's not gonna be 'forever'... Just because there's gonna be hurt in the end... We shouldn't just deprive ourselves of the 'happiness' that might come with it.... The next time (or think of your previous time, though it's relatively harder) if you have a failed relationship... Try to change your perception of it...? Don't just focus on how BADLY it ENDED... The PROCESS... The HAPPINESS... The MOMENTS together... You shouldn't just pretend that it all didn't happen...? In life, nothing's free.... Just because it has to end doesn't mean that you should stop LIVING and EXPERIENCING altogether....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
