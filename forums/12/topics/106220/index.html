You learn from the negative and positive experiences. CCA is meant to be enjoyed . Why deprive yourself of a life experience , on account of politics. Politics happen everywhere , work school family etc. Be a piece of wall paper when there are hostilies - keep under the radar . It is a learning experience - see who the backstabbers are , see how they behave etc. When you enter working life , it will teach you well to survive in hostile environments.<br><br>When two people are arguing , just leave them and join the others who are not. If one side wants to drag you in, politely find an excuse and say you have to go somewhere (toilet is the best reason) . My frequent excuses are " I cannot really say much since I don't know the sides of the stories too well.  I prefer not to know , too. Excuse me ,I have to use the loo".   Then I stroll to the people who are mixing about happily (after walking to the loo). It works for me in my workplace.  So far , people have not complaint much about me and I like what I do. I just act as a spectator of their hostilities towards each other as a show and tell.<br><br></div>

Well , you will soon know who your real friends are. Your real friends will stand by you and believe what you say. The fairweather ones are those who help spread the rumours  and gossip.<br><br>If you overhear it yourself, just go up to the idle gossiper (find out who the gossip is)  and say :<br><br>"Excuse me , you got the story wrong. You were not there and you have absolutely no right to say anything at all. I was there and I can tell you this is not how it happened. "<br><br>or<br><br>" Congratulations . I think you have a great potential for being the world best fairy tale writer . I am sorry to disappoint you - that despite all the exaggeration you have done - it is not how it happened"<br><br>or<br><br>" If you wish to spread the rumours about me- I appreciate it if you could say it to my face in front of everybody. "<br><br>I think the 3rd one is better - just keep smiling (even if you want to wring the neck of the miserable wench) when you say it to him/her. It is fun - my colleagues can't stand it when I say it with a smile . They buay tahan when I suan them .<br><br>However I need to caution you - it may work for adults but not for kids. You can also choose to ignore it - rumours take time to die down and everyone forgets about it.  Sometimes an ignorant man is a blissful man.<br><br>Stay under the radar next time. If you need to mete out punishment - just tell them LOUDLY what they did wrong and then mete it out. An OPEN explanation is always good for clarification.<br><br></div>
