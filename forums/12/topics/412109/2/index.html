              <p>The teacher refer the student to the <span>HOD</span> and the student got punishment while the teacher carry on calling
              the class name ..</p>

              teach is animal, does that make him more human ?</p>
              <p>I wanted to complain to the principle but my son is afraid of
              victimisation.</p>
              <p>I just saw his compo this morning and he was writing about
              stress in school. I know he is very stressed up as he is wetting
              the bed almost every night. Yes, he wet the bed when he is
              stressed. Exam around the corner, I do not know how I can help him

              <p>the behaviour of school kids nowadays are horrible compared to that of 20 yrs ago, or even 10 yrs ago.</p>
              <p>in the past, students are aware that its was at their own risk if they were caught talking in class. etc, the sort of minor disciplinary issues.</p>
              <p>today, kids, esp those of primary school age find nothing wrong with running about, fighting and playing with their psp etc during lesson, while the teacher is teaching.</p>
              <p>You can threaten to speak to their parents but rest be assured that they do not care, since thier parents will inevitably end up speaking for their children, condoning their child's misbehaviour.</p>
              <p>spare the rod and spoil the child.</p>
              <p>i find that the root cause of this misbehaviour is the growing power of children, attributed to the lack of discipline imposed by their parents.</p>
              <p>our parents grew up in a stern schooling environment, where schooling is a privilege, and any misbehaviour is rewarded with caning and scolding from both parents and teachers. teachers then are perceived to be the acting moral-guardian when the parents are not around. they are a figure of authority in the community then.</p>
              <p>whereas, parents nowadays go with the western approach that it is better to instil discipline through logic and understanding, rather than caning and punishment.I feel that it has eroded the image of teachers as a stern and authorative figure. And parents are not doing themselves or to their children a service by turning a blind eye to this.</p>
