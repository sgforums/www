              My son's teacher called the class " animal" and call one student " a dog ".  This student tell the teacher, " I bark,you moo "..

              I wanted to complain to the principle but my son is afraid of victimisation.
              
              I just saw his compo this morning and he was writing about stress in school.  I know he is very stressed up as he is wetting the bed almost every night.  Yes, he wet the bed when he is stressed.  Exam around the corner, I do not know how I can help him ..

              <p>If this teacher continues behaving like this, you'll have to report him/her to the school.</p>
              <p>Tell you son to inform you if the teacher continues to verbally abuse the class.</p>
              <p>Don't worry, I'm sure the school will take action if you report this to them. If they don't, then write up a formal letter with all the neccessary details, send it to the school and CC it to MOE. They'll see that you're serious about this and take action.</p>
              <p>Also, you can help to relieve your son's stress by reassuring him that you'll take care of it and he won't be implicated.</p>

              <p>well to be fair to the teachers these days, i think kids are indeed animals. Can't follow instructions, can't focus in class, talk back, don't do homework, come into class late, play truant etc.</p>
              <p>Not all schools of course. I do believe angelic students still exist.</p>

              Not that I don't agree that kid are sometime hyper active and can be a nuisance but why call all in the class. Not all kid are naughty!  When you take teaching as a career you know this will come. If cannot take the heat, get out if the kitchen. You can't blame other for your lack of commitment and patience. 
              
              The school is in Sengkang area and sound like the male private part in hokkien. I am waiting for the exam to be over before taking action. I had wanted to talk to the teacher but my son stopped me. He is quite a timid fellow and so i did not proceed. 
              
              I taught at CC for children on origami. I met worst children. They run about, scream and take your prized collection and damaged it. I lost my cool but never called them animal or scold them. I just stopped teaching at the end of the contract. So if the teacher cannot take the heat, shouldn't he or she just do a Carreras switch instead?

              <p>Ya when kids misbehave it's understandable, but when adults (especially teachers) misbehave, then there is no excuse.</p>
              <p>And in my opinion, it's still best to inform the school/principal. Especially since your kid is reacting so badly to this treatment.</p>

              <p><br>Shouldnt the teacher call up the parents and informing the parents about their kid behaviour? Let the parents know the consequences first before taking any action by the descipline master. Dont take matters by yourself.</p>

              <p>Nowadays, the parents have this mindset that it is never their child's fault. It must be something or somebody that trigger their child to misbehave. There was a parent who told me just let her child did whatever he liked. I gave up on those students and concentrate on other students who seriously willing to learn. If these students and their parents are not going to help themselves, what can the teachers do ? Anyway, I'm not teaching now but I have friends who are teachers. It is not easy to be a teacher.</p>

              By aLl mean punish the naughty one. But why brand the whole class. Also he call one of the student dog and the boy reacted. He refer him to the HOD and the boy got punished. Is this the way the system goes?

              <p>Dont expect all teachers have their students very bright, intelligent, smart, and not naughty type. What is teachers for? They are here to teach the weak, groom the naughty students and make sure they are good in future.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For TS, it is better to let your kid concentrate on the exam first. After exam, approach the principal or better still, talk to other parents about this issues and then comes up with a solution.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>After exam, I am sure your kid will not be in that teacher class anymore. Right?</p>
