            <div class='col-md body'>TS: At the end of it, its up to you to decide whether to have a good talk with her or not. This is just parts and parcel of life. If you got sometihing which you dun like and it sounds logical, voice it out. If she blow up, it shows that she is not ready. Ready as in mentality.<br><br>For your case, you should voice it out. If she understand, its ok. But if she dun, its time to seek alternatives.<br><br>I am also in quite similar scenario as you but lucky for me, she understand and accept. She hopes to see me everyday in the past but now, she understand that I need to work, OT sometimes , fly overseas sometimes and also time for me to spend with my family and friends.<br><br>If she really likes you, she should be ready to understand and accept the things. Especially things which is logical, for eg. in your situation is time.<br>If she dun understand, sad to say, its call b1tching behaviour. You are a human who needs freedom, not a prisoner or a bird lock in a cage.<br><br>In my case, it turns out that she loves me more and wait dearly for me. In this way, it also builds up the feeling for each other. But this does not apply to everyone cos there are some I know, broke off because of this thing call 'time".<br><br>Tell her this:<br>Now no need to see everyday, in future if we married and live together you will see me everyday untill sian ar...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br></div>

It's really tiring doing it everyday.<br><br>Even when I want to OT, she will be very very unhappy.. when i'm together with her sometime, office calls me, she will also be angry with me.<br><br>Basically she's afraid of doing anything herself, wants people to accompany her.

Hmm... Come to think of it, it has already been a year since she had been behaving this way all these while...? And exactly what were you doing back then...? Giving in to her....? Honeymoon period...? Mmm... Is she a Leo..?<br><br>Understand that even if you don't (don't wanna?) burst her 'idealist love' for now, tension would probably just build up with time and there'll no saying where this relationship of yours would be banging the wall in the future to come... So it's really a 'take risk now' or 'bang its head' later situation...?<br><br>And note that you're also quite responsible for letting this 'evil' grow within your relationship... Try to let her understand that it's really for the good of this relationship.. Is she is not receptive, then I can only say 'good luck' to whatever you've done so far...? May be quarrels and such... But you should always try little by little to make her understand as far as you're really concerned for the relationship..?<br><br>How old are the both of you by the way?</div>
