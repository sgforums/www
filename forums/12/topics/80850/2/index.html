            <div class='col-md body'>It is not the credit card but how one uses it. I have about 4-6 credit cards. But I make it a point to pay my bills every month.<br><br>I never owe... You could be tempted to spend more when you have a credit card. But I find that as long as one can control can already.<br><br>Why I have so many cards? I can accumulate the points and also got a lot of discounts and freebies! Credit card companies will hate me, they want their customers to roll over their balances and not pay every month.<br><br>As for what runnie propose, assuming that you save $150 by charging the $150 to the credit card what is the point. The interest on the credit card balance is 24% per year which is the max legal interest limit in singapore (if charge beyong 24% considered loan sharking). So in the end you are worst off. You mentioned that you had other loans to pay off, what are those loans?<br><br>It is difficult to earn another dollar more (because salary is fixed) but to save another dollar is much easilier..... remember a dollar saved is a dollar earned. This sound old-fashioned but it is true. Also do not borrow to consume, it is the road to financial ruin.<br><br></div>

In other words, spend within your reasonable means... Only maintaining at that would you hold the 'mutual relationship' with them... But in case you can't?

Impulsive buying... Sometimes based on a 'belief' that you would be able to use 'advance money' to pay up 1st using your future earning... If that picture falls out, could mean hell to you... Other times based on a 'delusion' that you're just spending your own money... Like most others have said, it's just a vicious cycle...</div>

I think I don't have to point out much too? $300 and no savings...? At least you're not a dead fish? Once you're dead, you're DEAD..... Go around and ask people who are or had been in serious DEBTS with credit cards or financial supports before... They'll tell you... But at least some of them are with better reasons? Your 'plan'...?
