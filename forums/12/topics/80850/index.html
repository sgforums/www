            <div class='col-md body'>after settling my Uni study loan and some other loan every month, i'm down to about $300plus from my salary. and this excludes daily expenditure like meals, etc etc...<br><br>let's face it, $300plus per month for expenditure is just sufficient. but my question here is, how do i still save up every month?<br><br>just in case you start saying i can save about $100 from the $300 if i cut down a bit, i just want to point out that, NO, it's not possible.<br><br>SO, i was thinking: Apply credit card so that i can charge my expenditure to it, pay the monthly minimum (of about $50-$80), so that i can have a bit of savings.<br>Savings = $300 i'm left with every month - credit card min. monthly repayment.<br><br>this sounds stupid, i guess, but i really need to save up. i feel it's better than using up all the $300 i have left with at the end of the month and realised at the end of it i've no savings, and this stupid cycle will go on every single month, right?<br><br>and as long as i don't touch my savings, the amount of savings that i have will be equal to the credit i've owe the bank as long as i don't over abuse my credit card, right? so just in case anything happens, i can just use my savings to repay all the credit card loan, right?<br><br>so many questions here and please, i need proper answers. scold me of being stupid, but do tell me where i've gone wrong...<br><br>Last question, is this the lifestyle people in singapore are having, or am i the only few who's going into a credit card debt?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>This is never a good idea... unless u can clear of all the payments within the month so as not to incur any interest...<br><br>With your idea, Let say u charge $300 to the CC every month, and u pay min $50 every month. This leaves $250 subjected to interest. Normally the first year u dont have to pay for the card, but after that, holding this card is another cost to ur $300 excess... Let say the interest is 5%, your will need to pay an additional amount of $150 by the end of a year. Do u think this is a good solution???</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>and for using credit cards, some places charge a few dollars more.. this is to cover the administrative cost for using credit card..  It might seem insignificant, but 10 times of $2 is 20, and $20 out of $300 per month is something.. Besides the the $20 can be put into better use than be sucked up by the banks.. can have 5 more plates of cha kway tiao.</div>
