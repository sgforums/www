            <div class='col-md body'>You have 3 options.<br><br>1. Try your best to make friends with the existing people in your school. If you are sincere and nice enough, there's no reason why people wouldn't want to befriend you. And if you're desperate enough to want friends, then do what it takes to get them.<br><br>If you are intending to work after poly..<br><br>2. Quit your course. Do a course you love NOW. even though you've already wasted 4 sems, at the end of the day you are getting a diploma and will WORK in the relevant industry of the diploma. If you are not interested, better quit now and do something you really like. Time is not an issue. You have the rest of your life and we all make mistakes. What's important is to live a life with no regrets.<br><br>If you are going uni...<br><br>3. Finish the course and just get the diploma. When you have the diploma and intend to move on to Uni, you can apply for a range of courses at SIM. And by then, you can choose something you love. It's just 2 more sems to go...<br><br>You have one life, just live it to the fullest and have no regrets. Waking up everyday to dread life is just not the way it should be. So act upon it, cos u have the power to change your circumstance.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi shadez,<br><br>I don't exactly know how poly life is like cos I'm in a JC, but I can relate to you when u say have little/no friends. Albeit I was from a JC and had a class, it was like there wasn't a class cos the ppl were all over the place. I was essentially alone for many periods of my JC edu and I agree wit you when u say it sucks.<br><br>Have you tried taking up a hobby, like a sport? I personally took up running as a sport, and frankly, it helped a bit. For one, you don't need a friend to run.<br><br>One thing I don't understand though, you have a gf what. isn't that good?</div>
