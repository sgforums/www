            <div class='col-md body'>The problem is that you have nothing to look forward to in life! There must be a balance. If you have things to look forward to, then you will be able to cope with the downsides of life.<br><br>You do not mind going to work even if it is a torture, if you know that you will have a wild time over the weekend.<br><br>If you have nothing to look forward to then the torture of work will be a serious torture because the torture is all you have!<br><br>How can anyone, not just you, live life that way? A long lasting continuous no ending torture?<br><br>You see your friends enjoying life at school and you assume that they do not find it a torture. You think that they do not find it a torture because it is fun for them.<br><br>Think again. That might not be true! The real reason might be that they can cope and because they can cope, they are able to have some fun within the torture.<br><br>That is to say, they have many things, outside of school to look forward to and so they can cope with the torture of school better and because they can cope with the torture of school better, they start to enjoy it!<br><br>So, I think that you cannot solve your problem because you are looking for the wrong solution! You are trying to make a torturous situation acceptable by trying to make school less of a torture, you will fail!<br><br>It will always be a torture. You cannot do anything about that!<br><br>What you can do, however is to find things that you enjoy to do. You can organize, plan, look forward to doing things that you enjoy doing and just clench your teeth and do the necessary to finish school and pass.<br><br>If you do not solve this problem, you will have problems next time when you start working. When you find it tough going, you resign. If you do that, you will not be able to put in enough years to gain the necessary experience.<br><br>Whereas, if you are able to "compensate" by finding things to look forward to, your life will be more meaningful and you will be able to cope with the torture of school and next time, work, better.</div>

What do u want to do down the road??<br><br>Can you united with repeated students and form a study group? Do you have friends who have graduated and possibly borrowing those tutorial solution from them? It is possible to know new friends from your current class during lesson time... since you also be doing some project works with them.<br><br>Your second social avenue: can be through cca.... don't know how political things can get but then everywhere also have politics. Knowing more people couldn't hurt..<br><br>And study hard for your exam and clear all the modules!!! Don't waste your life in poly anymore... jiayou jiayou!!!</div>

Firstly, the course i'm currently studying, i have totally no interest in it. Secondly, i don't even have a class in poly as i'm repeating my modules. So most of the time, i'm attending lessons alone or at most, with 2 or 3 other repeat students.<br><br>Just imagine poly life without any classmates or friends. It's difficult as it is that i'm struggling through my course, but having no friends or classmates whatsoever does not help. And i only have classes on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday so most of my time is spent doing nothing.<br><br>Sometimes i just wish i had a class to go to in school and talk and laugh together and study together. And maybe have classes everyday studying something i enjoy. I'm currently 4 sems into my course so if i transfer now i would have to waste more years.<br><br>It seems like my life doesn't have any aim now and i get jealous of my girlfriend whenever i see her enjoying herself at school. You know, your mind tends to wander when you're not doing anything so i have had a fair share of arguments with my girlfriend.<br><br>I'm currently studying in a course that requires lots of programming and it is so technical. I'm personally more of a art person so imagine being stuck in a technical course.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I really don't know what to do with my life at this point.

ITS ALMOST LIKE YOU'RE ME WTF. at least you're better than me, i failed my modules in a course i have no interest in and whats more, im in a class of year 1s when im a year 2 student.. indeed programming sucks. i vow never to touch that ever in my life again. Maybe u could tell your gf how u feel. and of course just do ur best and get that diploma. even if u just scrap through its still a diploma. just do your best..</div>
