With zero kind of requirement they are looking for - anyone would fill the bill - decent looking, decent character, etc. Everyone only need to feel comfortable with each other, overflowing emotions, someone made the move, both agreed, a relation formed <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Ask what are the physical and characteristic you are LOOKING for in a person - nearly 70% will tell you either don't know or anything is general.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Drama mode on:<br><br>'I want a caring guy'<br><br>'Yeah I know you looking for a guy that is caring, about 0.2 millions brother Joes in SG fits the role. Take your pick.'<br><br>People dunno what they want... so they are the ones who cannot differentiate platonic friendship from a potential - because anyone *SEEMED* to fit the bill. People end up going through series of relations, each relation gone and they learned. With time, people will finally find and settle with this one person - from fallen dreams, reality, lesson learned, etc - the partner that would walk down the path of life with you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Used to have one and we confided in each other last time. Quite long ago already man. But, I started to avoid her when I knew that something was wrong, in me of course. Some feelings grew after a period of time.<br><br>Told her about it after given much thoughts and I anticipated her answer. From then on, the friendship kind of faded. Till now, she will always still say 'Hi', but I just can't talk to her like how we did in the past.<br><br>Guess there is this 'something' in me yar... shrugs.</div>
