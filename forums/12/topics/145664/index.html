            <div class='col-md body'>A little update on my current situation involving my ex now....<br><br>It now seems that her good friend is acting as a middle person between us. I did not trust her initially because she kept on giving me attitude whenever we were conversing with each other. As time flew by , I found out that she was okay and it was natural of her to give that kinda "bimbo-ish" attitude.<br>I have this male friend who strongly dislikes her because he feels that she might be toying with my feelings by giving me false hopes. Anyways , she is the only remaining communcation line available that stands between me and my ex.<br><br>Basically my ex birthday is in 2 weeks time and she wants me to buy a present for her. The thing is , she told me that my ex wants accessories , makeup , perfume , pencil box and a bag for her birthday. Obviously my initial reaction to her was ,"eh you think I print money ah?" and so i dismissed it as something from her own personal opinion and besides my ex was never the kind of girl who would be interested in fashion accesories , let alone even go shopping.<br><br>Today she somehow managed to convince me that my ex really wanted these things for her birthday. My ex already knows that she is passing information to me about her but chooses to keep quiet about it. I know I can't buy all those stuff for her.<br><br>So here comes my first question......<br><br>1) Out of the <strong>fashion accessories , cosmetic set , perfume , pencil box and bag</strong> , pick the 2 most appropriate items which would be most meaningful<br><br>The next thing is she wants me to pass the present to her in a meaningful way. She suggested converting this lounge which we have been frequenting into the main setting ground , dim the lights , close all curtains and give that "romantic setting" even though if it happens in the afternoon. But come to think of it , I can assure myself that the minute I see her face when she enters the lounge , I would most probably freak out. I mean , it's been 3 months since I last saw her and I know a lot of things can happen in 3 months and so I'm not sure what the possible outcome of it might be.<br><br>I was thinking of doing mimicking the show "50 first dates" method. If you've watched the show , I'll do up an informal powerpoint presentation on my notebook and leave it beside her present in the lounge. So it will be like , "It's been 3 months since we last met , here's what you've been missing since the day I last saw you....CLICK HERE TO VIEW" then at the end of it , I'll say , "I'll be waiting for you at this particular place as at XXXXhrs." I'll feel more comfortable doing this instead of meeting her face to face in an instant , at least I'm more prepared this way....<br><br>So my second question would be spilt into 2 components....<br><br>2a) Do you think it is a good idea to do this considering the fact that I've never done something for her on a large scale before and I guess this kinda stuffs are reserved for matured adults eh? How would a girl view this scenario as? Hot or flop?<br><br>2b) Any further suggestions?<br><br>I'm thinking of setting aside $100 for her birthday "expenses" which includes her present as well....<br><br>Oh yeah , she also wants me to record myself singing the happy birthday song to her. I'm thinking of doing a piano accompaniment to it. So that means I'll be playing and singing at the same time. I do hope my Creative Muvo mp3 player is able to "balance out" the sounds.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Or what about the guitar?

Run!"<br><br>Apologies for not answering your first question. I don't know your girlfriend personally, and it seems rather pointless trying to guess what she would like <span style="font-style: italic;">and</span> would find meaningful. However, if what your mutual friend said was true, your ex-girlfriend does sound rather "high maintenance", so you might want to work from there.<br><br>2a) May not be the right person to answer this question either. While the question of what she would do upon receiving your presents is important, the more important question is what <span style="font-style: italic;">you</span> would do if things didn't go your way. Are you mentally prepared to accept a flop after all that you've done? Or would you like to adjust your expectations and scale your plan according to those expectations?<br><br>2b) "Run, Forrest! Run!"?<br><br>Whatever your decision is, and however your plan turns out, good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Rammstein619,<br><br>1. Once I break up with an ex, it's over.  Until sufficient time has passed for both of us to move on, I won't accept any gifts for fear that it gives him false hope.  Later on, if we remain friends, I'll accept <span style="text-decoration: underline;">non-personal things from a friend</span>.  I hope you understand what I'm driving at.<br><br>2. If that ex wants to get me a gift, then it should be what he wants to give me as a friend, there's No reason for me to specify to him what I want.  An ex, is still a human being, Not an ATM machine.<br><br>3. If I wanna catch up with an ex who's decided to remain friends with me, there's No need for romantic settings.  We can just go for coffee, or dinner.  Unless I've specifically told my ex there's a chance for us to patch things up, then No point leading him on, telling him to do this &amp; do that for me.  Love &amp; relationships are NOT a game.<br><br>Moral of the story?  Please think carefully, dear boy.  I'm a woman, &amp; here I am, Not even defending someone of the same gender.  Girls/women usually know what other girls/women think.  Been there, seen that, may/may Not have done that, but definitely experienced that in some way or other.  There're plenty of fishies in the sea, cliche, but true.  Why set your heart on a girl who doesn't deserve you?<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by rammstein619:<br><strong>A little update on my current situation involving my ex now....<br><br>It now seems that her good friend is acting as a middle person between us.
