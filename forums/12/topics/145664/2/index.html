            <div class='col-md body'>I suggest that you do something for her instead of buying things for her.<br>Like a pic album of the times you were together, to remind her of the fun and laughter both of you once had.<br><br>using this method will test whether she is playing with you or she is really wants to patch back with you.<br><br>Buy a simple cake, find a place for a nice dinner and then give her the pic album.<br>If she dumps or quickly just flip through the pic album it shows that she no longer loves you. If she still treasure your love she will looked at each page carefully with tears in your eyes.<br><br>Is up to u to decide whether is worth to go after her again or not but I hope that you will be able to accept the fact she may reject you again. Once you are prepare for the worst, then is time for you to face her once again.</div>
