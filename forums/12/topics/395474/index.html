              Recently somewhere beginning of this year, I had a discussion with a Malaysian friend. I had asked this Malaysian friend of mine about the high cost of living and cheap labour in Singapore and what he thought of it. I asked him, "High cost of living and cheap labour in Singapore. What is that? The first word that came out from him was, "Slavery!". This person is currently the Head of Logistics department with a world known and very well established MNC organization in Malaysia. I was sort of shocked at first to hear that from him and then I began to think.....he is correct to say that and I was actually agreeing to his statement.
              
              What do you think?
              
              Thanks.

              <p>Hello Everyone.</p>
              <p>Hmmm...so far we have four people responding to this topic. Thanks for responding to the topic. What I see and read so far from this topic is about Singaporeans alone are being seen like "Slaves". You have to look at it across the board. How about the foreign workers in Singapore? Are they not also being employed and work like "Slaves" too?</p>

              <p>Good Morning All!</p>
              <p>Ah...we have a new response from Soul_Rage....Welcome to the forum Soul_Rage. In your analogy about foreign workers and Singaporean workers, yes...I agree with you too and not only foreign workers can exit from Singapore but Singaporeans too can exit from the cage if they wanted too for instant, to Johor Baru, Malaysia....the nearest and closest neighbouring country for them to have a good life while working in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Thanks for the response Soul_Rage and Dondontan....hmmm..your laughing is very contagious you know. I wonder if Members of Parliament will laugh like you if the opposition party members speak like Soul_Rage in the Parliament.</p>
              <p>I will come back again soon enough to meet you guys....in the meantime, I will get ready to go to work.</p>
              <p>Have a nice day guys.</p>
