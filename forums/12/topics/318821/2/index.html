              <p>When a party wants to end a r'ship, any (all) kinds of reasons &amp; excuses wll surfice, jus so one cld end tis r'ship as swift as possible.</p>
              <p>I had a fren who had similiar experience as u, muffincakes..Her case was no better, at least u dun live together..She lived at her boyfren's home (for she is a foreigner) &amp; they were abt to get married until the guy had a change of mind..the rest is history.  She was suicidal then..but still, she has to learn to stand on her 2 feet - with the help of frenz &amp; relatives of cos. &amp; im pleased &amp; proud to say tat tis fren of mine is doin great being independent now. ^-^</p>
              <p>Of cos, it sux to know tat breakups always happen ard exams corner (cant explain y either), &amp; make it hard for the other party to focus on the comin exams.  It kindda needs motivation + determinations to be able to do tat well.  But Im sure once u think it thru, u can focus on ur exams.  Not worth it havin to retake ur exams over someone who doesnt love u anymore.  Think it over &amp; make it fast, so tat u can focus on ur exams.</p>
              <p>Best of luck.  ^-^v</p>

              <p>my boyfriend broke up with me after 5 years. he said that he has been taking care of me and pleasing me for 5 years that he does not know himself anymore and want his space and time.</p>
              <p>he said he don't love me anymore, and want me to just leave him alone. he said he wanna do stuff without anyone stopping him or controlling him. he said i talked too much about the future and he's scared of it. he said i pressured him too much, planned for him too much. he said he doesn't think that he loves me anymore.</p>
              <p>so for 3 days after that dreadful day, i smsed him, called him, met him to beg him to not do this and that we could work things out. yet he still do not want to change his mind. finally, i stopped.</p>
              <p>now, i just do not know what to do. i mean, 5 years gone like that? isn't that crap? i asked him how long does he need, and he said he don't know and don't wish to give me hope.</p>
              <p>should i just like get over him? or wait? when i do get to speak to him, he has this anger over something i do not know. and now it seems i also lost a friend in him.</p>
              <p>i tried to do other stuff, go out with friends. but the truth is, i do not know many people, because during that 5 years, i didn't really like try to keep in contact with them all. and the friends i'm close with are leading their lives, with their bf/gf, working.</p>
              <p>i'm still studying and the worst part is i'm having my exams now. so basically, i'm at home, supposedly self studying, when actually i'm just staring into space and thinking about him.</p>
              <p>and it doesn't help that he lives like 10 blocks away from me and sometimes, i would just go down and like sit under his block, wishing i could just get a glimpse of him, like a freaking stalker.</p>
              <p>what should i do? whats wrong with me?</p>

              <p>There are always many reasons behind a break up. It isn't one or two things that lead to the split. Rather than pointing fingers or figuring out the cause of the break up and worrying what will come next into your life, do the first thing first. Place your importance on your exams first. You don't have much energy to spend on now.</p>
