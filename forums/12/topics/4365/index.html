Ask urself first, who u actually luv more, then if u find that ur current bf cannot fit the bill, u hav no choice but to break up with him.

            <div class='col-md body'>1st of all, please differentiate between 'Love' and 'like'.... If you like a certain type of guy (may it be looks or style..), it DOESN'T mean that you'll love or you have to be in love with this type of person... How about knowing that person as a friend for a starter..?<br>In life, it doesn't really matter where you head for but more like which route you choose to walk and what you want...? Because everybody ends up at the same destination at the END of it.....<br>Ask yourself this question.... "Are you prepared to GIVE UNRESERVINGLY for LOVE and willing to get NOTHING in return" (and even experience PAIN in return...) OR are you more like looking for the fruit of LOVE...? Be TRUTHFUL to yourself....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> For this CAN be a VERY TRICKY question....<br>Are you made for YOURSELF, or are you MADE for ONE...? And.... How long was it since the last time that you've decided to have a little change in your life....? My PERSONAL point...? Make yourself a little comfortable with life and things... For if it's HELL you decided to stay in.... You would have to pretty much LIVEs there for a while....<br>But then again... MAGIC and LOGIC...... Which seems more beautiful...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> I think you get what I mean...? You DECIDE for yourself ok...? Afterall, it's YOUR LIFE... But try to make it simple on this one... Life's always running and full of other goals you know...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>------------------<br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....

From what you've said, you think you'll be happier with the first guy and living with your current is a pain because he cannot talk to you and there's no place to go with him.<br><br>The bad thing is your ex will give you pain because you love him more than he loves you.  The good thing is your current bf loves you more than you love him.  So you get the picture right.  I'm not you.  This is a your  personal choice.<br><br>There may still be hope for your current bf.  Is it because he's not communicating with you?  Or have you not been listening?  Where does the problem lies?  You or him?  Frankly, sometimes couple do not speak to each other much because they can communicate without talking and be happy as long as they are with each other....<br><br>If you don't get this let me know, I'll give you a wake-up call reserved for opinionated people.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Okie, imagination is good but how many can have such good imagination and longing.<br><br>To love and be loved is a completely different thing.  To read books, topics and articles on love does not mean that a person know love.  Just that theoretically the person can explain love better than anyone on earth but experiencing love... the warmth of love, loving someone who's special to you, enjoying her little quirks and mannerism, accepting her for her weird behaviour and bad habits.... and having her loving you and accepting you for what you are, knowing your heart when no words are spoken.  That's the kind of love to experience... Having her disappoint you or You doing something wrong and feeling the pain that she has go through... it's a total life experience that I won't give up for all the knowledge in the world.<br><br>One can read about swimming but in the end the person have to get into the water and start swimming.  That's swimming.  Same with love.  Hmmmm.... beginning to think I'm a sad case, can only rely on my imagination nowadays.... :~</div>

Just one look and a smile and it seems like we have communicated billions of words without speaking.  It has come to point of being so in tune with the other person that one look on his/her face you'll know something is wrong.  I don't know about others but I do feel this way.  Communication is only 7% verbal, the rest of the 97% is mostly body language, body signs and expressions.  Heehee...  :p<br><br></div>
