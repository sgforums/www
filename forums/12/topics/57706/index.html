            <div class='col-md body'>Dear tutors, please be careful if you are looking for any assignments from any tuition agency.  For your information, anybody can call themselves a tuition agency. Most of these "agencies" are not registered. Some are actually "co-ordinators" whom they paid a sum to an agency in order to be one.<br><br>Please remember to keep the number, name and address of these agencies who hand assignments to you. 1 such "agency" is actually located in a factory in Toa Payoh. They require you to go down and they will ask you to sign an agreement on the spot.  The agreement is actually a photocopy of some paper with very small words. Such agencies are inhumane to their "employees". This agency did not know the exact location of the address of the tutee and lied about it. Most of the tutors would prefer to teach in places nearer to home, so upon knowing it and rejecting the assignment, the tutor would be asked to pay the full amount. or a lawyer's letter would be sent. I would suggest contacting the "lawyer", if they ever have one.<br><br>Another agency with the name of Bowen, located at No. 10 Prince Rd, #01-54, (133849), somewhere near Bukit Timah. The administrative staff apparently did not know how to explain in layman's term on how to get there. This agency did not have any agreement with the tutor how the money will be paid and it did not bother to inform the tutor of termination of assignment. Many tutors would have experience the same plight of refused entry upon arrival at the tutee's home. The agency had already collected the money for the first lesson from the parent and refuses to split with the tutor. Which means, they would have collected the money on your 1st month by the forth lesson. If the parent decided not to continue after the 4th lesson then the tutor would not be paid at all. They collected amount is $16.25 to be exact and  they claim they paid $10 to the dispatch rider and had no money left. Can someone suggest a better excuse for this agency?<br><br>For those with tution experience, they would know that the first month payment is 50%-50% for most agencies. If there is no verbal agreement, then logically how should the money be paid? When contacted, the adminstrative staff just push the blame to her "collegue". When questioned about the credibility and if the "agency" is registered under Singapore law, the staff apparently hang up. How can an agency be credible and responsible if the staff did not understand simple English and avoided simple questions like this?<br><br>From a point above, I mentioned that some of these people are actually co-ordinators. While the agency take half the first month pay from you, these co-ordinators have to pay to some agencies in order to be a co-ordinator. A rational co-ordinator would of course collect the money first before telling you the termination of an assignment so that they can get the money before you do.  So they would claim "it's your problem with the parent" while the parents would claim "it's your problem between you and the agency". Where and who can the tutors turn to?<br><br>I hereby would like to urge students giving tuition and had bad experience to speak up. Do not fell shy as many people had the same experience. Many of us would blame it on luck and think it's just a small amount we lost, but there are definately more than 1 person cheated and there are not just 1 agency around. It could be you or your friend or your relatives being cheated next. Be a dear and send this out to your friends. Feel free to contact me or post messages. Thank you. Have a nice day!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>
