              <p>Of course I would be angry, especially if he tries to avoid contact with me when I try to get it back. But what's the point of going to the police? The chance of getting back the items is slim, and since you're willing to lend him a few hundreds buck plus a PSP, I assume he must be quite close to you. Do you want to lose a close friend just because of such an issue which may turn out to be a misunderstanding in the end? Not only that, you will waste lots of time trying to cooperate with the police and they may take weeks and months busy shaking their legs in their office for all you know.</p>
              <p>On the other hand, if you just knock on his door and ask him for an explaination, I'm sure things would be much simpler for both you and him. Maybe he had his reasons for avoiding you, or he was simply not around when you called him. At worst, he had sold the PSP because he had desperate needs for the money then. You can always work out a plan with him to pay you back by installments. This way, you get to keep a close friend while getting back your stuff.</p>
              <p>Nothing is impossible. You just need to listen to him and let him listen to you. Communication is the key.</p>

              <p>Firstly accept the fact that your money is gone. Try to get the psp back, and hopefuly the money too.</p>
              <p>There is nothing much you can do, except keep on reminding him. Do not be enemies with him, otherwise confirm all liau. If he keeps avoiding you, let him, just keep on reminding him to return you money and psp, when ever you see him. Be prepared to keep this up for years. This is a disgraceful thing for him, don't let him forget. Make him regret borrowing from you. Thats all you can do. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>
