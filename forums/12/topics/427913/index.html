              <p>I got problem preventing myself from developing feelings for a girl. Every time I got close to a girl, chat and sms very often, I would end up having feelings for her. My love was never return and I end up being heartbroken.</p>
              <p>Now I know this gal whom same age as me. We are both 30. We both got gd chemistry. We chatted about everything and anything. Can talk for hours. Even share our problems.</p>
              <p>I know her from an online chat and she wanna meet me one day. We have each other's FB so already see the pics. She admit she like chatting with me. She says Ive been a very good listener and she listens to my problems well too. She even knows my secrets.</p>
              <p>So far she is very respectable and she is a teacher. But I worried about having feelings for her. She told me I can sms her everyday anytime. But I refrain from doing so cuz that way Im sure end up falling for her.</p>
              <p>If I develop feelings for her, Im heading for another pain of rejection and heartbreak. No way she will like me or accept me. She earn like 3 times more than me since she is a teacher and plus she has Masters Hons. Me only N levels. Of course she wont consider me.</p>
              <p>How do I keep my feelings for her strictly platonic? I thought minimising my contact with her may help but if I do that, she may get upset.</p>

              <p>The brain sometimes do not follow instructions.</p>
              <p>Like "Do not think of the girl"</p>
              <p>The first thing the brain does is form a picture of the very girl you are not suppose to think of.</p>
              <p>So when you say do not fall for her, you brain is imagining you falling for her. If you imagine often enough, you will fall for her.</p>
              <p>So cut the platonic relationship crap. And just keep it at a conversational level. I believe she is aware of your status. If she want someone with N levels and earn three times less, thats her wish.</p>
              <p>Stop thinking of what you don't want, and just go on as per normal. And when she makes her move for you, quickly tell us.</p>

              <p><br>No, most PRC gals are frankly speaking much more beautiful then sg gals, like me, a taiwanese, PRC gals are more white, tall and slim..with good big shape at the right places, they also hv a good routine of diet, the only different is the character, PRC gals got no manner, like to behave like man, shout and demand here and there, but not all of them, some are real good, quiet, faithful and very pretty, Singapore U grad guy dun mind getting such gal.</p>
              <p>If you look at your sg girl, by 25yo, most got extra tire on the waist liao, and all like to eat spicy stuff, face discolored with pimples, dots...haiz..no eyes see</p>
