              <p>To ts,</p>
              <p>If you wish to shut yourself out becos of hurt by all means go ahead no one can stop you.</p>
              <p>I too was hurt badly , rejected many times and it was a painfull when I like someone and she rejects me. Its tough and no one says is easy. I have learnt a few lesson on the way and wish to share with you.</p>
              <p>1) Never meet a girl with the expectation that she will love you, You are not a hunk or have lots of money.</p>
              <p>2) Respect a girl wishes, if a gal chose to reject you, accept it like a man and just be friends. You may learnt a lot more by just being friends then lovers. </p>
              <p>3) I rather a girl reject me straight away then rejects me after she had used me and cheated my money.</p>

              <p>DRC&gt; i agree with what you said. I have never hold any grudges against any girls who rejected me. some of them, im glad I never be their bf as they turn out to be something i dont like. the most rejection I got from my friend if 6 years, i still feel the pain after 2 years she reject me but we are still friends and I never hate her for that. just that now i dont keep in touch with her that much as she also back with her ex now. what my friend said is true though its hurts me a lot, we guys gotta have something to impress the girls so that she can brag about you to her friends. from cars, money, condo, status and so on. if not you gotta have that cool personality or play some musical instruments. sadly, i dont possess any of those traits that girls look for so that why I know I dont stand a chance with any girls, let alone this lady teacher im talking about in this thread.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>dragg&gt; i dont know what you're talking about. i only mentioned about this girl who earns like 3 times more than me.</p>
