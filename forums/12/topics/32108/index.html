            <div class='col-md body'>hey dude!<br>i am sure if u can start this u will noe how to continue juz tt u are confused over wats right and wrong since u had asked urself so many qns there.<br><br>Long distance r/s do work but den its minority that it will end up as a marriage u see?<br>she may missed ya as a fren and she may haf treated u as a very good fren who can even juz sleep together even sex i can tell u that. but den nutting is confirmed ... so the next time when u received a call frm her juz boldly ask her if u are her bf.. but den being in sgp and shes in aussie.. theres a tendecy that she can haf another bf... sorry to tell u that.. a difft env will make one change..<br><br>again she maybe juz waiting for u to accept her as a gf so the only way is to ask her directly and dun pin too much hope or else u may fall in the end. if not the next call.. try to express as much as u can and den spend more money to fly over more often which is hard to accomplish. for me personally i will try to find a partner in sgp and den if things change when she comes back to jb or sgp things may take a turn again. its juz my views... dunno if i did any help anyway<br></div>
