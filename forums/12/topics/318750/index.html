              <p>This my first time posting so thk you all for reading this.</p>
              <p>my problem is that i know a girl about 2 year in my cca. we only started  talking each other  during sec2 as she come to school from dsa thus go to the advance group with all the senior while me a newcomer start from the beginner group.the stuff we talk about is all  about schoolwork and only briefly. i that that time also dun give a dam about bgr and laugh at those who have.</p>
              <p>    however recently i find myself dreaming about her and me in a happy family. i find it weirrd and tell my best friend about it he tell me to just forget about it  i heed his advice and forget about it. however i can't . during my last cca session, as m.y.e is comming cca is to step down,i can't help but keep looking at her observing her every action i start talking to her .i find myself in love with her .i use to have her number but lost it and dun dare to ask for it again.so during that period we nvr talk to each other but only say hi when we see each other.</p>
              <p>    i decide to start learning guitar to sing a song to her to express my feeling to her using the song 'hey there delihah' tune but change the lyric after finding out the song true meaning.i also start going to the gym because of her hoping to become stronger and more lean as i am quite fat.most importantly i hope to make myself more attractive to her because of my perception which girl will ever like a fat guy.</p>
              <p> also recently i able to get her number because both she and i are in the cca committee and will be organising the handover ceremony.and during the ceremony i talk to her amd surprisngly we are able to talk about everything  and stick with each other throughout the ceremony b4 she go home while i have to be in charge for the bbq.</p>
              <p>    later that night feeling confident i sms her.then from that time onward we sms each other. i was trying to be careful not to annoy her as i nvr really sms girl one. however the problem is that she alway took very long to reply me one sometime 1 day or i night time sms her she morning then reply. i feel like start calling her but i scare as i nvr done it b4 and also dun noe how to start a topic beside cca and scare annoy her. Now is the june holiday do you think i sholud make use of cca outing and ask her out</p>
              <p>i thk you one more time for reading this hope you all can give me some advice</p>

              <p>firstly, how old are you?</p>
              <p>personally, i think you should just relax and take it easy.</p>
              <p>from your post i guess you are only from secondary school. so why are you so eager to get into a relationship. you think you are going to marry her? you find yourself "dreaming about her and me in a happy family". don't think too much okay.</p>
              <p>so just take it easy. if over time she still takes forever to reply you or you guys are still in the same level of relationship you are in now. then forget it. you will know it in your heart when she likes you. its a kind of feeling that makes you know that its time to ask that special question.</p>

              <p>U talk cock ar? we like sms, and we only reply if we like the guy ok. if not reply for what, the danger of replying is that some sensitive corky guy always make up their own kind of love and emotion when we replied, when actually we are just trying to be polite. So in the end, we better dun reply.</p>

              <p><br>yes, not all gals like me, but most gals will be like me, what the hell u need a stroll in singapore??? here aint got good scenery to stroll about accept the bicycle track down at east coast.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Most of us gals will prefer a nite out at some cosy corner of a pub cum disco, where there are cocktails, live bands, a bit of disco and chit chat follow by a late supper and further chitchat to understand each other more, you need a bright atmosphere to lighten things up, not strolling, the more you stroll and talk, the more problem come out.</p>

              <p><br>LOL! As a guy I agree with angel leh. Wah lan eh, you think very romantic arh, walk walk, park got bugs, mosquito, will sweat and many ah mah ah gong.</p>
              <p>At least go makan at vivocity also can. See see look look shopping or at least a hobby together. What CCA are you in? Band? Like seeing her blow her trumpet? Fat? How Fat? Not that Fat? Need confidence. Too fat? Too bad.</p>

              <p><br>ya lor, there's no stereotype for relationships only stereotype for break ups/rejection. You can't treat every girl the same also, some want this and that others want that and this. Some like to play play spend spend carefree, some want you to have ambition and goals support pillar, family, kids, more family.</p>
