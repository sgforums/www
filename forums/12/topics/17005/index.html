            <div class='col-md body'>Life is somehow <span style="font-style: italic;">SO REALISTIC</span> at this age of the world... May it be that you're a 'materialistic' person, AMIBITIOUS person, a person IN NEED.... MONEY should always pay to a certain extent AT LEAST a minor role in your role... With <strong>CREDIT CARDs</strong> so easily REACHED and <strong>INVESTMENT</strong> opportunities so MANY <span style="font-style: italic;">AVAILABLE</span>.... <strong>BE WARNED</strong>, as I <span style="font-style: italic;">unveil</span>...<br><br>Using of a <strong>CREDIT CARD</strong> can always be such a <span style="font-style: italic;">CONVENIENT</span> thing... <strong>MONEY</strong> just flow SO EASILY... Do YOU have a <span style="font-style: italic;">HABIT</span> of using 'advance credit'? Using your next income as something which you RIGHTFULLY <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">deserves</span></strong> IN ADVANCE? It could do just like <strong>MAGICK</strong>... But might end up MORE like a <strong>CURSE</strong>....With a little annual membership fee and you've the <span style="font-style: italic;">ADVANTAGE</span> of drawing your <span style="font-style: italic;">ADVANCE SALARY</span>... BUT what if you CANNOT afford to pay up IN <span style="font-style: italic;">TIME</span>? Do you actually know your 'finance firm' WELL ENOUGH? Do you KNOW how they charge for <strong>OVERDUE CREDIT</strong>? DO you BOTHER to find out about the <strong>INTEREST RATE</strong> and <strong>PENALTY</strong>? Are you <span style="font-style: italic;">READY</span> for them?<br><br>With <span style="font-style: italic;">'golden opportunities'</span> NOT to be MISSED. Let's talk about <strong>INVESTMENTs</strong>... LONG-TERM? SHORT TERM.... The SHARPEST, <strong>MOST POWERFUL</strong> and MOST EXCITING... Short term investments with FAST $$$ GAIN... OR <span style="font-style: italic;">LOSS</span>? Can you AFFORD to PAY the LOSS..? How about IN TIME? Have you ALLOWED margin for <span style="font-style: italic;">ERROR</span>? What IF things go WRONG? <strong>VERY WRONG</strong>... We've always heard people talking about getting <strong>UNLUCKY</strong> and stepping on SHIT... How about getting UNLUCKY when you've decided to CROSS a <strong>MINEFIELD</strong>? Be WARNED... Be PREAPRED... For the <span style="font-style: italic;">UNPREPARED</span>... No JOKING with you... Many things that you might NOT THINK of or <span style="font-style: italic;">EXPECTED</span> lies ahead of you.... BE WARNED ONCE AGAIN...<br>How about LONG-TERM INVESTMENT? SLOW and EASY... LOW RISK... And perhaps even <span style="font-style: italic;">PROMISE</span> you RETURNs in the TIME to COME... What better way to earn $$$ at this NON-ECOMONICAL time of the world...? BUT. Think about YOUR MONEY. FROZEN. At one of the <strong>MOST CRITICAL POINT</strong> of YOUR LIFE. Would you even hold a <span style="font-style: italic;">CHANCE</span> at that 'return' in the <span style="font-style: italic;">future</span> to come...?<br><br>WHY am I telling you ALL this? Do YOU know? MANY people <strong>JUMP</strong>, KILL themselves, their children together, <strong>MURDER</strong>, ROB..... Because they're IN DEBT... <strong>BE PRE-WARNED</strong>... You can FORGET about getting <span style="font-style: italic;">HELP</span> from the people around you... With their <strong>FINANCE FROZEN</strong>, their legs sinking in DEEP SHIT... This is just HOW <strong>BAD</strong> time is.... In DEALINGs with FINANCE, there're ONLY BLACK and WHITE, LAW, 'RULES' and PLENTY of STRAIGHTFORWARD handlings... It can be <strong>SO CRUEL</strong>.. BLUNT, STRAIGHT with NO RIGHT or WRONG... Just LAW... Don't EVEN THINK about whether it's being <span style="font-style: italic;">FAIR</span> or NOT... <strong>YOU're WARNED</strong>....<br>Think about... Being BUGs (a low form), SLAVES for the <strong>REST of YOUR LIFE</strong>... For that is HOW MANY FINANCIAL FIRM grow STRONG... They <strong>SUCK the BLOOD</strong> out of you... EVEN if you declare <strong><span style="font-style: italic;">BANKRUPT</span></strong>, YOU WORK for the rest of YOUR LIFE for them... YOUR <span style="font-style: italic;">SOUL</span>, YOUR <span style="font-style: italic;">LIFE</span>... GONE... That's <strong>WHY</strong> people <strong>JUMP</strong>... That's WHY people who DON'T turn into <strong>HOSTILE CREATUREs</strong> who hide in a <strong>DARK</strong> corner of the <span style="font-style: italic;">WORLD</span>.....<br>This is a <strong>GENUINE POST</strong>... <strong>BE WARNED....</strong><br><br>------------------<br>In LIGHT I shall FEAR NOT. FOR what I AM is CUT so DEEP inside of ME.<br>I LIVE my FLESH and SOUL ONLY to BLEED for the OTHERS.<br>FEAR ME NOT. FOR I AM YOUR 'MASTER'. GIVE YOU STRENGTH. FOR YOU ARE MY 'ENEMY'.<br>DEVIL PHRASE I<br><br>I have no 'friends' nor 'family'.<br>I hold no past and see not future...<br>These are just samples of illusions....<br>I don't exist, but I shall live ETERNITY.....  DEVIL PHRASE II<br><br>ÃŸe COOL, NOT sÂ¢rrÂ¥....</div>

As the chip emit wave radio to give you exact location in earth, it will be easier for government to manage their people.<br>Additionally, this chip will use one currency... In single currency called "c-bill" u can sell/buy stuff around the world... and this is one of the way they solve the world economic crisis: by using single currency(C-Bill), single religion(???), single government (UNO?

            <div class='col-md body'>About your first post (about slave-slave thing)...<br><br>well ... you cannot resist human nature ...<br><br>Human always look at material thing, then feel interested, then buy ... then human also know "their own weakness" ... so they also try to make something so other human interested to buy his/her product ...<br><br>The question is:<br>How come now got economic recission?<br><br>if A sell, B buy from A, then C buy from B ... eventually A also buy from Z which Z buy from its predecessor (imagine it as alphabet) ...<br>So? Money is "a thing" right? Law of eternity of energy said "energy cannot is eternity, but it transform from one form to another" ... Is money eternity? It should be eternity! Then why there is more and more people cannot buy this and that? As if that "money is reduced from time to time"???<br><br>Hehehe ...<br><br>The answer is :<br><br>#1<br>Too much human in this earth already ... the count of human who sell and who buy are not balanced ... People is just tooooooooo much to count, whereas Earth resource is limited ... then economic recission begin ... food recission ... etc ...<br><br>#2<br>The money is kept by "one or two or three" greedy and powerfull being such as government, terorrist, Osama, Bill Gates, etc...<br><br>#3<br>Or there is tooooo much stupid human creature like me who like to guess in this earth ... so the main problem is never solved ...<br>What is the main problem?

COLONIZATION could prove to be one of the BIG problems in the future (if human still exist then...), that's why EVIL have to exist... To do some 'deeds' like KILLING... Set a little 'balance' to the world population perhaps many would like to think of as in the WRONG way.... But it's just all like an ECOLOGICAL SYSTEM....<br>And talking about SINGLE currency, SINGLE RELIGION and SINGLE GOVERNMENT...? It's NOT that it's not possible... But it's just a SENSITIVE issue.... Just like KOF have mentioned, the world ECONOMY has its way of 'survival' and PUSHING effect... &lt;- Though I must admit that I haven't know much about it to comment on this subject YET.... But I believe a DRIVING FORCE I should see it as quite a GOOD PLAN.... Not that there're no alternatives to it... (Just not easy to be accepted, UNLESS like you've mentioned... A single government... Things should be easier then... Then again.... Read on..)<br>Single government? POSSIBLE...? YES... But who would GIVE IN 1st...? Hehheh... Let me say an 'UGLY thing' here... The governments know how they rule their countries...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> Who would wanna be ruled the SAME WAY...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> How should power be divided out...?

I AGREE with you that a SINGLE GOVERNMENT could prove to be a MOST WONDERFUL and EFFICIENT scheme.... THEN AGAIN, it could just be EQUALLY as BAD.... A BAD or LOUSY ruler is all it takes to DESTROY the ENTIRE CIVILISATION.....<br>Single religion..? How CLOSE to it can you get...? With FREE-THINKERs around somemore? FORCE people to BELIEVE...? Just the minor disagreements on religious topics in this forum would bring to such 'hooha'... SENSITVE? Yes... EXTREMELY SENSITIVE... With terrorist AIMLESSLY using 'jihad' as a EXCUSE SHIELD people STILL fall for it... Can you imagine COLONIZATION using RELIGION? I can ASSURE you it is as BAD as using SKIN COLOR, GENDER, STATUS and such.... PREJUDICING... The REASON is because RELIGION is a THINKING thing... And HUMANs are THINKING creatures... It's NOT uncommon for humans to think DIFFERENTLY... Trying to FORCE people to THINK in your way just DOESN'T work... It's just DECEIVING yourself...? Why be SO HARD on the others if all they wanna do is just to THINK differently..? I know your style Lex... You don't force people... NO OFFENCE, but doesn't mean other people won't...? Given the 'right' POWER and AUTHORITY.... Do you read on HISTORY... I HATE HISTORY.... BORING stuffs... But stories on COLONIZATION relying upon a certain religion can always be SO UNFAIR... SO CRUEL... SO 'alien' like... Given the RIGHT RECOGNITION.. In the NAME of 'GOD'..... I'm a DEVIL Lex... Where should I go to..?

I am sure there is no gov will give up their power to 1 super gov at the moment. And the people also won't let it happened. But think about this... if the recission never ended, everything become worse and worse (as human population exploding like crazy, and the earth resources are getting drained), the scope of recission is not about "people, food, shelter, and humanity" anymore, but about the survival of "countries", about "survival of continents"...<br><br>Group of people get worried, they demands leader ... that's why kings and presidents are exist ..<br><br>But, group of nations worried, they will also demands leader, to lead, to balance, to guide them out from the recession.
