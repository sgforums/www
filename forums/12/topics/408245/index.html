              <p><br>It wasn't easy, I had to go around and shop for 6 phones with the loudest RING. I had to test them at every electrical appliance shop. And then I had to buy 6 X 30 feet cables so I can position the phones near the window. I also had to buy multiple phone sockets that don't work very well, so I had to use duct tape to stick the sockets to the wall socket.</p>

              just want to share with u what i done to my crazy neighbour upstair .. the whole crazy family walk like king kong, love to drag the furniture and bang the door  ... they can make noise for the whole day esp weekend, they can just drag the furniture around till midnight.<br><br>

                                                                                                        1. Went up to talk to them nicely for a few times, they always denied. They say someone else did that. They claim that they sleep early or nobody is at home in the afternoon.. yea yea u r the only family living above me unless is ghost.
                                                                                                        <br><br>

They say we r crazy always accuse them for making noise, i even use my hp to tape the sound they make and playback for them to listen. They still insist they never make those noise. Fine, no point arguing with barbarian.
                                                                                                        <br><br>

                                                                                                        <br><br>

                                                                                                        <br><br>

A tooth for a tooth, i just do what they did. Since the parent and kids need to work and go to school early in the morning. I dont mind sacrificing a few hr of my sleep to disturb them at midnight :mrgreen: <br><br>
                                                                                                        
                                                                                                        i used those hang cloth bamboo stick and knock on my ceiling where the parent room is . :lol: since they like noise i give them back. Another useful thing is watergun, i used either soy sauce or sugar water and spray on their clothe .. :lol: ..
                                                                                                        <br><br>

              <p>Peng Yu, your strategy can backfire. They are in a very advantageous position, being above you, they can pour shit, garbage and anything else into your home. No point making an enemy out of your neighbour, because who knows? One day you change your job, and it turns out the neighbour is your boss or your co worker, it is a small world.</p>
              <p>The phone tactic is useful because you can RING RING when you are not around. If they disturb you late at night, you RING RING from morning to evening, 3 RING per hour. If they disturb you early in the monring, you RING RING late at night until you go to sleep. Make sure you place some phones outside the balcony so can hear.</p>

              <p>no point, old habits die hard. Some people walk like elephant. Its like asking them to use a bucket instead of a spoon to eat dinner. They will stop for one or two days, then resume back again. This is the disadvantage of living in S'pore, there is always somebody above you. Unless you are rich enuf to afford a house. Or the buy the lot on the highest floor. What can HBD do? What can police do? Handcuff them? They can run marathon, jump and drag furniture but can you prove that? All you can do is to use Ipod to record their noise but can you prove it is coming from them? Even if you can, can you sue them over a silly thing?</p>

              <p>PAP won't implement a ruling that wuld anger voters, I am sure the number of inconsiderate neighbours number the same as those affected like you. All HDB can do is to kindly inform them not to do it but seriously, the person upstair can drop a hammer, and claims they didn't do it. Logically very difficult to enforce.</p>
              <p>Two ways you can avoid this, find a flat that is wall bearing - means the flat structure is supported by the walls not the columns. But these flats are very small although I believe the concrete flooring and walls will be hard enuf to withstand ordinary noise. Disadvantage, you cannot knockdown the wall for renovation or else who building collapse.</p>
              <p>If you buy condo you notice that the floor is so wafer thin, you stomp on the floor also can hear your footstep. This one is supported by pillars or column. <br>You can take a hammer and strap it with lots of duct tape onto a long stick. So whenever the top floor make noise upstairs at an unsuitable time, you use your hammer on the long stick to hit the roof.</p>
