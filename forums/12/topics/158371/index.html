Remember that there can only be ONE top student, a few top atheletes, etcs. In the end, it is these type of people who are more stressed because they constantly live in the fear of being surpassed. This is why the term 'lead a simple life' arises.<br><br>People making use of each other.. There can only be so much unconditional love. The only unconditional love is parental. Maybe try not to see it as making use of each other.. It is human nature to 'mutually benefit' each other, and I guess this behavoir appears in friendship as well.<br><br>As for the issue about the gal.. Well, a lot of time, a lot of people have told me that it may really sound cliche, but are you sure you can use the word 'Love' when maybe it is just a crush? Because like you said, she treats you like shit, so is it really worth it?<br><br>Well.. no one cares about you? You still have your 'mushy gang', and I am sure that there are a lot of people who want to join that gang but are not able to, while you are one of the privileged few. Lucky you  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>Sometimes, the easiest way to boost your self esteem is simply to do some volunteering work, for example at the Old Folks home, the things you do may be so little, but when they thank you, it makes you feel useful and important.<br><br>The problems you are facing are not chronic, therefore all you need is to look more kindly upon yourself, realise that you are unique, and I guess you'll have to accept the fact that input does not equals output, so when you say you give people attention they treat you like glass, remember that glass is beautiful, without glass there would be no windows, but walls only.<br><br>As for studies, I am sure it can definately be improved.<br><br>Cheer up !</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>WTF. Its you yourself who choose not to make friends. Rejecting the outing just because of what? The 'Oh, I'm not good enough of them' reasons. Why do you put yourself down when others have not done so? Its worse than condemning yourself to death. Do you think people care about how you live your life? NOOOOO! Its you who make your life count. Ask your friends out when you have spare time.<br><br>Since your studis are bad, spend time on them when you are at home?<br><br>If you don't believe in 'forever friends', so be it. But never tell others this for they might think you are arrogant or such. You cannot tell how long a friendship will last. Full of twists and turns, your best friend might become your worst enemy and vice versa. So why worry about it, since you assume all friendships are bound to break. People worry over everything... when its nothing to be worried about. Just make friends with others, hang out with them. Find out what they like and stuff.. Its okay to change a bit for the people around you. But not to the extent that you ain't you.</div>
