If you think you are average, the others pereceive you as average becasue you behave like that.<br>Nobody is average, outstanding or fabulous. If you feel yourself not well among other people, they can sense it and you get their reaction which is the one you just mentioned. It's a circle, you feel as you feel becasue the people behave towards you as they behave, and they behave towards you as they behave becasue they can sense how you feel. Everyone feels better in the presence of positive and merry persons becasue negative and sad persons make them feel negative and sad. It's about your inner attidute.<br>It's all in your hands and mind, you can do it  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm..I search for your name and you seem to complain abt ur low self esteem over and over again?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> I know how it feels, but at least try to look happy in front of them. Don't let those losers (those that makes you feel bad) feed on your unhappiness. So do yourself a favour, don't DON'T dwell on your unhappy past. It's terrible, sickening and guilty. I know it's difficult, I can understand. But do try to stay close to people that makes you feel better about yourself <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> This way, you can see a vast improvement on your esteem <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
