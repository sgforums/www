            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: blue;">I been harrassed by this man since i break up with him...<br><br>He was my ex-colleague.. He did persue me when i'm still attached... That time, I and my ex are facing some old problems which come and go for very long times... but we still can't resolve.. At the end, we choose to end the relationship..<br><br>After break up, I was very sad.. But he was there for me.. So end up i was together with him cause he was very nice to me and care for me which it's lack in my previous relationship..<br><br>However after some time, i found that actually we are not quite compatible.. the gap between us is too big... he is 8 yrs elder than me .. however i dun think the age does a matter, it's just the mentality and thought cant click...<br><br>He likes to control me where i go and restrict me to go out with my buddy or friends..He even ask me why my friends is asking me out?? which i really cant stand at all.. I din go out wif my friends very often, maybe just once a while...<br><br>Got one time I was so piss off.. During CNY, I went back my hometown in M'sia for vacation.. I told him i'll be away for a few days before i go back wif my family... I was thinking of getting away from him at least for few days.. cause i was almost suffocated having him around in my daily life... One day, he called me but i din pick up the line, i did it purposely.. He then keep calling me until my phone was showing 20++ missed call from him.. He even use his friend's phone to call me to see whether i pick up the line...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> I was so mad....<br><br>After this incident, I decided to break up with him... So i meet him right after i came back from m'sia n told him the whole things... He cant accept and wouldn't want to accept... I told him not matter how, this is my decision.. I was very firm with that...<br><br>From that day onwards, my nightmare starts.... At first he was waiting me and even drink at my void deck, insist to see me... then follow by nuisance calls and sms... I told him if he continue that way, we cant even remain as normal friend.. Later on, I got a new job and left that company.. But the nuisance sms still on...<br><br>To get rid of these, I brag him that i gt a new bf and my bf is very unhappy wif his acts... Then the nuisance finally stop...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> I thought I would have a peace of mind from that day onwards... But it only last for about 2 months.. Recently, he have started his nuisance sms again.. I delete it straight after i've read... But it has affected me emotionally and mentally... I really veri veri angry of his acts, but cant do anything to it... Sometimes i just felt so helpless that i can only let him torture me mentally which i cant stop him at all..<br><br><span class="large">HELP!!!!!!!! Can anyone tell me wat shd i do to this man????? Can i just call him to scold him and ask him to stop all his stupid act???? </span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> </span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: violet;">You obviously did the right thing leaving him. Having a control freak boy friend is already bad enough,worse if you do dive deeper into the relationship and get married,than you will be stuck with him for life.Normally such compulsive behaviours is a show of a lack of self confidence and this might drive him to great extremes which might result in stalking. Let it be known to all around you what is happening to you so in case he tries something extreme, someone will know about it. Get a colleague or friend to see you to and from the office ,but first of all ,have a good long talk with him.In no way back down from your decision.Be firm,let him know this will be better for both of you. Time is precious and it would be better for him to show his affections to someone else who will return his love better. If it gets bad,let your superiors know,but that is a  last resort. </span></div>

Best is change hp number. although its troublesome to inform all ur clients and friends again, but sometime its worth it. better than u got mentally torture until end up in IMH. if he go to ur house to pester u, u can directly make a police report.

            <div class='col-md body'>As difficult as it would be for you to do so, I see only two solutions:<br><br>1. Go to your handphone service provider and ask them to bar calls to your number originating from his handphone and home phone. Then again, since he might resort to using public phones instead, you may have to change your number. It's a great hassle, but at least it stops his calls.<br><br>2. Go to the police and file a complaint of harassment. It's the only sure way of stopping him from stalking you. Let the cops settle with him.<br><br>Of course, if that doesn't stop him, you could take out a Personal Protection Order against him. If he still continues to harass you after that, he'll be in direct violation of the law, which could see him in jail.<br><br>Good luck.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmmmm... that time i watched True Files.. also got a similar case. The ex keep harassing her, called her, drinking at the void deck. Bang on her house door, and when he knew she might be at her friend's home, he even brought a lock and locked them inside.<br><br>Finally he barged into her office, pulled her by the hair and left the office... That was the last time her best friend saw her. He threw her off the block....<br>*sad* Better stay as far as possible. Never Never meet him alone for whatever reason, be it to talk it out or bump into him accidentally.You won't know what he wants to do with you.<br><br></div>
