At the end, we choose to end the relationship..<br><br>After break up, I was very sad.. But he was there for me.. So end up i was together with him cause he was very nice to me and care for me which it's lack in my previous relationship..<br><br>However after some time, i found that actually we are not quite compatible.. the gap between us is too big... he is 8 yrs elder than me .. however i dun think the age does a matter, it's just the mentality and thought cant click...<br><br>He likes to control me where i go and restrict me to go out with my buddy or friends..He even ask me why my friends is asking me out?? which i really cant stand at all.. I din go out wif my friends very often, maybe just once a while...<br><br>Got one time I was so piss off.. During CNY, I went back my hometown in M'sia for vacation.. I told him i'll be away for a few days before i go back wif my family... I was thinking of getting away from him at least for few days.. cause i was almost suffocated having him around in my daily life... One day, he called me but i din pick up the line, i did it purposely.. He then keep calling me until my phone was showing 20++ missed call from him.. He even use his friend's phone to call me to see whether i pick up the line...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"> I was so mad....<br><br>After this incident, I decided to break up with him...

At first he was waiting me and even drink at my void deck, insist to see me... then follow by nuisance calls and sms... I told him if he continue that way, we cant even remain as normal friend..

I felt sorry to him and have let him down...<br><br>From ur point of view, i agree that i did owe him somethings in somewhere... but i dun think i've to sacrifice my happiness just for that... Since we are not suitable for each others, wat for to drag on it??? Break up will be a good solution.. good for me and for him as well.. NO point to carry on whereby both of us wont be happy..<br><br>Definitely his nuisance sms is the first category.. At first, he sms me said he still miss me a lots, still love me very much, cant forget me, whether i can give a 2nd chance, etc.. After i ignore this sms sometimes, he start sending those sarcastics sms... like saying i'm mean, cruel, not as nice as he used to think, etc.. No matter wat write, i just ignore him..<br><br>I dun want to have anything to do with him, i just wish to get out of these "dark" day and start a new life... If i still remain friend with him, he will think he still has chance, then will be endless story...</span></div>

If he continues to harass you. Call yr friend to go see him to gether and tell him firmly to stop harassing you or else you will report to police! More people around,he wouldn't dare to do funny things to you even if he turns that mad!</div>
