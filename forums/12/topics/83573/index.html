How is he going to survive through life itself? By choosing the easiest way out for him shows that he is a coward and will probably be so for the rest of his life. Happiness in life never comes easy for anyone. You have to fight for your own happiness. I think even if your friend do have another relationship in his future, he will also not be able to find the happiness. Trust me on this and mark my words. People who don't seek and fight for his own happiness will simply dwell in their own self-pityness for their entire lives. Whoever ends up with this type of person will also not find happiness in the relationship.<br><br>Your friend is probably still young isn't it? Not yet go through NS? He will probably need to mature more...and I hope he will. A lot of grown-up adults also behaved like this....their mentality haven't grown much compared to their body. Know anybody like this? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes">  People like this probably have a very good luck in their lives....smooth going life since childhood. But wait until disaster hits them and you will see those people committing suicide....hahahah.....hahahaha..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>BaByBoY, if you are his good friend...do help to bring him out of his naive thinking and faster awaken him to the real world...that's is if you really care for him. Otherwise, good luck to him...he is going to need a lot of lucks in his life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Bottomline, your friend is a disappointment to all guys.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

You should advice him to wake up. Maybe not now as he's disturbed by many issues.<br>But a friend not only advises the right way, but the wise way.<br>A friend not only helps in 'that situation' but help him to see light in himself.</div>
