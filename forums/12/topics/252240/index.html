            <div class='col-md body'>Lower back pain is usually caused by poor/incorrect posture especially when we slouch in the chair instead of sitting up straight. Go see a doctor who'll most likely prescribe pain killers. In serious cases, you many need injections. After the pain has subsided, you may want to learn pilates to help with posture problems too.
