              <p>I guess it is better not to set deadline, but rather an imaginery line, do not put ourselve into a stressful position with deadline, just go on and try your best, after that, it is all up to fate, without any deadline, you can go on forever, as long as you love or like, that someone will alway have a place in your heart.</p>
              <p>Let things flow as it is, resistance will create friction either with someone, or with oneself. Whatever want to come, shall come, whatever want to go, even you block all entries, it will find way to go.</p>

              <p>Hi TS, excellent post you made her as I can relate to it as well. I've had a long time crush on a girl, from primary school mind you!!</p>
              <p>However I learned that it is best that you move on because there is no other way! The thing is, there is NO resolution to this other than moving on into getting your own relationship with another girl.</p>
              <p>You see, I am getting married soon, but I still adore the girl I had a huge crush on so many years ago. Maybe that's why they say old flame never dies and childhood sweetheart is the most painful and emotional turmoil to overcome.</p>
              <p>I hope I have at least encouraged you to look outside as I have gone through the same path before. I have to admit that even now with my perfect relationship and future, no one and nothing can replace that feeling I have for that girl I have so longed to have.</p>
              <p>I try to use that to my advantage now by savoring the emotions I get. Bittersweet and painful but good. Sounds sick I know but you are SOL.</p>

              <p>Maybe she's posted on another Aunt Agony forum, asking if she should leave this guy for another.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> </p>
              <p>But consider this: If she dumps him for TroubledTeen, she could do the same to him just as easily in the future if another guy comes along.</p>

              <p>Just be Honest and tell the truth what You want from her and then let her decide. When She is ready and willing to provide what You want, she can come to You.</p>

              <p><br>hmm... if love just come like that, sometimes hard to stop it. but as much as possible, if TS knows she is attached, he shld stop pestering her already. if u dun like something to be done to u, dun do it on others</p>

              <p>So i know this girl when we were in Sec 3. We used to like each
                  other, but i treated her really badly back then because of my bad
                  attitude and temper. We quarrelled and we stopped talking since
                  then. </p>
              <p>Then, my arch enemy quickly came into the picture and starts to
                  get close to her, while we distanced.</p>
              <p>There was endless drama between me and that guy in Secondary
                  4.</p>
              <p>Just before O levels, they got together.</p>
              <p>So, just a few days ago, we started talking again, after 2 years
                  of silence. I still love her and i can only wet my pillow at night,
                  regretting what i've done 2 years back. We weren't awkward at all,
                  and we can still talk like how it was in the past. But i made a
                  mistake.</p>
              <p>I couldn't control my emotions and i expressed my affections for
                  her.</p>
              <p>She said as long as she's together with that guy, i don't stand
                  a chance.</p>
              <p>Oh and that guy doesn't know we started talking again, because
                  we just hate each other so much, if he knows about it they are
                  going to fight like no tomorrow, previously they fought over me
                  just because the girl followed me on twitter, and he logs into her
                  account and block me again and again. So we only text when she's
                  alone and my name in her contacts is a girl's name just to hide it
                  from that guy. </p>
              <p>Up till now, she initiates the conversation everytime.</p>
              <p>I don't know but do you think i still stand a chance, and what
                  should i do? I really like her..</p>
              <p>Thanks for reading!</p>

              <p>Sorry TS but I think this girl needs to have a better manner. She declared you don't stand a chance yet continues to mess around and keep you in this sh**. If I were you, I'd ask her directly what exactly all those contradictions are, what she wants by sending loads of mixed signals. If she wants to be with you, then she has you, if she is confused with her feelings, then give her some time but not too long, if she insists in her previous statement, then move on.</p>
              <p>Honestly speaking, if I were you, I've moved on already. If a girl can do that to another guy, I mean being that close to you while commited to him, she can do that to you too. I'm not talking about all girls though. But I just don't accept sneaky behavior, be it from a girl or guy.</p>

              <p>Demanding bf that checks on her all the time.. Hard to stand it for long..</p>
              <p>IMO, it is the perfect image of the old her that holds you back.. And.. it is really not worh waiting.. Feels like she is somewhat cheating on her bf, can't openly declare that she is still contacting you..</p>
