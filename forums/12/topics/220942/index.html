I really scared and regretful..<br><br>So you girls out there, please protect yourself, even if you are in love, dun let your BF take such photos or videoclips of you!!!!! NO matter how he promise!!!!</div></blockquote>I Believe he already back up the clips to his PC or something for easy viewing purpose. He may not have shared it with his buddy or friends unless he's really not into valuing the relationship the both of you had before.<br><br>Sort things out with him if he's reasonable or else i believe it will be quite ugly for you. Good Luck</div>
