              I got to know this girl 6 months ago, at a friend's gathering. Initially, we talked a bit and exchanged numbers. Over these few months, I noticed I have taken a liking to her and text her often. But somehow, when I see her face to face, I was unable to strike a conversation with her. Our conversation is always very short, with no more than a few sentences. 
                  
              Any suggestions how to carry on the conversation? I tried talking about stuff that she is interested but it still don't work. Am I somehow trying too hard? Sometimes I also got a feeling that she is either not interested to talk to me, or she is not comfortable opening up to me (as in sharing about her past and her life).
                  
              FYI, my last relationship was 3 years ago and it lasted 7.5 years. The girl is those outgoing sporty type who talks a lot and can make friends with anyone.

              I don't think so.. she usually hangs out with her poly and uni friends. She has been single since 6 years back? It's either she is not willing to open up herself up cos she don't feel comfortable with me, or this is her character. There are people who show themselves to be very outgoing or talk alot with anybody, but they are actually introverts, like putting up a false front to mask their insecurity.
              
              Or maybe she feel that i like her so she distance away from me? I don't know. Too many possibilities. Or could be i am a boring shit. Haha. I have no problems cracking lame jokes and have fun with other female friends but not her. I am losing ideas how to get the conversation going. Feels like a one way conversation most of the time, despite me trying to make sure that our coversations does not result in closed ended answers.

              Thanks jojo. I agree too.. I never really ask her about the past. I already sort of know what she wants to do in the future, what she likes to do, where she likes to go.. but other than that, like nothing much to talk about leh. I tried asking her out but seems like she is quite "å®…å¥³". She either hangs out with her uni or poly friends or just stay home. Maybe need to give her some time ba.

              Jojo, I don't think now is a good time to tell her. Later scare her away. I feel I need to try and get to know her more, then see how things go.

              I don't know.. but isn't there a saying that one should fight for their own happiness? I believe in "if it's meant to be, it will be" but I have friends who stuck to that belief and still single now.

              hi p228,
              
              it is true that destiny is in your hands. but at the end of the day you can only control yourself. 
              allow me to elaborate. for that special moment to happen it requires u to like the person, that person to like you and also the correct timing. sometimes even if feeling are both ways timing is wrong...it happens. 
              
              this is where "meant to be" comes into play....when those 3 conditions are met is when "destiny is in your hands" comes in.
              
              if you try too hard you are not yourself and it will show. confidence is a sexy thing
