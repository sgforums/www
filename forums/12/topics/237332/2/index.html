I do not want to have any dark secrets hiding in our relationship and I especially do not want to hide anything from you.

No point lying anyhoo :/<br><br>Bare with me, it's long.<br><br>I had a crush over girl B when I was in sec 2. But one day I made her cry by being childish. =( Then girl C came over and talked to me. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I followed girl C after that and for the entire sec 2, I sat in front of her for every class. We grew closer after that.<br><br>So close that someone who had a crush on her asked me to help him. I said okay, but after a couple of weeks, I found myself falling for her too. I told him that I was sorry. He called girl C to tell her that night, she didn't believe. So I set my mind to tell her the next day. And I did.<br><br>It was during class, I said "C, I like you.".

I just walked away, it kills me everyday that I didnt say that its because I love her.<br><br>During seconday sch, I always fought, then there was this once, I was angry with her because she wasn't talking to me so I went to the back to seat. She kept looking back, and I just walked away. She came to my pencil box and slipped a letter into it. She was saying sorry, it was 2 pages, and she asked me to go back to sit with her. Which I did.<br><br>There was this once, I told her that I didn't like someone in class, and she asked me "What about me? What about me?" and I just said, "I don't quite like you too, your attitude"<br><br>The next thing I knew, she went to her friend and cried in class. I don't know if it was me, but I went to her and said I was sorry. She kept saying it isn't me. I gave her the only chocolate I had and said sorry. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Everytime her bf came to her to talk, she'd go to sleep. But she'd always talk to me (cept when shes having her headaches).<br><br>-------<br><br>Towards the end of the year, the booted-captain of netball came to me and asked me about C's results, since she got promoted to captain and got into the top class. Turned out C's results were poorer than hers, and yet she got into the top class.<br><br>Anyhoo, thats besides the point, whilst I was calling her and her friends to find out about her results. Her friends (netballers) kept asking me who wanted to know. I told them. They never liked the booted-captain alot.<br><br>The next day, the disciplinary master cum netball coach called me over and scolded me and said I was just being used by the booted-captain, and he asked me to keep away from his netball girls, citing that I'm not a good influence. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>I stormed back to class, it was the last day of sec 2. She came over and asked for my signature behind the class photo, I flipped the table in front and shouted at her to @#@($)( off and stormed out.<br><br>I was fuming, thinking that it might be her who had sabo-ed me.<br><br>Thing is, I dont think it was ever her. My anger clouded my judgement.<br><br>We proceded into sec 3 in different classes, I dropped into the last class, whilst she went into the top.<br><br>One day I had remedial in her class, so I rushed up just hoping that I'd have a glance of her. And I did! After I put my bag inside the class, I walked out, and there she was! Just outside the corridor, she said my name, and I swore she looked like she was going to cry any moment. But I just ran <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> I don't know why, but I did.<br><br>We never spoke ever since then till sec 4 when it was her birthday, I bought her a lava lamp (god knows why). I didn't even say happy birthday, yet she came over to say thank you.<br><br>She left for australia when I was sec 5, after she graduated.<br><br>She comes back every year. And when she did this year, I called her during christmas to wish her a happy birthday, but it felt weird. I know it'd take time. I kept asking her out almost every month (she was here for 4 months). But everytime she said she was busy<br><br>But the week before she left, she messaged me saying that if I could organize something, then she'd meet. (Is she afraid of being with me alone?) Nobody could make it, it was the exams week.<br><br>The week after, I messaged her what time her flight was. And she said it isn't confirmed, and she asked why?<br><br>I told her I wanted to send her off.<br><br>But I guess she didn't want me there because she didn't reply for 2 days. So I decided not to make it difficult for her, I sms-ed her a lie that I wouldn't be able to make it since i'd be busy, asked her to take good care of herself there.<br><br>Its been 7 years since I fell for her. I still love her alot and I regret my every move that I've made. I know I'm terrible at this. I just wished I could make everything right.<br><br>Problem is, her friends aren't exactly my friends, and my friends aren't her friends either. We don't have the same clique. I know shes the one, if she wasn't, I wouldn't have waited.<br><br>I just want to hold her and tell her I've always loved her.<br><br>Each time I told her I love her after the first time, it was stupid, I was doing it over msn or through wordpad. I wrote letters. Bared my soul out, and each time, I told her that I'm not good enough. And the last time I told her, I asked her if she'd invite me to her wedding.<br>Each time, she'd say ok.
