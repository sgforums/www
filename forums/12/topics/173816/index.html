            <div class='col-md body'>it doesnt mean if you're getting around 16-18 pts, it would be better for you in poly. my advice has always been if u could enter a jc, just go for it. poly modules can very quite tough, it doesn't mean poly is necessarily easier than jc. if ur ultimate goal is to enter university.... jc is a better choice, coz it's normally easier to enter uni from jc. even if u didn't do well in jc, say u get Bs and Cs and Ds, u still have a shot in entering uni.. if ur poly results are mainly Cs and Ds, u can kiss local uni goodbye... u also have little chance with a good overseas uni. most ppl who enter polys know what they want to study already and many intend to start work after poly...mainly those with good results do go to uni...<br><br>during my secondary sch days i was thinking of going to poly study IT. but my results were good enough to go jc... and i decided with jc coz im not sure if IT is what i want... and now im doing engineering in uni which I really enjoy studying.. so im quite glad i didnt go to poly.. coz i would have regreted studying IT and given the slacker in me, my poly results probably wont be very good enuff for uni too.. so im glad i went to jc..</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>thanks so much for these advice... but really if i were to take B chinese, will i still have 6 or 5 subjects? cuz if it is 5, Jc's comfirm out....<br><br>And above all, judging by wht i see, CI has completely lost the race. but what i have yet to read is the real reason why. I would want to persue mass com in future so which path is better? JC, or POLY?<br><br>and i do see the down side of JC, If you are not able to enter Uni, A level cert is nothing. But in oly, you are on your own and you have to be the top 5 % to enter uni.<br><br>does anyone know, how the poly system works? how many courses do you have to take?? someone shed some light on that, please!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
