              <p>Hi, I live in Maplewoods for about a year now. We have renovated and made our apartment more like a home now. </p>
              <p>However since a few months, we have been getting security coming over to our place over smallest most questionable issues. The latest is when we were installing our air con units. There was complain of noise. </p>
              <p>By now management office are used to the complains made by my "anonymous" neighbour about my unit. I live on #01. And neighbour #02 (adjacent). </p>
              <p>I have 2 young children under 4 years old and I'm 8 months pregnant. I am getting fed up with these constant bullying from this neighbour who also happens to be one of the council member of this condo. </p>
              <p>What can I do? Talking to management office - they will rather not get involve n pass on e MSG. Is this considered harrassment? Do I go to e police? Hire a lawyer? It's causing me distress!</p>

              solutions:
              
              1.   You also join the management committee /council of the condo where you stay, so that you also have a say and not be overpowered by your neighbour because of his / her status in the condo council.
              
              2.   Turn a deaf ear from the management office.
              
              3.   Makes more noise to further irritate the neighbour.
              
              4.   Confront the neighbour for a face-to-face talk.

              <p>Yes, it's irritating to have such a neighbour but he's already showing his displeasure in the most non-confrontational way. Some wannabes just like to be involved in such commitee and imagine they are some powerful policitians and use a featherduster like a sword. Just ignore them and the management office if you are not in the wrong, why let such a small thing cause you distress and affect your life. If you find such a small thing distressing, perhaps you have difficulty handling small issues of life. </p>
              <p>There is also no need to escalate this further, like reporting to the police or hiring a lawyer. Sometimes perfectly normal people can degenerate into extreme idiots like the people involved in the famous Everitt spat and the recent quarrel on the MRT, turning themselves into a national joke.</p>
              <p>Trust me, there are many worse neighbours around, just take it in your stride.</p>

              <p><span class="bodytext"> Government considering setting up a body with power to order 
                  neighbours locked in difficult disputes to go for mediation. -TNP </span> <br> <span class="content_subtitle"> <br> Sat, May 18, 2013<br> The New Paper </span></p>
              <p><span class="bodytext"> </span></p>
              <p>SINGAPORE - The Government is considering setting up a body with the 
                  power to order neighbours locked in difficult disputes to go for 
                  mediation.</p>
              <p><span class="bodytext"> </span></p>
              <p>Such a body may also be able to prosecute 
                  people who do not follow orders set out after mediation, Acting Minister
                   for Community, Culture and Youth Lawrence Wong said on Sunday.</p>
              <p>This would strengthen community dispute resolution in dealing with 
                  particularly difficult cases, where going for mediation is voluntary 
                  now.</p>
              <p>"We are looking at how to have a more robust community resolution 
                  framework," Mr Wong told reporters on the sidelines of a ministerial 
                  visit to Admiralty ward.</p>
              <p>The Government is studying systems in other jurisdictions such as 
                  Britain and Hong Kong, and also looking at local examples to have a 
                  better understanding of dealing with these disputes.</p>
              <p>Mr Wong did not give an exact time frame, but said the Government 
                  will be studying how to put the measure in place "over the next few 
                  months".</p>
              <p>The idea of a tougher framework for settling neighbourly disputes was
                   first put forward by Law Minister K. Shanmugam last August.</p>
              <p>Besides strengthening the legal framework, another approach has been 
                  suggested to deal with the issue. This is to develop norms for conduct 
                  between neighbours.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The new Community Mediation Centre (CMC) Central was officially 
                  opened Friday, March 9 by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Law, Mr K
                   Shanmugam, at The Treasury.</p>
              <p>The new centre, which commenced operations on Feb 12 this year, 
                  consolidates the operations of the CMCs at Regional North (Woodlands) 
                  and Central (URA Centre).</p>
              <p>It will be the primary location to mediate all family, social and 
                  community disputes. Cases referred by the Courts will continue to be 
                  mediated by the CMC at the Subordinate Courts.</p>
              <p>With bigger and better facilities for mediation and caucus sessions, 
                  it can hold up to three mediation sessions concurrently, compared to the
                   maximum of two that could be held at the two centres in Woodlands and 
                  URA Centre.</p>
              <p>At full capacity, CMC Central may see up to nine mediation sessions 
                  per day. Mediation rooms are outfitted with soundproof features to 
                  assure greater privacy.</p>
              <p>Mediation training for volunteer mediators, referral partners and 
                  other interested agencies can now be conducted under one roof at the new
                   centre.</p>
              <p>Guests at the opening of the new centre included former Senior 
                  Minister of State for Law and Home Affairs, Associate Professor Ho Peng 
                  Kee. He is now the Chairperson of the Advisory Committee on Community 
                  Mediation, which looks into improving the effectiveness of community 
                  mediation services and the mediation profession.</p>

              <p>air con noise can be damn irritating and affect sleep of some people.    I believe the complaints from her neighbours are genuine.</p>
              <p>I have a foreign indian neighbour from India who complained to me she is fed up to receive complaints about her kid making noise to disturb the neighbours.    Truly, her son can be noisy.    Luckily, my family is not staying below her unit.</p>

              <p>Thank you all for the feedback. Ignorance is best since i am genuinely not in the wrong. I have managed to talk to management office &amp; they have agreed to help. Mainly because the complains is baseless &amp; they have better things to do. </p>
              <p>Shirt_less - I have asked security to ask that neighbour to come down personally. But to no avail. If I have a small issue with a neighbour, I had no problem telling them e situation. Most neighbours will understand. After all it is a apartment block. Noise &amp; disturbance is bound to happen. </p>
              <p>Arami - Neighbours are local Chinese Singaporeans. I don't think race matters. Maplewoods is full of FT. Whiteys, Indons &amp; local Chinese who has been there since it was built! Misusing authority is not fair. Full stop. </p>
              <p>Tanet - I'm a Singaporean who recently just moved back after many years abroad. So yes, adjusting to e new Singapore is NOT easy. Thank u very much! Problematic ppl can be found all over e world. One thing can't be denied is - Singaporeans has a love to and for complains. This we cannot deny. It's just not nice when u r e one getting e end of e stick. Whatever incidents that you have mentioned, it's probably e typical hot blooded Chinese who can't control their temper. </p>

              <p>Deacon blue - what more is there to explain? Security came to ask what we were doing. Installing aircon. We have permit. And of course e security went away. We were doing it within e designated time &amp; have e right paperwork. </p>

              <p>Deacon blue - what more is there to explain? Security came to ask what we were doing. Installing aircon. We have permit. And of course e security went away. We were doing it within e designated time &amp; have e right paperwork. </p>

              <p>such complaints are nothing lah. if no issue why you come here write and whine?</p>
              <p>singaporeans or not in the internet even a dog can post if it knows how to type. really.</p>
              <p>so what's the point in this post?</p>
              <p>security also guundu, anyhow approach you to 'harrass' you when the complain is not genuine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>your case of aircon - security might have go to you to check if they are licenced that's all. if yo unot able to proof they are licensed then that;'s wht the complaint was addressing to. if you can proof then security can forward the information to the complaint community and close the case.</p>
              <p>as a good neighbour, usually if i do loud contract works (even if in the day), i will inform the neighbours in my immediate vicinity about it. if i cannot get them i will drop a note. that's the proper way to do. if they do it at night after the lawful stated hour, and dont have the couurtesy to inform then that is really a moubtain boor family.</p>
              <p>unless you friedn friend ark lar liao with them, the head of family probably will say 'okay lah' while the rest of their family suffer in silence from teh loud moises.</p>
