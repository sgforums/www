The more I work, the more i'm so disgusted with the human race &amp; the more I am so glad that I am single. I can't be bothered to be milking what's left of my energy for the other half.</span><br>You're afraid to switch jobs because you're worried you'll not be able to find a better one if you quit now. And if that happens, you may not be even be eating cup noodles. I faced that problem quite a few times too, albeit in a different context. The solution is simple to suggest, but hard to get it started: start saving up. That's the only way you can tell yourself, "If I quit now, I'll have at least 1 month's time to look for a better job while relying on my trusty cup noodles." Judging by your standard of English, and what you're currently eating, I'm sure you can get paid better elsewhere.</p>
              <p><br><span style="color: #888888;">I love simplicity &amp; I always envision myself to be living in some country side, painting &amp; planting potatoes for a living (or maybe a vineyard) I don't want to get caught up in the rat race but yet I have another contradicting alternative that if I married someone rich &amp; dependable, I would be living a comfortable &amp; stable lifestyle.</span><br>Who doesn't want to retire early and enjoy life? Even the uncle who is queueing up at the lottery betting station is thinking of something like that too. But come on, there's no easy way out of this, especially when you're living in a country called "Singapore". However, if you really don't want to be in the rat race for your whole life, or even half of it, I can only offer you an advice: "If you live your life the way most people do, your life will be lived the way most people do." <br> <br><br><span style="color: #888888;">I do hang out with friends but most of the time, I am alone by myself. I feel stress when someone wants to get to know me or wants to be my partner. I don't just go for anybody as you can refer back to my previous paragraph.</span><br>You think you deserve someone who needs to be good enough for you, but yet you worry you may not be good enough for him or her. Find your self-worth, and you'll be out of this dilemma.<br> <br><br><span style="color: #888888;">i don't have a specific aim but even if I do, the people factor is always the obstacle.</span><br>What aims do you have? Every goal has its obstacle. The challenge is to get past it. What's the point if you're the only player on the field sending a ball straight into the goal post?</p>

              <p>Well written, amigo. For once, you're definitely no social retard, you expressed yourself well <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"> I'm certain if you try hard enough, you'd be able to articulate and get your points across to people tactfully in reality. </p>
              <p>Now, let's try to tackle one problem at a time. </p>
              <p>Pertaining to your financial plight, have you tried communicating with the management to let you clock more hours? Do let them know that you're tight, hardly surviving and request for extra hours; I'm sure the management would aid in this area. Otherwise, you may need to get an extra part-time job to set your finances straight - of course, this is no long-term solution.</p>
              <p>I can understand your cynicalness; you probably tried to blend into the world before, but people and things continue to disappoint or even disgust you (unfortunate, really). I can't give you much advice on this, for this may be the way you chose to live your life. But I hope you will try to open up yourself, take baby steps and learn acceptance. I'm certain that you'll be a happier person when you learn to come to terms to things</p>
              <p>You mentioned that you lacked a decent certificate? If it's no too personal (you may pm me, if it's not convenient), may I ask your qualifications? It's my belief that education is the surest way out of poverty, have you considered going back to school? Is there any subject you're interested in? Cite a few examples "journalism", "mass communication" and "business"? I'd encourage you to pursue something you're passionate about while you're still young and all.</p>
              <p>It's commendable that you do not want to partake in the rat race; I'm heartened that the ways of the world doesn't have that great an effect on you <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="icon_biggrin.gif"> After all, 70 odd years is what we have, life is too short! Then again, it's not unusual you sometimes would think bout the 'comfortable and stable' lifestyle, it's not spilt personality - don't worry!</p>
              <p>The first step out of our comfort zone is probably the most difficult, but I'm sure things will be fine bit by bit. First, work on your short-term financial problem. Then, it'd be time to think of the big picture, sit down with yourself and plan out your life. Baby steps, friend... and I'm sure you'll get to your destination <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="icon_razz.gif"> And remember, the people factor will always be an obstacle, if you don't open up yourself and accept them.</p>
              <p>Good luck!</p>

              <p>Habits and be learned. Who are the people that you admire? Someone with good charisma? Learn the way how they portray, express themselves and how they speak.</p>
              <p>In life, we can never stop learning. Never stop seeking what you love and like to do.</p>
              <p>I love simplicity too. Humans have a perverse characteristic to make simple things complicated.</p>
              <p>Keep your job, find meaningful things to do on your free time. Lastly, try to open up a little to others whom you trust. That is the first step. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/biggrin.png" alt="biggrin.png"></p>
