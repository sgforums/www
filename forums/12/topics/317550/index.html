              <p>Well.. i have to get this off my chest, its been a burden and im suffocating from carrying it all around..</p>
              <p>i met this girl on the bus, i went up to her and chatted her up.. took her email, name and handphone number..</p>
              <p>the email was her true email, but the handphone number wasnt.. it belonged to a girl who said she didnt know who was the girl i met.. I confronted her through the email, she didnt reply. I did abit of surfing and found her blog, shes attached.. well, i mean we could have been just friends right? Not that im  looking for a relationship of BF/GF nature with her.. if she didnt want to be friends with me she could have just told me.. not give me some fake number for me to call..</p>
              <p>Now its been bothering me so much.. bad news along with bad news been piling up..<br>Sometimes i think im so childish, even though im 21 years of age, i have no successes in life.. i cant get a place in the course of my choice in Uni, my diploma scores suck , i barely scrapped a pass. I dont have much friends in the first place, trying to make friends and it doesnt work, no girlfriend ever before, my existing friends all drifting away from me.. I used to like computers games so much, nowadays i got no mood to even pick up my psp and play..</p>
              <p>Anyone can help me turn this situation round?  i think im going mad from all these..</p>
              <p>"two shots of hate from a mouth as loud as a gun,<br>like an assasin ... who does it for fun.<br>two deafening blows in a war that has just begun,<br>life gone away...i'm done.<br>two red roses sitting on my coffin, the wind blows, leaving only one<br>the world i know disappears...like the setting sun." ~ Alone</p>

              <p>It's just an incident.... dont let it bother you and prevent you from getting on with your life<br></p>
              <p>On a positive side, you managed to chat her up, know her name and get her email and 'number'. How many guys here have the guts to do it? (ok lookin at the threads here)  <br>For this, you deserve a thumbs up. +1 for guts.<br></p>
              <p>Some girls are like that. They dont know how to reject a stranger's invitation and have doubts in giving her mobile number to you. Hence the fake number. It's pretty rude anyway, but at least you got her email. (im not sure if she responds to you in MSN though)<br>Anyway, in my opinion, local girls (not all) are pretty hostile towards strangers in making friends with them. <br></p>
              <p>You're the only one who can help yourself and turn the situation around. If the girl doesnt respond to you in MSN, then forget bout her. There are more girls out there, dont let this one girl to disrupt your life....<br></p>
              <p>Have more confidence in yourself in making friends and also do something bout your social life instead of sulking. It's all in your mind, if you think you're a failure, you will be always. It's your thinking, mentality. Hence it's time to sit down and think what to do with your life? Anyway, a good sleep can make you think better.</p>

              <p>I never say it's impossible to be platonic or humans are not attracted to beautiful things. it's just that if you are really out for friendship, there shouldn't be disappointment when you know she got a boyfriend.</p>
              <p>nobody likes confrontations. maybe she wants to get to know you more on emails or msn before giving you her real number? or maybe she don't want her bf to think too much when you call her at the wrong times?</p>
              <p>you didn't think on her part before you confront her isn't it? all you did was "why she like this why she like that". She also didn't give you her blog address, however you searched and scanned and spied, and use those information you got to know about to confront her. Do you think that is right?</p>
              <p>you make her feel like a criminal or suspect lo. Just get to know her on a bus and expect everything from her with your so-called "platonic friendship".</p>

              <p>You're coming on too strong dude.</p>
              <p>You think what, you god gift to women meh ? Just because you approach means girls must reciprocate your affection ah ?</p>
              <p>No ok ?</p>
              <p>When you figured out her number was fake.. you shoulda keep quiet. Confront her for wat ? Very hero issit ? </p>
              <p>You got her email, she already very pan chan you liao. Now you go search her blog, you betta keep quiet about what you found.. else she will know you are a stalker !</p>
              <p>You say you want to be friend, then just be a friend. Expect so much will only make girls irritated with you. OK ? Good.</p>
