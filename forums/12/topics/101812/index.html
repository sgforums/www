            <div class='col-md body'>Should i give her up, forget abt her and carry on? Or just be friends? Or dun give up and wait patiently?<br><br>I just broke up with my gf a week ago.We have been together for more than 2 yrs. Throughout this time i have been very good to her, she is to me too. We seldom quarrel and have been very happy and loving. We always felt that we will get marry each other in the end. But..<br><br>She has been working for about a yr. As a depress and pessimistic girl, she always have many thing to complain especially when she just started work. Everytime, i will listen patiently to her, help her think so solutions, calm her down and make her feel better. As time goes by, she became better, problems from work was lesser. And our conversations are also getting shorter. We begin to have <strong>communication problem </strong>as we didnt have much common topic to talk about. She tried her best to hang on but i didnt realised it till its too late..<br><br>She became very close to an ex colleague. I knew it and complain abt it to her. but she keep assuring me that they are just patonic friends. As i know she loves me alot, so i believed her. but all the while i was quite uneasy abt it. she was afraid that i will be very miserable so she begin to lie to me abt going out with him. But everytime i would know about it as she dunno how to lie and will end up quarreling with her.<br><br>One night, we went out with him again. i found out and was very hurt and angry. i went down immediately to look for her. we talk abt it and she told me they have some time cross the line of being friends. She was moved by him.<br>she was confused abt it and was really sorry and want me to give her time to sort out her feelings. So i sent her back home. When i reach home, i called her but she didnt pick up for very long. i was worried and went around looking for her. In the end, she called me. she was at the movies with the guy. She said that her feeling for me was always the same but she felt even more for the guy. She is able to click emotionally with him!<br><br>We didnt broke up immediately though.. i didnt want to give her up.this is what she had always taught me. i tried to win her back. she was touched but also guilty. But one day i found out that she send a love letter to the guy.. When i knew it i was very angry, felt cheated and hurt. I confronted her and in the end we broke up.. broke up the night before my exam..<br><br>Though i was angry at the night, but all the anger and hate was gone by the next day. i started to miss her.. i still love her.. i regretted that i confronted her that night as that marked the end of everything.. she is still not together with him yet. but i know its soon or later. i felt that i have given her up, given my chance up. I know that she wont turn back. she always felt that <strong>a r/s with a scar will never have a good ending</strong>.. is this true?? But is it possible for a r/s to never have a scar??<br><br></div>

Either learn to accept  and grow in r/s, or just move on.<br>Time and maturity are the best medication for healing.<br><br>For you, the only thing I sense is that you are not letting go, you are the only person who is still there trying ways to patch up the r/s.

You said you went out with both of them and you are hurt abt it?? If there is no typo error there, should you not haven taken the chance to know him better and make it clear that at that point of time, you are attached with her?<br><br>From where you are standing, we can see that you are kinda scared and in secure of what she is doing.. 2 years of a relationship should be something that you know how firm is it.. The way you put yourself in this relation ship is like someone who has just started one.. and not sure of whether she will run off with another guy...<br><br>I don't blame you for feeling sad or angry when she sent that love letter to that guy.. Cause no matter what, at that point of time when she sents the letter, she is still attached to you.. That is an "indirect at of being unfaithful". Anyway, at the rate things are between you 2 now, you are standing on a thin line.. if things turn out very well and she wants to be back with you, she will come back to you.. But something I would like to advice you first.. The scar will always be there.. There is no such thing as not feeling awkward when something bad has happened..<br><br>What you can do is maybe drop 1 or 2 hints that you wan to get back to her.. Unless you really are firm abt your decision that you wanna leave her for good and vice versa..<br><br>Good luck. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
