            <div class='col-md body'>i am currently a poly student at NP..takin a course quality assurance engineering,as my family is juz able to make ends meet i decided to sign on the army under the polytechnic sponsorship thing, as i do not want to stress my parents by getting pocket money every month.and also becos i interested in a particular vocation which is automotive engineering specialist.involing mataining and repairing vechicles in the army. i have given it a thought and is interested in it and cos in signing on there is a 10 yr bond and if next time when the bond is ending and  i die die dun feel like staying wif saf i can come out and work as car mechanic as wat i learned inside 4 the 10 years is good experience and i suppose i wont have too hard a problem looking for jobs if i come out,or if i like life inside i will stay there.and recently i went to fill in the forms to sign on and few weeks later i recieve a letter saying my course facutly is not relevant to the vocation i applied.darn i was feeling down that means if i want to sign the vocation i have to change a course to like mechancial egr , electronic egr those course and i had alread i complete a yr of study of my current course.part of the reason i want to sign is becos of the money i suppose most pple who sign up is becos of the money,and i am not makin a rash decision juz becoz i need the money.i am given it a thought wether i will take it in the long run of a 10 yr bond.and reason i want to sign on becoz my coz dun really have good prospects and my standant is those average results that pass averagely.pple want to hire also hire pple wif better results.and the market of QA engineering is not veri big ..lets say a company ,it doesnt needs a lot of quality inspectors,juz need a few to conduct quality checks tats why i tink prospects are not veri good.<br>all mistake is tat i did not consider the coz properly before applyingfor tis current coz , i was like juz taking it for the sake of going poly.<br><br>and i had another alternative which is to sign on under combat ,those chiong sua type.i wouldnl't prefer tat,as i tink u sign on as those chiong sua type if next time u die die want to come out after 10 yrs wat can u do?will pple employ u to teach pple how to chiong sua?or else stay all the way inside till u retire.<br><br>now i am in a dilema and stressful for me these few dayz..tinking wether should i have to change of coz,which means going back to yr 1 starting anew  with new frenz new environment wasting a yr and i could pursue wat i want to be in future wat i am interested in doing,or sign on a combat vocation,dun have to waste studying a yr ,faster to get cash from saf coz under the sponsorship i will get $1200 as allowance. as i am finacnally veri tight.<br><br>advise will be deeply appreciated</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hmm.. FOr me I would say that the best is to really decide which path you really want to take and not regret it after that. Look at it this way, if you waste a year to study a new course again is better than wasting more years ahead of you struggling to make ends meet, which one do you think is more worth it?? Besides, if your interest in mechanical engineering, you would have a larger interest in getting good grades for that field, rather that doing something that you don't like and only telling yourself 'if only you had dones this or you have done that.'<br><br>It's good to hear that you do not have much trouble financially within your family, as it will be a pretty crucial factor for your decision. However, look at it this way. you lose the $1,200, but only to gain more, assuming that your foresight is not wrong the prospects of the 2 courses.<br><br>I would say, it's better that you really check things in more detail first esp with the QA engineering part, as you seemed to be giving only some very -ve comments about it, while promoting the mechanical and eletrical engineering courses. It's better for you be sure and clear of the courses and prospects first before you make the decision. Personally, I feel that there's some biasness in your decision now, that's why I really urge you to look things up. On the other hand, I'm not into the field to give you advise about what you should take. Maybe someone else is more knowledgeable in it to give a better description.<br><br>However, if what you have said is all true, I would say it's better that you change your course, as it's better to rectify things now than later you regret or even proceed further into the wrong path and thinking how you wish you have done that, and it will even hinder your interest in pursuing your current education.<br><br>Seriously, I really hope you will get a balanced overall view first before making a decision. Besides now you have the time, as it's the hols, so just do all these research first. You procastinate, it will only affect your own future. That is something only you can carve out for yourself, and no one can help you with.<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)

I don't believe anything's really wasted in life... Especially when you're still young...<br><br>Having said that you've already given serious thoughts about what you would like to do for now and what you would like to do in the future, I think you should just cling on to your option while keeping an open mind for any other possible options or changes in the future... Future is always UNCERTAIN... What more talking about 10 years down the line...? QA field saturated? How about Mechanics field?<br><br>About your 1 year of course in QA, you mentioned lots of ADJUSTMENT and starting over again... Shouldn't worry too much...? These things usually inevitable in life.... Not to mention 10 years in SAF... Though I have to admit that mechanic life in SAF can be pretty 'routine' in SAF if there ain't major changes...? And life would just sail pass like a breeze...?<br><br>And since you've mentioned that QA might not turn out to be a good course, you can consider other courses...? If ultimately, electronics and mechanic courses are not what you want to pursue, you can always try to pick up night classes during your 10 years in SAF...? (Though I have to admit that it's not gonna be easy... BUT yes, I've seen people did it before...)<br><br>Oh well... Good luck to you? Sorry I can't give any pro advice here? If you like you might wanna check out with more SAF regulars ESPECIALLY those mechanics..?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Automotive means u be at the MT line, that means u be in an Eng Check there after 3-4yrs. U have to co-odinate logistics like petrol spare parts and ur men not that easy leh.<br><br>Plus SAF vehicles are like some baby to them accident nia got big problem liao. If u change oil and tyre for 30 - 40 Three tonners then u'll get the picture.<br><br>how about a signals vocation or something in air force to maintain their systems thats pretty good too.</div>
