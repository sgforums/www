              <p>CoffeeLindy, Since everything was in the past. You should not be so worried by this. He told you because he is true to you. It not like he is being unfaithful to you.</p>
              <p>There are no guys that are not horny, its a matter of self control in a moment of lust.</p>

              <p>You can't change his past, but you can shape your own future.</p>
              <p>This must be your first relationship with a guy ? Most newbies make the same mistake as you.</p>
              <p>Next time, make sure the guy is a virgin before you go into a relationship with him. And ensure he meets your other requirements which are important to you.</p>
              <p>Choosing a guy for a relationship is like buying a house.</p>
              <p>We all live and learn. It's either you dump him or you make lemonades out of lemons.</p>

              <p>Hi Coffeelindy,</p>
              <p>Since you have already come to the conclusion that you are unable to accept his past, you will only be bringing more unhappiness to yourself in this relationship by letting it be, and you will also be fooling your boyfriend into thinking that the two of you will have a bright future together.</p>
              <p>It is painful to let go of him now, but it will be better to do so than to let the unhappiness build up gradually within yourself, which will also eventually lead to the same ending later. You must also understand that it is unfair to him too, to be together with you in a downward sliding relationship without realising it himself.</p>
              <p>I sincerely hope that you will make the right choice.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>How I wish your bf would keep his mouth shut! What use is there to tell you any of this? What use to the relationship to tell you his history?</p>
              <p>Well, the mess is only caused in your head. Like Russell Peters says, women sometimes think too much. Get over it girl. How big this issue is entirely up to how big you want to define it. I personally think since he has already opened to you, he's just being real with you. I would prefer him to keep quiet and not talk too much.</p>
              <p>If you die die cannot tahan his past, then by all means leave him and don't waste each other's time. Else, just accept it and move on. Really, it's all up to you.</p>

              <p>Well Lindy,</p>
              <p>The good news is... you are not married to him yet. And there's no children involve.</p>
              <p>Returning him to the shelf is an easy option. Fortunately, the "return policy" is still available for you at this life phase. </p>
              <p>Don't force yourself to accept a "defective" item, what is important is you must be "happy" with your purchase.</p>
              <p>If he ask, you don't have to give much explanation, just tell him, after getting to know him more.. you realise you are both "incompatible". And leave it at that.</p>

              <p>coffeelindy....</p>
              <p>its good to chat about each other past and try to understand more about each other liking but sometimes too much exposure it not usually good...most poeple think that they can accept whatever their bf or gf did in the past (before they are together) but believe me, once you started to like him alot, you will mind even small little thing he did...</p>
              <p>sssppp....im telling you this becouse i've gone through the same thing before but after reliased that my curiosity is hurting me-i stop no matter how much i wanted to know,let it go. talk to him and tell him about your concern, gd luck</p>
