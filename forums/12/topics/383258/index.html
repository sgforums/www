              <p><br>I second that. By him willing to divulge his past to you, it means that he is really being honest with you and he wants no secrets between the both of you. And sadly, not many men are like that. And if you can't accept his past, then why did you accept him in the first place? Put yourself in his shoes and spare a thought for him...</p>

              <p>They werent together in the first place. He did it before i got to know him. He was very curious and also under peer pressure during his army, he decided to try it out for once. And he did keep to it. He did not contact her already.</p>
              <p>yup, i understand that the past is the past moreover when he did that, he did not even knew me then. im trying to get over it.</p>
              <p>but saying is easy, achieving it is hard.</p>
              <p>i wish to get some advice on how to stop thinking about it. sigh..</p>
              <p>wanderer:</p>
              <p>I understand your point that by willing to tell me all his dark secrets, he is really serious about being with me. I can feel that. and i agree that not many guys are like that nowadays. i really appreciate his honesty to me.</p>
              <p>i accepted him because at that time i thought i could accept it. Moreover, at that time, i didnt really think about that issue until when we get to know each other more and the love builds up, i realised i start to mind about that issue ALOT.</p>
              <p>im trying to understand. But i just couldnt get rid of thinking about it. i keep imagining them being intimate and it really hurts me.</p>

              <p>Hi Coffeelindy,</p>
              <p>Loving someone technically means that one is able to accept everything about his or her past and not mind it at all. But to be truthful to you, that is something which very few people can do. Thus, most people choose to not think about it and let the past be.</p>
              <p>This applies not only to your other half, but also to everyone around you. Sometimes, deep inside your heart, there is a tiny part of you unwilling to forgive that person for what he or she did in the past. Hence, if you are unable to cleanse this tiny part of your heart, the next best thing you can do is to bury it, unless you wish to carry this grudge or unhappiness with you around all the time.</p>
              <p>The present moment is a time of utmost importance for you - You must decide whether you will want to let the past be and continue this relationship, or you will rather end it here because you are unable to let go.</p>
              <p>Please do pardon me for saying so, but do remember, if you are to end your relationship here and now, your time with your current other half will become part of your "history" as well.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> You are experiencing disequilibrium in managing your beliefs against this new input forced into your thoughts. Your difficulty stem from having to reconcile these two different set of values into a harmonious equation. Unless there is a shift of perception (or adoption of some newly constructed ones) - you will behave/react/feel in a way as if your boyfriend has cheated on you, which is of course detrimental to the growth of your love.</p>
              <p>Personally, I do not think it's wise to share events that occurred in the past, ESPECIALLY if it doesn't value add the relationship. Some people think that they are being 100% open about themselves, but that's terrible one-sided because no matter what we think we have communicated, we are never 100% open. (Some people intentionally communicate such information, but that is another topic altogether and I won't touch on that here).</p>
              <p>The other side of the coin (which is the greater evil) is that there are even more people who can't handle certain 'truth', even if it's in the past. I will explain a little: it's paramount that we maintain an open honest relationship with our current love. However the catch is that this responsibility only covers our current relationship - it doesn't mean that we should regress and extend this coverage into the past - ad infinitum. </p>
              <p>The goal of love should always be forward looking - in regression, we could only seek to achieve little.</p>
              <p>My lecturer once told me that when he was younger, he smoke pot - once. He doesn't like it and still grows up like any other law-bidding citizen in the country. Having to experiment it once doesn't make him a drug addict. You see, many people get into fights, steal or do stupid things when they are younger, but that doesn't necessary mean that they are potential violent murderers/robbers/thief (of course, unless the behaviour is reinforced in regular negative pattern and conditioned by their environment) because if so, most of us are in fact criminals.</p>
              <p>We need to consider the component of a person's ability to evolve themselves, especially if it's just a one time off. Of course, this principle is less reliable if your boyfriend has history of engaging in ONS as compared to a one time off situation.     </p>
              <p>You are definitely entitled to your own beliefs and feelings. Just that, with all that focus onto his past, you could have spend that same deal of energy into making this relationship meaningful for the both of you.</p>
              <p>Having a deontology belief, imho, does not relate to every case. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> You are experiencing disequilibrium in managing your beliefs against this new input forced into your thoughts. Your difficulty stem from having to reconcile these two different set of values into a harmonious equation. Unless there is a shift of perception (or adoption of some newly constructed ones) - you will behave/react/feel in a way as if your boyfriend has cheated on you, which is of course detrimental to the growth of your love.</p>
              <p>Personally, I do not think it's wise to share events that occurred in the past, ESPECIALLY if it doesn't value add the relationship. Some people think that they are being 100% open about themselves, but that's terrible one-sided because no matter what we think we have communicated, we are never 100% open. (Some people intentionally communicate such information, but that is another topic altogether and I won't touch on that here).</p>
              <p>The other side of the coin (which is the greater evil) is that there are even more people who can't handle certain 'truth', even if it's in the past. I will explain a little: it's paramount that we maintain an open honest relationship with our current love. However the catch is that this responsibility only covers our current relationship - it doesn't mean that we should regress and extend this coverage into the past - ad infinitum. </p>
              <p>The goal of love should always be forward looking - in regression, we could only seek to achieve little.</p>
              <p>My lecturer once told me that when he was younger, he smoke pot - once. He doesn't like it and still grows up like any other law-bidding citizen in the country. Having to experiment it once doesn't make him a drug addict. You see, many people get into fights, steal or do stupid things when they are younger, but that doesn't necessary mean that they are potential violent murderers/robbers/thief (of course, unless the behaviour is reinforced in regular negative pattern and conditioned by their environment) because if so, most of us are in fact criminals.</p>
              <p>We need to consider the component of a person's ability to evolve themselves, especially if it's just a one time off. Of course, this principle is less reliable if your boyfriend has history of engaging in ONS as compared to a one time off situation.     </p>
              <p>You are definitely entitled to your own beliefs and feelings. Just that, with all that focus onto his past, you could have spend that same deal of energy into making this relationship meaningful for the both of you.</p>
              <p>Having a deontology belief, imho, does not relate to every case. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>i really appreciate your words of advice and analysis :) thanks!</p>
              <p>what you said about putting two sets of values together into a harmonious equation is very true.</p>
              <p>i feel like its a blow to my expectations of him being a good bf. He is very very good to me. But yet there is this other side of him that i find it really hard to accept. No doubt its his past, but haiz...</p>

              <p>Ask one no questions of the past..and he will tell you no lies...</p>
              <p>Truth at times can be painful, but it will set you free, for within you lies the freedom of choice. Once that informed choice is made, there must be no regrets, or even more pain of the 'what ifs' will crash you like a raging tide upon a rocky shore...<br>To continue on, is to live with a truth you cannot live with. To leave..is another truth you cannot live with. Thus your confusion and hesitation, a decision you are in reality, not matured enough to make..</p>
              <p>That truth will always gnaw at your mind if you continue on, inhibiting you, preventing you to love him totally, imagining past scenes, feeling dirty each time he touches you physically...</p>
              <p>To leave, you will fear losing something that you cherish and treasure, for he is a good man, and that you may never find another like him..</p>
              <p>Think not only about your feelings, but think about his feelings too. The knife of truth stabs and remains painfully deep in your heart, and will only cause you to quietly distance yourself from him and his intimacy towards you. He too, will feel hurt by your distance and withdrawal.</p>
              <p>Both of you will be in pain. You by the truth, and him, by revealing it to you. Unfortunately, the truth once spoken, cannot be wiped away. Walk away, and let time and distance heal, and to find love, with each other again or with another, then to live now close to each other in pain and misery.... </p>

              <p>Hi Coffeelindy,</p>
              <p>Since you have already come to the conclusion that you are unable to accept his past, you will only be bringing more unhappiness to yourself in this relationship by letting it be, and you will also be fooling your boyfriend into thinking that the two of you will have a bright future together.</p>
              <p>It is painful to let go of him now, but it will be better to do so than to let the unhappiness build up gradually within yourself, which will also eventually lead to the same ending later. You must also understand that it is unfair to him too, to be together with you in a downward sliding relationship without realising it himself.</p>
              <p>I sincerely hope that you will make the right choice.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>
