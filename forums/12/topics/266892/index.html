            <div class='col-md body'>I like a girl very much , whom is in my class , she knows that i like her but i on the other hand dont know whether she likes me .<br><br>When i asked her best friend who she like , her best friend just said it was someone from the class and on further asking her best friend told me that the person might be me . But i always feel that i was not the one .<br><br>We did exchange smses and she would 100% reply , but after some time i stopped smsing because i feel that i might be an irritant to her cause it's always about the same things and i dont have the courage to find out more about her afraid that it would scare her away .<br><br>I did told her i was from a broken family and shared the problems with her , she was willing to be a listening ear and encouraged me .<br><br>So one night on msn , i plucked up enough courage to confess to her , but she told me that some things are not meant to be said and it's already good enough if we know it's from our heart and i told her that she might not feel the same way as i do but i have to tell her that i like her . So she said Â¡Â®Ã“Ã�Ã�Â©Â¶Â«ÃŽÃ·ÃŠÃ‡Ã�Ã¨Ã’ÂªÃŒÃ¬ÃŠÂ±ÂµÃ˜Ã€Ã»ÃˆÃ‹ÂºÃ�ÂµÃ„' , i was confused by what she meant in that sentence .<br><br>She told her best friend the next day , and one day while going home on the bus without her presence , her best friend told me that she told her about the confession i did that night and her best friend told me that she didn't believe what i said was true and her best friend told me to give her more time and try confessing again after a few weeks .<br><br>But since then i told myself , since she doubt the love from me , i would not hurt myself from trying to hard to win her heart . Because the last time i actually like someone , it lasted for six years and when i was rejected 3 times during the period , i took a long time to recover from the last rejection and made myself to stop thinking of her .<br><br>Now i have been not that close to her like talking in class , smsing her , talking to her on msn and stuffs like that . She told her best friend about it and her best friend came to tell me that she feel the coldness from me to her .<br><br>And ever since i told myself that i need to concentrate on my studies and not having a relationship but everytime i see her and i knew she's the one for me but all these things just stop me from going on .<br><br>What should i do ? And what does she really mean in that chinese sentence ?<br>Did she show little or no interest in me or was she just pity-ing me cause i was from a broken family ?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well dude,<br><br>Think of this in this way: Rejection make me stronger, so is ok to be rejected. I am rejected lots of time liao and i am feeling stronger each time.<br><br>Anyway, all girls are one kind and i really mean ALL normal girls. I am prepared to be flamed but ok the thing is they won't say anything hurtful to the person who loved them and so they like to beat around the bush. As such, we guy are confused whether they are giving us a chance, they need more time or they dun like us at all. Hence, the lesson i learn is not to invest too much feeling on a girl first (be it she is ur current gf a not), only when u are certain that she really likes u and cannot bare leaving u, then that is the time u should invest ur time in the relationship wholeheartedly.<br><br>TS, just take this as a lesson learned. I have learned mine long ago and now is ur turn to experience it. Dun let this small challenge beats u, there are more fulfilling thing in life than just relationship<br><br>Cheers</div>
