              <p>I have a live-in boy friend for more than 2 years. I used to pay for everything in the household and i owned the apartment. Last year, i decided to quit my job and take a breather for two years or so. I will be surviving on my own savings. The issue is that my boy friend doesn’t contribute to the household other than paying the utilities bill. I pay for the mortagage loan naturally as it is my property, i also pay for the groceries, food, cable tv etc. Now that i am not working, i really hope that he will start contributing more. Well, i hinted once, he felt “hurt” that i implied that he was “leeching” on me, which i had never meant that in anyway. He is the ego type of man. After that incident, he still does not initiate to contribute more. As i have been cooking at home at least three times a week, i am actually spending more because he always likes expensive steamed fish. Recently, i hinted to him again that eating at home is healthier but it can also be more expensive. Then he suggested that we go his mom’s pl every sat for dinner and he will pay her extra for the meal on top of his monthly $1k allowance. I am very disappointed that he feels necessary to pay his mom for 1 meal but never thought of contibuting to our meals! Sometimes, he even makes me pay for his shopping!</p>
              <p>Is it too much to ask him to contribute more and ow not to make him feel that i am too calculative. But i really need to be careful with my spending and hope that he can help out.</p>
