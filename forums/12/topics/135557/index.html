            <div class='col-md body'>I knw hw u feel. Last time I had a gf, she was having party and feel asleep on the couch. And she woke up because her thai flatmate was touching her all over her body. It made me so fu*kin pissed off. Worse thing was I was overseas so I cant really do anything about it. I forced her to go to the police..even ask her friends to bring her to the police to make report...But those idiotic stupid friends and her said police wont do anything. It made me even more angry because of their unwillingness. Finally I accepted a compromise that she report it to the landlord. The landlord kicked the flatmate out and reported it to the thai as*hole's employer so the employer fired him.<br><br>Of cause this is just tip of the iceberg..I cant let it go so easily..but being overseas I was powerless to do much. So I called two of my thug-type friends n help me beat that lowlife up. And they did. But the worse things is, it takes alot of strength and forgiveness to forget what happened.</div>

No where to rest ? something is fishy based on the situations that you had described. What about her parents ?  In such cases, it is best to report to the police. Let them determine whether what happened.<br><br>And if there is penetration, whether it is really rape or  ( sorry to say this ) its consentual but your GF regret it later and claim rape. And how to determine it is really rape or consentual ?  I think you will know it better yourself based on your knowledge of your GF. Did she and her EX had sex too? No need to tell us . But with this knowledge, I guess you can roughly gauge for yourself if its a case of consentual sex but claimed rape case.<br><br>If its really rape, then report it. Let the guy be jailed. The " holiday makers in Changi chalet " HATE people convicted of rape and molest cases. They will treat such convicts " well ". When I still serving NS last time, 1 of my man convicted to selling pirated VCD, said they like to " massage " those convicted to sex crimes on almost a daily basis when they just arrive.<br><br>If it not rape, but a case of consentual but claimed rape case, brother I think you know what to do. In any case, you have nothing to lose by reporting. And if your GF is really raped, all the more shld report it. Take care bro...</div>
