              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span><strong><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Is Singapore really a SAFE country?  I was ROBBED...........</span></strong></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"We have the name of a safe and democratic country".  I truly agree to this until I was ROBBED yesterday.  </span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I am staying in the HDB flat in Blk 140 Jalan Bukit Merah.  I always thought that the residents here are happy and well taken care of as it's always a walkover town council.  However I was WRONG!</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I was robbed by an ARMED robber in the lift yesterday. At the moment desperation, I wanted to shout for help.  However, the lift in my flat is fully covered and does not allow me to be seen by the public.  I had no choice but to hand over my belongings to the robber.</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I reported police after the incident and was amazed to understand that there were at least 3 reported robbery cases that occurred over the past 6 months.  This is totally not ACCEPTABLE!</span></span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">My estate has a lot of old folks who are the most vulnerable and needed extra security. I urged the public for awareness to voice out on a better security systems that needs to be done for us.</span></span></p>
              <ul type="disc">
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; color: black;    "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As per my understanding from the residents, the request to install a CCTV at the lift lobby or car park area was declined due to the costs of maintaining them.  We are all tax payers and I guess the least I should expect from a country is security.</span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; color: black;    "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The lift door should be upgraded with clear glass so that one can be seen from inside in the case of emergency.</span></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; color: black;    "><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Although the neighborhood police post, Cantonment/ Jalan Bukit Merah is so near my flat, I do not see any policeman patrolling this area.  Why is this so???</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">These are the minimum a country with well known standards should provide-SECURITY. And I really hope something can be done to the estate before other severe CRIME happens AGAIN! I seriously doubt the security in this area is very well taken care of! We expect to have a safe living environment our country.</span></span></p>

              country?  I was ROBBED...........</span></strong></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">"We
              have the name of a safe and democratic country".  I truly
              agree to this until I was ROBBED yesterday. </span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I am
              staying in the HDB flat in Blk 140 Jalan Bukit Merah.  I
              always thought that the residents here are happy and well taken
              care of as it's always a walkover town council.  However I was
              WRONG!</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I was
              robbed by an ARMED robber in the lift yesterday. At the
              moment desperation, I wanted to shout for help.  However,
              the lift in my flat is fully covered and does not
              allow me to be seen by the public.  I had no choice but to
              hand over my belongings to the robber.</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I
              reported police after the incident and was amazed to
              understand that there were at least 3 reported robbery cases
              that occurred over the past 6 months.  This is totally not
              ACCEPTABLE!</span></span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">My estate has a lot of old
              folks who are the most vulnerable and needed extra
              security. I urged the public for awareness to voice out on a
              better security systems that needs to be done for
              us.</span></span></p>
              <ul>
              <li style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; color: black;"> <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">As per my understanding
              from the residents, the request to install a CCTV at the lift lobby
              or car park area was declined due to the costs of maintaining
              them.  We are all tax payers and I guess the least I should
              expect from a country is security.</span></li>
              <li style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; color: black;"> <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The lift door should be
              upgraded with clear glass so that one can be seen from inside in
              the case of emergency.</span></li>
              <li style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt; color: black;"> <span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Although the
              neighborhood police post, Cantonment/ Jalan Bukit Merah is so near
              my flat, I do not see any policeman
              patrolling this area.  Why is this so???</span></li>
              </ul>
              <p style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: black;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">These
              are the minimum a country with well known standards should
              provide-SECURITY. And I really hope something can be done to the
              estate before other severe CRIME happens AGAIN! I seriously doubt
              the security in this area is very well taken care
              of! We expect to have a safe living environment our
              country.</span></span></p>

              <p>just curious..</p>
              <p>does it means clear glass, will not have crimes?</p>
              <p>will CCTV deter crimes? to me, it will not prevent, but just makes finding the culprit easiler but then if they are foreigners, it may be a bit harder.</p>
              <p>same, in bishan, there is a police post but they are not open @ night, if any problem you are supposed to rush there and use the red phone..</p>

              <p><strong>By Teh Joo Lin &amp; Arlina Arshad</strong></p>
              <p><img src="http://www.asiaone.com/a1media/news/07Jul08/images/20080729.103020_meninblue.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="175"></p>
              <p>A BAG left on an MRT station platform used to be something train station staff would be saddled with as part of their 'lost and found' service.</p>
              <p>That was before 9/11.</p>
              <p>Today, the police can be called in, the area cordoned off and, if need be, bomb-disposal experts summoned as well.</p>
              <p>'It's a totally different ball game,' said Station Inspector Nazri Abdul Karim from the Bukit Panjang Neighbourhood Police Centre.</p>
              <p>All angles have to be considered, without much extra time or resources.</p>
              <p>And it is taking its toll on the men in blue.</p>
              <p>'While difficult to quantify, the psychological and physical fatigue within the usual working hours is palpable', a police spokesman told The Straits Times.</p>
              <p>A large part of the added strain on the force comes from the series of manpower-sapping security deployments they are called upon to provide when Singapore plays host to mega events, like last week's Asean Ministerial Meeting, which tied up some 2,000 officers for eight days, with security round the clock.</p>
              <p>Although the demands on the force have gone up, the numbers have not.</p>
              <p>There were 12,516 full-time officers in service last year, a slight drop compared to the 13,377 in 2004.</p>
              <p>But over the years, Singapore's population has swelled.</p>
              <p>The resident population hit 4.68 million last year as the number of foreigners here crossed the one-million mark for the first time.</p>
              <p>Their arrival and their language and cultural differences add another layer to the complexity of the job of policing.</p>
              <p>To help ease the load, the force turns to its pool of national servicemen and volunteers.</p>
              <p>During the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings in 2006, about 5,000 police reservists were recalled for an additional two weeks. The police also roped in about 700 voluntary special constabulary officers and 600 auxiliary police officers (APOs).</p>
              <p>Duties have also been outsourced to private security agencies such as Certis Cisco and Aetos. Both companies reported higher demand for their services, resulting in Certis Cisco's APO force growing 41 per cent over the past seven years to reach over 3,600 officers.</p>
              <p>At Aetos, the headcount has doubled to 2,500 men today compared to 2004, when it was formed.</p>
              <p>However, not all police duties can be outsourced, said the Tanglin Police Division's Deputy Superintendent Poon Ngee, who added that the private security forces also had to be supervised by the police.</p>
              <p>For some crowd-control duties, where the threat of a riot is possible, officers from the Special Operations Command, whose unique training cannot be replaced, are called in.</p>
              <p>SI Nazri, an 18-year veteran, said that his workload had 'been increasing gradually' and he now puts in an extra two to four hours for every 12-hour shift.</p>
              <p>'Every morning I leave home and, more often than not, it's a late night and my children are already asleep. They have asked me why I've to work on my day off,' he said.</p>
              <p>Despite the stretched resources, Singapore's police force, with a lower officer-to-population ratio than Hong Kong and New York, manages to keep crime rates here lower than in those cities.</p>
              <p>If that record is to stay intact, Dr Teo Ho Pin, chairman of the Government Parliamentary Committee on Law and Home Affairs believes the police force has to be expanded.</p>
              <p>He said: 'I think we should increase by 20 to 30 per cent the existing workforce, coupled with the use of technology, to prepare for future security threats.'</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>even HongKong where officers perform beat patrol, snatch theft and neighbourhood crimes are common</p>
