It's seriously just about how much you treasure the friendship and whether you wish to forgive and forget... You're now still relatively quiteyoung... As life goes on, you'll realise that as a friend gets closer and closer to you...

            <div class='col-md body'>Betrayal of trust is the most painful tt can ever happen to anyone. A friend who treats you as a friend will nt betray u of ur trust for them. to me this girl is not keeping even as a frien. When she came to you, was out her loneliness or subcousiously unaware that she is giving out wrong signals? Bt obviously when it ended, all she wants you to be is sometink she can rattle everytink to and not interested in a r/s or worse nt even a friend bt someone who she can make use of. She needed someone at the point of her breakdown and u happens to be thr. But what past let it past, you cant revive wat oreadi happened. live ur life to the fullest for ur future.<br><br>Afterall, she aint the only tree in the forest.</div>
