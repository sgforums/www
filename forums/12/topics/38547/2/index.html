I dunno, but maybe is the Cancer Descedant that is in my chart - I very much regret over unsorted issues of feelings, etc revolving past relationships - I always feel that if it was the me NOW - things will be very much different - however to reach to the me NOW - of course I must go through some form of experience ya? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Since you cannot differentiate which is the one that really draws you, etc - go with the flow. Try to get to know people more through interaction, etc, instead of just one. It is like going for a massive jioing for all the potential you have - you will find the among the massive number of people you try knowing - there will be one that is more suitable. Then spend reasonable effort in getting to know more - probably your effort will be rewarded in due time.

Regardless, being yourself is very important. If you are not yourself, people will sense and avoid because they feel that you ain't yourself and is like very 'false' side of you. You can't overnight change that sort of preception you already had for woman. It takes time and real effort.

You are not beyond hope unless you choose to think that way!<br><br>there are 2 approaches u can use rite now. It's gonna be long, but i hope u take some time to read through it.<br><br>You have this mental barrier in you rite now, it all stems from the fecking 4-lettered word called "fear"...fear of rejection is a b!tch, it stops u from doing what u want to do. Though I can't teach you how to remove fear completely, you can learn to shove it aside.<br><br>1) <strong>First method: Confront that b!tch in you called fear</strong><br><br><strong>Now close your eyes and imagine this...</strong><br><br>u saw a beautiful stranger u really like and u are thinking whether u should approach her. Then the fear in you makes u think, "there's no way I can do this...i might get laugh at, what if she rejects me".<br><br>Then u saw her looking at your direction, your instinct tells you you might stand a chance. Then u start having second thoughts again ," Do i really look all rite? do i smell all rite? what if i fark in front of her,,Arrgghhh!! no...im not ready to do this!"<br><br>Before u knew it, the gal was gone and u thought to yourself,"i will never see her again"...u probably felt that <strong>familiar disappointment and pain</strong> in you.<br><br>NOW STOP...I want u to replay that pain and disappointment over and over again in your head...I mean it...close your eyes, repeat and repeat hundred times...dont cheat! really try to feel that pain that had accumulated over so many years.<br><br>Now think about this...there is nothing more painful than to regret about something u ought to have done but never did!!<br><br>So what if she rejects you??? Big deal!! The rejection will NEVER be as painful as the disappointment u felt for so many years.<br><br>Next time u see someone u like, dont ever second guess yourself...go over to her and face rejection. <strong>Remember, you approached her not becos you want her to fall in love with you. You are approaching her cos you never ever want to feel that pain and disappointment anymore! It's not about her...its about you..You...YOU! Thats a big difference.</strong><br><br>Trust me, rejection really not as painful as u thought it might be.<br><br>2) <strong>Concentrate on other aspects of your life</strong><br><br>Be absolutely true to yourself...write down in a list, all the long term plans u have for yourself, your goals and ambitions,new hobbies or exotic places u want to visit, etc...rank them in priority--think about which one is more important to you.<br><br>Cos u find it difficult  to talk to gals and have been alone for so many years, "find myself a GF" is probably one of the tasks at the top of the list.<br>Now i want you to shove that task to the bottom of the list...make it the last thing u are going to do.<br><br>Next, go out and try to do all the things at the <strong>top of the list</strong>...dont worry about finding a GF...its at the bottom of the list, u are going to do it only after u complete the other tasks ie. after u have done the other important things in life.<br><br>This is extremely effective cos as u work through that list of important tasks...and complete them, your self confidence will increase...<br>Most importantly, women will sense it.<br><br>In you, they now see a man who seem to know what he wants and strive hard to achieve in life. There's nothing sexier than a man with self confidence.<br><br>Reading what i have to say is useless my frd...now switch off the computer, go out and do it!!<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
