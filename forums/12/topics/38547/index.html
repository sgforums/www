Media, especially what idol drama, etc plus people around affects and influence the way people yearn for relationship. When you see someone behaving intimately at a corner, subconsciously - your mind actually reacts even though your eyes may avoid. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The only way you can achieve what you wanna achieve is when you fully and totally treat ladies as any of your guy friends - be it pretty, average or whatsoever. You mind habour thoughts is because to you women is a totally mystical entity - you seen people possessing them, but not you. And as a man who knew very little about woman itself - to man - woman is like an isle to be explored. There is this barrier, this distance, which creates this vast chasm <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Actually this isn't a problem normally after when you enter your first relationship. Well, its nature's way to urge people to fall in love, probably marry and create more humans in this world. Don't treat it as a curse - I suggest go with the flow: take things as it is. You can't stop it unless you are gay or your life is revolving on spiritual aspect or Self Actualization - which could substitute for crave for a mate.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Definitely there will be one that will stand above the rest and actually draws me. Maybe not now, but certainly in the future.
