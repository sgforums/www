              <p>BMT I remember that is about  5-6 years ago.</p>
              <p>I experience the same thing. Somehow people like me just dont know how to adapt and obey to orders. Lol. And cannot be trained one.</p>
              <p>I remember at that time I had insomia as I cannot sleep in at all for 3 months as I am not sleeping in my own bed. I have dry cough for 3 months and cannot stop coughing.</p>
              <p>I dont usually talk at all. Even in normal civilian life. So practically I kept everything to myself. Actually even the counsellor, SGT, OC, CO talk to me several times I still kept 80% of my problem to myself.</p>
              <p>The SGT and OC usually leave me alone since I managed to pass all the tests.</p>
              <p>Somehow things passed very quickly in 3 months. <strong>Depression depression loh, as long as the SGT and OC dont cross the line, everything is fine. For me, just leave me alone and dont disturb me and everything is going to fine. <br></strong></p>
              <p>Somehow I was lucky in a warrant company and all the SGT, OC are very understanding and "in fear" of me also. lol. My eyes are like those of tiger and somehow "Ready to Strike".</p>
              <p>Time passed quickly and I managed to POP, strangely with 95% attend B and somehow post to a combat vocation. But things turn out okay. I must thank my SGT, OC, CO and counsellor for their understanding. LOL.</p>
              <p>[Oh I remember my SGTs always say to me: "Dont you ever point the rifle at me! I want to ORD in one piece" Steady! steady! Dont throw the grenade at me! I am going to ORD in 3 months time! ] - LOL.</p>
              <p>I knew that I lost the control of myself and things still turn out to be alright. I think it would be the same for you too.</p>
              <p><strong>I suggest just relax and time pass very quickly. Depress then just depressed. Dont solve a problem is also a solution.  </strong></p>

              <p>well, the SAF system is like this: </p>
              <p>Because the chief clerk
              (civilian) is going to kill the officer-in-charge if he recommend a
              blurcocks to the department. Being a clerk is actually a professional
              skill and there is no blur sotong allowed. And chief clerk are perm
              resident of SAF so if you dont how step on the dog tail you officer
              will die flat by email arrow, die even you ORD.</p>
              <p>Chiong sua units are for the low-life
              disposable people, and let the disposable SGT handle the problem.</p>
              <p>Office politics is a complicated thingy you know. Worse in SAF.</p>

              <p>Be strong and start to really act like a man. So many people go thru NS and they make it out and enjoying their life. Doing whatever they want. Do u want to be like them?</p>
              <p>U can do it too. U mention u have gf? Do her proud. Show to her u can do it too. Its not 10 years or 20 years. Just BMT of 3months and if u r lucky. Will be posted to units which has more laxing working time.</p>
              <p>This is just a first hurdle in yr life. I bet there are more tough one coming ahead. If u have past this one. How are u going to clear the others?</p>

              <p>you see arh...</p>
              <p>two years of NS. no matter what have to go through.</p>
              <p>you think of all the emo shit everyday every hour, cry here cry there still have to go through.</p>
              <p>you work hard, face your problems like a man and refuse to be KO-ed by your problems, you still go thorough the two years.</p>
              <p>me like you, now in NS (though one year already). but it is my firm belief that one can seriously learn lots of meaningful skills and valuable life lessons in NS, precisely because it gives you so much shit.</p>
              <p>dun envy those who seems to have a better life than you. ya, perhaps they have a slacker time, but do you think they can seriously learn anything meaningful out of this two years? If life gets too easy what do you gain? Take the time you are going through now as a test, an opportunity for you to build up your fighting spirit.</p>
              <p>attitude is what separate losers from those who success in life.</p>
              <p>seriously, even from a practical point of view, depression does nothing good at all. if lan lan still have to go through NS, might as well be positive about it right?</p>

              <p>"A bit down" and "depression" are 2 different things.</p>
              <p>Encouragement does not help if it is really "depression". Depression is a mental disorder and can be treated by drug. And usually
              last from weeks to months or even years. Symptom that is associated are
              not eating, insomina and nausea.</p>
              <p>I know "coke"  and chocolate works for depression. (At least work for me). Beware of addiction.</p>
              <p>I know your camp enviroment is not that good so I can only pity you. loh. After so many years I still think that Army is a waste of time. And most people also feel sianz and you are not alone. I think there is nothing you can do. May be go to church. Jesus may help.  </p>
              <p>I got many friends that are commando out of course. They seems all ok. I think it is a normal event as there are so many people out of course. Seems to be like a routine to them.</p>
              <p> </p>
