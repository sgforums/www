(:<br>I'm currently sitting for my Os (yes I am going to continue mugging after this post). I'm a private candidate (used to be from a rather good govt school but joined a private school due to personal and medical reasons although I'm fine now).<br>I'm aiming to go into mass comm (hopefully in ngee ann) because I have an interest in it. I will most probably be going to aust to pursue my degree (into a university that recognises the diploma and gives advance standing). First question is : Will the poly accept students from govt schools over private candidates?<br>I'm hoping that I can get in. Just worried because this is a highly sought after course.<br>I will have to wait till May until I know if I am accepted.<br>Another option is to study in Australia by taking a foundation course and then going on to get a degree. However, I'm 17 this year so there's this problem with parents being overprotective and also financial issues. 4 years of studying in aust is going to be very costly. I don't want to be a burden on my family. Will have to get a good study loan if I really want to go. Only advantage is that this will take a shorter time to get a degree and more exposure. But I really don't want to spend unnecessary money.<br>So...second question is : Which one is the better option?<br>Also, is it very hard for poly graduates to get into NTU's mass comm degree course?<br>I know I should'nt be thinking now. My plan is to try if I can get into the poly course and if I can't, then think of another alternative. I'll be checking this post after my Os. So please, reply anyone!

            <div class='col-md body'>Money is the key for everything. Knowing Mass Comm is the direction you are heading is good for your age.<br><br>If financially is possible, I suggest you go Aust for your studies. I have friends that took the road to Aust for their studies and they have not regretted. In fact, one even complains why she spent 1 year in NUS, wasting of her time. Oversea Uni will provide you will a different studies environment. U r away from your family and friends and you learn to be independent. U will have less distraction and study better. U get to know other country cultures and might not want to come back to Singapore again. Who knows !!!!<br><br>Study in Singapore, provide less burden on financial.

However, if your aim is to do well to get to NTU right from the start, I don't see why it's hard for poly grads to get into NTU's Mass comm. At least there were people I knew who had made it and it was 99% PERSPIRATION.<br><br>As a student who was from poly before coming to Aust, I feel that you should do the course in Poly first before deciding to come over. When you are here, what you learn about is in Australia context, Australian perspectives. Unless you want to reside here, you should have a better view of SIngapore's context before coming here to further for future referencing. Being independent at 17 is hard. Trust me. Get more exposed in singapore first, If you are one who has freedom at home, basically independent. There isan't a need to learn to be independent. To me, life back home where my close knitted family and close relationships are far more important at the age of 17. Foundation to support is very important because no matter how enjoyable and friendships here are, they stay in this country. for survival sake to tell you the truth. many who came here are people who felt trapped at home, didn't have that "freedom" to begin with hence wanting to escape. Those who had that freedom longed for home. Though monetary terms are captivating as well, it is a matter of priority. My poly lecturer was here to do a PhD but chose to go back midway because of her family longing for her. Though scholarship was offered, she said something powerful "Husband and family, she only has one. But to study, opportunities are everywhere."<br>you are still young, experiencing life can wait for 3 years can't you? Relationships take more time to develop. SO it depends on you and your priorities.<br><br>Oh yah. one thing to remind you, if you want to come here and study, be sure that you can write convincing and powerful argumentative essays. If not, a degree with passable results, I don't think is supposingly good. Poly days had taught me to do research and write better essays than I would in Sec school. and for you the transition is huge if you r thinking of doing foundation years. PLS don't think that Aussie life is easy to deal with and studying is no sweat. Perspiration is more than what a poly day would need.</span></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i am graduating from university soon, i would really say singapore uni really is very stressful one, but it doesn't mean going to Oz uni will be easy either. Oz uni's emphasis on a different kind of education, 50% assignment, 50% exam. In my opinion their education is really more enriching. In the sense that u really learn more things there. Can u imagine i took 8 modules average every sem for 7 sems excluding industrial attachment. This is life in spore uni. Money a very important factor i would say.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>As a student currently studying Mass Communications at Ngee Ann Poly, I can tell you that as long as you possess that unique factor in you, and have sufficient 'O' level grades, especially in English, your chances of getting into the course should be moderately high.<br><br>I was like you, planning to go to Australia to study a foundation course first before embarking for a Mass Com degree. But on hindsight, coming to Ngee Ann's mass com was the ideal decision, since it will allow you to gain a solid foundation in the dynamics of Mass Communication first. Trust me, you'll have hardly any regrets banging for this course if your interest in it is overwhelming.<br><br>Hope to see you next year, heh.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Studying in Oz is tough I tell you.  You need to be mentally prepared.  Its not easy life.  You have to study and make time to care for yourself.  If got chance to go local, go for it.  The students here pay only a few hundred less than international students, they're not happy with their own education system.  We pay so much to study in their country, they pay just a little less.  The thing is that the Oz government is still raising the cost of education here, no one is happy. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

U must get good aggregates in "O' level &amp; be strong in Eng. (preferably get A).<br><br>Finish poly, then try for NTU. If cannot, then work &amp; save up for U. in Australia.<br><br>Don't depend on yr parents cos not every parents have the means or willingly to sacrifice.

But the difference for upfront paying local students are not much cheaper. I think they are arguing that HECS places are getting fewer and more competitive.<br><br>Anyway, point is ... ... i find that a lot of us have trouble adapting to self research and stuff. Not that i did much in my days, but like I did SIM in first year and moved over here in second. I nearly died, went from DI average to PA/CR.. i was devastated.. but i found my ground during my co-op year, came back, finished the last year with distinction.<br>Point is... you can work if you're in Australia.. but don't rely on it 100% of cos. Think of it as a supplement. Talk to the aussies... that's how I got one of my part time jobs. Ended up loving it too much to leave. I cried leaving that darn cafe when i got my 'real job'. Now i wish i could go back to waitressing.<br><br>ANyway i'm sure everyone has heard my waitressing and ticket selling stories. But.. i certainly was able to make ends meet. But of cos.. thank you so much mum. I love you for sending me here. That's my story in a nutshell.</div>
