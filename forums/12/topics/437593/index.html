              <p>It's so difficult to find friends that click, that back you up. I speak up for all my friends, but when times are bad I feel that I don't have anybody. Why must everyone backstab each other, why can't we be more understanding? Why can't some people just enjoy the silence, why think that there's something wrong with people who don't talk? Why can't some extroverts understand that talking sometimes is tiring, and that I'm not trying to be rude. </p>
              <p>I also hate it that I'm like that. People say to my face that I'm anti social, weird, too quiet, double faced, few friends. Already tried not to be affected, appear oblivious but sometimes it gets too much. It's always like this. Feel depressed, then try to be happy, then down again like times like this. When will it freaking stop. </p>
              <p>It's affecting me, affecting my studies, friendships, family,cca. I confess. I switched school because of this but the whole cycle is repeating. I'm so weak I hate myself.</p>

Your sense of self is the barrier to being joyful to being peacful. Sense of self means  - i am clever, i m a ... Fulfil roles, responsibilites but let go immediatetly, that is ''die'' to that role. It is the attachment, the identification that has one jaded, that has one weary -  cos it is a struggle to maintain or a struggle to repeat the past in the future.</p>
              <p>Of course, the human mind only thrives on certainty. However, life is change and only that is permanent. One flows or one swims. Flowing is acceptance of oneself and acceptance of what is (including others). It presupposes self-acceptance which is that of accepting onself warts and all. As long as what one is being, what one is doing does not encroach or impinge on antoher to be or do - that suffices.</p>

              <p>Life always have a lot of adversities. Last week I went to visit the Tuol Sieng Genocide Museum in Phnom Penh. This happened during the 1975 Pol Pot Regime which killed 5 million cambodians. The prisoners in the Tuol Sieng detention centre was captured on mere and petty crimes and mostly innocent. Sometimes for no reason, the innocent people were detained for nothing. I look at the detention cells, they were so small, 4 feet by 6feet each with a small metal bucket for the prisoners to shit into it, very claustraphobic. And then the prisoners were subjected to daily torture, some strapped an iron bed, where the torturer will take pliers and ripped their nipples and nails out or take an iron bar and whack their body. Some are even hung upside down on the pole until they fainted and then their head is dipped into the pot full of dirty water with piss and faeces. WEhen they wake up from the dirty smell, they are hung upside down again to force them to confess their so-called crimes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>A lot of cambodians wonder, what they did in their life to deserve this?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So I ask you, is life unfair? Yes. Do some get it worse than you? Yes.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You are in much better position than those people who were detained in the Tuol Sieng detention centre. Everybody who go there, come out dead. Of the 7,500 prisoners interred there, only 15 people survived !</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So it is up to you. You sink or swim. Do you let adversity bring you down? Or do you want to take up the challenge? If people criticise you, take it as a learning experience and improve yourself.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Life is a choice, it is up to you. You want to take it negatively, you will never improve. You want to take it positively, you are in the next level.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Remember those people in the Tuol Sieng detention centre, your life is much better than them. They cannot escape from the prison and they have no choice. They will do anything to have the kind of life you have. You should appreciate what you have and at the same time take the challenge to improve yourself instead of wallowing in self pity.</p>

              <p>People have different priorities, but I think there is much more to life than the problems that you have pointed out. Not saying your problems are not worth doing something about, but just saying that you;re giving up so much more to life by allowing the matters to bring u to the point of thinking 'there is no point in living'.</p>
              <p>Make new friends. Find people who understand u better, than try and make it difficult for u all the time. Feel comfortable with yourself, before others can with u. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="icon_smile.gif"></p>

              <p>My good friends are from my kampong days in Sembawang, and my NS buddies which are formed over years and lasting.</p>
              <p>Frankly, I don't have any good friends from working colleagues. When I leave the company, friendship with them also wanes.</p>
              <p>Whether you have good friends or not, largely depends on your temperament and that of the other person. If they see you as a good person, and  you see them as good person, friendship will form. Thus, you choose your friends. There are lousy people around, I don't give a damn about such people.</p>

              <p>What is yr meaning of your existence in here? to enhance the human life, to help others, to be filial to your parents, to bring upon happiness to all??? Knowing yr existence will ultimately make you set your goals and objectives in life.</p>
              <p>Learn to have a selfless mind, most people helps other for a reason, learn to help other selflessly, meaning expect no return, learn to give and sacrifice selflessly and in return, people will look upon you as a great person. Do not seek attention just because you do not have enough attention, protray yourself well and people will come to you without any string attach. Be good, happy and most important who you are, many do not know who they are and thus, unable to know the meaning of there existence here.</p>
