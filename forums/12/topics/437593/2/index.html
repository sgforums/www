              <p><strong>When you're rich and powerful , you don't have to adjust to people , people will adjust to you and queue up to be your friend.</strong> There is no such thing as true friends in this world , everybody is somebody's friend only because there is some form of benefit. </p>
              <p>and don't ever ever force yourself to be someone else. you will regret it. because sooner or later you will find yourself as fake and hate yourself. whatever friends that you have made with your fake self will also leave you because they are friends with the fake you and not you. </p>
              <p>and the cycle will repeat. and you will find yourself in misery again.</p>
              <p>then 1) you either go mad</p>
              <p>2) you commit suicide ( you gave up on yourself , you disappoint your parents, you disappoint the people who are suffering )</p>
              <p>so don't try to 'fit in ', work hard and do things only for yourself.</p>

              <p>It's so difficult to find friends that click, that back you up.
              I speak up for all my friends, but when times are bad I feel that I
              don't have anybody. Why must everyone backstab each other, why
              can't we be more understanding? Why can't some people just enjoy
              the silence, why think that there's something wrong with people who
              don't talk? Why can't some extroverts understand that talking
              sometimes is tiring, and that I'm not trying to be rude. </p>
              <p>I also hate it that I'm like that. People say to my face that
              I'm anti social, weird, too quiet, double faced, few friends.
              Already tried not to be affected, appear oblivious but sometimes it
              gets too much. It's always like this. Feel depressed, then try to
              be happy, then down again like times like this. When will it
              freaking stop. </p>
              <p>It's affecting me, affecting my studies, friendships,
              family,cca. I confess. I switched school because of this but the
              whole cycle is repeating. I'm so weak I hate myself.</p>
              <p>I tried accepting myself. i really did, but it just doesn't work
              in this world</p>

              <p>But like some forumers mentioned, if u want to leave this, dont cause trouble to other people.</p>
              <p>If u jump - Who clean your blood on the floor?</p>
              <p>If u let train - u will cause disruptions to commuters; late for work, exams, interview etc</p>
              <p>if u spam drugs - the ambulance will need to waste fuel/time to fetch u to hospital when it could possibly be used to save someone in real need of ambulance. </p>
              <p>if u cut - who clean the blood on the floor or bedsheets? u?</p>
              <p>I also dunno the point of humans or anything living things being alive cos we all will die someday but since u are already alive as a human (be glad u are not fish, not pigs, not chickens, not ducks) why not just live until u passed on naturally.</p>
