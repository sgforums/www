              <p>Your grandmum is your father's MOTHER. What do you expect your
              grandmum to do ? Gang up against your dad ?</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is strange why your mother choose to tell your grandmum</strong></span> about
              the mistress , even tho your mom knew she don't have the greatest
              relationship with your grandmum.</p>
              <p>It is not your choice to make your parents divorce. The marriage
              is between your father and your mom. You can only talk to your
              mother.. she may not want a divorce if she sees no need for such
              drastic action.</p>
              <p>Your support for your mother is most imperative right now. She
              may feel abandoned by her husband whom she had stayed faithful all
              these years. But she must know.. that her own flesh and blood will
              stand by her through tough times.</p>
              <p>For a woman that age.. your mother's only hopes and future lies
              in her own children.</p>
              <p>When everything falls apart.. mothers are the ones who picks up
              the pieces and carry on for the sake of their children.</p>
              <p>As for your father.. know that his actions are foolish. And he
              had just chosen to die a lonely death.</p>

              <p>Though TS's mother got consoled by her children, relatives and friends, she still need someone more elderly and experienced than her to talk to.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, both her parents are dead, and the only elderly person whom she is close to is her mother-in-law.</p>

              <p>If your mom choose to divorce, she probably can get a sum of
              money frm your dad. Gather evidence 1st. &amp; since AWARE probably
              will make a big fuss out of this, contact them to help loh lol</p>

              <p>What many of you seem not to understand is that there is no way for TS to legally harrass or challenge the woman.</p>
              <p>If he tries anything foolish, like psychoing as you suggested, he will only get into trouble with law.</p>
              <p>If the TS is put behind bars, who will have the last laugh?</p>

              <p>Ello there, this is a forum, not a blog. And welcome to sgforums.</p>
              <p>I apologise for saying so, but your words are very messy and your sentence structures are very bad. Please do put in spacing between paragraphs next time round. Thanks.</p>
              <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>What you were trying to say </strong><strong>: ( At least I think so )<br></strong></span></p>
              <p>Hi Agenda, I am very new to this forum but this thread reflects my previous situation.</p>
              <p>I am the mother of two, and I suffered a failed relationship due to a 3rd party.</p>
              <p>I grew up in a broken family, and I told myself the same thing won't happen to me, but alas, the same tragic that broke my family apart befell me once again.</p>
              <p>But I still got
              to move on in my life, both emotional-wise and mental-wise. I also have to be responsible to
              my loved ones ( Namely children ) and deal with financial problems.</p>
              <p>Life is about suffering, not just in the past, not just in the present, but also in the future. Take all these as lessons in life, and don't let your life stop here over the sake of this incident. Move on in your life.</p>
              <p>Just remember that one day you will be a father and a husband, keep all these lessons you have learnt in mind and improve upon them.</p>
              <p>Stand up for those who are weak and do not fall into the evil side like Osama Bin Laden, who allows his preachings and actions to cause the sufferings of amny children. ..<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/cry.png" alt="cry.png"></p>
