              <p>Lets see things from the perspective of a 50+ year old man.</p>
              <p>He is Singaporean. Lived his whole working life in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Everyday go to work, constantly under stress about livelyhood and punctualilty.</p>
              <p>Not much enjoyment, excitement, entertainment.</p>
              <p>Marathon beer drinking session, girly bars, Desker Road, Bugis Street, are all things of the youth, it all ended when he got married and started living in a flat.</p>
              <p>Life become humdrum, only work for income, so that the family may eat, and keep up with the Tans (Jones) for practically the whole of his life.</p>
              <p>Then come this sweet young thing. Who would talk to him. Who would not insult him, or humilate him, or challenge him or critise him. Fair, and soft to the touch. The feeling in him is something he had not felt in decades. Infatuated or in love, he can't tell the difference, but anyway he does not want to lose it. He wants to revel in it.</p>
              <p>Him bringing her home is serious. He is not playing hankypanky any more.</p>
              <p>Asking him to give her up is asking him to give up the pleasurable feeling that he has missed for years and years, and is now having. Difficult but not impossible.</p>
              <p>Best bet is to keep cool (with negotiation in mind).</p>
              <p>Avoid arguments, talking sense into him, revenge, chopping etc. Keep cool and see what he wants, and work out a settlement. He brought the girl to the home, that shows that he is a reasonable fellow. He is displaying his obligation to the new found girl. So all is not lost. Safe guard yourself.</p>
              <p>Split in anger with nothing, or splilt amicably with a settlement.</p>
              <p>Let him have a life. Poor fella slogged all his life, and if he chooses to enjoy himself at the  risk of his life savings, so be it.</p>

              <p>Pyscho out the bitch &amp; your dad. Scare them, make them feel uneasy, uncomfortable. Try different ways.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But even if he breaks off with her, he can easily go find another since they are flooding the island like nobody's business.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If your mom choose to divorce, she probably can get a sum of money frm your dad. Gather evidence 1st. &amp; since AWARE probably will make a big fuss out of this, contact them to help loh lol</p>

              <p>Lets see things from the perspective of a 50+ year old man.</p>
              <p>He is Singaporean. Lived his whole working life in Singapore.</p>
              <p>Everyday go to work, constantly under stress about livelyhood and punctualilty.</p>
              <p>Not much enjoyment, excitement, entertainment.</p>
              <p>Marathon beer drinking session, girly bars, Desker Road, Bugis Street, are all things of the youth, it all ended when he got married and started living in a flat.</p>
              <p>Life become humdrum, only work for income, so that the family may eat, and keep up with the Tans (Jones) for practically the whole of his life.</p>
              <p>Then come this sweet young thing. Who would talk to him. Who would not insult him, or humilate him, or challenge him or critise him. Fair, and soft to the touch. The feeling in him is something he had not felt in decades. Infatuated or in love, he can't tell the difference, but anyway he does not want to lose it. He wants to revel in it.</p>
              <p>Him bringing her home is serious. He is not playing hankypanky any more.</p>
              <p>Asking him to give her up is asking him to give up the pleasurable feeling that he has missed for years and years, and is now having. Difficult but not impossible.</p>
              <p>Best bet is to keep cool (with negotiation in mind).</p>
              <p>Avoid arguments, talking sense into him, revenge, chopping etc. Keep cool and see what he wants, and work out a settlement. He brought the girl to the home, that shows that he is a reasonable fellow. He is displaying his obligation to the new found girl. So all is not lost. Safe guard yourself.</p>
              <p>Split in anger with nothing, or splilt amicably with a settlement.</p>
              <p>Let him have a life. Poor fella slogged all his life, and if he chooses to enjoy himself at the  risk of his life savings, so be it.</p>

              <p><br>Hello Mancha..... are you already 50+ ?</p>
              <p>You speak with such familiar and intimate knowledge on the experience of a 50+ "old" man (????)......  : )</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Sadly, it was indiscreet of him to bring the mistress home, and he should have not hurt his entire family in the process.</p>
              <p>Living the life in his new world of escapist pleasure would have been far better then creating new or even increasing the stress levels all round for himself and everyone in his family.</p>
              <p>Then again, something must have caused the deterioration in the existing husband and wife relations that caused the man to be so detached to his family - and to bring the new woman home.</p>
              <p>If there is no other way out in his relationship with his wife, and if he intend to start a new life - who else can be in his position to decide except himself ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>It is silly and childish for the TS to think that violence to the other woman will solve anything - and without thinking of the consequences to oneself and to the mother.</p>
              <p>Obviously, he did not learn from the experience of the factory supervisor who got involved with a China girl who worked as a factory hand, and was infatuated with her to the point that the China girl felt it was best to end the relationship as he was already married and she found someone closer to her own age and single too.</p>
              <p>It was unfortunate that the factory supervisor could not contain the violent cocktail of anger, hatred and jealosy that led him to murder a young woman, and chop her up into different multiple parts for disposal all over Singapore.</p>
              <p>In the end, he was tracked down by the Police, tried in court, and sentenced to death - bringing more pain and shame to the surviving members of his family.</p>
              <p>To the TS - violence solve nothing; neither does anger or hatred.</p>
              <p>Get over the emotional shock quickly.</p>
              <p>This is the time for growing up and a test of truly being an adult.</p>
              <p>Keep cool, keep the entire situation in perspective, calmly find out what are the issues involved and what possible solutions can there be.</p>
              <p>Perhaps divorce may not be necessary, and life can continue with two families co-existing under different roofs - as had occurred in the time of our fore-fathers, when two families even live under the same roof - peacefully.</p>
              <p>That is if your father can afford to have two families ?</p>

              <p>And each party now belittling each other's contribution to the household, don't know what to do. I can see that my mum say want divorce but actually inside she doesn't want to. And my dad say want divorce but this relationship can still be salvaged.</p>
              <p>Just that my mum been getting wrong advice from wrong people.</p>
              <p>And Mancha is spot on with his analysis, that is what my dad say - no one show him any concern.</p>
              <p>Come to blame, everyone is to blame. Maybe that's why we close one eye to him having a mistress. I know last time he also got other mistress - I saw some explicit sms myself and I was only 13 year old back then, I still cannot forget the words and images.</p>

              i have a friend whose dad has another wife, and guess what? 2 wives and 1 dad live very happily together under the same roof. 
              
              many cannot accept it of coz. even me. i'm still amazed how the 1st wife easily accepted the 2nd wife in the house and family. and they seriously live happily ever after. I guess it's how the 1st wife look at life. 
              
              as the parents all accepted it.. naturally my friend accepted it too. rather be sad over something they have no control of, she felt blessed to have two mothers at home, and the house is pretty lively. 
              
              face it, there's basically nothing you can do unless u want to do something illegal. i understand ur frustrations, but å¤§äººäº‹æƒ… we dun chap in one leg is better. things will be more complicated. at most.. u can only stand by ur mum and support her decision. u dun like the china women, u can show ur detest i guess. however, your dad is still your dad.
              
              all the best.
