Others have expressed similar views about you, I'm just more vocal about it.<br><br>You can think I'm mean, but I don't see how I'm any worse than you. You afterall started a thread that seemingly was about guys who cheat on their girlfriends, but instead, it was about you complaining everything about a particular guy but his lack of fidelity.</div>

Are you her? Or a fan of hers?<br><br>Still, don't use being direct as an excuse to say all the nasty things you want. And I see contradictions in what you say about yourself.<br><br>Open minded? = Then you would be able to accept other people even if they didn't speak english as well as you.<br><br>Sociable? = Then you shouldn't have problems getting along with anyone, even 'cheena' people.<br><br>I have no issue with your preference for guys. Who am I to say who you like or who you don't, but my issue is how fake you are.<br><br>I'll admit you're confident, maybe to the point that you're stuck-up. But I'll admit that's personally my opinion.<br><br>Your conscience is clear not necessarily because you didn't do anything wrong, it could well possibly be because of a lack of conscience.<br><br>Go figure.</div>

N his attitude is real bad tht's why i hate him. the reason why i wrote tht thread is ta rant N vent my anger of such guys' existance.. still hopin he will change for da better cuz he's so friggin arrogant!!
