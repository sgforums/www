            <div class='col-md body'>Nice story got $$$ so what???<br><br><strong>One day a father and his rich family took his young son on a trip to the country with the firm purpose to show him how poor people can be.  They  spent a day and a night in the farm of a very poor family.  When they got back from their trip the father asked his son, "How was the trip?"<br><br>Very good, Dad!"<br><br>"Did you see how poor people can be?" the father asked.<br><br>"Yeah!"  "And what did you learn?"<br><br>The son answered, "I saw that we have a dog at home, and they have four.  We have a pool that reaches to the middle of the garden, they have a creek that has no end.  We have imported lamps in the garden, they have the stars.  Our patio reaches to the front yard, they have a whole horizon.<br><br>When the little boy was finishing, his father was speechless.<br><br>His son added, "Thanks, Dad, for showing me how poor we are!" Isn't it true that it all depends on the way you look at things?  If you have love, friends, family, health, good humor and a positive attitude toward life, you've got everything!<br><br>You can't buy any of these things.  You can have all the material possessions you can imagine, provisions for the future, etc., but if you are poor of spirit, you have nothing!</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><b>From evolutionary psychological POV</b><br><br>Why women like "so-called" rich and handsome men??<br><br>It's hard not to feel something for a guy who is handsome and rich. Because women like men who have good genes (looks and brains) and lots of resources (time and money).<br><br>Good genes = offspring will either be good looking or smart. This means that her offsprings will have less problem in finding a mate, which will lead to passing on of her genes.<br><br>Resources = Women had to take care of the family and still have to work. If a guy can provide some help for the girl, it's natural the girl will be happier with the guy, because this means she has more time for herself and more money to spend (Who don't want??).<br><br>At this age (teenage years to early 20s), a guy's career is not stable, his pursuit of education is also not reliable, the best guess a girl can make of a good mate would be whatever that's physical, especially at the first impression. Hence the fancy car, the rich family background, the cool clothes, and the generous gestures, are, at this point, the most reliable indications if he's a good catch.<br><br>Some girls who can't get these guys would thus call those girls who got them "cheap", at least in the hope that if she can't him, the current girl can't too. On the other hand it also shows that she want a piece of that pie too, otherwise, why the sour grapes?? When those envious girls got a good catch themselves, where does all the "cheap", "slut", "bitch" go?? Aren't they doing just the same very thing, being call the same labels, and yet they don't mind?? Why??<br><br>Why do you think men are working so hard?? To have a stable career, to earn a good salary, so that his mate(s) will stay with him. Not too many people will want to date a road sweeper, a garung guni, construction worker, why?? because, it's a low income, and the smell ( = bad genes) is a turnoff.<br><br>Basically to say, these are the underlying "unconscious" urges in you. It's passed down from our ancestors over a long period of time, because these urges have proven to pass on the genes well, so they are adopted even today as good heuristics for a good mate.<br><br>How to stop yourself from going further?? just don't go and see him... have yourself engaged with some club, or volunteer work, or work or school, so that you don't have the time, especially during the hours he's there, then the problem is solved isn't it?? haha~</div>

I dun wish ta haf pple thinkin bad bout me juz cuz i go aft a rich caucasian N label me as cheap. if i were ta date him, it'll be cuz of his looks N character. wht i find nice in him is tht he is caring N extremely generous.DUH! he's lyk..when i talked ta him he asked me bout my family N whether ive eaten. We had a nice chat N i found out lots bout him N he gives many many pple free drinks. If nt for da other guy i'm dating but nt yet my bf.. i'd haf gone for this guy. Wht i look for in a guy..he's em all but it wont be so eazy goin after him cuz i noe he has lotsa female frens.<br><br>wht u think if a girl dresses up with high sex appeal to tempt u N acts lyk a bimbo? i noe how ta do it but im nt sure if i shld.. but if tht's how it will please him i dun mind. Afterall it's juz one time. i wont be havin too mucha loss rite? i dunno wat ta do wit my current guy cuz i still love him juz tht i find this 'ang mo' much more attractive. We haf been goin out almost everyday aft sch if he's free.. watchin movies N stuff. But we haf nt kissed yet. thxxxx.<br><br>`bian</div></blockquote>Who doesnt? Alrite, weather if its a loss, or nt, you will onli find out in the aftermath. It'll b great if u r able to get over r/s fast, but if u r e kind tat cant, i believe u knw wat r e side effects u will hv. Im nt saein tat caucasian guys r bad, cause i've lotsa friens who r "ang mo". But e ting is u will hv 2 keep an open mind tat caucasians r friendly. Dun get e wrong idea if he portrays ani carin thouts. Frankly speakin, if u realli 2 knw if u hv a chance wif him, u will sense it in a conversation or e signs when both of u hang out. N if u were 2 b wif him? R u able to take it if u c him hangin out wif other gals at clubs who 2 e xtnd of bein touchy? If u cant, sad 2 sae, i tink u r nt in his league. Cause caucasians r tat open minded. I hv a few ang mo friens who bed each other's gfs, n e nxt dae, they can take it as if nothin happens. Can u? Sumtimes its much more easier to straight away hv sex rather than sittin there n tinkin wat 2 do or sae. N tats e beauty of caucasians, they can do it. Tink these r e few qs u hv 2 ask urself. 1nce u hv e ans to them, u will knw wat 2 do. Niwae, if u hv ani other doubts, n need my advise, get me at perfectio_spiritu@yahoo.com.sg. Cheers!!! Hope u find ur ans sn.<br></div>

But I'll take being a gay over being a shemale, if I really had to choose. At least gays accept that they're male, just that they have a sexual preference for males. Shemales are a different thing altogether.</div>
