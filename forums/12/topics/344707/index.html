              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>Last week, I went to a club with a group of friends(mix of guys
              and girls with Stella (cover name) who happens to be a girl i'm
              really interested in to be in the group)</p>
              <p>It's right we started drinking, I got really drunk after and
              went straight to the dance floor. It was fun at first, went around
              and did what a couple would do in the dance floor(with Stella), til
              past 1 am when i got really drunk...I forgotten everything when i
              finally woke up at around 3-4am (due to some dispute i was forced
              awake), all i know was she started ignoring me, not letting me to
              even hold her hands. I know something wasn't right at that point of
              time... nevertheless we went over to my friends place. I wasn't
              invited to sleep on the same bed as her (as she commanded), she
              doesn't want anyone to sleep with her. But well, i do as she asked,
              and instead I watch her to sleep, (around an hour later) she
              invited me to sleep beside her. Throughout the night I didn't
              manage to sleep, I was holding her hand so tightly, and hugging her
              at the same time I wanted to know what's going on so desperately as
              I know something is amiss, and I feel that I'm losing her...She
              woke up in the morning I send her back, still she didn't allow me
              to hold her hands after we left my friend's place.</p>
              <p>The following day, I asked my friends what happened during that
              night, they told me I went around the club getting to know new
              girls, those that hit on well, i'd take no considerations and just
              had it my way.(yes i made out with many many girls) It really never
              happen that way before, when usually me and my mate were the ones
              pushing girls away and enjoying amongst us... I'm really feel so
              fked up right now, Stella must be totally pissed with me, yet she
              took care of me throughout... She must be so disappointed in me...
              I took the initiative and apologize to her, she told me i didn't
              owe her an apology, I'm such a coward, I guess she though I treat
              her as one of my flings... she thinks now that im a player... she
              thinks now that I'm just like typical guys who goes around taking
              advantage of the rest! I've to admit we don't know each other very
              long yet, but i really do feel for her... She's the first girl I
              ever had this kinda feelings! I'm so confused, I don't know what to
              do now! I don't know what will I do to make her forgive me,
              although she didn't say she blame me at all and claims that she
              doesn't, and even if she forgave me, I do not know how to face her
              at all! I brought her to the club and LC with other girls, I'm the
              worst...</p>
              <p>I'm confused! I really wanna be with her, but I don't know if I
              can even forgive myself even if she does... and I don't know if I
              can make her forgive me in the first place...</p>

              <p>Ya all i can remember was when I'm together with her, I don't have any
              impression of me doing anything else with any other girls...  Now she's
              finding excuse to avoid me, not to meet up with me alone we started
              chatting again, but I can feel it's different there's some kind of barrier</p>
