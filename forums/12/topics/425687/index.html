              <p>1. If a single Singaporean wants to own HDB apartment, they must be 35 years or above at the time of application.</p>
              <p>2. Occupant has no age requirements.</p>
              <p>3. Refer to number 1 if you do not wish to wait until 35 and do not wish to have a co-owner. Otherwise, you can sleep near the longkang.</p>
              <p>4. If a co-owner is not a family member (family nucleus), under the fiance/fiancee scheme you have 3 months to get married at the point after you had taken possession of the HDB apartment. If the co-owner is the same sex, or not eligible for marriage, you cannot apply. If co-owner and owner are not married within the 3 months, then HDB will re-possess the flat and maybe put many hantu inside.</p>

              <p>im a guy..sorry to disappoint you goodheart.</p>
              <p>i saw the floor plan models for 2-room flat. the bedroom can fit at least one queen size bed. if i live alone means i need a single bed and imagine the space i have. even the living room is spacious too.</p>
              <p>if i end up with 3-room flat, i may consider renting the 2nd room out. Im ok if the tenant is a girl but she must be sure she dont mind staying with me.</p>
              <p>no point getting married for the sake of getting my own flat. wait halfway sure divorce then got problem with the flat.</p>

              <p>want to marry but my situation dont allow me to. now want to have wife, must have lots of money or else fat hope any girl want to marry me. some more, i also hate kids.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>anyway, there is more to life than marriage. since i got no chance to get married, just carry on with life as a single man. no commitments, can go sleep around if i want to and Im not unfaithful to any one but of course must have protection. being single also means I can save more money.</p>

              <p>like you: 2nd question should be, Are you earning at least 3K per month?</p>
              <p>But too bad I dont have the answer the ladies would want to all those 5 questions.</p>
              <p>goodheart: i dont fancy dating agencies. I dont even like the idea of being introduced to a friend's friend. I prefer me &amp; the girl to meet each other by chance.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>overall, I have to say I have nothing to offer girls if they marry me. What I can give them is simply not enough in today's world so thats why I guess my fate is sealed.</p>
