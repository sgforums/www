However, the fact is that....not everyone can readily embrace the fact that love is " <span style="font-style: italic;">Love is natural, expansive and ever-growing - there should not be a space for jealousy in our hearts when it comes to love</span>"....<br><br>At the end of the day, leaving the point about how an individual distrust love and therefore allow jealousy to consume him/her in a relationship.....<span style="text-decoration: underline;">please also remember that jealousy doesn't just spring out of nowhere too</span>. I mean...how many ppl can take it if your other half has been constantly smsing your opp sex friend? Even though it might be true that nothing is going on during their sms chat....but my question here then is - if it bothers you, should you just quietly take it? or rather...even if your other half doesn't know that it bothers you, isn't it only appropriate that your other half stop such a practice? so as to avoid misunderstanding from both end?<br><br>I opined that jealousy arises not just from the insecurity within a person...but external factors contribute to it as well. It is true that if your other half wants to leave you, there is no need for a 3rd party to appear before he/she decides to do so. But at the meantime, don't "trivalise" your sense of discomfort and never brush it off as "Oh..i'm just immature or insecure...I'll work around it." Calmly talk it out with your other half how you feel. You may face the risk of being looked upon as immature or insecure...but if your other half really cares for you, he/she will appreciate that you are open about your feelings and is likely to refrain from doing what upsets you...provided that it is not unreasonable.<br><br></div>

Keep his number. But, he has to SMS/tell face to face your galfriend  do not SMS to him anymore. Your galfriends can always SMS to her own boyfriend and stop bothering other people's biz.<br>3.If your boyfriend insist he wants communication with them, he is rather not committed to the relationship.<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br>The feeling of boyfriend double timing, for sure get his girlfriend jealous. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

It is true that if your other half wants to leave you, there is no need for a 3rd party to appear before he/she decides to do so. But at the meantime, don't "trivalise" your sense of discomfort and never brush it off as "Oh..i'm just immature or insecure...I'll work around it." Calmly talk it out with your other half how you feel. You may face the risk of being looked upon as immature or insecure...but if your other half really cares for you, he/she will appreciate that you are open about your feelings and is likely to refrain from doing what upsets you...provided that it is not unreasonable.<br></div></blockquote>Hi...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>Actually...
