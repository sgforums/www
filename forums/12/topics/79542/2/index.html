            <div class='col-md body'>Well Genie, You can't say woman are jealous creatures.. but woman are likely more sensitive than male gender. I can understand why you will feel jealous, but I think you and your bf should sit down together and talk about the friendship with him and your friend. Get to understand the situation and work out something with him. IF you are not happy with him talking with your friend, voice it out, talk to him. But NEVER flare it out on him. He will end up hating u for it. If you talk nicely and let him know how you feel, he will respect that. Remember Temper is something that you can remove by losing it.<br><br>All the best Buddy<br>Cheers</div>
