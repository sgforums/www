I am a new user.<br><br>Anyways, i was reading the other threads by other users and realised that we all have similiar problems.<br>My boyfriend thinks that he is in a marriage. He told me he doesnt feel like a boyfriend. He says that i control him too much. Like other people, i think it will be nice for him to tell him where he is going. Its so weird because we have this relationship for 2 years and he is only telling me now. I dont know. I think its the way i show how much i care for him but i guess it has adverse effects.<br><br>I have a very lonely life. A best friend who is getting married and is always with her fiance and we dont talk much. She is like the only friend i have. I am so lonely. I think that because of lonliness, i depend on my boyfriend alot. Always want to go out with him. I put him on top priority but realised that it is not the same for him. He says that he feels cramped.  Everytime we talk, it seems that he just want to blame me for everything. He says i blame him all the time too. Its so weird about the way he behaves around me like he cant stand me. I dont understand why. I just want him to accept me the way i am. He says he loves me for me. I guess thats not really true huh. He likes to drink alot so i tell him to cut down but he doesnt listen. I took care of him when he was sick but he called me a bitch. Maybe its true. Everything is my fault and i shouldnt "mother" him too much. I thought its my way of showing that i care for him. Now it just pushes him away. His ex cheated on him and i never did but somehow i think that he thinks that she treats him better. Maybe i should get a social life so i dont have to be so needy to him right? Leave him alone, dont call him or something...i feel like a sinner..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"></div>

I have been through the same thing. In the end, i just gave up... no point having this kind of relationship. Been through 6 years of this, i guess i am a slow and blur learner or lover too.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

If he feels uncomfortable, then the choice of what to do next is up to you! Either you let him have his way or you both can talk things out again. I hope that your relationship will work out!

From time to time, you both will definitely hurt each other but you both can work things out by talking calmly. In a relationship, its not always all fun and laughter! At what you have wrote, to my own point of view is that he is taking you forgranted. He won't realized how good you are until he has lost you and he will come running back. Some people are like that they don't cherish others and things when they still have it but once its lost or gone then they regret.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"> What to do this is life?</div>

Well this is to my own point of view. If he is all talk and no action... what is the point. He is exactly did what my ex would be doing. I always believe this... if you can say it then back it up!</div>

I am a new user.<br><br>Anyways, i was reading the other threads by other users and realised that we all have similiar problems.<br>My boyfriend thinks that he is in a marriage. He told me he doesnt feel like a boyfriend. He says that i control him too much. Like other people, i think it will be nice for him to tell him where he is going. Its so weird because we have this relationship for 2 years and he is only telling me now. I dont know. I think its the way i show how much i care for him but i guess it has adverse effects.<br><br>I have a very lonely life. A best friend who is getting married and is always with her fiance and we dont talk much. She is like the only friend i have. I am so lonely. I think that because of lonliness, i depend on my boyfriend alot. Always want to go out with him. I put him on top priority but realised that it is not the same for him. He says that he feels cramped.  Everytime we talk, it seems that he just want to blame me for everything. He says i blame him all the time too. Its so weird about the way he behaves around me like he cant stand me. I dont understand why. I just want him to accept me the way i am. He says he loves me for me. I guess thats not really true huh. He likes to drink alot so i tell him to cut down but he doesnt listen. I took care of him when he was sick but he called me a bitch. Maybe its true. Everything is my fault and i shouldnt "mother" him too much. I thought its my way of showing that i care for him. Now it just pushes him away. His ex cheated on him and i never did but somehow i think that he thinks that she treats him better. Maybe i should get a social life so i dont have to be so needy to him right?

One is more like a mother than a mate - while the other longs for a simple girlfriend that respect personal space and freedom.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You mentioned about your lonely life and small social circle - this is true. Let me tell you, one VERY IMPORTANT element to maintain a lower risk long-term relationship is to have life outside that of your boyfriend. The dependancy onto him is about 50% of the difficulty - rather in terms of conversation, it will gradually become dull. Relationship is gradually crystallized into routine form. And when problems with bf occur, you have problems finding people to pour your sorrows too. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>All these points are invisible daggers that lay ambush within your relationship.<br><br>Under the seventh law of Love - <span style="font-style: italic;">Love always wants more of itself and Love always brings up everything, but itself</span>. As time goes by, issues that doesn't exist in the past surfaced - what special motivation do you need to conceal all these flaws that he once hide during courtship or honeymoon period? Only love and the desire to improve can change them willingly - if not all is futile. He showed his dissatisfaction of your attitude towards the relationship and chose to shower blames then to reflect upon himself. (I am not saying that anyone of you is at fault, however, since you both are already together, is it a must to point fingers? This relationship lacks the combination effort to go through problem and solve them in unison.)   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Ladies, Yunhaier has one good advice on how retain your man - let him know how valuable you are to people outside and if he is foolish enough to dump you, everyone else would fight violently for your dates. In Art of Seduction: Everyone wants things that are highly desirable. Your man feels that you can't live without him - because simply, like what you said: 'you are needy to him.'  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> And - He knows it.<br><br>Expand social circle gradually (not aggressively) and take up interest course/classes to widen your knowledge. You must have life outside him - you must instill confidence in yourself and grow less dependant on him. If things is really getting on well - he will instead cling onto you, not the other way around, and would be more willing to let you 'mother' him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: Don't shut contact with him totally and don't feel that 'mothering' him is the wrong approach of love. The problem doesn't lies with you - its with him, therefore, there is nothing wrong is showering concern. Do your duty as a girlfriend, yet balance your life onto work and friends-outside-bf.

Its like he must know who you go out with and where but doesn't does the same when comes to his turn. Don't you think its a little unfair?</div>

If you want me to do it, then dont grumble when i do it back. But again, love is very disillusioned. I try to tell him that its unfair but as above, alot of times, its just lip serivces. He will say that yeah i will do this do that, normally, thats a lie.</div>

When you go out, he would sms every 5 minutes, etc - this is BECAUSE under this self-absorbed character lies a gnawing inferiority.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Oh you want space, yet you don't give space theory. (E.g. I can club, you cannot club. I can go out with girls, you cannot go out with guys.) Sound familiar people? Yes, indeed it is.

Love is about looking at the same direction - not dominating it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Advice?<br><br>Exactly in my prior post. There is something I would like to add on - do what he does. If he go out with friend, don't bother to msg, etc - same for you. Whatever reasons he used to defend himself (aiya, forget mah, I am playing lar, etc), do the same. Shaken this fortress of his and let him know that the there is no king in relationship - only two commoners moving forward.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: A leo lady - I feel that there is a lack of self-confidence outside him.
