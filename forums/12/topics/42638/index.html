Whatever's the case, she've already got herself a bf now, haven't she? It's certainly quite unlikely that she's gonna give up her current bf just for that matter? Neither is it quite likely that things can be undone...? If she's feeling real guilty about it, maybe she should just let her ex know..? And try not to repeat the same mistake again....?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A lot of people are going to tell you that you just need to get over him and move on since he hurt you. However, I know you are thinking that the thought of that is more easier said than done. Of course it's easy to say you'll move on and forget him but you really cared for him. So, I want to start off by saying that the break up is going to cause you some emotional pain, and it will take some time to get over him. But in time, I really feel you need to move on and start looking for another guy to date. One reason I say that is because he broke up with you for another girl, so what is going to make you think that if you get back together, he won't do it again? It seems like he doesn't really know what he wants in his life yet, but it isn't fair it he just toys with your emotions in his time to decide who he wants to date.<br><br>Now, if you do end up back with this guy, I really urge you to take things slow because you don't know if he will hurt you again, ok? I know that you care for him, and you're going to want to believe him when he says nice things to you, and that he won't hurt you, but you can't ignore the fact that if he hurt you once before, he may hurt you again. The time you spend being upset about the break up is just time you're neglecting on hanging out with your friends and dating other people. You can't put your life on hold for this guy. If the two of you are meant to be together, then you'll realize that you want to be together. But, it just seems like he doesn't know what he wants out of life, and you shouldn't have to wait around for him to decide he wants to be with you when you could be dating other people.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>So, as I said, it's ok to be upset about what happened, but in time, you're going to need to move on and concentrate on yourself and maybe dating some other people. Dating and break ups are a hard part of life for anyone to have to deal with it. But, it will only make you stronger in the end. I know it's not positive at the moment to see what happened as something for the good but you will eventually.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>Cheers<br></div>
