            <div class='col-md body'>Alright, lately I am very into Doraemon and was doing alot of research on it, if anybody has know any rare information about this cat, please post it. Thanks!<br><br>BTW if you are interested, I've got all these information.<br><br>A creation by Fujiko Fujio first appeared to the public in 1969.<br>This is a creation by 2 artist actually, but they break apart in  1987. One named Fujiko F. Fujio and the other name Fujiko A. Fujio. But it is under the name of Fujiko F. Fujio and his real name is Hiroshi Fujimoto. He died at the age of 62 in his work place in 1996.<br><br>He created this robot cat named under model number 1293, with the name Doraemon. Which means stray cat in japanese. He is of the size 129.3cm, 129.3kg, with the ability to jump 129.3m when threaten and run at 129.3km/h when scared. He is originated yellow in colour with ears. But his ears got bite off by a robot mouse and due to under depression, he became blue.<br><br>As for the ending of Doraemon seems to be unknown, but there is 3 series of ending for Doraemon from my research. The first ending was released in manga form. It said that one day, after Nobita came back from school, he found that Doraemon is frozen, so he called Dorami for help and it is found that Doraemon is out of battery and theres a chip in Doraemon ears that surf as a memory chip. If the the battery is change, the memory will be all lost. So after the day onwards, Nobita try study his best and work out ways to help Doraemon, at the same time he became the best AI creator.<br><br>The second ending of which is shown on the TV series of Doraemon goes like this. Nobita is actually a boy that suffer Autism, every thing in his mind is actually imaginary, nothing is real and the fact that Nobita is actually a dying kid, the imaginary of Doraemon makes him feel the ease to his suffering. After the release of this episode, a lot of doraemon fans protest for a better ending to the series.<br><br>So finally in 1998, after the author died, the final release of Doraemon is out in Anime form and the story goes like this:<br><br>One day, after Nobita got bullied by Gian, he ran to Doraemon and seek for help as usual, but this time Doraemon seems very angry and upset and refuse to help. Doraemon told him the fact that he is leaving him already, he cannot stay there anymore, so Nobita got very upset and and he search one of his box and found a toy in it that was by his grandmother. He promised to be a good boy in the future and will stand up by himself every time he fall down. So Nobita went down for the last dinner with Doraemon and with the consent of Nobita's parents, Doraemon will be leaving the next morning. During that night, both Doraemon and Nobita is unable to sleep, so they went for a walk in the park and they had a very emotional talk, Doraemon doesn't want Nobita to see him crying, so he ran away, at the same time, Gi an appear and bullied Nobita again, this time he doesn't ask Doraemon for help again, instead he wanted to prove himself that he is strong enough and doesn't want Doraemon to worried for him anymore, so at last and finally, Nobita won Gian in a duel and proved to Doraemon that he is strong enough to take care of himself. So when the day break came, Doraemon left but he left a box and told Nobita that it is his final gadget he is leaving behind for him and so Nobita can't find him anymore, he tried to act strong in everybody he sees and finally during april fools day, Gian and Suneo lied that Doraemon is back, he went back home search for Doraemon but no where to be found, so he thought of buying Doraemon favourite food, Dorayaki  . So on his way back home, he saw the back view of Doraemon, so he chase after him and finally, Doraemon turned out to be Suneo and was a pranked by Gian and Suneo. So Nobita swear to revenge for himself so with his final resort, he took out the box left by Doraemon and saw a potion of lies. With that potion, whatever Nobita is to say, the result will turn out opposite, so he went to revenge on Gian and Suneo and he went back home again. As he reaches home, his mum ask him if Doraemon is back and Nobita reply his mum, no, Doraemon is not back and he will never be back. So after Nobita's reply, he went back to his room and found that Doraemon is there. With that potion and the words Nobita has said, Doraemon is back! THE END!<br><br>So. Thats all the information I have collected. If you are a fan of Doraemon and you have anything to share, please feel free to post a reply to me! =)</div>
