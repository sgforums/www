            <div class='col-md body'>I think your colleague is a very practical person.  Having 3 children to look after is not an easy affair, even with alimony from her ex-husband.<br><br>On the other hand she might not regret it as most women will sober up to know that looks and adventure from a good-looking guy is never stable.  Fun but not good for herself and for family.  What most women wants (I think) is someone to provide for her and family, at the same time a man that's stable in his thoughts and care for family.  I hope your colleague will learn to love this man... one day.  That's all folks.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Did she divorce her ex-husband juz to marry this guy or was she divorced sometime ago?<br><br>According to yolanda_tan she commented that u can't use once bitten twice shy as an excuse. i do agree to a certain extent. however, we are all humans with feelings. There are also other externalities u would never know had happened to her, which made her decide to leave her ex husband and now marrying this guy.<br><br>If she is willing to lie to herself, y not? Alot of pple are lying to themselves nowadays. An eg would be the jobs that pple are holding, it might not be the one they are most interested in. but they still work coz they wan the monetary returns. who is to decide or comment on what kinda person she is, when in actual fact, we are lying to ourselves in some other areas?<br><br><strong>'ThE pRice oF grEatNEss Is ReSponSIbILITy.'</strong><br><br></div>
