              <p><br>yes, later get married, must give big ang bao to me hor, and the first baby must call me Mommy hor.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Lesson 1, first and foremost, you must dress and doll up yourself, look at you now, you think a gal on the street will  like you?? Dressing is very important, cleanliness is also very important, face full of pimples or oily oily can forget it, and then your hairstyle, please do a Gucci or armani style, unless you hv a nice hairstyle like Jerry Yan, please keep it short and spikey, otherwise, look like a mop, gals see also sian. So, go look up some teenage or male magazines/internet to doll up ya, you need to invest on yourself. For a start, i suggest you visit st 77th for their male fashion, very reasonable price and yet fashionable, you can also get to talk to a few of those chio gals there. And if you do not have the body, do some gym and slimming down exercise to tougher up. Just look fit will do, we gal do not like those Mr Universal type hor.</p>
              <p>Lesson 2, after you hv learn to dress up and doll yourself, you will have more confident, the next most important subject is communication, how you present yourself and the word you choose must becareful, dun kan chiong and talk like MRT, be cool and steady, think before you talk, when a gal talk, listen, be a good listeners, gal like good listener man who pay attention to them, even if she talk shit, you also must listen, learn to have a 2 way communication, meaning you must acknowledge what she said, feel sympathy for what she gone thru, because of wanting her to be by yourself, agree to whatever she said, give sound advice, dun just neglect her and look at other places, look thru her eyes, have eyes contact, alway learn to read the body language, ask her if she want to go toilet, or is she hungry, or is she comfortable to go for a drink, take it slow and easy, do not think of bed and sex with her, think of how to take care of her, how to protect her, how to read her body language and act accordingly to suit her, in courtship, you need to sacrifice, nevermind, cos in after married, you hv a whole life of ordering her.</p>
