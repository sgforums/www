              <p>No need to worry, although the economic downturn is looming according to those blah blah news. Many people are in fact changing jobs....I meant job hopping.</p>
              <p>Since you have overseas education, have you considered working overseas at the country where you studied for your education?</p>
              <p>Have you applied/registered with any job agencies?</p>
              <p>Working itself is already not easy when you don't have experience and have to start from the bottom. And working together with your colleagues who are Singaporeans is even more difficult because I believed most of them would be childish, arrogant, competitive, back-stabbing, political and not helpful people.</p>
              <p>So it's not bad to keep this in mind, "Working is like Acting".</p>
              <p>The better worker you are, the better actress you will need to become.</p>
              <p>Helpful, kind, sincere, genuine workers are usually the most naive people in the company and will be the first few people to die or placed on the chopping block.</p>
              <p>Be EVIL, CRUEL, HEARTLESS, COLD-BLOODED, SINISTER, PRETENTIOUS. It is required for you to survive in this cement jungle you would be calling your workplace.</p>
              <p>Smart doesn't usually necessary bring success in a person's career. And so good luck to your job hunting and I hope you will find a suitable job soon. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
