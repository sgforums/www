              <p>No need to worry, although the economic downturn is looming according to those blah blah news. Many people are in fact changing jobs....I meant job hopping.</p>
              <p>Since you have overseas education, have you considered working overseas at the country where you studied for your education?</p>
              <p>Have you applied/registered with any job agencies?</p>
              <p>Working itself is already not easy when you don't have experience and have to start from the bottom. And working together with your colleagues who are Singaporeans is even more difficult because I believed most of them would be childish, arrogant, competitive, back-stabbing, political and not helpful people.</p>
              <p>So it's not bad to keep this in mind, "Working is like Acting".</p>
              <p>The better worker you are, the better actress you will need to become.</p>
              <p>Helpful, kind, sincere, genuine workers are usually the most naive people in the company and will be the first few people to die or placed on the chopping block.</p>
              <p>Be EVIL, CRUEL, HEARTLESS, COLD-BLOODED, SINISTER, PRETENTIOUS. It is required for you to survive in this cement jungle you would be calling your workplace.</p>
              <p>Smart doesn't usually necessary bring success in a person's career. And so good luck to your job hunting and I hope you will find a suitable job soon. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p>I did send to job agencies initially. had a few bad experiences with them. then i decided its best to find job on my own.</p>

              <p>Much much more free time</p>
              <p>MOE teachers are worked very hard. They have to do many admin things, and usually worked till late at night at home (1 to 2 am isn't unusual). And they have to wake early to be in school by 7am.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>On the other hand, full-time tuition teachers work on weekdays, earliest from 3pm onwards. They also work on weekends. Full-time good group tuition teachers can easily earn 6k upwards, all the way to 5 figure salaries. Or if you work for a tuition centre, it is easily 4k a month too... The free time is usually at hours in which people are working, so there will be little number of pple around when you go shopping, etc. The disadvantage is that you will most likely be stuck at that "price tag" for a very long time. However, you would take much longer to reach such a salary scale working for MOE or any other corporations.</p>
              <p>However, given your extra free time, it could be used for much more things, like analysing investments, writing books, etc, each of which could potentially earn you even more.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>In short, MOE teachers are overworked and underpaid <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"><br>And they still have to face naughty students and irritating parents <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>

              <p>For the next year, I will be teaching at another one, which pays substantially higher. The centre accepted me partly because I had experience. Also, I will be setting up my own group as well.</p>

              <p>Sometime it pure luck that whether you get a job or not ,it really depend on whether the hiring manager like you or not,so I think TS should not be sad.</p>
              <p>As to what you can do to increase your chances of being hired,maybe you could just call the company and ask questions regarding the job,show interest and be sincere.</p>
              <p>I used to work in HR for a short period of time,my manager once received about 100+ job application,do you think she has the time to look at all the CVs? Calling up the company help alot but don't sounds too desperate.</p>
              <p>.</p>
              <p>As least you are young,there alot of older,senior employees worry about retrenchment since the economy is bad and most of them have to support their family.</p>
              <p>Good luck,it took me quite some time  to get a job</p>

              <p>I suspect that come 2009, you will come across more than usual, people who will be unemployed.  They will be your ex-school mates, friends, relatives, ex-colleagues even ex-bosses.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There will be fresh grads/school leavers, people who have worked a few years, mid level managers, senior managers etc all struggling to look for a job.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>The newspapers and media are carrying out reports of retrenchments and downsizing of companies everyday.  Many companies, from the small SMEs to the large MNCs will be struggling to survive next year.</p>

              <p>I'm also trying to find a job now. I have to agree it's much harder to get employed at this time because many others are also competing for the jobs. Don't worry, u are not alone. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="icon_wink.gif"></p>
              <p>Since many companies are cutting cost now, it's natural that degree holders with no experience won't be considered in the first place, unless u are really lucky to be chosen. They want people with relevant experience, not just because of degree.</p>

              i dont know why they reject me.. i  applied via their moe portal 3 times....twice during my poly days.. once after i grad from uni... wasnt even given a chance for an interview... 
              
              i guess its probably my diploma and my foreign degree??

              <p>does the portal ask u to list what subject u want to teach?</p>
              <p>if u're nt choosy... and ur foreign degree might be a deterrence to them hiring u, maybe u can try asking for a position in a primary school... my friends wif only A levels are doing quite well as primary school teachers... it's also less stressful than teaching sec sch. at least, i think so... :/ u might wanna try applying again... </p>
              <p>in the meantime, why dun u sign up for relief teaching first and call up the schools directly? try ur alma mater or the schools in ur neighbourhood. :)</p>
