The main thing to really propel her to start off is to sit down quietly &amp; think abt wat she really wants in future and how much of her youth she can <strong>AFFORD</strong> to waste &amp; while away in the sweet, honeyed state of the "romantic" affair with that guy.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br>If she can accept being nowhere just like wat the man had already foretold her he hv no plans for future &amp; marriage, then that's on a dif scale of issue. Friends can only give advice this much. It's a relationship literally btw them afterall. But do warn her that he may change his mind and marry other lady instead.
