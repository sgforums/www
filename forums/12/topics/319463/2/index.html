              <p>What I have to say is this.....</p>
              <p>You can only help people who want to be helped.</p>
              <p>I have a friend who was also in an MLM.... she tried to peddle so-called 'alkaline water' to me which can supposedly 'purify the toxins in your blood' by 'changing the pH of blood'. She was begging me to buy it to meet some sales quotas.</p>
              <p>I tried to objectively point out to her the scientific wrongness of the claims of her product. Basically, if my blood pH levels can change by drinking that 'alkaline water', I'll die of liver failure, kidney failure, or both.</p>
              <p>However, she shut her mind out and said that I was being biased against MLMs. Never mind that I was just pointing out what was so wrong with the so-called 'scientific claims' the product was making.</p>
              <p>I think she woke up her ideas eventually.... but not before making a rather substantial loss.</p>
              <p>Bottom line? Sometimes, some people just need to be taught the hard way.</p>

              <p><strong>Well too bad for your friend, just make sure you're far away when he tries to borrow money.</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Sad reality is that the stupid always lose out in life. If he cant see past their lousy tricks, he deserves to lose his money and time. for society to progress, the mentally inferior have to be left behind.</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>MLM is just like any other scam. Just legalised because theyre actually selling something. The products are not actually intended for employees to sell to others. They're targeted AT THEM EMPLOYEES themselves. They're selling the PROSPECTS associated with promotion after meeting a sales quota.</strong></p>
              <p><strong></strong></p>
              <p><strong>Im sure most of you have heard of this scam, where the trickster cheats some old lady that some magic apples will bring her family good luck, and sells it to her for thousands of dollars? Same logic here, just change the words "MAGIC" and "APPLES" to something scientific sounding, like "ALKALINE" and "TONIC WATER" and you can move on from cheating old ladies to young people. Theres the beauty of MLM.</strong></p>
