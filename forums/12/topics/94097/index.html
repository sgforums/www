This rejection depends heavily on how you shaped your thoughts during the chase and of course, greater dissapointments arises from greater expectation. The direction of your thought also depends on how you want things to be seen - the first natural reaction of someone would be to spin around and run. They WANT to forget, not accepting and be natural about it.<br><br>Psychologically, the things that are reinforced, you find it difficult to forget. Why would Mac` spend millions on advertising and marketing? They want everyone to remember and spend some of your cash there. Simple as that.
