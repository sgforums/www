Are you appreciated in the first place? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I don't believe in doing things for girls until it becomes a habit. Afterall, likely, you won't be able to get her - she is just used having you around NOT accepting your assistance because she loves it. A guy who gives in/do too much for girls are seen as weak-willed, not by me nor the other guys, but <strong>subconsciously by the girl herself</strong>. She would rather have a mate who has some degree of control of himself instead of doing things for the sake of pleasing.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Too blinded to get out of this mess?

Personally, I feel that some things especially of more important issues should be made clear between both parties. Like some tolerance to things and limitations. There're of course people who feel that many things are just of a matter of 'give and take'.<br><br>Then again, important issues or not can be subjective from both parties' point of view too? Commonly, there are some who would tends to regard whatever activities or needs of the other party as less important and vice versa.<br><br>Theoreotically speaking, setting standard too high in a relationship is often not a good thing especially when one is barely struggling to meet the requirement or finds it frustrating to perform. It often just brings you back to a simple question. What is the existence of the relationship about in the 1st place?<br><br>Your example is just one of an equilibrium shift.

The fire that burns with greater intensity, dies quicker than the one who ignite gradually.<br><br>Then again, have you ever thought that <strong>she has already failed</strong> you regardless of the things you do? She being on the receiving end, receives. You are already judged, yet she kept silent about the issue because of the 'goodies' that is coming forth.
