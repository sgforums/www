            <div class='col-md body'>I think most of you are confused on the concepts of insurance, so allow me to explain... If the policy's insured is a minor, by that we mean under the age of 16, then of course the insured <strong>CANNOT BE AN APPLICANT/ POLICY OWNER</strong>, but his or her immediate family member. ( For the singles, its their parents, and for the married, its their spouse) Therefore, given that the insured suffers a slip disc and is declared partially disabled, the benefits goes to the APPLICANT. The benefits ALWAYS GOES TO THE APPLICANT, and it doesnt matter if the applicant has been paying for the premiums or not.... However, if the policy insured is above 16yo, then when buying the policy, the parent can choose to be the applicant or allow the child(insured) to be the applicant. Either way, again the benefits goes to the applicant.. The person who pays the premiums is not taking into consideration upon distribution of the benefits.</div>

You have no rights to the policy at all, cos you were a minor in the inception of the policy, and even if you are all grown up right now, he still retain the rights to the policy, unless he transfers them to you. That is his prerogative as a policy owner, not a MUST. Even if you are a 40year old spinster, he can still buy a policy on your life. The only relation you have to the policy, is that you are the insured, and he can buy a policy on your life, cos he has an insurable interest in you. By the way, an insurance bought on your life is a sign of goodwill and love of your Dad, and to question him and accuse him of being a mercenary is not really ideal. Then again, its your family matters and none of us have the right to interfere.</div>
