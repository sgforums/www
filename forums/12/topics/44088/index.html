            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>I am really very unhappy abt my own parents.<br>Everything they blame me,ask me do everything in the house.<br>Like when the ice box is empty, no one will refill it until I do so. and no one volunteer to refill it and fill the ice tray with water.When i complain why no one does it,they all say it's me who is using all the ice.HELLO?!<br><br>When i take out some ice for a cup then pour some bottled green tea,they are the ones who always snatch it away and drink it till there is only 1 sip. when i make noise abt they drinking it all up,they will just say " see there is some left". fark there is some left.my dad does it even better, when i fill up a cup,he will be there waiting. then he just takes it and say " let me old man drink some"<br><br>then i have to refill ice and drink.once i tried something. i left the ice box empty in the late morning. in the evening, it was still empty.<br><br>sometimes when my sis wants some ice and she doesnt refill the ice box, she just takes some ice cubes frm the tray w/o emptying it.<br><br>it's not that i wont refill the ice box/tray, but it's just that no one would do it until i do it. Nor is it that i am unwilling to refill the drink. but it's NO ONE would do it until me.<br><br>when no one washes the dishes? and my dad happens to see me in the area,he just shouts at me.he still says " i am not scolding you,I am just making a point" when he wants me to do something it's called " everyone has a duty and this is yr duty". when he wants my sis to do it, he begs her to do it.<br><br>I am having my exams now,that day i complained that my sis is making too much noise and i am unable to study.they all gang up and scold me for unable to concentrate.last time when my sis was studying for her O level,A level and Uni exams, they all warned me not to make noise at all. whenever i complain abt the noise, my dad would always tell me long story abt when he was young. he would say " long time ago........" zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz<br><br>this afternoon, i was having probs with my chem tutorials which i took out to do for a revision.i went downstairs to look for him and i sat on a chair next to him while he was watching tv,and the first thing he said was " u idiot,why u cannot keep still issit, much watch tv!" then i just interrupted him and said i got a Q,when he answered he used a much lighter tone.<br><br>then the rest of the day he keep cooking, i asked him for help and he told me to wait for him.just now i went down to watch tv while waiting for him and my mum shouted at me ask me why i never study and I told her i was waiting for my dad. But her tone of voice was hostile,so i was very unhappy and shouted back at her. for a long time i was never this angry. then my dad never say anything just scold me.i told him my mum dunno anything just shout at me.<br><br>all my dad cares is abt my sis,mum,his cooking and his dreams of becoming rich.<br><br>my sis has loads of shoes,bags and watches.and my mum allows her to buy it.i only have a pair of shoes and sandels which i go out to sch and out. my sis has sandels,boots,shoes,heels,almost 1 of each kind.bags ? loads of it. sling bags etc.<br><br>my bag is broken,so is my pencil case which is more than 6yrs.tattered and torn i dont dare to buy because i am afraid to get scolded for that and my dad's long philosophy(sp?).<br><br>that time i asked for raise of 30dollars pocket money, and then my sis asked for 100. and she asked for it because i asked for a raise too. and FYI it's not because she is in the U so she needs more money.<br><br>My sis always gets away with going out w/o telling. and she goes out much more often than me when i had holidays last yr.<br><br>remember my other thread here? i got called up during dinner with my friends to go home because he wrongly accused me of not telling him.sometimes he's deaf and blames me for not telling him properly. HELLO?! I am not the one who is 50yrs old ? And i can articulate and pronouce my words clear enough to my friends OK?!<br><br></div>

Nor is it that i am unwilling to refill the drink. but it's NO ONE would do it until me.<br><br>when no one washes the dishes? and my dad happens to see me in the area,he just shouts at me.he still says " i am not scolding you,I am just making a point" when he wants me to do something it's called " everyone has a duty and this is yr duty". when he wants my sis to do it, he begs her to do it.<br><br>I am having my exams now,that day i complained that my sis is making too much noise and i am unable to study.they all gang up and scold me for unable to concentrate.last time when my sis was studying for her O level,A level and Uni exams, they all warned me not to make noise at all. whenever i complain abt the noise, my dad would always tell me long story abt when he was young. he would say " long time ago........" zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz<br><br>this afternoon, i was having probs with my chem tutorials which i took out to do for a revision.i went downstairs to look for him and i sat on a chair next to him while he was watching tv,and the first thing he said was " u idiot,why u cannot keep still issit, much watch tv!" then i just interrupted him and said i got a Q,when he answered he used a much lighter tone.<br><br>then the rest of the day he keep cooking, i asked him for help and he told me to wait for him.just now i went down to watch tv while waiting for him and my mum shouted at me ask me why i never study and I told her i was waiting for my dad. But her tone of voice was hostile,so i was very unhappy and shouted back at her. for a long time i was never this angry. then my dad never say anything just scold me.i told him my mum dunno anything just shout at me.<br><br>all my dad cares is abt my sis,mum,his cooking and his dreams of becoming rich.<br><br>my sis has loads of shoes,bags and watches.and my mum allows her to buy it.i only have a pair of shoes and sandels which i go out to sch and out. my sis has sandels,boots,shoes,heels,almost 1 of each kind.bags ? loads of it. sling bags etc.<br><br>my bag is broken,so is my pencil case which is more than 6yrs.tattered and torn i dont dare to buy because i am afraid to get scolded for that and my dad's long philosophy(sp?).<br><br>that time i asked for raise of 30dollars pocket money, and then my sis asked for 100. and she asked for it because i asked for a raise too. and FYI it's not because she is in the U so she needs more money.<br><br>My sis always gets away with going out w/o telling. and she goes out much more often than me when i had holidays last yr.<br><br>remember my other thread here? i got called up during dinner with my friends to go home because he wrongly accused me of not telling him.sometimes he's deaf and blames me for not telling him properly. HELLO?! I am not the one who is 50yrs old ?
