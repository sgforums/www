              <p>You'll have to try to overcome it if not you will always have problems in future and not many girls like boys that are too shy and quiet.</p>
              <p>Anyway, you still so young, should not think so much about relationships. Most guys loss their gf in NS anyway so its better to get 1 after NS where u got more time and hopefully money to be with her.</p>

              <p>Thats an internal thing. If you really value that friendship, you will be able to find some courage within yourself to overcome it. If you can't, it could just mean shes not that important and you view yourself as more important than her.</p>

              <p><br>That's because she has started to notice the way you have been looking at her secretly and all. I think it's best that you avoid contact with her for now.</p>

              <p>Give yourself sometime to settle ur thoughts. Can you and how can you change urself to be more like the people she likes (If you really die die want her)</p>
              <p>If not, i would suggest just give her up and focus on your studies, 15 is too young for relationships anyway and most relationships at this age won't last long.</p>
