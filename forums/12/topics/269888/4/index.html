I cant believe that sg is still such conservative country and they are so many conservative peeps ard. I mean the girls know at they in for and so does the guys.<br><br>However, I dun believe in cheating. I believe you should be open about your relationship status and views, if the girls accepts it then its fine. I'm currently not attached and have numerous friends of the opposite sex. They know perfectly well that I'm single and do not want to commit to anything at this point. I'm sure alot of guys share this sentiment, be it career or past relationship phobia and stuff like that.<br><br>You may see it as an excuse, but its so true. There are girls who dont mind and are willing to share a close relationship with these guys as they themselves do not want to commit. So if its a relationship based on these understanding, I feel its perfectly alright.<br><br>As someone has mentioned, it could be that the girl went into such an understanding and later on discovered that her feelings had went on further as she has lost the control over it. Some like to call it a game, know how to play it or leave it. If you are not comfortable then dont play, dont get hurt and cry foul cause nobody can force you in.

But then, that is extremely controversial and reflects only my personal opinion. And after all, I'm a guy. And I have had to learn to give up on girls that don't like me as much as I like them, because it "doesn't feel right".<br><br>It's very hard to give up feelings for another person just like that.<br><br>From what you have just said, you cannot expect to go to sleep everyday and just forget about your feelings for him like that.<br><br>Your cautious approach is being threatened by your desire for his love, which may force you to give more than it is advisable.<br><br>It's all up to you.

            <div class='col-md body'>All I can say TS is treading on thin ice base on her post. She already knew the answer to the guy's reply if she bring it out in the open. And if TS 'threatened' the guy will just retreat leaving her standing cold like what he did in his previous relationship. This guy is no wimpy. He knows what he wants and once he set his mind on a decision he will not waver. So, TS, don't try to change him into accepting you as a gf. He will not! And you will hurt deeper. Either continue as you are now, which is to be in this no string attached relationship (which I don't agreelah since I'm from the old school but your choice lah since you try to emulate the western ways of living lifestyle) or leave the relationship completely.<br><br>Actually I don't agree to what you are going to do that is to tell the guy your true feeling cos you are not playing by the rules which you both set up. You violated the rules and now want more out of this relationship. Not really fair to him.
