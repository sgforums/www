We are both single (It's what he claims)<br><br>We started early June this yr. He claims that his gf has left him in april when he decided to return a job which requires very much of his time. I asked him, what's he looking for? He says he's not ready of commitment. He has his fears, but it's not a one-off thing with me. So it's not a non-commitmental relationship right.<br><br>It was ok to me at that point of time, as i also work long hours and i have my own life too. But whats the boundaries of a non-commitmental relationship? Because some of his actions have been making me very confused about non-commitmental relationship. Sometimes he makes me feel like he's a bf, yet sometimes i just feel like a friend. I did ever ask him before, "what am i to u?"<br><br>He said that i have a special place in his heart and he did not sms or call his other girl frens as often. But he has his fears too<br><br>I shall not elaborate what the actions are as it's going to be  novel. But probably you guys can share what do you think of non-commitmental relationship and how it shud be. </div></blockquote>maybe he is implying that he just wants sex. He only wants a sexual relationship with no strings attached.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>

So if a guy wants to choose from 2 or more girlfriends, he will enter non-committal relationships with both, and that makes him a player.<br><br>But what if he's genuinely undecided?<br>Obviously at that point, a good guy will just stand apart from both of the girls, and make his decision, before plunging into one (no pun intended).<br><br>Maybe the key difference here is how far apart he stands from them, before making a decision.

If the guy loves the TS he will understand.<br><br>After a few months, we'll know if the guy or girl is playing when he finally makes a decision on whether to commit or not. If he is still wishy washy or got attached to another gal during the "waiting" period then at least the TS didn't lose much. If he is sincere he will commit and we'll have a happy ending.<br><br>This i think is the best move and yet the hardest when you're in love...</div>
