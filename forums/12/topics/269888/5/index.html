But justice for instance vigilante justice or justice from the law? So i am just saying that it does affect our mindset and principles .<br><br>Well i understand your points hope you get what i was trying to say ya. In the end of the day. . One thing will always affect another in some way.</div></blockquote>Woah. lol .<br>Sorry side track back abit.<br><br>Ordinaryguy32 pretty much grasped the idea behind it.<br><br>I'm referring to <span style="color: red;"><strong>timeless principles</strong></span> for success, love, happiness, war, health, business, etc.<br><br>To name a couple of simple examples.<br><br>Say for instances, the <strong>principles of war</strong>.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Although there are somewhat different versions of the principles of war, changing in time and from country to country, and between various theoreticians, but generally speaking, there is little practical difference between the version of Sun Tzu, who lived about 2500 years ago, and the most updated official version of modern Army. This leads to the further definition of those principles as the timeless principles of war. You will be amazed to discover that the principles which were so true in the age of the sword and arrow are still so true in the age of computerized guided weapons.<br><br>Or say for instances, the <strong>principles of effective living</strong>.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Maybe a simple illustration for effective living is to inculcate a hackneyed proverb like "Don't cry over spilt milk." into your life. I know its a trite, commonplace, and a platitude. But I also know that this hackneyed proverb contains the very essence of distilled wisdom of all ages. They have come out of the fiery experience of the human race and have been handed down through countless generations.<br><br>I think you get the idea - that proven principles are applicable in any age, era, timeline.... despite the changes in practices and beliefs. (With some exceptions)<br><br>As for that <strong>question on justice</strong>, I find it hard to answer as well, but my view is this:<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Justice operates on the principles that man is basically good, that a person of good intent should not be harmed, and one should treat others as one would like to be treated. It includes the notion of procedural fairness. Thus laws are made to protect ourselves, and our way of life.<br><br>Hmmm.. not a very satisfactory answer I believe. Anyway that's my view.<br><br>Badzmaro, I understand what you mean like in the case where some arbiter decides to impose a principle on his people and that can inadvertently affect their mindsets.<br><br>Ya true. I get what you mean.<br><br>As to applying it to the discussion where the future generations' perception of love is concerned. I would say that the chances of the future generations to be governed by a dictator, who deliberately limits the freedom and inhibits the choices of the people thus affecting the principles of love, is really slim. (At least for singapore)<br><br>Anyway, I prefer to focus on the things within one's control than things that one has no control over.<br><br>CHeers<br><br>Ok. Better not hi-jack topic.<br><br>Back to TS's prob.<br><br>LOL</div>

He can just lie his way through isn't it...<br></div></blockquote>yes true tt he can lie his way thru, but since u can't let go, i suppose e best way for u is still to hv a talk with him n tell him abt ur feelings, n if he still wans a non-commitment relationship, ask him wat he means by non-commitment relationship, n if it sounds ok to u, stick to it, I know it's hard, but if u choose to continue u hv to learn to control over ur feelings no matter how hard it is, if not it would be better for you to give this guy up.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by shirurinu:</div><div class="quote_body">In the beginning everything was fine, but he'll always ask me where am i, asking to go back and home and rest, dun go party, dun always go home late etc.<br>He can even tell me straight in the face " go back straight and rest."<br>Is that what a guy in a non-commitmental relationship tell the gal? I thought there's not supposed to be in this way?<br></div></blockquote>Good news, by showing "concern" abt ur whereabouts we can sort of know wat kind of a man he is alre with a simple test.<br><br>It either shows tat his feelings for you is genuine or he is using you.<br><br>Try this little test.<br><br>*Go hv a talk wif him n confide wif him ur feelings, tell him everything.<br>-If he tries to give *(any)reasons n refuse any commitment, he's obviously playing you.  Dump him straightaway.<br>-But if he accepts n decides e 2 of you should be tgt, good news, the chances of him lying to you is much much lower.  You can accept him with a bit of caution.<br><br>Btw WHO can tell me wat is a NON-COMMITMENT RELATIONSHIP?<br>-A relationship where the gal and the guy are not allowed to ask each other's whereabts?<br>-Allowed to go after anyone they fancy during this period?<br>-Dun tell me it's for sex ok..<br>If e ans is as abv, wat is a non-commitment relationship for??  Why would anyone (Deeply In Love) wants such a relationship?</div>
