We are both single (It's what he claims)<br><br>We started early June this yr. He claims that his gf has left him in april when he decided to return a job which requires very much of his time. I asked him, what's he looking for? He says he's not ready of commitment. He has his fears, but it's not a one-off thing with me. So it's not a non-commitmental relationship right.<br><br>It was ok to me at that point of time, as i also work long hours and i have my own life too. But whats the boundaries of a non-commitmental relationship? Because some of his actions have been making me very confused about non-commitmental relationship. Sometimes he makes me feel like he's a bf, yet sometimes i just feel like a friend. I did ever ask him before, "what am i to u?"<br><br>He said that i have a special place in his heart and he did not sms or call his other girl frens as often. But he has his fears too<br><br>I shall not elaborate what the actions are as it's going to be  novel. But probably you guys can share what do you think of non-commitmental relationship and how it shud be. </div></blockquote>It can be everything a long term committed relationship is except for one thing, both sides are free to go into a long term committed relationship with someone else.<br><br>For example they can be sex buddies without any "formal" attachments but as we all know, girls feel emotionally attached with their sex partners whereas many guys (not all) do not feel emotional attachments or have less strong emotional attachments.<br><br>So if you are a girl, you should "protect" yourself from heartbreak and if you are a guy, you should be careful about breaking the girl's heart.</div>

I PERSONALLY [b]DISAGREE</strong> with what some of the forumites have mentioned about this guy not being sincere and all that... I think it'll simply be too early to tell, and surface to deduce at this point... Though they might be right about their 'guess', I would also like to think there's a chance that this guy is genuinely not sure or having emotional baggage... That might render him less suitable to go into a relationship at this point, but not enough to condemn him nor to go on a personality attack on him.[/b]</blockquote>We are in no position to tell whether he is insincere or sincere, player or non-player, genuinely hurt and suffering from a rebound or not.<br><br>But the fact is that a good guy suffering from the after-effects of a broken relationship and knows that there is this particular girl e.g. TS, who likes him should<br><br>1) not hang carrots for the girl to stay close to him and "wait and see"<br>2) not reap the rewards of companionship, dates, and intimacy while "still deciding"<br><br>For the simple reason that it might hurt the girl.<br><br>Sure, it might please the girl (and himself) in the short term, but if things don't work out, the girl is bound to be hit hard.<br><br>And the roles can be reversed too in the above text.<br><br>There is such a status as "platonic friends with mutual acknowledged liking but no promises". The yardstick is that TS can go out with other guys without having to report to that guy.</div>
