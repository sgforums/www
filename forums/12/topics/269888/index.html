Now, ask urself this. Are u willing to accept someone who refuses to commit because of possibly his previous relationships or whatever reasons he come out with? Do u find it just a little strange that he should not want to make a committment to u, despite being single?<br><br>If he says he is still hurting from his previous relationship, that just show that he is an indecisive man who cannot let go of his past, and not yet ready to step into the future. Do u want this type of guy to be ur bf?<br><br>If he refuses to make a committment, and yet makes u feel like u are his gf, then maybe its time to make a stand. Because its obviously unfair to u that u have 2 sit and wonder just what are u in his heart, while he refuses to make a committment, and yet at the same time, sweet-talk u and make u hope.<br><br>Its all up to u really. If u like things as it is now, then leave it as it is. If not, ask him again. Ask him if he sees u two having a future together, or is he just treating u as someone to pass time away. Its for ur own happiness. Rather than waste time and think if he wants in or out of this relationship, sorting it out with him a.s.a.p is better.</div>

Asking what a 'non-commitment' type of relationship should be like is just contradicting yourself... Anything specified would most likely requires a form of 'commitment' to keep up to it. Anything which does not require any form of commitment is not specifying....<br><br>The 'interesting' thing about such a form of relationships is that they often just remain in the GREY AREA.... Often until some time after maybe...? When the relationship starts to develop and more emotions, efforts and needless 'commitment' starts to pour in... To that stage, it's only natural that at least one of the parties would start to demand or request more... Upset point is when a 'balance' is not maintained... Meaning one party grows with the relationship while the other simply refuses to... When it's 'balanced', it would become a 'give and take' situation... Where the stakes would be raised with time... VERY often, this process repeating can be quite hazardous and 'painful'.... There'll be more often than not struggles to find the identity (re-recognise) of the relationship and the identity of the 2 individuals within the relationship... It COULD come to a point where both parties decide that they wanna convert it to a COMMITMENT relationship (with or without them realising it), hardly would a relationship at its low point keep still or move backwards (or they'll simply fail to exist with time)....<br><br>The strange thing I would like to ask is.... From the way you've described it all... You don't seems to be suitable for a 'non-commitment' relationship.... Why even step into it in the 1st place? Why play with fire if you now likely you'll be the one burnt?<br><br>PS. I PERSONALLY <strong>DISAGREE</strong> with what some of the forumites have mentioned about this guy not being sincere and all that... I think it'll simply be too early to tell, and surface to deduce at this point... Though they might be right about their 'guess', I would also like to think there's a chance that this guy is genuinely not sure or having emotional baggage... That might render him less suitable to go into a relationship at this point, but not enough to condemn him nor to go on a personality attack on him.</div>
