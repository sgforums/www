IMHO, love is<br><br>1) when she wants to b free so tat she can b happy, even tho' it hurts, u will do it..<br><br>2) protecting the one u love even to the extend of sacrifising some of urself..<br><br>3) no matter how the other person looks like or behave, u wll accept..<br><br>4) standing by him in terms of "life &amp; death"..<br><br>All these mentioned above can b labelled as foolish, but tat's how love is.
