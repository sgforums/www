              <div id="post_message_2586449">Hi, I have recently obtained my retest results for my promotional examination and totally bombed it. As I enter the JC through a special appeal, I am not given a chance to repeat in the JC but the principal is willing to contact another JC in which my l1r5 meets the criteria. However, I was advised to take the poly route as i was only able to pass 1 h2 sub during the retest.<br><br>I am rather skeptical of entering a poly alternative as I have already used a year for my JC education and I felt that with that extra year I could do better as I have more time for my studies instead of working on my project work.<br><br>Nonetheless, I do have problems in JC as well which resulted in my results. Firstly, I didn't really liked the environment I was in as I didn't really have a good relationship with my class - thus one might say an outcast- I felt no matter how hard I studied, I just didn't have the interest in it. Therefore, the fear of repeating and having this problem once again could result in my failure in JC once more. I know such situation could be identical if I were in a poly but at least I will be able to survive in a poly if such situation occurs despite hating the course.<br><br>Therefore, I am not really sure about choosing to retain in another JC if I was given a choice or should I take the poly route or even a private poly route which allows me to obtain a diploma within a year and therefore being able to catch up with those in my batch.</div>

              <p>Firstly, i think your definition of hard is "not that hard". Anyone who pays attention in tutorials/lectures, does his/her homework consistently and put in a little hard work would not have any problem passing any H2 subjects.</p>
              <p>Secondly, i think you shouldn't include "class-relation" as an issue. If you have problem mixing with JC people, I believe that you'll also face the same problem in Poly. Always remember, you're where you are to get an education, not to entertain people.</p>
              <p>I strongly advise you to consider going into Poly. Judging by the way you wrote, I think you'll have problems getting promoted. Although you're lagging by a year, it's better than getting retained again and opting into Poly.<br><br>My final advise is to put private Polys at the end of your list. Those diplomas they offer aren't as recognised as mainstream Polys, and for the price you're paying, it just not worth the buck. Don't be tempted by their shorter academic term. Always remember that instant things are usually bad for you.</p>

It's gonna be pointless if you have no idea and basically just anyhow pick a course that your L1R4 fits. After 3 years when you get your dip w lousy credits and the lack of passion, you're not gonna appreciate your decision you made 3 years ago. So I suggest you really sit down and think about it, talk to someone maybe.</p></div>

              <p>some questions:</p>
              <p>do you like wad you experienced in JC? a change of JC only means that you have a change of physical environment. but you will still encounter the same things, maybe albeit in a slightly different form in a new JC. Is JC suitable for you?</p>
              <p>do you have the self discipline? in Poly u go by GPA which is measured by consistent effort put in from yr 1 to yr 3. many ppl i noe wasted away their 1st yr  or 3rd yr, and ended up not being able to progress to uni. Poly might indeed be easier, but it takes alot of willpower not to be distracted by all the happening things going on around you.</p>
              <p>A levels is the one single exam you have to take to go uni. all other exams  taken in sch will not count. so r u a one-shot guy or r u disciplined enough to go slow, but steady all the way for 3 yrs?</p>

              <p>Hi <span style="font-size: 15px; line-height: 17px; color: #333333; font-weight: bold;"><a style="text-decoration: none; color: #5d5ebc;" href="http://sgforums.com/users/252776">AnimeSakuraTM</a>,</span></p>
              <p>    .  Perhaps If I may summarise, you seem to have the following challenges and concerns:</p>
              <p>   1. You felt that taking the poly route may waste 1 more year of your time.</p>
              <p>   2. You are afraid of the same bad experience you had (cannot get along with friends) if you go another JC.</p>
              <p>     Allow me to comment on the 2nd point first.  It seemed that you are experiencing a 'once bitten twice shy' complexion which made you a little hesitant about going to the other JC which your principal is trying to arrange for you.  But if you can overcome this fear of the future by learning from the past, taking the JC route may still be viable.  Perhaps instead of telling yourself - "No, I had a hardtime making friends in JC, I am not going to go thru again in the next JC", u may want to ask yourself, "What went wrong the last time and how can I do it differently the next time?"</p>
              <p>    As for point 1, even though you may need an extra year when comparing with your batch, if you switch to option 2, you will also be one year out of sync with them.  I guess the important may be to ask yourself (if you choose poly) is to know what you really want to do in future.  The mainstream polys are well established and recognised by industry.  Hence it is worthwhile to invest your time and $$ in proper training and certification.  Better have an established cert later than a questionable one in short term and then regret later because not many companies would recognise them.  Thinking long term is important.</p>
              <p>   Hope this helps.</p>
