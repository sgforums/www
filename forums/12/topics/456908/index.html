              <p>First thread, please be gentle. </p>
              <p>I've been living in states for awhile for my degree. I graduated, and I found a job. My boss applied work visa for me, and I got it approved. Cool? Erm.. I don't know. I don't think this is the kind of job I really want it. I don't really have good options for jobs since I have no permanent resident status. My employer is nice to me, but I just can't see my future from this company. I've taken my time and spent a year working. I just could not see it.</p>
              <p>I have applied countless jobs, and got no reply. Got rejected few times because of my international student status. It was really frustrating. </p>
              <p>If you think foreigners are having tough time finding jobs in Singapore, that also implies how tough foreigners are getting jobs in the United States. It's probably tougher due to the limitation of the available work visa, capped 65,000 visas every year. </p>
              <p>I, then, tried to search jobs in Singapore. I hope that I could at least get a decent job with my good qualification. </p>
              <p>Cool! I got a job that I always want it. I will learn stuff based on my study, engineering. Tho the paid will not be that good. I'm okay with that as long as I could get my way up someday. </p>
              <p>Problem is now my emotion. </p>
              <p>Anyway, I have been living with my sister for awhile. There are good and bad times. My feeling is really sour that I will be moving back to Asia in less than two months. </p>
              <p>My parents live close to Singapore. It's cool that I could see them often. However, my sister had applied green card for them. Soon or later, they will be moving to US. </p>
              <p>On the other hand, I really have no other choices. I could not get the PR in short amount of time. </p>
              <p>The moment I leave the country US, I will not see my siblings for a long time. :(</p>
              <p>I would say it would be 10 years before I could move back to US. </p>
              <p>I'm a grown up man. I know that a man needs to move and fight for his future. I just can't help it now. I feel very sour that I've gotta leave my comfort zone.</p>
              <p>Thank you for listening. I've signed the contract, and I'll be moving to sg soon.</p>
              <p>Hope things go well. Hope that my employer knows my values are. Hope that God leads my way. </p>
              <p>Hope that I can make good friends there :)</p>

              <p>It's normal to experience anxiety when you are unsure of your future. </p>
              <p>My advise to you is to be as adaptive as you possibly can. Be flexible and flow with the wind.</p>
              <p>Expectations will always lead to dis appointments.  So be prepared to live through culture shock and clashes. </p>
              <p>In a global world and advance technology, you are only an Internet connection away.</p>
