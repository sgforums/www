              <p>at 1 time, i have confront him and asked him why does he called every morning? he said that he called me for chat and asking me whether is it affecting me?  am i thinking too much ? after that day, he stop calling me and seldom msn me. </p>
              <p>So lately, he started to call/sms me again but this time round, the feeling is kinda of different. it like we feel more closer than ever and we even talk more.</p>

              <p>Describe him.</p>
              <p>I suspect he might be lacking in the confidence department to make the move; to put it crudely, the one playing the 'guy' role suffers from fear of rejection most of the time.</p>
              <p>If you're interested to take this friendship to the next level, why not take the initiatitive?</p>

              <p><br>Do you like him?</p>
              <p>If not, treat him as a friend and don't be bothered by him.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Yes I agree guys are irritating most of the times, especially when they don't know what they are doing too.</p>
              <p>Don't be surprised to know that 99.99% of the guys out there probably don't know what they are doing when they are with the girl that they liked.</p>
              <p>So girls always need to guide those dumb guys and help them to go after ourselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Without enough consenting women to be involved in some form of relationship with a guy, the guy can never become a womanizer. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>
              <p>Guys should just wake up and start paying attention to their outlook and appearances, if they want to attract girls and if they need to attract girls.</p>

              <p>pardon me.. but I tend to prepare for the worst... so the worst case scenerio: he has a list of girls to call and you happen to be in the "morning shift".</p>

              <p>some guys are terribly shy and sensitive. Fear of rejection and unsure of what you are thinking.</p>
              <p>More importantly, do you like him? If not, just be friends ba. If yes, are you brining the friendship to the next level?</p>
              <p>Out of curiousity, do you call him at other time?</p>
              <p>hmmm... absence makes the hearts fonder? hahah..anyway.. good for you la. Just continue to chat, msn ...etc until he is comfortable to ask u out? or you drop a hint to him? I go with the flow. no stress =)</p>

              <p>I'd assume you didn't enjoy the guessing game, and from what you said, you do have feelings for him.</p>
              <p>Why not intitate the first move by asking him out then? Some girls I know like to play 'hard to get' so the guy will treasure her more.  However, opportunities like this may not happen often, and I'm pretty certain you wouldn't want to regret later.</p>
              <p>Another thing is, if he's sincere about the friendship or simply comfortable talking to you, he wouldn't avoid you just because you asked him out. Maybe during the conversation, you could mention a movie that you really want to watch etc...</p>

              <p>Just need a opinion and views on the following case......<br>I get to know a guy from my msn  and we start to msn, sms and calling each other for the past 3 months. He has been calling me every morning ( only weekdays only ) just to chat. And now if he does not call , i will feel very uneasy.</p>
              <p>at 1 time, i have confront him and asked him why does he called every morning? he said that he called me for chat and asking me whether is it affecting me?  am i thinking too much ? after that day, he stop calling me and seldom msn me. </p>
              <p>So lately, he started to call/sms me again but this time round, the feeling is kinda of different. it like we feel more closer than ever and we even talk more.</p>
              <p>But one thing strange, he does not initiate to ask me out. </p>
              <p>so what u gals think and what should i do?</p>

              <p>You feel uneasy is bcos he entered your life(mentally)..Routine mah..</p>
              <p>He "disappear" for awhile then appear again.(Make you yearn for him,when he come back hook you in your mind more)</p>
              <p>Where will hv cat no eat fish.. be prepared..if that guy is what comes to my mind now.. he is using his tactics &amp; stratagie..He is a player...BUT again, mayb is think too much.</p>
              <p>You can also go with your heart &amp; jio him come out, see how is him actually lor..but personelly, you see his good 1st, then slowely see his bad.<br>OR<br>You can play along wait till he jio you out.</p>
