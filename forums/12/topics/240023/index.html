            <div class='col-md body'>Definitely after my secondary school days.<br>After i left that school, and went to JC.<br>I was a loner for most of my sec school days, very very few friends. I think I had more friends who are my junior than I had of people ard my age that time.<br>I think a lot has 2 do with the fact that I was a big arsehole back then, and I was a compulsive liar.<br><br>At a age when I think acceptance from others was THE THING, I found myself having to gain acceptance frm people as a way of accpeting myself back then.  And hence did a lot of stupid things. But after getting my O-levels and then going to JC, did I realise the most impt thing is not how people look at u, but how u look at urself.<br><br>My most memorable time was when I was in SIM. Was there for less than 6 mths, but gained life-long friends, friends who are willing to stick thick and thin with u. Gosh, those happy days.</div>
