              <p>well first of all, is it a date or is it a outing just a online friend?</p>
              <p>perhaps he don't react as a gentlemen, but why should he please you when you are not his gf? lols.</p>
              <p>in this case, i think he just wants to make more friends. or perhaps he wants to know more female friends through you, since he suggest to you to bring your single friends along to join him for an outing. back to your question interested in you wise, i doubt so.</p>
              <p>just my thoughts. ;)</p>

Nor did he behave like a gentleman during the date."</span></em></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>1) As this is the first date, he may want to go slow. Therefore the suggestion of group dating. Maybe he is shy. Maybe he is uncomfortable on a single date. </span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>2) From the way you described him, he seems very much like a novice when come to dating and woman. No 'experienced' guy would go Dutch with a woman on the first date. But everyone else has a first so be a little gentle and forgiving on him. He is learning the role - so to speak. </span></p>
              <p><em><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>"I thought this means that he is not interested to see me again.

              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>3) Switch from net dating to face-to-face dating is a whole new experience. He is trying to seize you up as much as you are trying to seize him up. The way he seized you up may not be comfortable or agreeable to you. Because both of you have diff expectations, his action may seems contradictory or confusing to you.  <br><br><em>"Then he said he believe if i work hard in exercising and training, i would attain a good figure. He feels that it will be a waste if i just don't toned up as he sees that i have a good"bone structure". </em></span></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>4) Maybe he is not implying anything. Maybe he said it tongue-in-cheek manner - that if you exercise, you will have better figure. I read from somewhere that man and woman have diff references when come to communicating. You may want to ask yourself if your reference point on this area is the same as his.</span></p>
              <p><em><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>"My question now is " Is he interested in me?"" </span></em></p>
              <p><span style='font-family: "Arial","sans-serif"; color: black;'>5) Just go slow. Interest should not be an area of discussion at this point - unless both of you are in your late 30s and rushing to get hitched asap. If you are still young, in 20s - take your time to peel off layer-by-layer your partner's personality and character - to find out if both of your are really compatible, and this is a more important factor than anything else.   </span></p>

Anyway, your post is your own perspective, and it can be quite lopsided. If you are really interested in him, (don't bother to think too much if he is interested in you, if it works it works), go on a few more dates. If you keep thinking about what he thinks of you, it gives you more undue stress instead of being true to yourself.</p></div>

              <p>typical fucked up guy..ditch him..he's prolly got bored of u hence, he tried to widen his chances by getting u to invite more single ladies. Thus coming out with such excuses. Its not about whether he is ur bf yet but i personally believe a date is like a game, u have to play thru its rules, each has a specific role to play. And him, total screwed up, æ²¡é£Žåº¦(not sure correct spelling anot) kinda guy.</p>
              <p>going dutch on first date, big mistake. telling u to do sth bout ur figure, wrong move. tho not obliged to send u home but not msging u just shows how nonchalant he is.</p>
              <p>whats more, going on a movie for first or first few date, terrible mistake because pple dont take enough time to get to know each other.</p>
              <p>so final conclusion, quoting him "Then he said he believe if i work hard in exercising and training, i would attain a good figure. He feels that it will be a waste if i just don't toned up as he sees that i have a good"bone structure".</p>
              <p>yes he is interested in u, just on the appearance/body, nothing else.</p>
              <p>just my two cents</p>

              <p>My opinion is he might be taking things slowly. I think he's testing water and looking for somebody to go out with. I went out with quite a few guys and they all went Dutch, including the one who professed his interest in me before lol.</p>

              <p>Hi bearie,</p>
              <p>My opinion is he might be taking things slowly. I think he's testing water and looking for somebody to go out with. I went out with quite a few guys and they all went Dutch, including the one who professed his interest in me before lol.</p>

              <p>I don't like that he mentioned body to her either. It was either insensitive or reflecting his own intentions or he could be liberal. But anyways, ulterior motive or not, he wouldn't be able to do anything if all she does is just do activities with him and put a wall so thick not even a machine gun can bust through it between them both.</p>

              <p>I just went on a date with a guy i knew from the net.<br>At the end of the date, he said if there's time, i could ask my single friends out and join his friends for an outing. He didn't go his way out to please me and we went dutch. When i told him I'm interested in a particular activity, he just simply dismissed it as not his cup of tea. Nor did he behave like a gentleman during the date..<br><br>I thought this means that he is not interested to see me again. Then he said if there are nice movies, he can ask me out for a movie date again. I tried to tell him that I'm interested in watching one movie, but he quickly said he isn't a nice movie, and that he will decide again.<br><br>He did not send me home or send me a sms to ask if i have safely arrived home at 11 plus. Then later in the evening, we "met" each other on msn. To my surprise, he said i hope u enjoyed the date...and i hope we can do it again. Then he said he believe if i work hard in exercising and training, i would attain a good figure. He feels that it will be a waste if i just don't toned up as he sees that i have a good"bone structure". Well, during the date, we did discuss on exercising and body training matters.<br><br>My question now is " Is he interested in me?" He got me confused with his mixed messages.. first with his nonchalance attitude during the date..then asking me to invite my single female friends for a group outing..then telling me he hopes he can go out with me again..</p>
