              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I just went on a date with a guy i knew from the net.<br> At the end of the date, he said if there's time, i could ask my
              single friends out and join his friends for an outing. He didn't go
              his way out to please me and we went dutch. When i told him I'm
              interested in a particular activity, he just simply dismissed it as
              not his cup of tea. Nor did he behave like a gentleman during the
              date..<br> <br> I thought this means that he is not interested to see me again.
              Then he said if there are nice movies, he can ask me out for a
              movie date again. I tried to tell him that I'm interested in
              watching one movie, but he quickly said he isn't a nice movie, and
              that he will decide again.<br> <br> He did not send me home or send me a sms to ask if i have safely
              arrived home at 11 plus. Then later in the evening, we "met" each
              other on msn. To my surprise, he said i hope u enjoyed the
              date...and i hope we can do it again. Then he said he believe if i
              work hard in exercising and training, i would attain a good figure.
              He feels that it will be a waste if i just don't toned up as he
              sees that i have a good"bone structure". Well, during the date, we
              did discuss on exercising and body training matters.<br> <br> My question now is " Is he interested in me?" He got me confused
              with his mixed messages.. first with his nonchalance attitude
              during the date..then asking me to invite my single female friends
              for a group outing..then telling me he hopes he can go out with me
              again..</p>

              <p>I think he's the type of guy who goes for a girl that is ugly/average looking and asks for the number for the single girls. If you were to date this guy, it would end in a bad way. If he's the guy who actually asks you to shape up a bit, he loves a girl with "good/slim body shape".</p>
              <p>Anyways you don't deserve a guy like him, you should go find yourself a guy who appreciates your look.</p>

              <p>From what I understand from your post, I think he's just not interested in you (after the date). Sorry to be frank, but your appearance may not appeal to him.. that's why he asked you to bring your single and available female friends along for him to choose from.</p>
              <p>After that he said both of you can meet again, then commented that you will look better after toning up your body. He's just despo for women and hopes that you can improve your appearance for him to get interested in you.</p>
              <p>Conclusion - he's just a despo pervert.</p>
