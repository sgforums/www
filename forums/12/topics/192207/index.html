            <div class='col-md body'>Like the title of your thread says..  "FINALLY......... boys to men". This is a process that one has to go thru. It's 2 years now, compared to my time.. way back when you are probably still a toddler (it was in 1989, when I got enlisted).<br><br>I received my posting and I frozed... It was Hendon Camp!... Stoned for 1 whole day in my room, fearing the unknown.. Din know what to expect.<br><br>My time during my army daze were fun, despite all the games the instructors played with us.. in the middle of the night.. giving us only 2 hours of sleep... etc.<br><br>Bottomline is, it's all in the attitude. You are not the only one that will / had went thru the 2 grueling years of "boys to men" transformation process. Be strong (mentally) &amp; prep physically.. You will make it.<br><br>Good luck!<br><br></div>

"yes sir", wearing uniforms, march, learning code words, military songs, and whatever BS there is. its just not my thing. i belive many of you understand what i mean by that.  and now, i gotta do it for 2 freakin years?? i always have the logic that with hard work, one can make a million in a year. let alone 2. now dont get it wrong that i will be able to do. its just an example of how 2 years can change a persons life. girls already have a head start in their careers. i am really really sad and stress up right now. seriously.. i know there's no escaping. but dang...  is NS really not THAT bad and 2yrs past by so easily?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>PS: to anybody who completed NS over here, i got a few questions. pls help.<br><br>1) my fren told me BMT is 3months. and i thought that 3months i'll be stuck in the camp cannot go out. but he told me yes its 3months, but only the first 2weeks i'll be locked inside. after that, i can come out ever weekends for the next 2months+. is it true?<br><br>2) i heard the situation in camp is alot better den our father time. as lame as it sounds, do everybody have to bath naked together or is there seperate door like a usual toilet? do they give you limited shiitin time?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>3) the most important of all. i doesn't know how to swim! and i heard that in NS, they will throw you inside the river and slowly 'teach' you and let you swim. and without completing a certain quite far distance, you gotta stay back stay back and stay back. is it even true? this is one of the reason im really worried about. i got fears of water.. i think im gonna freak out if they told me to swim in some river or even a 2m swimmin pool. is it really complusory to swim?? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>please guys.. if im not that stressed out right now, i wont resort to posting in a forum. not that its bad. but theres always some ppl who gonna try to bring another person down here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation">  its a public forum afterall. but for those kind souls, thanks.<br></div></blockquote>I think most of already answered your questions before me... But let me be long-winded and answer my fair share as well....<br><br>Before I got into NS, I had the same mentality with you about the 2 years head start for women and wearing uniform thingy... But at this point you should really understand... This is really something you can't avoid... Now... That should makes you feel better...? Many had initially thought that it's a TOTAL WASTE of TIME in there for the 2 years... IN FACT, though I personally agrees that 2 years might be quite long... But whether it's a total waste of time or not, depends on your own mentality to pick up and learn things... And make use of whatever spare time you might have... (Don't think too much about 'spare time' during your BMT 1st!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  )<br><br>One of the 1st thing you might not get used to is the confinement.. You NEED to TREAT ARMY like your NEW HOME!! In fact it's NOT EVEN your 2nd home... it's gonna be your 1st HOME!! YES!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Learn to GET USED to the ROUTINE and LIFE in there... Know your commanders... How to handle your superiors and PEERS...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> Learn to EAT, SLEEP and SH|T with them!! It CAN BE TOUGH, but NOBODY'S telling you it CAN'T be FUN!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>1. Yes. You'll be confined for the 1st 2 weeks... Subsequently so long as you don't make mistakes or meet objectives, you should be pretty much ok...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"> The POINT is to STAY ALERT at ALL TIMES!!<br><br>2. Yeah... Things are ALOT BETTER now.. How you would be treated would very much depends on your commanders....<br><br>3. You swim in a pool.... They'll teach you but you must be willing to enter the water... There'll be no escaping that... If you can't pass your swimming, you might lost much priviledges compared to others....</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Some tips on how to survive in the first stage of army life, BMT:<br><br>BMT:<br>1) make friends, make friends, make friends.<br><br>Start immediately. Try not to make enemies. Friends will help us get things done, reinforce each other's knowledge of lessons, defend us against backstabbers, and generally raise our morale. They may become our pillars of strength. Having friends means BMT will be alot more enjoyable. Very important.<br><br>Help everyone, don't treat anyone badly, even if they may not treat you well.<br><br>2) Just do as you as told.<br><br>Instructors detest smart alecks, who assume things can be done their way, that their way is better. Army doesn't work that way. One thing you have to learn is to: not be individualistic. Just do things the way you are told, the way you are taught. No room to be individualistic in BMT.<br><br>You will have learn things quickly, and do things quickly the way you are told. Never assume.<br><br>3) Understand that Army culture is different from civilian life.<br><br>The moment you step foot in camp, understand that you are entering a different world. This is not to make you feel stress, but to tell you to expect that at the start of BMT, instructors will be especially hard on all the recruits. Everyone, not just you. They will use all sorts of colourful language on all of you, they will harass all of you. This is done to establish control, so that recruits will understand that in Army, you have to obey orders. Don't fight this. Roll with it.<br><br>Understand that instructors don't have anything personal against you. When they use vulgar language on you, when they punish you, <strong>dont take it personally</strong>. Generally, it is done to teach you about something. Just relax about it, man. Don't hate them, this only wastes energy and distract you what you need to do, what you need to learn. Instructors will begin to let up a little once they see that the recruits are tranforming to suit the system, when they learn army discipline, the way to think and the way to do things in army.<br><br>BMT will be tough at the beginning, but as you begin to understand the system and make more friends, things will get better.<br><br>4) Be strong, there's nothing to be afraid of.<br><br>The transition from civilian life to army life may take a little getting used to. One my first day of BMT, I thought to myself, "how can I live like this for the next 2.5 years?" But once I learnt that my mindset had to change, that I was no longer a civilian but a soldier in training, then i began to understand what i was going through is necessary. So you will learn to change your mindset, the sooner the better.<br><br>Also know that treatment of soldiers nowadays is strictly regulated and monitored. Instructors may make life difficult for you, but they will also take care of you physically. Good instructors will take care of you emotionally and mentally. But not every instructor is good, so you have to take care of yourself. Make friends, they will help you get through it all.<br><br>-------<br><br>End with this cliche - many people have got through it, don't be afraid that you cannot make it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
