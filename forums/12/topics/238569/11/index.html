            <div class='col-md body'>Just had a long conversation with him.<br><br>A conversation that he said we'll never have again.<br><br>He told me to him sexual intimacy is an intricate part of love he cant change that. He said how much i'd go with him doesnt determine how much he'd love me but at the back of his back it's how much i love him. He told me he loves me so much he'd die for me but feels very insecure bout my feelings towards him because of this he thinks bout it so much start feeling so empty esp when he has urges it is causing him immense pain it's such a mental torment he had cried and had sleepless nights and he believes this will go on. he admitted what i hav said is true that this is our irreconcilable gap but he doesnt want to give up on me cos of that. he really loves me he cant let go of his feelings. so he told me that from now onwards he'll just keep all related to this issue to himself and suffer on his own, he doesnt want to talk about this anymore since we won't be able to resolve it.<br><br>I don't know what to do. As much as it hurts me so I brought up the thought of letting him go cos I simply can't bear to see him in constant pain and misery but he said i'd just hurt him more this way. I really dun want that ending any more he does yet I don't see any way how it can work out. Wanted to assure him that my feelings to him are true and my apparent lack of willingness to commit sexually doesn't reflect that I don't love him as much but he just dismissed that as my attempts to cover up. enough said he told me, n spoke that if he were to show me the dozens of books he has bout relationship it all concurs that when a couple reaches a depth in love it's natural that they would want to go sexual and thus it speaks of the feelings i have for him. There's no way I can talk him out of this yet i m witnessing his mental and physical conditions deteriorate as this wears on and that he'd always hav to take sleeping pills to sleep so often I really don't wish this to go on.<br><br>Even though he said he's willing and determined to go on this way to keep the status quo I cant help worrying about the long term detrimental effects to his health. I'm really worried bout him, it's not the right ways to sustain things. and he even mentioned taking this drug that will make men "sterile" for a few years or so. I'm really afraid that he would do things harmful to his mental and physcial health since especially he said that after today he's not gona tell me anything related to this issue anymore he doesnt want me to get the wrong idea n feel pressured. How can i put my mind at ease when at the back of my mind i never know wat's brewing beneath the lovely surface? with the nagging thought that he may be on his path to self destruction n i wont even b aware of it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>The past will come back and haunt u eventually<br><br>Seriously i admire girls like you who have a determined mind set of chastity and it is really respectable in such era where fling and sex is really common. Honestly, his views of relationship would not change because he self-belief that sex meant a certain depth in a relationship. That is however a personal idealogy thinking of others based on situation and culture of the west, which had been open since ages before our local culture. His acceptable views of a relationship have been deemed unacceptable in your own idealogy and thinking.<br><br>Everyone has a different meaning to how deep a relationship is to individuals. Sex, nevertheless, is one method that some people used to judge a relationship. Others like kissing, holding hands etc. might be others' meaning that a secure relationship has taken place.<br><br>My advise would be that both of you start doing things that you enjoyed together and try to put the issue behind you. If he truly loves you, being self- destructive isnt a way to show love.<br><br>PS: Sorry about the poor english due to the fact i haven't been writing or typing since years<br></div>

This guy's brain is so full of sex that nothing else matters to him at all.<br><br>stop wasting your time if you feel like wasting your first time on a guy like him go ahead, no one can stop you. Stop thinking how painfull he will feel leh. Just do it and get over with it. OR just dump him is as clear cut as possible.<br><br>if a guy really love you he will never complain or force you. To me he is just that type who wants to have fun thats all.<br><br>If you still want to think it over challenge him this . If you love me go to ROM with me sign the doc, then we do it. you will see all his dumb excuses all over again.</div>

What about him showing his love to you? You can tell him that love for me is all about showing understanding and not forcing you to have sex with him when you are apparently not ready.<br><br>My advice is: Don't give in to him so easily. Once you give in, the thing you are trying to preserve for so long will be lost forever.
