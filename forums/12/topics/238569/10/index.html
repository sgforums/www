On the surface act like heck care but actually hope that you still virgin. Typically, guys want their gf or wife to be virgins.<br><br>Funny thing is that despite so, quite a number of them went around deflowering virgins. And then they turn around and complain about their gf and spouses not being virgins or that girls nowadays losing moral blah blah blah. They seem to have totally forgotten the part they've played in it. The way they coerced the girls into sex in the name of love. And I mean it by the most typical cases. What I've said don't apply to the really decent boys and the immoral girls who doesn't give a heck to their chaste by sleeping around.<br><br>Personally, I think chastity is very important and I hail your decision in this matter. Don't give in lor. If he wants more than what he gets now, you will know the kind of hypocrite he really is.<br><br>The truth is, many guys want their girl to be chaste but it all goes down to the way they act about it. Your boyfriend isn't making a great impression, unfortunately. No offense but he stinks a little to me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sex is not a solution to any problem. It WILL only bring more problems.<br><br>Do not use emotional intimacy as a level of guidance for physical intimacy. Rather, stay true to your own beliefs. Emotional intimacy could be momentarily and could be the way he plays into your pants.<br><br>Purity and chasity are values still highly regarded in our society. You can conduct a survey if you want, but I can honestly say all men would want their wives to be their first time.<br><br>If his feelings for you are truly strong and right, he should respect your decision and even support your stand.<br><br>I'm really sorry but what I can say is despite your strong feelings towards him, but I feel this guy is not for you. The fact that he wants you to change FOR HIM rather than him accepting you as you are, shows that he just wants to satisfy his desire.<br><br>"ytd he lamented that only if i were older things would b easier my mindset would hav been different." - this sentence just shows how much he wants you to change and think like him, and give him what he wants.<br><br>I agree with Bontakun's suggestion. More physical intimacy is not a solution to the problem right now. To add on, you can try writing a list of consequences or regrets that you might have. That may strengthen your resolve.<br><br>I wish you all the best.</div>

My point from quite an earlier part of this thread... 2 of them are holding on to a major difference in mindset to this relationship... Especially when this 'factor' (sex) is quite significant to them. So they might not really be quite compatible, especially when there seems to be no 'downplay negotiation' for either party...<br><br>Of all that I've posted earlier... I'm currently maintaining to my suggestions at the assumption that they would still like to be together... Since if like TS has mentioned, and many 'solutions' have failed.. It might be ok to use 'petting' and such such substitute for now if they're both agreeable to it? No doubt I won't deny the possibility of the 'next step' or difficulty in 'self-restraint', that's why I mentioned the control of environment and such so that those situations are less likely to happen... Apart from that, I don't think actual sex is gonna happen unless he intend to rape her? (not possible though if there's control in environment, limiting his ability to perform that).. If it's a 2 way thing and both of them just feel that they're ok with it... Perhaps it might not end up so bad afterall..? If not, he's still be 'pushing' for it like he's doing now anyhow...? The situation might be just more or less the same...<br><br>But generally speaking, I do agree with some of the forumites that it's very inappropriate and insensitive of him to use 'emotional blackmail' for 'sex'... But I shall not comment more as it's the TS's decision to stick with him despite all the 'torments'. Despite what we've heard of what's the 'problem' and what he has been doing... We really do not know how he's handling other aspects of the relationship to weigh if TS should really be sticking to him and whether it's worth it....? So I shall just restrict my suggestions and comments to such as of now.</div>
