It's either both of you have a way to negotiate or 'give in' to the other party's principle or point of view which would make this relationship last long enough... Else, it would just be too difficult with quarrels and tiffs...? Unless you're telling me those 'tiffs' really ain't that serious on basis...? Then maybe it's still not that bad to let time 'pass along'...?<br><br>The other alternative standpoint would be unless both of you get married... But then again, I would have to question what's really the purpose of the marriage itself...? For love? Or just to 'prove' something else...?<br><br>I must say.. It's quite normal of you to feel much insecured... Only 2 months plus and he's trying to tell you it would be 'forever'...? Not trying to belittle what's really coming between the 2 of you... But from the way I personally see it... It could be... 1. He's just saying things for the sake of saying it... 2. He's too terribly emerged into something, and would likely be wearing off that amplitude of feeling one day... 3. His own form of insecurity... Likely to be emotional baggage carried forward from his previous relationship(s).<br><br>By the way, I think you really need to explain things to him...? He's really having this terrible delusion...? Having sex = you'll be his forever? In terms of what...? Body..? Soul..? Heart..? Well.. Sad to say, it's not gonna work for any of the mentioned... A simple thing to prove his 'hypothesis' wrong would be his previous relationships... He had sex with his ex-gfs right? So where are them now?<br><br>Straighten his thoughts... Tell him not to go for a relationship on a delusioned mind... It's gonna be a VERY DANGEROUS MOVE... If he's sincere enough to care for the real future of the relationship that is?<br><br>Ok. I see your point about your 'preservance'. I won't comment much as to whether it's a 'good' move or not as I believe 'to each their own'.... But my personal belief related to your point is... I don't think love needs to be 'proven'... But rather, love would prove itself... Requiring something else to 'prove' a 'love' can just be pathetic... The 'test' to prive anything itself is already likely to be saying that insufficient love is there by itself...<br><br>One basic thing to learn in a relationship is to learn to RESPECT the other party... Especially if that 'something' is so much precious to one of the parties...<br><br>Tell him to drop his past please.. You are YOU and NOT his EX...
