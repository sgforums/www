Finally he smsed me sorry he had too much troubles.<br><br>At last his whiny i want to die attitude died out for now. since he so wants it that way n i hav no better way of being ultra sensitive to his fragile psyche while dealing with our issues i shall just leave him alone for now. both of us really need to do some quiet thinking. if he's unrepentant i m taking off. my heart's crying no but my mind says i hav to go, this cant go on forever. my love may be forgiving but there's only so much i can take. i m only willing to give him one more chance for all that we've been thru. guess i'll have a good gauge of my answer at 9.</div></blockquote>just say good riddance to him  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>trust me, you will be happier without such a guy in your life</div>

YA RITE. sometimes i wish i could curse that he has erectile dsyfunction oneday n i would tell him bout bout getting hots from porn n stuff he can try how it feels like. i wasnt even saying he cant watch porn just he really NEED NOT MENTION it to me all the time such that it's becoming a pain. after some squabbling he goes like "Fine.Everything also go ur way.". seems like he hasnt understood me.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"> </div></blockquote>Lolz!

He said how much i'd go with him doesnt determine how much he'd love me but at the back of his back it's how much i love him. He told me he loves me so much he'd die for me but feels very insecure bout my feelings towards him because of this he thinks bout it so much start feeling so empty esp when he has urges it is causing him immense pain it's such a mental torment he had cried and had sleepless nights and he believes this will go on. he admitted what i hav said is true that this is our irreconcilable gap but he doesnt want to give up on me cos of that. he really loves me he cant let go of his feelings. so he told me that from now onwards he'll just keep all related to this issue to himself and suffer on his own, he doesnt want to talk about this anymore since we won't be able to resolve it.<br><br>I don't know what to do. As much as it hurts me so I brought up the thought of letting him go cos I simply can't bear to see him in constant pain and misery but he said i'd just hurt him more this way. I really dun want that ending any more he does yet I don't see any way how it can work out. Wanted to assure him that my feelings to him are true and my apparent lack of willingness to commit sexually doesn't reflect that I don't love him as much but he just dismissed that as my attempts to cover up. enough said he told me, n spoke that if he were to show me the dozens of books he has bout relationship it all concurs that when a couple reaches a depth in love it's natural that they would want to go sexual and thus it speaks of the feelings i have for him. There's no way I can talk him out of this yet i m witnessing his mental and physical conditions deteriorate as this wears on and that he'd always hav to take sleeping pills to sleep so often I really don't wish this to go on.<br><br>Even though he said he's willing and determined to go on this way to keep the status quo I cant help worrying about the long term detrimental effects to his health. I'm really worried bout him, it's not the right ways to sustain things. and he even mentioned taking this drug that will make men "sterile" for a few years or so. I'm really afraid that he would do things harmful to his mental and physcial health since especially he said that after today he's not gona tell me anything related to this issue anymore he doesnt want me to get the wrong idea n feel pressured. How can i put my mind at ease when at the back of my mind i never know wat's brewing beneath the lovely surface? with the nagging thought that he may be on his path to self destruction n i wont even b aware of it?</div></blockquote>Lolz!

            <div class='col-md body'>Conclusion: Chastity is still valued, or else he won't try so hard to fark you this badly.<br><br>You can take my words as advices or an insult, up to you.<br><br>Believe me or not, he wonÂ’t kill himself.<br>LetÂ’s put it this way.<br>Imagine this as a board game.<br>He canÂ’t get Â“sexÂ” after all the efforts, all the steps.<br>So in order not to lose out, he goes for your Â“moneyÂ”.<br>But after a while, he realized that the title of the game, is Â“Fark the virgin!Â”<br>Which means that, even if he had taken everything from you, that doesnÂ’t mean that he had won. Only after he had gotten Â“sexÂ”, then he can win.<br>And that is why, knowing that heÂ’s losing, he wants to Â“show handÂ” the game, and see how you responses to it.<br><br>But if you really like him that much, you still can keep him though heÂ’s a bastard.<br>What you have to do, is to remember that you are playing the game too!<br><br>Your ultimate goal will be to Â“delayÂ” him till XX years, and tataa~! ItÂ’s marriage time.<br>The easy method to cheat the game is to give him sex without using a condom when youÂ’re fertile, but ofcourse lie to him that you counted and now is safe without condom.<br>That way, you win the game immediately, but you might not want it that way unless you are guys are financially prepared.<br>So, what you should do is to play around with what you have rather then hoping for something that you donÂ’t, or wonÂ’t happen.<br>Play around with words like, Â“The more you ask, the more I donÂ’t give lor.Â” So he will wait wait waitÂ… until he gets impatient again. TaTaa~! You earn 5points for your game.<br>Then next, you may go, Â“I will eventually give it to you one lor, why are you so impatient.Â” Ting Ting~! 5points.<br>Then use reverse psychology from the things he used to pressure you to pressure him back. Â“You donÂ’t love me is it? You say you are willing to do whatever it takes to keep us together. Now IÂ’m asking you to wait only lor, wait also cannot ar?Â”<br>Putting it in this way, you have turned the table from Â“You not giving him sex = You donÂ’t love himÂ”, to Â“He not waiting for you = He donÂ’t love youÂ”. Marvelous! 15points!<br>Ok. Then you can see his character, if itÂ’s those very ego oneÂ… Got pride right? Use that.<br>Â“You guys donÂ’t keep your word one lor, you say you love me one. Now you like that. DonÂ’t tell me all along youÂ’ve been lying to me?Â” Step on the pride a little, but giving him enough room to escape. So while escaping, heÂ’s not attacking. HeÂ’ll end upÂ… Â“No la! No lor! ItÂ’s just thatÂ… DonÂ’t you thinkÂ… bla bla~!Â” Ding Dong~! 10points.<br><br>The rest of the game you play yourself.<br>And, try not to use all those at the same time. Remember your goal, Â“delayÂ”!<br>Have fun playing~!<br></div>

I had to stamp my feet today n tell him enough is enough. If i m not getting it back today i m going to look for him at his place.<br><br>I retorted his death threat. Tried so much positive stroking doesnt work. I had to scold him and said i wouldnt bother him anymore,told him to think over it himself. He ought to stop treating death as an escape button it isnt. Learn to be responsible for his own actions and life. Finally he smsed me sorry he had too much troubles.<br><br>At last his whiny i want to die attitude died out for now. since he so wants it that way n i hav no better way of being ultra sensitive to his fragile psyche while dealing with our issues i shall just leave him alone for now. both of us really need to do some quiet thinking. if he's unrepentant i m taking off. my heart's crying no but my mind says i hav to go, this cant go on forever. my love may be forgiving but there's only so much i can take. i m only willing to give him one more chance for all that we've been thru.<span style="color: blue;"> guess i'll have a good gauge of my answer at 9</span>.</div></blockquote>so has he returned you your money as he had claimed he would?</div>
