Frankly speaking, I think your guy is crap.<br><br>However, you love him and that should be the basis of sticking to it and helping him to be a better person. It will be hard on you initially. I do think his mentioning of the 'porn' stuffs are some hints for you to offer yourself to him, BUT you have a mind of your own.<br><br>You should decide what is in the best interest of yourself and him.<br><br>I do thank you though for sharing part of your life with us, strangers.
