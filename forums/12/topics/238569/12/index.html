He said how much i'd go with him doesnt determine how much he'd love me but at the back of his back it's how much i love him. He told me he loves me so much he'd die for me but feels very insecure bout my feelings towards him because of this he thinks bout it so much start feeling so empty esp when he has urges it is causing him immense pain it's such a mental torment he had cried and had sleepless nights and he believes this will go on. he admitted what i hav said is true that this is our irreconcilable gap but he doesnt want to give up on me cos of that. he really loves me he cant let go of his feelings. so he told me that from now onwards he'll just keep all related to this issue to himself and suffer on his own, he doesnt want to talk about this anymore since we won't be able to resolve it.<br><br>I don't know what to do. As much as it hurts me so I brought up the thought of letting him go cos I simply can't bear to see him in constant pain and misery but he said i'd just hurt him more this way. I really dun want that ending any more he does yet I don't see any way how it can work out. Wanted to assure him that my feelings to him are true and my apparent lack of willingness to commit sexually doesn't reflect that I don't love him as much but he just dismissed that as my attempts to cover up. enough said he told me, n spoke that if he were to show me the dozens of books he has bout relationship it all concurs that when a couple reaches a depth in love it's natural that they would want to go sexual and thus it speaks of the feelings i have for him. There's no way I can talk him out of this yet i m witnessing his mental and physical conditions deteriorate as this wears on and that he'd always hav to take sleeping pills to sleep so often I really don't wish this to go on.<br><br>Even though he said he's willing and determined to go on this way to keep the status quo I cant help worrying about the long term detrimental effects to his health. I'm really worried bout him, it's not the right ways to sustain things. and he even mentioned taking this drug that will make men "sterile" for a few years or so. I'm really afraid that he would do things harmful to his mental and physcial health since especially he said that after today he's not gona tell me anything related to this issue anymore he doesnt want me to get the wrong idea n feel pressured. How can i put my mind at ease when at the back of my mind i never know wat's brewing beneath the lovely surface? with the nagging thought that he may be on his path to self destruction n i wont even b aware of it?</div></blockquote>Do some research and read up, and help him to control his 'urge' in a more healthy manner....</div>

If you don't, it just mean that you don't love and care for me enough so let's break up."</strong><br><br>Oldest trick in the book, and this is the exact (frequently repeated) trick jerks use to coerce their girlfriends into going to bed with them.<br><br>Stand firm, be assertive on your beliefs and stand. Don't give in. If he's going to have problems with you over that, it simply means that he's not as good as you would like to think he is. Let's take note that he is emotionally blackmailing you, especially when he mentioned the sterile drug.<br><br>But ultimately, the choice is yours to make.

            <div class='col-md body'>at other times it's the small things that make me crack. like i gave him a light slap on his hand playfully as i walk past him he got mad at me he said it was painful and it gave him a heart seizure cos the sudden movement shocked him, he went on saying how would i feel if he hit me like that on my face how come i never care bout his feelings oneday i'll give him a heart attack n kill him. seems like my routine innocent actions could be traumatising to him. whenever we had a tiff, he'd tell me bout all the sweet things he had done n he'd do for me i'd hav nothing to rebutt, afterall he alr dismissed my actions as unreasonable or delibrately pain-inflicting. i dunno wat esle to say, it's true i cant deny he had done a lot for me yet how he makes me feel as tho i had done nothing good to him makes me feel lousy n wonder why is he doing so much to keep me then. for it seems like i m more harm than good to him. he even claimed that i don't care bout him, i just care whether he has time for me or that he does what i want.everytime he says this kind of things i just felt like retorting with "if i m such a trash,why not just dump me?".<br><br>he told me he really love me so much he had stayed up at on fri night when i had to study for my test to give me moral support, called me a few times in the night to make sure i'm awake studying and he said he stayed awake not doing anything cos he was really worried for me and wanted me to know he feels what i feel.<br><br>i believe he loves me and i had done my best to assure him that i feel the same. he tells me to change my number cos a guy smses me to say he misses me etc. i dun see it as such a big deal (alr told him more than a dozen times this guy doesnt matter to me he does) tho i m willing to comply if it makes him feel better. but somehow lil things always get on our nerves like the manner he flared up and hang up on me when i called him ard 9am, he had alr slept for at least 9 hrs then. when he had done the same at most i'd say i m really tired dear,i'll call u back later alrite? he doesnt like to tell me his plans for the day does things like tell me 11pm ytd he'd call me to tell me wat r our plans today when he wakes up. i m always hanging in the mid-air the days i expect to meet him, hard to do things like meet frds or settle my own stuff cos i dun really know when i'm supposed to meet him. if i had went out with a frd n it so happens that he wants to meet me at that time he'd b unhappy why did i still go out n stuff when i knew i had to meet him that day. so wat does my dear expect me to do? wait for his verdicts before i could plan my day on what <span style="font-style: italic;">might b</span> "our days"? even when half the day's gone n i receive no news?<br><br>i love him dearly but it's small details as such that makes me wonder if we could really be happy together. we've had great times yes but even if we resolve the big issue i'd still hav to b so conscious with my behaviour so i dun step on any landmines he has? or is it cos of the not completely resolved big issue that he's acting like that? the thought that we might part saddens us deeply we know the emotional roller coaster is starting to take its toll on my studies, his work and our lives yet everytime we see each other we just cant bear to part. and if we hav to i dun want him to think that i'm "just making up some excuse to leave him", that's what he said when i brought it up. i really love him and if i hav to leave i really want him to know that it's not that i dun care bout him, not getting enough kick out of this relationship or some other childish reason. it's precisely cos i care bout him that i started comtemplating if life for the both of us could b better without each other. it hurts me so as much as it hurts him but how do i get him to see that?</div>
