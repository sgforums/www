And not myself. Thats when i realised i was wrong. I realised that i didnt loved her. And its nt going to be fair to her and the r/s.<br><br>But that aside, perhaps something u could think about to get u to move on is the fact that he is not GENUINE about this r/s. Trust me this once, i was in your bf's shoes i know exactly what he is thinking. Manipulate and manipulate till he get what he wants. His acts may seem to you that he is true, but let me tell you doing all those stuff is effortless. You shldnt let momentarily happiness foil your permanent happiness. Feeling of being hugged and kissed, any guy can give it to you. Im sure you would want it from someone who is sincere about you.

He took away all your savings, and did he return?<br><br>He knows you are being controlled by him.  If you allow yourself to fall any deeper, no one can help you.<br><br>Any guy can be sweet and loving if he wants to, even if the girl is not someone he loves.

Thats when i realised i was wrong. I realised that i didnt loved her. And its nt going to be fair to her and the r/s.<br><br>But that aside, perhaps something u could think about to get u to move on is the fact that he is not GENUINE about this r/s. Trust me this once, i was in your bf's shoes i know exactly what he is thinking. Manipulate and manipulate till he get what he wants. His acts may seem to you that he is true, but let me tell you doing all those stuff is effortless. You shldnt let momentarily happiness foil your permanent happiness. Feeling of being hugged and kissed, any guy can give it to you. Im sure you would want it from someone who is sincere about you.  Btw is the money in? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote>i m not just after physical comfort and that follows of course not physical comfort that any guy offers. i wasnt much of a physical person. i used to hav a very limited acceptable scope for physical display of affection. in my last relationship my ex couldnt even kiss with me. hence one could guess i need to adjust rather drastically to a guy who finds just no sex as lack of emotional affirmation even tho i m still adamant on the bottomline bout keeping my chastity. to him he felt that he had to adjust just as drastically to accomodate to me. and he felt that all our problems stem from the fact that we are two head strong characters i.e. he finds me too domineering.<br><br>at times i can understand that it's cos i like to reason things out like deconstruct his inconsistent behaviours and explain the need for us to share a common communication model; the rest of the times it's things like he likes to hav plans which affect me without telling me and he does things like tell me i m to meet him lets say tmr or a few days later but doesnt tell me where n where even on the actual day n expects me to be waiting ard till the time comes which i almost never know when. like what happened on tuesday was he told me to meet him at a specific place at 1pm that day on mon night yet when the time comes n he doesnt appear he asked why didnt i call him first before going out. in the end as u all know at 7+pm he smsed me to tell me to go home first. most of the times it's he'll tell me to wait at home then i end up wasting the whole day away waiting for news from him and sometimes it turns out that he cant meet me at all. it's really frustrating for me to plan my schedule and i confronted him bout it i told him that i hav a life too. he likes to send me smses upon smses whenever there's a problem and wouldnt pick up when i call to talk properly. he interprets such as i m trying to take charge of him etc which i dun understand why.<br><br>i m not sure it's just an issue over dominance as he thinks it is. it's more like some fundamental problem over basic understandings and value systems. which is why it's so difficult for me to sort things out for good with him no matter how hard i tried.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Bontakun:</div><div class="quote_body">What do you want to do with regards to your relationship with him as of now?</div></blockquote>my head's having a split now.<br><br>want to break up i dun know how to. even as he called me just now i couldnt conceal my happiness to hear his voice.<br><br>want to straighten things out i dun know how to either. there are too many things to begin with.</div>
