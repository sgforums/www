            <div class='col-md body'>Firstly, you gotta figure out why did he dumped his former gf, after he had upteen rounds of sex with? Asking him would be futile. He would probably badmouth his ex. To him, his ex is the problem, not him, even after getting wat he wanted in the first place. Perhaps he is just interested in having sex with gals, n not really wanting to settle down just yet. You may be just one of his vested interest-----&gt; a trophy that he can boast around wif, like "hey, i manage to bang this gal who has this thingy about chastity, but who in the end, like the rest of my ex, just could'nt resist ME, for i am one whole hot guy who can melt any gals heart and belief into lettin me bang em good!!...heheheh"<br>I once have an ex-male collague. This guy is, i must say, well verse in these tactics. He would always have a very good reason to dump his ex------after he had banged em good! Guess wat? He was so good he can break down a gals belief about chastity, then after banging em good, out comes his excuses for dumpin his ex - u noe wat? as always, gal is the problem, not him. He was so confident about himself, he got around braggin his tactics to us guys! He's one hell of a patient chap. Once, he toyed around with this JC gal for almost a year! He mentioned this gal is one tough nut to crack, cos she believed in chastity stuff. Eventually, this gal cracked up, maybe due to exam pressures and a whole lotta issues. Our "hero" was there in her darkest hour, and guess wat?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  He got to bang her good! Man, i can see the glitter in his eyes when he boasted to us about his conquest of this JC gal! He dumped her after 4 months. Too bad, the gal was in tatters.<br><br>My advise to you is, if you bf can't wait up for you till both of you get married, no need to waste your time. There are many other guys who, for the REAL LOVE of his gal, will truely cherish and uphold his gals belief, instead of tryin very hard to break his gals belief.  There are many fishes in the sea, get wat i mean? Cheers!!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></div>
