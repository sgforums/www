It's her own chastity.. she's single and she's female.  The rules just aren't in her favour.  Technically she has more to lose than to gain from being convinced by this boyfriend of hers, furthermore she herself has declared how much she values it.

            <div class='col-md body'>A quick reflection on what we have here:<br>1. She has a right to decide on her own chastity values<br>2. He has a right on his own chastity values<br>3. They are in a relationship and discovered that they have different chastity values<br>4. They can respect each other's values and continue<br>5. He can try to persuade her to change her values<br>6. She can try to persuade him to change his values<br>7. He has no right to impose his values on her<br>8. She has no right to impose her values on him<br>9. He can decide to break off with her solely on this issue<br>10. She can decide to break off with him solely on this issue<br>11. They can continue despite having different values regarding this - some people will argue that it is simply sweeping the problem under the carpet and it will rise one day and show its ugly face<br>12. They can compromise and go all the way short of intercourse... how they can compromise, the details, we have to continue in bar  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br>13. If they can get through this successfully and remain bf/gf that speaks well for their future marriage because there are lots of compromises to be made when you are living with someone<br>14. They can stop the relationship and find someone with similar values on chastity - but there will be lots of other stuff that they will fight about<br>15. They can try to impose each other's values without compromise and quarrel constantly about it - that would mean that they will have an unhappy marriage because marriage is about compromise - Some people will argue that you compromise most of the time but you do not compromise on certain issues<br><br>So you see, relationships are difficult animals because it involves another human - relationship with pets are so much easier...</div>

The media and the influence from the west are the cause.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br></div>

That would meanthat he is willing to be her b/f and not have sex until marriage. That is a good boyfriend right? He thinks it is moral crap but willingly continue the relationship!
