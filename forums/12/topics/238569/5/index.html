If people live in an "escape from reality" mode, then they only suffer and make others suffer with them.<br><br>If people think that they are "good" because they are "virgins"; that is such an extremist position. Some people think that they are "good" because they are willing to kill themselves for their cause (killing others with them).<br><br>If people think that others are "bad" because they are not "virgins"; that is another extremist position.<br><br>"I have a right to be "CHASTE" and "CHASTITY" is "GOOD" - I have a right to my beliefs!<br><br>"I have a right to kill people in the defense of my Faith and Killing people in the defense of my faith is good  - I have a right to my beliefs!<br><br>So are they both right? So how do we judge?<br><br><strong>THE CONSEQUENCES! </strong><br><br>Real life is not so simplistic. You need to be intelligent otherwise you are no better than animals. You refuse to think and live life in automatic mode blindly following rules.<br><br>You must consider how "chastity" is "good' as well as how "chastity" is "bad".<br><br>Many people end up in mental hospitals because they cannot do that. They cannot see how a so called "good" thing can be "bad" and a "bad" thing can be "good".<br><br>In their heads, everything is either "good" or "bad". You can end up in a mental hospital if you live life like that.<br><br>You are very right in pointing out that there are many people with very successful marriages even though they had premarital sxx.<br><br>The possibilities are endless and to say "virgin=good" and "non-virgin=bad" is going down to the level of animals and refusing to think.<br><br>Premarital sxx can be good or bad, it depends. So you might think, "Is there nothing "good" in this world?" There is nothing "perfectly good" in this world. You need to use your brains.<br><br>Do you think that suicide bombers go around thinking how "evil" they are? Of course not, they go around thinking how "good" they are.<br><br>So are there no "laws" to live our lives by? Of course there is. There is the Law of the country for example. There is the unwritten LAW of consequences, for another.<br><br>Five thousand years ago up to even one hundred years ago, Chastity was not only good, it could be life saving.<br><br>People do not understand things like germs and virus and STDs. Pregnancy and abortion killed many women. Non-virgins are ostracized by society.<br><br>Now the chances of pregnancy if you use contraceptives properly are very low. If you have only one sxx partner and practice "clean" sxx, the chances of getting STDs are very low. Even abortion if you don't do it so many times is relatively "safe". Most people do not care if their wives are virgins.<br><br>There are consequences if you chose to have sxx before marriage and there are consequences if you chose to remain a virgin before marriage.<br><br>There is no free lunch.<br><br>Use your brains and don't live life like an animal according to rules and regulations blindly, without thinking about the consequences of chastity and the consequences of remaining a virgin.</div>
