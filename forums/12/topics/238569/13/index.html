Suicide?<br><br>Aww come on. over what? no sex?<br><br>I think he is just a very good manipulator. His objective at the of the day? Just to have sex with you. He has not given up though he claimed he has. Think about it. Why does he get irritated or annoyed with you so easily? Because he cant reach his objective. If he truly loves you, why will he treat you like that? I wonder how he looks like, cause from my impression of him here, he seems like a real loser. no offense to kuri though.<br><br></div>

Your boy has problems with himself, his depression, his dependency issues.  He's not ready for a relationship.  You may decide to be a friend and help him out but know now that it won't be easy, the solution is not sex, and you must be prepared for alot more emotional stress .<br><br>He needs to work some things out by himself.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Devil1976:</div><div class="quote_body">Did you previously already knew that he's having depression and is under treatment for it or has it only came to your knowledge lately..? How long have you both been together again...?<br><br>How did you learned about him having depression?<br><br>For all that matters, I would agree with udontknowme... At least let her family members know what is going on for him now and have them take the heavier burden in taking care of him...<br><br>Try to find out more about his depression... i.e. What other problems he might have already had in life.... Find out from his family how long has he been like that..... etc.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by zeny:</div><div class="quote_body">We cannot have the best of both worlds. You cannot save someone who is using death as a way of keep you from running away. You have done your part.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by rainee:</div><div class="quote_body">where is he getting treatment for depression? ask him to show u the proof? Did you know abt this when you two get together?<br><br>I do not think this guy is ready for a r/s. First he needs to learn how to love himself first, and get over his depression issue. The longer you are with him, the more likely you are to become as depressed as him.<br><br>Sometimes loving someone is about letting go. </div></blockquote>As with the many forumites whom I agreed and quoted, you should find out his condition and appointment with the doctor for the depression diagnosis. You should talk to his parents too. This is not your own issue already. Suicidal notions should be tackled by everyone who cared about him including his family and other friends.<br><br>You alone can only do so much, get help from his family and other friends who cared about him.<br><br>As for your relationship 'problem' with him, I suggest you put it aside and focus on getting him back on the right track. <strong><span style="color: red;">Get help</span></strong>.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>He just smsed me to say he wont meet me anymore. say he'll transfer the money he owes me back to my account by 9pm and not bothering him with my overbearing attitude, he just wants to die far away from me. i didnt want to mention this previously but which girl would lend her 2 month bf atm card n wasnt even mad when he had to give her back he explained n told her he spent every dollar inside? and after he got more than the means to return me he dragged on for 3-4 weeks. honestly i doubt any girl i know would do that for a bf she just known 4 months back. i did that. he's taking the incredible amount of trust i put in him for granted. I had to stamp my feet today n tell him enough is enough. If i m not getting it back today i m going to look for him at his place.<br><br>I retorted his death threat. Tried so much positive stroking doesnt work. I had to scold him and said i wouldnt bother him anymore,told him to think over it himself. He ought to stop treating death as an escape button it isnt. Learn to be responsible for his own actions and life. Finally he smsed me sorry he had too much troubles.<br><br>At last his whiny i want to die attitude died out for now. since he so wants it that way n i hav no better way of being ultra sensitive to his fragile psyche while dealing with our issues i shall just leave him alone for now. both of us really need to do some quiet thinking. if he's unrepentant i m taking off. my heart's crying no but my mind says i hav to go, this cant go on forever. my love may be forgiving but there's only so much i can take. i m only willing to give him one more chance for all that we've been thru. guess i'll have a good gauge of my answer at 9.</div>
