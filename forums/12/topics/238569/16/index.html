He is just dangling you around and if he can be trusted, you wud have gotten the money back by now...<br><br>He is trying to make you feel guilty about the break-up by putting the blame on your personality and lack of will.

Do not allow him to stir up your emotions too much and make it difficult to make a logical decision which you can stick to....</div>

Give yourselves like... Maybe 2 weeks to 3 weeks' time...?<br><br>Straighten out your thoughts during that period.. List down things if you have to... What actually don't work out and what keeps you want to be in the relationship.... See how you're actually coping without contacting him for that period... Last but not least... When coming close to the end of that 'break period'... Make a 'feel decision'... Do you actually FEEL like staying with him more or leaving him...? How strongly do you FEEL for that decision you've just made...? (Only) If your decision is to STAY.... Look back at the list of 'problems' you've made again... Do you actually have any CONCRETE ways in SOLVING them...? Or it is possible to solve them at all.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"> That would be coming to the part of your LOGICAL DECISION....<br><br>If you decide to STAY because of your 'feel decision' but you couldn't answer the 'logical' part of things... Unless you just happens to build up a determination AGAINST your 'feel'... Likelihood, you'll be going into a KARMANIC RELATIONSHIP again....</div>
