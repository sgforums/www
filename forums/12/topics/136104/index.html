Then at the end of the day, usually she ask me out a second time, this time round with her friends also.. ended up I made all her friends crack up.<br><br>Always when we were out, she would like to grab my arm, hit me playfully and call me all kinda names.. also pounced and tickled me during the time we were chatting in my car.<br><br>Sent her home once really late in night, and her mum saw me.<br><br>Kept smiling at as I used their toilet, I apologised to her parent that I did'nt buy anything as a first meeting.<br><br>After I reached home, she called me to tell me her mum likes me and was singing praises how polite I was. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>right now.. here comes the problem... I got this funny thing with me, that this thing screwed me over and over and OVER OVER many times.<br><br>I can't seem to focus now.. something jus triggered in me and Im kinda afriad to ask her out.. suddenly I become more shy and to a state that I fear rejection even before it happens..<br><br>Last night I tried to call her, her mum still answered cheerily to me and called her to the phone but she told me she needed to bathe while I told her I wait for her to call..<br><br>she just msged me 2 hours later stating its late already, told me to go and sleep. ~_~<br><br>I cant.. maybe cos I din get to hear from her... hmmm.. and back my thoughts ran though my mind as i remembered how i was rejected by my ex-gf 3 years ago.<br><br>I always had this self - destruct mindset that each time I met with a small setback, I simply stopped chasing, and i gave up on many good ladies in my life. The fear of loving someone again spun butterflies in my tummy.<br><br>so today I was thinking the entire day, how do I step out from my rejected mind and be confident again? Always I cant be presistent, and from what I hear from what she msg last night, i feel as if she trying to avoid me.. maybe she is not, or she jus being considerate.. I feel failed and as if that she won't like a guy like me..<br><br>I know I have a steady set of friends, I know Im healthy, Im funny, im not handsome but at least im cute, or so many of my silly friends tell me.. I am confident of myself, good self esteem and have good thoughts for myself throughout the day. However, my 2nd nature pulls me when I feel something for someone.<br><br>No one yet, have taught me how to get rid of the rejecting mindset I have been struggling through all these years.. I feel so sia sway and paiseh to tell people of my problem.. even this girl i am liking so dearly, i feel like giving up already. Im scared for no apparent reason and if she decides to test me by throwing a tatrum, im so out..<br><br>its like a song by Daniel Chan - Ai Ni Duo Ni<br><br>So all masters of love, princes of hearts, my elder brothers, if possible.. help ur unconfident, small friend here.. help me.. teach me, Im willing to learn, really. I like this girl, but when i shift her from friend to lover.. i get all squishy and worried.. help me get out of this mindset, I can't tell my problem publicly, im jus too ashamed to do that. and I can only seek help here.<br><br>argh..</div></blockquote></div>
