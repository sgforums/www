              <p>Hi...I am so stressed...please help to give me some advice..</p>
              <p>I was recently been offered a job which will offer me a promising and rewarding career prospect in few years' down the road. This happens when I was about to engage to my part time degree programme and I was offered a place already.. *shrugs* I hope I can work and study at the same time but the co. rejected it due to its demanding job scope.</p>
              <p>Because of this, they hope I can defer my studies. They mention that they have good opportunities for me to upgrade myself if I can perform well in my role. I have been regretting it since I finish my poly. But finally I have the financial support and a chance to study now. I feel that I always kept saying wanted to study wanted to study but always find it difficult to even start. It has been many years already but I still look back since then. Feeling that I did not achieve much in terms of career wise...and always cause alot of limitations when I am applying for a job. I have been hanging there and not doing a job that can make full use of my diploma.. But now I met someone who may seem to give me lots of opportunity now, but I need to give up the idea about studying.</p>
              <p>What should I do now?</p>

              <p>Times are bad now, it is good to have a job.</p>
              <p>But what job will definitely offer you a rewarding career in this recession? I am interested in knowing that.</p>
              <p>And how well do they want you to perform, or more directly, what they want you to do?</p>
              <p>I hope you are not being sweet-talked into a crap company, and later find that the company is going under.</p>
              <p>Okay, back to topic, since you are doing part-time degree, odds are you will still be able to get in again few years down the road, so no worries there.</p>
              <p>The main question is do you really want to study? Do you really need that degree?</p>
              <p>If your answer is no to both questions, then you are free to take up the job.</p>
