            <div class='col-md body'>dear confused123, ask yourself if you still have feelings for her. if your answer is yes, give it another shot. if things work out, it's the best. if things dun, at least you tried. from there we'll move on and perhaps you'll find a better one in poly? pls accept my sincerest regards.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by confused123:</div><div class="quote_body">I didn't have dreams like that the last time we were together.
