Such things do happen in life especially if you're in your younger days.... Then again, just be yourself..? The situation will change... You'll see... UNLESS there's really something VERY WRONG with you..? (which I doubt so...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"> ) So just RELAX... The WORSE is you allow your own axiety and agitation to get the BETTER of you and let the others see that whatever rumours spreading behind you are SEEMINGLY true...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

Ever heard failure is da mother of success? Ever tried to LEARN from failures? so dat U can make GOOD use of da experience? U r only a failure when U THINK U r a failure... No 1 but YOU can brand U a failure...<br><br>Its all abt experience... I dun see things as "failure" when I did not get wat I expected... I see those results as "different" from wat I expected... NEVER a failure... Its like U wanna score 80 &amp; above in a test... then U study a certain wae... U got less than 70... U knew instantly U NOT a failure... juz merely yr studying pattern did not produce da results U wan... U shld try another method......<br><br><img src="http://www.spacespider.net/emo/nono.gif"></div>
