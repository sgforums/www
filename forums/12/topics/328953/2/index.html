              <p>very troublesome, and i dont want to tell her that, cause the
              last time I did something like that, she got angry like once she
              said she wanted to know my friends then i prefer to low profile
              first then she kpkb say i taking her for granted.</p>
              <p>then she ask for all that, she doesn't tell me her whereabouts
              as well. last night i didn't knew she was at a guy's house until i
              msged her.</p>
              <p>got this guy interested in her and the guy is making me SEE HIS
              PRESENCE in every possible way then I told her i don't like her to
              hang with him, then she say okay. But ah, she still hang with him
              1.</p>
              <p>from before i entered this relationship i already like most of
              the time will xian girls 1, then she knows, so she warn me better
              don't play around so i said okay. but she still does it with other
              guys, even though she ensures me that she wont fall for them or
              they are just really good friends. somemore she is so open,
              sometimes i really wonder i got wear green hat or not.</p>
              <p>then tonight supposedly was to go pub with friends and her as
              well, i asked her ytd if she wanted to come she told me SEE
              FIRST.</p>
              <p>then this morning, i wake up, my mum want me to stay home and
              eat dinner so i stay lor plus i feeling abit sick so i told my
              friends to go without me.</p>
              <p>then she msg me late afternoon asking if she was meeting me then
              i got confused for a while, replied her "meeting me?" then she give
              me attitude then i got upset and a quarrel started revolving around
              that i always meet my friend nv meet her.</p>
              <p>I know relationship is give and take but i already given up
              alot. and she always complain say i never do this, never do that
              but she herself also taking me for granted just that she never see
              it and i don't want to say it.</p>

              <p>my opinion; end the relationship. it's going nowhere... there is no trust between you guys and based on experience, it's heading towards "break-up" eventually.</p>
              <p>i believe you are still young and the world is your oyster. i'm not asking you to sleep around casually. just explore your options and see where it leads you. getting tied down at your young age is a waste.</p>

              <p>honestly from the first post i can tell both also got problem</p>
              <p>i just think that both of you are taking each other for granted
              thats all. both you and the girl.</p>
              <p>she double standard you, you not happy must voice out one what
              these are really trival issues to quarrel over.
              you better re-evaluate your r/s and see if both of you are ready to
              settle down <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sorry for sounding harsh but from the comments,
              its just his/her fault and never your own</span>.</p>

              <p>I guess this will only get worse. Either she is not the right
              one for you or youu are not the right one for her. I always think
              that in a relationship, you need the right match otherwise it will
              never work.</p>
              <p>My advise is, if you cannot take her type then it's time ot move
              on. Longer you drag the worst it will get. trust me, I have been
              thru this before........</p>

              passed by, it got obvious that she too cant take it when i'm out
              with her in our group of friends...<br> <br> at the peak, she even gave me an ultimatum : me or your friendship
              w/ her?<br> <br> of course i told her, i think you're trying very hard to change me
              into some desirable guy &amp; u wont get it and i'm leaving. so i
              left.<br> <br> and best part is when she's out with guys, she'll just remark..
              <strong>you jolly well know they're just my friends.</strong><br> <br> hahaha... so now i'm single and having lotsa female friends since i

              <p>one way is to be completely honest about where u are going and with who. the person on the receiving end also should not criticise the choice of friends or be overly jealous. In this way both will be more willing to be honest. alternatively, wherever u go try to bring yr bf/gf along and incorporate him/her into yr personal life.</p>
              <p>at the end of the day, u 2 are supposed to be a couple who should be part of each other's life. I'm not saying it's wrong to meet yr friends, but if you are meeting yr friends more than yr gf/bf (and not even honest about it), then something is very very wrong.</p>
