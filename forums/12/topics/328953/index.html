              <p>from before i entered this relationship i already like most of the time will xian girls 1, then she knows, so she warn me better don't play around so i said okay. but she still does it with other guys, even though she ensures me that she wont fall for them or they are just really good friends. somemore she is so open, sometimes i really wonder i got wear green hat or not.</p>
              <p>then tonight supposedly was to go pub with friends and her as well, i asked her ytd if she wanted to come she told me SEE FIRST.</p>
              <p>then this morning, i wake up, my mum want me to stay home and eat dinner so i stay lor plus i feeling abit sick so i told my friends to go without me.</p>
              <p>then she msg me late afternoon asking if she was meeting me then i got confused for a while, replied her "meeting me?" then she give me attitude then i got upset and a quarrel started revolving around that i always meet my friend nv meet her.</p>
              <p>I know relationship is give and take but i already given up alot. and she always complain say i never do this, never do that but she herself also taking me for granted just that she never see it and i don't want to say it.</p>

              <p>She's not giving me the same as well, what with all those 98379453745 guys constantly after her?</p>
              <p>I mean, come on. She go to a guy's house and doesnt even let me know! I go meet my friends I also let her know. She always complain that I don't love her enough etc etc but if she also loves me, should there be a comparison? If i don't call her, not like she can't msg me or call me?</p>

              <p>Be nice to girls... giving in a bit is ok, but learn to draw the line... no matter how big a temper she has, do not go against your principles. that is the way you can gain control..</p>
              <p>since she always keep track of you, ask to keep track of her. this way, you are showing that you care about her.</p>

              <p>Sorry for the side track, like I have said, your situation is not new and I am sure many have gone down that path.</p>
              <p>Take a step backward and look at your relationship, ask yourself how much you love her and how much you willing wanted to change or accept. Forcing it only bring saddness.</p>
              <p>Two strong heads = no no</p>
              <p>That's my 2 cents worth</p>

              <p>then tonight supposedly was to go pub with friends and her as well, i asked her ytd if she wanted to come she told me SEE FIRST.</p>
