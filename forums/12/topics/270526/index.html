            <div class='col-md body'>I have this bestie, for like going 5 years.<br>We spent alot time together. Really alot.<br>I was free and easy - No CCA committment and BGR<br>We have been really close and happy hanging out together.<br><br>Until I gradually neglected her.<br><br><strong>Reason being:</strong><br><br>1) Heavy CCA committment<br>2) BGR (problematic bf)<br><br>Over a period of 2 months plus, our friendship took a turn.<br><br>CCA committment was stressful as I have loads of deadlines to meet.<br><br>Moreover the planning of 2 major events started together so it was sometimes like a 'chiong till the end' thingy.<br><br>We were in the same CCA. It's just that she slowly didn't turn up for CCA regularly. I can barely bring extra time to meet her. The only regular meeting we had was CCA but it is gone totally.<br><br>My bf was rather problematic, as he is always demanding me for time together. Our thinking clash soo much. I do not like to 'stick' to my bf, and regards my studies and my friendship with my bestie as my top priority.<br><br>I have no idea why but my bf seemed to be redundant, or worse to say, he is bugging me and super irritating. (He wasn't like this in the beginning)<br><br>We had quarrels almost everyday. The most stupid thing was he so obsessed with MapleSEA that he forces me to play with him. There was once I rejected as I want to sleep, he actually rang up my house and shouted at me.<br><br>I can only take up whatever time I have left (after school and CCA) to spend time together with him. I didn't meet my bestie for a very long time. I broke up with him twice within 2 months, and he said he would change. I waited for very long before he started to accept my thinking.<br><br>She knows about my bf as 3 of us are colleagues in the past. She knows our problem. My bf and her cannot click. I am like in between.<br><br>However I disallow my bf to talk bad about my bestie and that is often the cause of our daily quarrels because he feels that I am too concerned about my bestie. I speak bad of my bf infront of her. However I stopped talking abt my bf infront of her as she doesn't like it. She also doesn't like it when I talks about CCA.<br><br>Hence I have nothing much to talk to her. Moreover she is going through her darkest moments in her life due to some personal stuff and I am busy doing my CCA event thingy. In fact, I am so engrossed in doing and so busy editing the budget that I don't even realise that I have more than 7 MSN Messenger windows.<br><br>After finish planning my event (which is 2 month plus later) I tried contacting her but I didn't know how to start. So the stupid me go and ask her about the Starhub Cable Internet. Her reply was 'today is exactly 1 month we didn't contact'<br><br>It didn't came out of my expectations of course. I did explain to her. But she wasn't the same anymore. She do not bother about me anymore. I hurt her tremendously and she cut herself.<br><br>I really feel remorseful and really wish to save our almost 5 years friendship. I am sincere but she was so determined. I have been trying to talk to her for almost 2 months. I didn't mean to spoil our relationship.<br><br>I admit I was too self-centered. Being too involved in CCA as I was becoming the committee member. Now I am in the committee, she finds all sorts of ways to 'shoot' me and I am very upset, but still thinks I deserves it.<br><br>Now, whenever I try talking to her, she starts to say 'go talk to ur bf' or 'you have ur bf everytime' or 'you have ur bf to accompany u'.<br><br>I asked her out and she thinks that I am treating her as a substitute for my bf when my bf cannot accompany me. That is absolutely not true. I am very hurt by this and it seemed that no matter how hard I tried to explain, she doesn't take it.<br><br>My world is totally different w/o her. Whenever I see her I hide away. I don't know how to face her again. I cry uncontrollably whenever I talks about her. Being too emotional but its out of my control.<br><br>I need encouragements and some enlightenment.<br><br>I welcome critism too. I am a lousy friend and I need to improve.</div>

And you know what? All the females will go goo-goo gaga over them. Never mind some of these foreigners were married, or attached (engaged or with a gf), not so good looking, and some even on the pudgy side but the fact was they drew the company girls to them in droves.<br><br>The females in my company would go lunch lah, tea lah and dinner with them.  In fact the females were the ones initiated those meals. And the females colleagues willingly do almost anything for them without being ask twice. So, some of us local guys ask the females why they like the 'ang mohs' so much (that inclusive of those synthetic ang moh kow toolah). Their reply? They speak very charminglyleh.

Office girls just don't have brains, so how to get brainwashed?  But they get hynotised by any 'white' foreigners, whether good-looking or not, pudgy or bald.<br><br>Your story and that of dnd_gal is consistent: <strong>sweet-talking</strong>. Women don't care whether you are fat or thin, tall or short, rich or poor, intelligent or dumb!

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by paperlove:<br><strong>I have this bestie, for like going 5 years.<br>We spent alot time together. Really alot.<br>I was free and easy - No CCA committment and BGR<br>We have been really close and happy hanging out together.<br><br>Until I gradually neglected her.<br><br>[b]Reason being:</strong><br><br>1) Heavy CCA committment<br>2) BGR (problematic bf)<br><br>Over a period of 2 months plus, our friendship took a turn.<br><br>CCA committment was stressful as I have loads of deadlines to meet.<br><br>Moreover the planning of 2 major events started together so it was sometimes like a 'chiong till the end' thingy.<br><br>We were in the same CCA. It's just that she slowly didn't turn up for CCA regularly. I can barely bring extra time to meet her. The only regular meeting we had was CCA but it is gone totally.<br><br>My bf was rather problematic, as he is always demanding me for time together. Our thinking clash soo much. I do not like to 'stick' to my bf, and regards my studies and my friendship with my bestie as my top priority.<br><br>I have no idea why but my bf seemed to be redundant, or worse to say, he is bugging me and super irritating. (He wasn't like this in the beginning)<br><br>We had quarrels almost everyday. The most stupid thing was he so obsessed with MapleSEA that he forces me to play with him. There was once I rejected as I want to sleep, he actually rang up my house and shouted at me.<br><br>I can only take up whatever time I have left (after school and CCA) to spend time together with him. I didn't meet my bestie for a very long time. I broke up with him twice within 2 months, and he said he would change. I waited for very long before he started to accept my thinking.<br><br>She knows about my bf as 3 of us are colleagues in the past. She knows our problem. My bf and her cannot click. I am like in between.<br><br>However I disallow my bf to talk bad about my bestie and that is often the cause of our daily quarrels because he feels that I am too concerned about my bestie. I speak bad of my bf infront of her. However I stopped talking abt my bf infront of her as she doesn't like it. She also doesn't like it when I talks about CCA.<br><br>Hence I have nothing much to talk to her. Moreover she is going through her darkest moments in her life due to some personal stuff and I am busy doing my CCA event thingy. In fact, I am so engrossed in doing and so busy editing the budget that I don't even realise that I have more than 7 MSN Messenger windows.<br><br>After finish planning my event (which is 2 month plus later) I tried contacting her but I didn't know how to start. So the stupid me go and ask her about the Starhub Cable Internet. Her reply was 'today is exactly 1 month we didn't contact'<br><br>It didn't came out of my expectations of course. I did explain to her. But she wasn't the same anymore. She do not bother about me anymore. I hurt her tremendously and she cut herself.<br><br>I really feel remorseful and really wish to save our almost 5 years friendship. I am sincere but she was so determined. I have been trying to talk to her for almost 2 months. I didn't mean to spoil our relationship.<br><br>I admit I was too self-centered. Being too involved in CCA as I was becoming the committee member. Now I am in the committee, she finds all sorts of ways to 'shoot' me and I am very upset, but still thinks I deserves it.<br><br>Now, whenever I try talking to her, she starts to say 'go talk to ur bf' or 'you have ur bf everytime' or 'you have ur bf to accompany u'.<br><br>I asked her out and she thinks that I am treating her as a substitute for my bf when my bf cannot accompany me. That is absolutely not true. I am very hurt by this and it seemed that no matter how hard I tried to explain, she doesn't take it.<br><br>My world is totally different w/o her. Whenever I see her I hide away. I don't know how to face her again. I cry uncontrollably whenever I talks about her. Being too emotional but its out of my control.<br><br>I need encouragements and some enlightenment.<br><br>I welcome critism too. I am a lousy friend and I need to improve.[/b]</blockquote>I think your friend's definition of bestie goes along the line of "Being there in my darkest moments, which you definately did not satisfy.<br><br>True, you were involved in your planning of the activity, and also your childish boyfriend, but if you did any prioritizing at all, you placed her right at the bottom.<br><br>A friend in need is a friend indeed. You were too engrossed with your work and boyfriend to consider that she was in the dumps, and needed someone to talk to.<br><br>You didn't mean to spoil the friendship, but to her, this friendship has been sullied the moment she cried for help, and you didn't reply.<br><br>Don't see much you can do other than telling her what you did, and ask for her forgiveness (if you really treasure this friendship), if not, just take this lesson to heart, not to be so self-centred anymore, and to priortize what you think is more important. Work, BGR, or friend.<br><br>Take this as a lesson learnt,<br>Aaron</div>

Try Speaking to him nicely and see if he understands your situation. If not, then maybe a time out would be needed.<br><br>ok, try to understand that, you and her are best friends, and she might be jealous that you have found one and she might have not or you guys are so loving. As you said, explaining might not be the best way (and it didn work for your case) so, prove it through actions, and hang out with her. you cant be sticking with your bf all the time. you need your girl life sister.<br><br>Btw, how old are you</div>

You have your constrains and she has her needs, but certainly, there must be a tacit mutual understanding between friends. If it's not understood, then you need to communicate it.<br><br>Since there is already a crack surfacing, I don't see why you should avoid it if you desire to resolve this plight. Imagine when you talk to her and your opening statement is about 'StarHub Cable Internet', I reckon on her end, she would probably be thinking that you don't value this friendship as much as she does and thus she chose to regress from you emotionally (And of course, we all know that the truth isn't this way).<br><br>Be sincere for once if you want to work on any form of relationship. Effort is not about MSNing just because it is the most convenient way of 'contacting' - effort means some sacrifice on your part.<br><br>To balance bestie and bf is probably the hardest - but if there anything you need to do to ensure that this equation balance itself, you must be the component to tweak the scale. If not, you will probably end up losing one of the two.<br><br>P.S: People come and go all the time; there's simply no way we could hope to hold onto people unless they want to stay - friendship and relationship likewise.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
