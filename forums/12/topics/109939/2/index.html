            <div class='col-md body'>Ok.. here's my experience...<br><br>After my A levels (in 1995), I got myself a bf (he's now ex-bf)... not from the uni, but thru BBS-ing after my As... he only has O levels... my mom were really against us becoming together... but I stood firm... for about 4 years, my mom kept discouraging from continuing the r/s... and  I was not doing so well in uni as well.... No matter how many heart to heart talks I had with my parents, it always ended on the wrong notes... both sides refused to give in... they kept telling me that I'm still young.. and should not get involved... should concentrate on my studies... and that I should find someone more compatible.... moreover, my ex-bf was a regular in the army at the time... my parents were convinced that once I graduated and started working, the r/s won't work out... however, after 4 years.... we were still together and going on strong.. my parents relented.... they gradually began to accept him...  we were even planning to get married in 2003...<br><br>However, when my ex-bf ord from army, he went outside to work in 2002...  and I too started working in 2002...somehow things didn't go on as usual... he had a change of heart... he fell for his colleague who chased him even though she knew he has been attached for about 7 years... I gracefully accepted the breakup (of cos, there were tears and all).... we broke up in early 2003... and oh my, my parents and brother were furious... really angry with him... it took so long for them to accept him and he did this to me.... after tat, they became very protective of me....  but I m happy to say that I have found a new bf since, and my parents approve of him...<br><br>as for your case, I think you should just take it slow and don't rush into things... just keep the relationship growing normally...  talking to your parents may be a good idea... but if your parents are like mine.... whole day nag... I would assume that it would be quite difficult to convince them within such a short time...  one thing's for sure, if you can prove to them that your relationship can withstand the test of time, they will give in.... and from your parents' point of view, they would never want their precious daughter to be hurt in anyway at all... they only want the best for u...  try to put yourself in their shoes....  u know, my parents were so worried that I couldn't take the blow after the break-up... but I showed them that I was back on my feet after 3 days...  u have to show them that you are strong and you know what you want... parents will always be parents... they will treat you like a small kid, no matter how old you are.... it's just natural for them.... moreover, they have encountered more life experiences than you, and must have seen many breakups....<br><br>You are still young... take time and sort out your thoughts.... it's a nice feeling to be in love....  if you and your bf are able to remain together after you have graduated and started to work, I think by then, your parents will definintely accept the r/s....  yeah, it's a long process to convince them... but you have to do it....  you will have to stand firm...  and I wish you all the best in proving to them that your choice is right.... ultimately you will be the one choosing your other half... your parents are only there to give advice... and remember, they want you to be happy always....<br></div>

Especially when the person's young.<br><br>I also agree that one can get companionship and character building without a BGR. But some 'character building' essentials are only more readily incorporated when they're having experience in relationship(s) itself.<br><br>No. I don't agree on the last part really. Alot of (young?) couples go into a divorce because they got into a marriage young. On the contradictory, they probably (often?) believes that they've already got the glimpse and idea of a marriage when they might really not have enough exposure or experience to mature their thinkings on relationships and marriages. Often, their marriages failed because it is built on a wrong concept or they are kinda 'forced' or 'rushed' into things. (Yes. That includes the popular notation of "If you love me then marry me")<br><br><strong><br>Their dependency on each other turns up alot of lies and problems after they get married.</strong><br><br>Not only marriages end up with that, many relationships do too. It mostly depends on the maturity, character and compatibility of the 2. Though marriages would often means that they would have to walk a longer journey to endure more tears and wears which might come along the path, and the possibility of seeing 'hidden' or new characteristic of the other party.<br><br>It is not really about their dependency on each other but more on the marriage being built on a wrong concept. (see above)<br><br><strong><br>Having the end in mind does not mean having to get married. It means having the correct and mature reason to enter a relationship.

Even i am starting to get depressed looking at things like that happen. It hurts alot to see teens ruin their own lives.<br><br>I recommend young people learn to be happy as complete and whole singles, who lack nothing, before entering into any relationship. It would help resolve the divorce issue.</strong><br><br>Early 'maturation' and media exposure to BGRs have given many teens false ideas of relationship. Often when they find reality to be so far off from what they 'imagined' it to be 'supposingly', it could be too much for them to bear.</blockquote></div>
