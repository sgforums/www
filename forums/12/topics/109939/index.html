            <div class='col-md body'>As an ex volunteer counsellor, the ideal case would be that the girl gets attached in the last year of university studies, this ensures that she is already mature enough to handle a certain level of stress. It also helps when you enter the workforce and actually earn more money than the guy. In many sad cases i have seen so far, the guys normally feel inferior in that sense.<br>Guys do have alotof pride.<br><br>I would advice you to wait up for a bit and use this time to develop the other areas of your life, character and such.<br><br>Two "incomplete" persons end up breaking up.<br>One "complete" person + one "incomplete" person is stressful.<br>Two "complete" persons can enter into a relationship and even if a breakup occurs, both will look back at it as a good experience and come out of it as a "complete" person.<br><br>By complete, i mean that the person is mature and character-developed enough to be independent by him/herself. No offence mean to anyone.<br><br>Have the end in mind, no releationship is easy. Marriage must be on the cards if a couple decides to enter into a relationship, if not, it will end up a whole of hurt.<br><br>Ask the guy if he is considering marriage, and make him give you a reply a week later. If he tells you on the spot or tells you before a week is up, he's not even really thinking about it seriously enough. This is a basic indicator of character development- patience.<br><br>You should call up professional helplines if you are really very vexed, most of the helplines have very nice people manning them. Try TOUCHline, or just call TOUCH Youth Services for advice, they're really very patient and nice.<br><br>PS: By the way, mums should be your best friend. Mum's advice goes a long way</div>

And let your parents get to know your bf... and they can judge for themselves after that. Try to tell your mom the good points of your bf... ie maybe he has been helping you studying or is a good motivator when you were in JC thats why you got good enuff results to enter uni, Bf also comes from a decent family and is very well brought up, Bf is also going to Uni after NS is a good thing(esp if he's enrolled into Med Sch... future Dr Bf...) or of course it helps if your BF is actually the Prince of Burnei and your mom can get to wear all the crown jewelery!

You can get companionship and character building without a BGR. The reason that alot of couples get a divorce is because they start on relationships young and their characters are not fully built up yet.<br><br>Their dependency on each other turns up alot of lies and problems after they get married.<br><br>Having the end in mind does not mean having to get married. It means having the correct and mature reason to enter a relationship. You enter one to find your other half, you don't enter one for fun and for some, sex. You end up hurting the ones you profess to love most.<br><br>A good relationship with the end in mind has 2 possible outcomes,<br>1)Ends up in marriage<br>2)Ends up in a way where both parties come to an understanding that they may not be best for each other and part as good friends and complete persons.<br><br>I do see alot of teens these days with depression, normally over a failed relationship. Even i am starting to get depressed looking at things like that happen. It hurts alot to see teens ruin their own lives.<br><br>I recommend young people learn to be happy as complete and whole singles, who lack nothing, before entering into any relationship. It would help resolve the divorce issue.</div>

Well.. You are goin to uni soon.. and your bf will be in army soon.. is not so much problem about what he will do when he comes out of army.. The main issue is whether are you both ready to take up these challenges.. You wont be able to see or talk to each other like you used to be.. You'll spend less time together.. In order to keep this relationship going and maintaining it good.. Your foundation must be <strong>REAL</strong> strong!<br><br>Will you be able to wait till he comes out of army?? I'm not saying you ain't faithful.. but then like what you says.. human do change.. But if you are very firm and confident that all these obstacles would never come or happen to you and him.. Then go for it..<br><br>As for your mum.. She's jus worried.. She might not want you to waste your youth to wait for someone who in the end maybe not be with you after all.. However.. talk to your mum about it.. sit down and chat with her.. tell her that even if dodn't take risk in this relationship.. you will still experience it in the next one.. its a cycle.. You never gain or learn your lesson if you never lose or try!<br><br>Reassure her that you are old enough to make decision yourself.. no matter what.. you wont hurt anyone.. including yourself.. There's always a first time in life! Talk to her nicely.. Think before you speak..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Don't look for one-stroke solutions....<br><br>Of coz, if such things happen, everyone wld wish to get over it quickly.But a relationship is about two persons, not just one. you don't have to face it alone. tell your bf hw troubled and confused. face the obstacles n the challenges together and support one another. It's a testing period for you and your bf.  One of the tests which determines whether you n your bf can be together..Nobody knows what will happen in future, so you are nt the only person who faces that, but the most impt thing is to do what you wld think u wld regret nt doing it.<br><br>Your mum has reasons to doubt your relationship with your bf as mayusaki has mentioned. Even if you talk to her openly, it would be hard for her to be convinced straightaway. Only time can tell. Time nt only tells a person's character(e.g. whether your mum can trust ur bf to be with u) but also a relationship as well.<br></div>
