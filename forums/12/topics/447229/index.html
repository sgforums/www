              <p>I know there are quite a number of similar thread in this forum but now that its getting to my personal story, I'd love to hear from you.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal">I moved to Singapore 2 years ago and getting on well with
                  everyone around. However, it is needless to reaffirm that Singaporean guys are extremely
                  shy and for that, I really don’t know how to communicate with them properly. I
                  like shy guys but problem is I am shy too, I mean shy towards the one I like. I
                  am sorry I am not meant to show off here but will have to be direct that I got a
                  lot of attention from guys, obviously in my office. But I reckoned they are
                  more likely to admire me from afar than giving it a move. Well, as long as I am
                  not interested, I’m good with that. However, now that I have feelings for this
                  guy but he seems too shy, as it’s said by many, shy + shy = failure, I am kind
                  of stuck! How can a man in his 30s still be shy? Not to mention he is pretty
                  open to everyone else but me, a big NO. He dared to look at me in the eyes, gave
                  me a sea of glance but not at all a smile (well, once as I am aware when we
                  first met). He often looked awkward when I happened to catch his eyes. He can talk
                  restless to anyone but never more than a Hi to me. And you know what, it’s
                  almost a half year we’ve been in this situation. You may encourage me to make
                  the first move, but to be honest, I just can’t. I gave him some hints but not
                  sure if he get the signal. Now it even gets me wondering if he is really shy or he
                  is just not that into me. Any thoughts? What else should I do? Any ideas
                  would be appreciated. Thank you.</p>

              <p>There is two reason for his behaviour:</p>
              <p>1) He is not interested. I advice that you should NEVER act like a Despo. Guys hate despos. They are particularly annoying. Try striking some conversation. If further encouragement provides some positive response from him, then do more. Invite him to some event - if he say yes mean you are progressing. But if he say no - means he is not interested. You can try 3 times. After that don't do anymore - guys find it irritating. Guys are opposite of women - just because they don't respond positively doesn't mean they are playing hard to get - may mean they just not interested.</p>
              <p>In the words of Harrison Ford - "If the guy is interested - he will be there".</p>
              <p>2) Asian guys get flamed a lot. They don't get the appreciation for making first move. When they make approach - suddenly failure - the girl don't know what to do to tell the guy he is rejected because don't want to hurt his feelings - tell everybody but him - the guy get obstrosized. So guys just become shy especially those who experienced failure.</p>
              <p>Then after the guy confesses his feelings for the girl - the girl inadvertly rejects him - then desperado girls whom the guy don't like start to disturb and mock him.</p>
              <p>Feels annoying when despo girls start disturbing the guy (normally these are the girls he don't like due to their size, physical appearance, age, no chemistry, nothing in common, characteristic traits).</p>
              <p>When the guy like Girl A - Girl A reject him. Suddenly Girl B and Girl C whom guy don't like start to harass him and play him like a game.</p>
              <p>So what do you think? Of course Asian guys are shy because they get flame a lot.</p>

              <p>Thank you guys.</p>
              <p>Shame on me I missed mentioning one thing about our so-called encounter. It's that I had not been aware we are colleagues until one day he suddenly showed up and introduced himself to me when I was checking out my pigeon hole. To be honest, I was stunned (positively though) and too shy to say anything more than my name then pretended to continue playing with my letters. Yes, my bad, there was an awful awkwardness afterwards. I knew it's clumsy me who unintentionally failed his expectation that's why I've been trying to fix the situation yet we hardly have chance to really meet up even though we happen to come across almost every day. Rather than hoping to gain another opportunity with him, I still feel really bad that I might have hurted his pride somehow. From his behavior and communication with others, I am sure he is very gentle and kind...</p>
              <p>Abt what speakoutfor said,...I get what you mean. I personally have never ever either flamed anyone for confessing their feelings for me or made fun of such a thing. I also don't second the way a girl may play around with a guy even though she is not interested in him. Always Yes, or No, that's it!</p>
              <p>I agree with you guys that I will need to try harder to break the silence but just don't know yet how...I made mistake one and never want to repeat the same thing...</p>

              <p>Uhm...I am 100% sure he's not yet married, but you are right, there's a possibility that he is seeing someone but well how do I know...Looks like I will need some time to sort this out</p>

              <p>After quite a long time having patiently waiting, it gets me to think that sometimes we may have to create the magic ourself and grant it to the one we like.</p>

              <p>Of course I am not saying that you should not try. Try by all means to reach out to him but as I said after few times if he doesn't give any sign or positive reply - forget about it.</p>
              <p>For example, I have this group of friends of which there is this girl - I find her interesting but I am too shy to speak to her. I thought she is the popular girl of our group so only the popular guys can talk to her. One day we all went for an outing and coincidentaly I was near her. All this while I never talk to her before but she spoke to me. I got to talk to her a bit. Even though it was just 20 min - that gave me a good impression of her. I don;'t know her that well and she doesn't know me that well - but from this first impression at least we got off to a good start.</p>
              <p>I have no idea what would come after that but all I can do is to be a genuine guy as possible. I try to work hard and be helpful and committed to doing the best things I can do.</p>
              <p>So yeah. It does work if you approach the shy guy. Because I am a shy guy too.</p>
