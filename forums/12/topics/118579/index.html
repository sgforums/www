Since young, i have to make alot of tough decision on my own without the consent of my parents.. My relation with my parents are kinda "Cold" as we seldom talk and they only feed me with pocket money everyday. Its not that i was really rebellious, but perhaps we couldn't find topic to talk about and they never once asked me about anything..<br><br>After my 'O' level, i went to take a sneak peak at the society .. I took up a job and it was indeed an eye-opener for me. Relation among people in the company gets real complex. As a freshie, narutally i would keep quiet and observe the suitation while doing the job assigned to me faithfully. I talked to many of my colleague of many departments and yet they spoke a common tougue..  The whole conflict arosed because of this two superviser whom fighting over a higher position post. One successed and he was determind to drive his rival out of the company.. Which eventually he did..<br><br>Is our ability to compromise and forgive decreased? Or is the coperate ladder too harsh and cruel in reality for us to climb?<br><br>After all, our education do prepares us to be employee but can anyone handle it if reality slapped you with the truth?<br><br>Currently, i am still studying with no primary objective.. I do enjoy my days right now going crazy with friends and the feeling of being together.<br><br>Ultimately, i dunno what i want in this life.. I want to do things i truly enjoy and even more of quality living.  Instead of studying.. do you think i can travel slowly around the world, taking my laptop with me, recording my phrase of life and living my days doing odd jobs which i feel is more meaningful?<br><br>*I dunno.. i am just too tired making decision and living on..<br>Some of my friends feel the same too.. maybe we are just escaping the reality .. but.. i seriously dun enjoy my time =\<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"></div>

Difficulty is a matter of perspective and ability. The hierarchy of the corporate ladder is a pyramid where most people will fall at the lower levels. Few will ascend.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BakaDead-:</div><div class="quote_body">After all, our education do prepares us to be employee but can anyone handle it if reality slapped you with the truth? </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Education only prepares you with skills, and most people are unable to become entrepreneurs because they lacked the courage, luck, vision, connections and most importantly the finances to support them. So in the end, they will decide to take an open opportunity where they take minimal risks. Ability to handle reality differentiates between people.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BakaDead-:</div><div class="quote_body">Ultimately, i dunno what i want in this life..

Furthermore, it might affect your social lifestyle as you will always be on the move. Thus, you will have to accept leaving loved ones behind as you venture. Other things will include illnesses, and other problems. It is an insecure lifestyle that I would not recommend.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by BakaDead-:</div><div class="quote_body">*I dunno.. i am just too tired making decision and living on..<br>Some of my friends feel the same too.. maybe we are just escaping the reality .. but.. i seriously dun enjoy my time =\<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> </div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Changing your perspectives might be the key to achieving happiness.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Wherever u go, there will b politics. Not juz in the offices only. There's dis chinese saying "1 kind of rice feed hundred kinds of pple". Every1 is brought up, taught &amp; live their lives differently. When u put them to work together, there will definitely b differences in opinions, habits &amp; ways of working.

But how many really made it? In reality, we can't or for some, don't dare to pursue due to many other factors. Most of us r juz making do with it even though they r not enjoying it. For the worst off 1s.. it can b a torture as they struggle wif doing sheeety work juz to feed their families. Do we really haf a choice? In a way, yes u still do. U can either choose to take up risks &amp; face up to the challenge OR stay on the safe side juz like wat many of us r doing.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"> I don't enjoy wat im doing too &amp; Im still clueless like u, dunno wat we wan in life. Im not fretting though, coz it only causes more splitting headaches for mi.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br>No 1 (parents/frens/teachers) can/shld tell u wat to do.<br><br>If u'r strong-willed, u'll let nothing stop u from doing.

You can do just that if ya want to? But then again, that's not really a way to avoid the harsh reality.. In fact, it'll probably just turn out to be another way of facing problems you to handle, often in a more 'extreme' sense maybe..?<br><br>Alternatively, why don't you just get a more stable job in Singapore and just stay on and decide where ya wanna go before ya move on..?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
