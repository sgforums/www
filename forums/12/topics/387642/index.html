              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>I'm going to cut the whole story short and just summarise everything so that everyone can read and understand quickly.</p>
              <p>I have feelings for my best friend, and she knows that I have feelings for her as I have confessed to her before.</p>
              <p>Apparently, one of our friend's birthday dinner is on Friday night. So I just asked her if she would be coming.</p>
              <p>And so, she said nope i'm very busy and I have a dinner on thursday night. so i won't be joining you guys.</p>
              <p>Honestly, What is your opinion on her mentioning that she has a dinner on thursday night related to friday night?</p>
              <p>I just wish to know all the possible reason.</p>
              <p>Call me lame or whatever, i will simply ignore any insults or criticism shot at me here.</p>
              <p>So, those who are interested in this, please let me know what u truly think.</p>

              <p>Hey! She's maybe trying to make you jealous, if not why does she wants to tell you about the dinner?? Ask her about it, like with? and stuffs, since you are a guy, kindly keep the convesation going by joking with her and stuffs, then you ask her again about friday? hahaha! I know how girls work,they would want the guy to know about every damn thing they do. Try asking her out. Like suprise her, if she reciprocate your feelings.. If okay.</p>
              <p>Good luck! (: Lucky girl!</p>

              <p>U may ask her out or she may even oblige u - but what u are is never going to go away. She is an excuse - the cause is within u and the effect is within u .</p>
              <p>By that i meant that u are INsecure. how can anyone secure u on the INside.</p>
              <p>Yes, materially it is possible - buy a drink, a car, a cake, have sex with u. It is at the most supericial. U will feel good or ... however, anxiety is the shadow and it will always haunt u.</p>
              <p>Be secure within, be self-fulfilled within ('<strong>Self' without ego</strong>) and u are an emperor or empress.</p>
              <p>U will be always sharing, relating and the only shadow would be the fragrance of your being.</p>

              <p>to Fugazzi: don't really understand what you are talking about, sorry.</p>
              <p>to xstryker: hmm maybe i will, like try to mention abt the friday dinner again when it's closer to the date.<br><br>to Fireice: her dinner won't be very late, like only till 10plus max and i know she doesn't have a quota</p>
              <p>to rebecca: actually i forgot to mention this, she actually has a bf already.</p>
              <p>to &lt;(0))&gt;&lt; : yes i've asked her already, she simply said " just telling u.nth wrong abt it."</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>My opinion is that she is trying to make me feel hurt by telling her she has a dinner on thursday ( because it might be with her current bf ). Do you think its true?</p>
