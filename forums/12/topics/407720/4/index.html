              <p><br>Your friend is just being honest about what he felt when he's out with you.</p>
              <p>It could be worse than what you have imagined and it could also be just because he was showing his gratitude by saying out what he felt compelled to tell you.</p>
              <p>Regardless, what you have decided to behave towards him next will determine if your journey with him has ended already or not yet.</p>

              <p><br>Alot of guys often end up with girls who bears certain resemblance to their mothers.</p>
              <p>So in this case, I won't be surprised if this is really what your friend wanted.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Bottomline, don't go and wreck up other people's relationship under the shadow of real friendship. Real friendship do not deter with each other's own free will but can still managed to be there for each other in times of misfortune and fortune.</p>

              okay! i am just me no matter who am i out with..but i really really
              really dun understand why people can say things like "you CANT go

              one day i am gonna say that to my guy i would be soooo ashame of
              myself...cause i will see myself as petty woman..oh..yea yea..like

              dun see what's the problem...haix..1week or 2week once is totally
              fine with me..sup man! need to control ur partner so much meh?if
              its urs..meet ex everyday also nvm ma...but if its not..even if
              going with someone whom u meet once a year or 10years once also can

              <p>There since your real motive is to catch a movie at times and all, i find that it is quite unfair for you to meddle too much with him and he's personal relationship life. Given the fact you're he's ex-gf.  Put yourself in her shoes, what if you're hearing things from ur bf abt he's ex suggesting him to break off, due to ur behaviour? I guess you'd ripe off her throat and shut her forever.</p>
              <p>Sometimes yes, u may think if things are meant to be, they meant to be... however there are no free lunch in this world, so it's nth wrong for people to work for what they really want. like in this case the gf, tries to protect what is her's... and adding on to that if you believe in ur what's meant to be will be logic,  than let me ask you why are you still discouraging ur ex from the rls? Since what's meant to be will be, u shldn't care and leave it like it is right?</p>
              <p>I kinda think that the gf is not overly - possessive but simply lack trust to the bf. Can't really blame her unless we really know why can we? Being a guy, i know of many temptations I've to resist everytime i go out with my buddy, cigg is 1 thing I quit but they still smokes, girls 2nd thing, all the girls u used to flirt with becomes your buddy where you cant and wun have intentions upon, but what about new girls in the group? On the norm, guys of all age look at girls, pretty ones especially, some guys not only LOOK but they virtually rape the 'victim' with their stare. </p>
              <p>n TS you commented on he's gf looks and all, in a way i felt u're quite confident abt yourself. Probably this arouses jealousy within the gf, knowing her own bf is going out with a seemingly perfect ex will only push her to desperation have u ever tot of tat?</p>
              <p>I felt that my way of typing may be hostile but please take note it's nothing near there, i'm just expressing myself and to let u understand my opinion which u can always disagree =)</p>
              <p>I like ur way of thinking, i am not as magnanimous as you are, i am someone that fight for my own happiness, i allow my gf to go with her friends but i must know with who and where to, but there are times i won't. Just like in my case, she won't mind me see-ing my friends, but at times she'd make noise... </p>

              <p>Going out with ex 1-on-1 is not a matter of being not petty. Look at it this way:</p>
              <p>If u are the one who dumped him, why would you wanna go with someone you don't wanna be with ? Don't you have other friends ?</p>
              <p>If you are the one who got dumped, why would you wanna go with someone who doesn't want you ? Are you his 'spare tire' ? It may seem petty, but at least you don't get hurt :)</p>

              <p>As a FRIEND you should respect his choice of gfs.</p>
              <p>Maybe he's the type who likes getting bossed around or whatever. Anyway why are you even commenting on this? Not that it's affecting you right?</p>
              <p>All I can say is, stay out of other people's business. There is a reason why he chose her as his gf. And it's not your place to comment on his choice.</p>
