Getting to know and getting along with your collegues comes with getting used to your job, whether its a new one in future or the first...sure there will be jitters....Same for everywhere, at school or work.... it certainly takes time, in fact u r doing fine.<br><br>Moreover, she does not understand you quite well either, so be patient. You will be able to clear up the misunderstanding when both of u got to know one another more and she understands u more as a person as time passes by.<br><br>All the best in ur first job!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>There could be other reasons to her mood...maybe a mood swing, or that time of the month? Since you've already explained that it's a small misunderstanding, cheer up! I'm sure she isn't that petty. As long as you've tried to apologise to her, you're not in the wrong! Just continue to be friendly to her, even if she gives you a black face all the time. Better to make a friend than an enemy at your workplace...especially when you're a new bird there.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>I think even if your working environment is full of ladies, it's best to try and mix around with them. The point is not about gossiping, it's about building friendship with them. And besides, you won't feel so bad about your job if you have more friends around you! Like I said, better to have more friends than enemies!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>=) The reason's obvious.But First of all, We will need to know whats the misunderstanding about. Does it involve hurting of pride? Does it involve embarrassment in public? Does it involve whatever you can think of?<br>Be a little more sensitive and avoid unnecessary Misunderstandings. Try to know more about her from her colleagues that are friendly to you. Since you are a lady you may perhaps threaten her position as the popular lady in the shop, and she felt threatened, which is unavoidable. Perhaps she will have to start changing her attitude. Otherwise, i would conclude that she is, although, in her 30s, an immature adult. If that happens, just smile. Its hard to get irritated when you smile, and other people involve would respect you more as you manage to handle your emotions well. THink positive, perhaps she is just afraid of you as she doesn't know you that well, give her time to adapt to her presence. try talking to her like a friend. Perhaps you are trying to speak to her either too personally, or too much like a strange, or perhaps as a proud jerk? Since, i believe, this is going to be a long term job, it is not a beneficial to you, her, and the shop's owner if this continues, try getting to know her more, after sometime of friendship, clear up the misunderstandings in the past, and hope for the best. Although i know, you will be asking yourself, why should i do all this? Why can't she do it first? Why can't she apologise? But, you see, you, should be the leader of your life. You, decide what you want, if both of you decides to remain proud and decides to wait till the other party makes a move, this could end up rather negatively, affecting your first impression of working full time. You can choose to make the choice first, making her respect your Decisiveness and guts, thus changing her opinion of you. If all this doesn't happen, don't worry, let time heal. This, is an experience that everyone has to go through at least once, considering singapore standards of society. THink positive, at least you do not have a word fight everyday you get to work like my cousin. =) and... You wouldn't like it at all, its hell everyday. So, just consider yourself lucky, that your first experience isn't that bad. Well, will write more if you ask some other day, too little information on whats going on. Take care and Goodnitex =)</div>
