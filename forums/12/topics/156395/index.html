Some of us will get bullied during our pri/sec school days.<br><br>It is sad especially if no one out there can help you or defend you against those bullies.<br><br>Yet there is where you must help yourself. Take it as a way to become strong mentally. Tell yourself that no matter what others do you, you will become strong inside and no one can take that fighting spirit away from you.<br><br>But also never give up on trusting other people. This is a huge world and there are many caring, people out there who won't backstab you and all as a friend.<br><br>Anyway good luck for your 'O's  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

It requires more than just a post to change all these negativity you have accumulated throughout your developing years.<br><br>To overcome your disgust with people, you got to first overcome yourself. Please understand that although we cannot control who our parents are, we certainly have absolute control over our own life and what we want to do with them. You may have encounter terrible family experience and is likely to instil certain corrupted mindset towards relationship with people, but that is only if you want to set your perception in bending towards such negativity.<br><br>You have to find ways to improve your overall esteem and to seek for your confidence. Self love is essential, if you desire to improve relationship with people around you, or at least, remove the contempt you had for others.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Because everytime him and my stepmom quarrel, he would send us to different relatives' places and put us there...maybe even forgetting that we are there at the first place, and the last straw came when he has to put us up in my uncle's place permanently.<br><br>We were quite happy there at the first place but after my uncle and aunty give birth to their first child, we feel like second citizens to their family. First of all, they don't give us freedom and likes to restrict our every movements. Once even commented to a stranger while I was serving tea to him that I was his free maid.<br><br>Like wtf, I feel so sad that he thinks of me that way that I decided to rebel so that my father would take me to his home again, and rebel I did, so I finally was sent to my father's home..leaving only my poor sis to my uncle.<br><br>but luckily she's still coping well, so I felt a sense of relieved..but my nightmare doesn't ends there...<br><br>(do note that I didn't write a full story of my bad past, only leaving some out like for e.g my sister and I were thrown into different places before settling down on this uncle's place 'cause the relatives didn't like us, but just took us in cause of pity and because of that, I have to change sch often)<br><br><strong>School</strong><br><br>So I kept changing school right? And sad to say, i'm always the new girl in the sch during my primary sch days..but it's ok, I made some great friends, but in the end? I had to change school and places, so my friendship stops there. We did contact, but couldn't meet cause we are not staying close to each other and my relative doesn't allow me to go that far a destination to meet friends.<br><br>In the end, we stopped all contacts together.<br><br>But never mind, in this new school I go and made some great friends again, but during primary 6, backstabbing amongst us starts to occur and I suffered the worst  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>I was beaten up by a guy 1 yr younger then me (but he's stronger..oh i'm a girl mind you) and my so called best friend joined him to go against me and make me suffer mentally and ...physically.<br><br>It was a painful period and during one time, I had started my menses earlier and I was feeling kind of sore down there and this guy came and whollop me down there (uterues, or however you spell it) and he kept hitting and punching me too. It was painful to write this as I recall  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"><br><br>Ok, so I graduated from primary sch and my so called best friend snub me and so are others (except for 1 or 2, but they went into different sch cause they were best frens together..but i'm only a good friend to them)<br><br>So I had this mental barrier that I couldn't overcome and went in to sec sch with a negative attitude and also, shun most people. Morever, I was posted To NA and this doesn't help with my already bruised self-esteem.<br><br>So some classmates of mine took advantage of me and you guess it..bullied me back and forth. I was miserable throughtout this whole period..humilated and insulted.<br><br>Anyway, things were cooled and but the hurt is still there and some b!tch in sch tried stealing my crush cause she knows I like him (I do not think she likes him, just that she's been a b!tch)<br><br>Oh well, though my results worsen somewhere there. I manage to pick it up this year, hope fully I can get into a poly course I wanted. But the problem is..how..like how do I overcome the disgust I had for people over the years..*sigh*<br><br>Yours mentally scarred,<br>Depressed...*sigh*[/b]</blockquote>how old are u?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Learn to shut out all distractions and focus on succeeding your dreams. Along the way, keep an eye for fiends and friends - who to avoid and who you can trust. You will surely meet new people - the key to your happiness or misery is a calm mind and wisdom to discern who is friend or foe.  Your life ahead is never found in the past - it's job is to mould you and sharpen your mental strength-will and always remember not to let the past transform you into a miserable person (unless you let its weight overcome you). The past cannot be undone but we can surely create our future. Learn to react to all stormy situations, provokations calmly despite the turbulence "outside". Life becomes turbulent than peaceful when we react turbulently to stormy situations.<br><br>If you're the silkworm, you're like going through the stage of life when it undergoes metamorphosis in the pupae undergoing complete transformation within a protective cocoon or hardened case (necessary to protect yourself from any form of harm) bidding your time. But when the time is ripe and it reaches adulthood, the struggling juices it's gone thru will transform you into a beautiful butterfly where a new life and world awaits you to live and enjoy taking flight away leaving the past behind.<br><br>And there are many similar pupaes undergoing transformation as much as there are many harmful "insects" in the harsh environment.<br><br>Let not the past and present distractions cripple you.<br><br>Don't lose heart. Go and seek your dreams. Let the past collect dust.<br><br></div>

If you sense trouble stay away; and if you feel that the people who surround you now will one day become part of that hurtful past, i'd say you should pull yourself out now while you have the chance.<br><br>Warmest Regards,<br>SupaFatty<br></div>
