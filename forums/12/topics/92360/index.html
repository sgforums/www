It was such a wrong move or rather improper of you to jus hit her becos of such reasons..<br><br>If you really wan to have your own privacy and you think that she is intruding.. you can jolly-well jus tell her you need your own space.. Hate guys to violents to solve their relationship problems.. You think using violent can solve?? You hurt her deep.. Not becos of the pain.. is becos of the punch that slash thru her heart..<br><br>She can moved on so quickly simply becos at that point of time when you hit her.. i bet she's already too stun.. to shocked.. too heartbreaking.. she lost her trust in you.. she fear.. she leave for good.. Now that you know she has a relationship.. give her your best blessings.. And you jus have to move on.. and learn from the past.. If this never happen.. You never know how much hurt you have done to her.. and to this relationship.. it still goin on if you didn't hit her that once!<br><br>But then again... Everyone do make mistakes.. Jus make sure you learn your lesson deep and hard.. get on with your life.. Cheer up..<br><br>Cheers..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
