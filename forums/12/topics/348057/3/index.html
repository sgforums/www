Also, should you questioned yrself , how you valued yr relationship with dat abusive guy , despite all the hittings he gave to you , do you still think it is worthwhile to be with this guy for the rest of yr decades with him , if he promise to marry you one day ? <span> </span>Not point of getting police involve unless you wants to go further to prosectuate him , getting all your time spent just to get him with all the legal proceedings , to be honest.

              <p>DUN DO TAT, cos tat will make u suffer in agonies n regrets for the rest of ur life......</p>
              <p>ALL u need is tat extra courage to tell in his face tat "I DUN NEED U IN MY LIFE ANYMORE" tat extra step is to pave ur happier life.</p>

              <p>IF yes why is he hurtin u physically n mentally even u dun enjoy even the slightest of it?</p>
              <p>Well, if u think the power of love for him can surpass ur own LIFE. Be our guest, cos it is STILL ur choice, unless u take action to salvage ur miseries.</p>

              <p>hmm. a bad tempered person will not change that easily.</p>
              <p>but i think it's true, that you use the word break up too flippantly. you should never threaten anyone in a relationship, you either accept that person as he is, or don't be in the relationship at all.</p>
              <p>if you say break up - mean it, don't use it as a game.</p>
              <p>and yes, i feel that girls generally are petty.</p>

              <p>hello all. i really need comments and advice on my r/s. i'll
              just summarise my dramatic love life. my bf and i have been tgt for
              3 years. after months tgt, he showed his true colours by being
              abusive to me whenever he got angry or when we quarrel. abusive act
              like punching and scratching which happens in public too. i gave
              him alot of chances by forgiving him until a day when i couldnt
              tolerate, i initiated a break up. he got worried and told me all
              those stuffs that he'll change and so, i went back to him. it
              became such a habit that whenever we quarrel, i will always say
              break because the thinking that he will only be afraid of break up
              is there. however for the past 6mths, he stopped his abusive act.
              my cousins and aunt and friends knew about it because its really
              hard to hide my sadness and thoughts when i know there're there
              for me and the bruises, scratches are obvious.</p>
              <p>yesterday, a love festival, i guess i'm the only pathetic one.
              everything went well but not the night. we were at esplanade for
              some chattings and theres a mini concert so we sat and listen.
              after some time, he told me that his friend would be meeting him
              over at his place and he is alr there. so we left the concert after
              about 2-3songs sang. but its true that the songs sang were boring
              for us. we went to the bus stop and waited for bus. then he
              suggested taking train which he will never because he always wanna
              spend more time tgt. he claimed that because the weather is humid
              and train will be faster and train might have seats. the thing is
              bus got higher chances to get seats because train is gonna be damn
              squeezy and going home by bus takes abt 35mins and train-then-bus
              is gonna take 45mins. i got no idea why he suggested this but to
              conclude that he wanna meet his friend sooner. which girl will be
              happy when your bf is rushing to leave you for his friends? however
              after he explained while shouting, i understood and wasnt angry
              anymore. but he still kept repeating saying that i'm very petty and
              said out all the past where i'm petty and always saying break
              easily. i didn't shout out the abusive part is alr being kind
              enough. i didnt talk back because i dont wanna further embarrass
              ourselves not knowing that he just kept repeating non stop, even
              till we got up the bus. alot of people were looking at us and i
              really felt like a pathetic shit. when we were up the bus, he
              continued saying non stop and its real loud that ppl can hear me
              and stuff. keep saying that im petty and alr 19 yrs old still
              saying break all the time (do you have any idea who made me do
              this)? alll he wanna do is to embarrass me but he didnt know he is
              embarrassing himself even more. he even go to the extent to insult
              my family. he is 20, who is childish here? he whined for real long
              till i say 'stop repeating alr can', he gave me 2 scratches on my
              neck. it hurts yes, but my heart definitely hurt more. i dont know
              if i should forgive him.</p>
              <p>Just a day ago, he told me one of our friend, ts, whacked his gf
              real hard with alot of blood on the face and body. he kicked,
              punched, slapped and all. he said he is guilty, but the girl
              deserved it. he said i deserve it too. and he added, with the tone
              i give when quarreling and the unhappy face i give, i will get
              punches from him someday. what should i do? he is alr hinting me. i
              dont know if i can still trust him anymore. because i dont want the
              past to repeat, i suffered enough in the past.</p>
              <p>i had enough. people keep advicing me to leave him but because i
              know i still love him, i dont have the heart to really ignore him
              and break up. i kept forgiving while the phrase 'leopard never
              changes its spot' is reflecting in my mind.</p>
              <p>i am real clueless and have no idea what to do. i havent been
              contacting him since last night, can anyone help?</p>

              <p>I read in Newpaper the other day that there is a Date Violence Help group around in Facebook or something, you might want to check it out for some support from people who experienced what you are going through.</p>
              <p>My personal take is that any guy who does not respect his partner and used or wants to use violence on the very person he proclaims to love, does not deserve anybody's love. Such a person does not know how to love. Please leave him asap.</p>

              <p>This is really like fcuked up! Many guys have no girlfriends and this guy is taking things for granted... abusing his girlfriend like a slave...geez. Abusing someone weaker than you is cowardice. Girls should be loved and appreciated even if they give you a hard time. When you enter a r/s, be prepared for such pain to occur.</p>
              <p>TS, I advise you to leave this unhealthy r/s. It's like a neverending loop. You propose to break, he begs, you go back and the same thing happens. Go find other guys who will not abuse you but will please you sexually and emotionally. A real man is someone who is in control of his own emotions. The last thing any guy should do is physically abuse her unless you are talking about having a rough romp together.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> People who are violent in love often demands a concrete amount of control over something as erratic as love. If one experienced violence over time, fear will eventually displace the position where love used to be. Love cannot be coerced and the truly problematic ones are the one who end up concluding that they needed more force to curb their love ones from running away, one after another. </p>
              <p>Such unrecognized personality will naturally formulate the outcome of self defeat for afflicted Mars never win in love (In Greek Mythology, obnoxious Ares is pretty much hated by other Gods over his love for war) and only the notion of willingness could love surrender itself and truly be tied down.</p>
              <p>Also, chances are, guys who display aggressiveness and violence in love might brought up in a family where such occurrence are a norm in the household. </p>
              <p>Nobody has the prerogative to physically abuse anyone else. If his brand of love means beating, then you probably don't really need it at all. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>TS's boyfriend should be the role model for all guys.</p>
              <p>this is the kind of real man who attracts girls; it is violent abusive guys like him who is able to make girls cling on to him despite all that he has done.</p>
              <p>read the teen magazines, women's magazines.</p>
              <p>plenty of stories everyday on how, despite a woman being abused by her man, still keeps returning to him. it is sub-consciousness at work; by being violent, a man is sub-consciously showing a woman that he's a REAL MAN who can protect in times of trouble, not some farking sissy.</p>
              <p>it is the nice guy losers like me who don't even have any farking girlfriend to hang out with on valentine's day.</p>
              <p>this is the kind of alpha-male, forceful real man, who controls the girl and not the other way round. this is how life should be.</p>
              <p>if TS can give me your bf's MSN, i would be very grateful.</p>
              <p>i need to make him my mentor so that he can teach a soft bast*rd like me how to behave like a farking real man. from what i see, heard and read, the more forceful you're, the more girls you attract.</p>
              <p>i don't wanna be a farking soft pretty boy anymore. all those dating tips about being gentlemanly are the biggest single trash i ever knew in my entire farking life.</p>
              <p>i vow that from now on, i'll worship and pray to every guy who behaves like a real man.</p>
              <p>like that recent 13-year old father in the US who had sex with a 16 year old girl.</p>
              <p>that's the most glorious achievement in his entire life and that act alone already wins most SG guys here. i admire his power and wish i could learn from him too.</p>
              <p>it is the cheaters, the jerks, the abusers who gets so muhc pretty chicks clinging to them that they have a very tough time deciding which chick to go out with next minute.</p>
