              <p>I wonder why TS said we would laugh at her? Its strange, because we are glad for her. I think everyone will be glad she finally broke up with an idiotic person.</p>
              <p>On another note, I wonder why abused women often love their abuser. Many a beaten wife, have told the judge that they love their wife-beating husband.</p>
              <p>Love? Do they know what love actually means. Love is growth, constructive, positive. Love builds, improve, enhances. Where is any of these in an abusive relationship?</p>
              <p> Is it fear, that they pass off as "love"? They are afraid to let go of what they are used to, of what they are famililar with. They are afraid to part into a void, that they prefer to hang on to what they have, and hope things will turn better.</p>
