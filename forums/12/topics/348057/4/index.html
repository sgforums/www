              <p>TS's boyfriend should be the role model for all guys.</p>
              <p>this is the kind of real man who attracts girls; it is violent
              abusive guys like him who is able to make girls cling on to him
              despite all that he has done.</p>
              <p>read the teen magazines, women's magazines.</p>
              <p>plenty of stories everyday on how, despite a woman being abused
              by her man, still keeps returning to him. it is sub-consciousness
              at work; by being violent, a man is sub-consciously showing a woman
              that he's a REAL MAN who can protect in times of trouble, not some
              farking sissy.</p>
              <p>it is the nice guy losers like me who don't even have any
              farking girlfriend to hang out with on valentine's day.</p>
              <p>this is the kind of alpha-male, forceful real man, who controls
              the girl and not the other way round. this is how life should
              be.</p>
              <p>if TS can give me your bf's MSN, i would be very grateful.</p>
              <p>i need to make him my mentor so that he can teach a soft bast*rd
              like me how to behave like a farking real man. from what i see,
              heard and read, the more forceful you're, the more girls you
              attract.</p>
              <p>i don't wanna be a farking soft pretty boy anymore. all those
              dating tips about being gentlemanly are the biggest single trash i
              ever knew in my entire farking life.</p>
              <p>i vow that from now on, i'll worship and pray to every guy who
              behaves like a real man.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>hello all. i really need comments and advice on my r/s. i'll
              just summarise my dramatic love life. my bf and i have been tgt for
              3 years. after months tgt, he showed his true colours by being
              abusive to me whenever he got angry or when we quarrel. abusive act
              like punching and scratching which happens in public too. i gave
              him alot of chances by forgiving him until a day when i couldnt
              tolerate, i initiated a break up. he got worried and told me all
              those stuffs that he'll change and so, i went back to him. it
              became such a habit that whenever we quarrel, i will always say
              break because the thinking that he will only be afraid of break up
              is there. however for the past 6mths, he stopped his abusive act.
              my cousins and aunt and friends knew about it because its really
              hard to hide my sadness and thoughts when i know there're there
              for me and the bruises, scratches are obvious.</p>
              <p>yesterday, a love festival, i guess i'm the only pathetic one.
              everything went well but not the night. we were at esplanade for
              some chattings and theres a mini concert so we sat and listen.
              after some time, he told me that his friend would be meeting him
              over at his place and he is alr there. so we left the concert after
              about 2-3songs sang. but its true that the songs sang were boring
              for us. we went to the bus stop and waited for bus. then he
              suggested taking train which he will never because he always wanna
              spend more time tgt. he claimed that because the weather is humid
              and train will be faster and train might have seats. the thing is
              bus got higher chances to get seats because train is gonna be damn
              squeezy and going home by bus takes abt 35mins and train-then-bus
              is gonna take 45mins. i got no idea why he suggested this but to
              conclude that he wanna meet his friend sooner. which girl will be
              happy when your bf is rushing to leave you for his friends? however
              after he explained while shouting, i understood and wasnt angry
              anymore. but he still kept repeating saying that i'm very petty and
              said out all the past where i'm petty and always saying break
              easily. i didn't shout out the abusive part is alr being kind
              enough. i didnt talk back because i dont wanna further embarrass
              ourselves not knowing that he just kept repeating non stop, even
              till we got up the bus. alot of people were looking at us and i
              really felt like a pathetic shit. when we were up the bus, he
              continued saying non stop and its real loud that ppl can hear me
              and stuff. keep saying that im petty and alr 19 yrs old still
              saying break all the time (do you have any idea who made me do
              this)? alll he wanna do is to embarrass me but he didnt know he is
              embarrassing himself even more. he even go to the extent to insult
              my family. he is 20, who is childish here? he whined for real long
              till i say 'stop repeating alr can', he gave me 2 scratches on my
              neck. it hurts yes, but my heart definitely hurt more. i dont know
              if i should forgive him.</p>
              <p>Just a day ago, he told me one of our friend, ts, whacked his gf
              real hard with alot of blood on the face and body. he kicked,
              punched, slapped and all. he said he is guilty, but the girl
              deserved it. he said i deserve it too. and he added, with the tone
              i give when quarreling and the unhappy face i give, i will get
              punches from him someday. what should i do? he is alr hinting me. i
              dont know if i can still trust him anymore. because i dont want the
              past to repeat, i suffered enough in the past.</p>
              <p>i had enough. people keep advicing me to leave him but because i
              know i still love him, i dont have the heart to really ignore him
              and break up. i kept forgiving while the phrase 'leopard never
              changes its spot' is reflecting in my mind.</p>
              <p>i am real clueless and have no idea what to do. i havent been
              contacting him since last night, can anyone help?</p>

              <p>Most of the women that get beat up are more afraid whats going to happen to them when they leave the man then anything else. Its gonna take another more manly man to beat down her man before she leaves him.</p>

              <p>after all the comments ppl gave, i'm sure of my route ahead.</p>
              <p>Nikar 3, from your point of view, i can only think that you're lack of love. A girl or at least 20 of my girlfriends are looking for guys that are gentleman, in a way that he's not a weakling to get permission from her for doing anything, but respecting therefore informing her on necessary stuff. Your choice given to Miss Tiny, is alr quite a bullshit. Of all comments i received, you're the only wimp. Girls like me who used to stick to abusive bf is because they can be good to extreme, and bad to extreme as well. Its quite impossible, at least for me, to totally leave my bf for treating me extreme good once, and total bad for a moment. Nikar 3, I'm quite assure you're below 17. Hope you find love soon. Goodluck</p>

              <p>O' rly? and when these "20 of your girlfriends" eventually get guys who are "gentleman", then they start getting sick of these goody-gentlemen and dump them, and start looking for real men like your current bf. we've all heard real-life accounts like this too many times.</p>

              <p>that's the most priceless piece of advice you've given. now, i know why your bf is so hot. so, the method is to treat girls very nicely and sweetly to attract them like ants attracted to candy factory, and then when they get bored of the guy, the guy should treat them nastily to spice up things? and when the girl is sad, they then suddendly become sweet again to make the girl happy and the girl in turn appreciates them more?</p>

              <p> nah, no worry. just look like TS as an example. her bf physically abuse her but she still keep quiet, because she don't dare and she don't want to. so, the father will never know. these girls will just suffer in silence, which is good news for us.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>pls don't count your chickens before they hatch. for all you know, you'll end up marrying a wife-beater one day and still love him to hell. then, we'll see who spit on who.</p>
              <p>it's been scientifically proven that girls want aggressive guys, the nastier the better.</p>
              <p>look at Pamela Anderson. got beaten up by ex-hubby Tommy Lee so many times still go back to him like good girl. then, they break up and got with another girl-beater bf.</p>
              <p>still love him. now, the 3rd or 4th or 5th bf she is with now is also a tough rocker guy.</p>

              <p>read the teen magazines, women's magazines.</p>
              <p>plenty of stories everyday on how, despite a woman being abused

              that he's a REAL MAN who can protect in times of trouble, not some
              farking sissy.</p>
              <p>it is the nice guy losers like me who don't even have any

              <p>if TS can give me your bf's MSN, i would be very grateful.</p>
              <p>i need to make him my mentor so that he can teach a soft bast*rd

              heard and read, the more forceful you're, the more girls you
              attract.</p>
              <p>i don't wanna be a farking soft pretty boy anymore. all those

              ever knew in my entire farking life.</p>
              <p>i vow that from now on, i'll worship and pray to every guy who
              behaves like a real man.</p>
              <p>like that recent 13-year old father in the US who had sex with a
              16 year old girl.</p>
              <p>that's the most glorious achievement in his entire life and that
              act alone already wins most SG guys here. i admire his power and

              <p>hey Nikar, good that you are finally maturing. U are right, being that super gentlemanly, super nice guy will get u nowhere, in the end everyone will just step over yr wimp head</p>
              <p>to be a real man u need to be self-assured, confident, independant, and LOOK like a man. if u are forever going out in shirt n jeans, schboy metal rim specs and centre parting, u'll never become the 'man' that women cling to</p>
              <p>but using violence on gal is the most disgraceful thing to do. want to get gals use sincerity, use sweet words, use yr 'manly' charm, use yr success, use yr sharp wits. make yrself a guy wanted by her (to show off to her frens), and not a guy feared by her</p>

              <p>Well well, I think u seriously need to think clearly from a girl's point of view. Ok, u want me to choose one of them right? I can clearly tell u that if my bf dares to lay one finger on me, I'll slap him back and kick his groins, and make sure I'll never ever return back to him, unless I feel that being slapped by him is an enjoyment and a thrill. I know u must be thinking that I only say say what. Don't think I don't dare just because I'm a girl. I rather have a wimp to be my bf rather than an abusive guy who thinks violence will solve everything. At least a wimp deserves my love, and not an abuser who reciprocates my love with violence.</p>
              <p>A guy who acts as a gentleman doesn't need to resort to violence yet can be like a real man to his beloved lover.  A man who starts on violence is a thorough loser who has no brains because he can only think of violence which controls a girl and makes her obey him.</p>
              <p>Pamela Anderson? Haha, she's just a bimbo with big boobs, so can't blame her. It's only weak and feeble girls who have no mind of their own chose to torture themselves by going back to their abusive bf. If u think that being a real man equates to agressive and violence, then I must congratulate u. Go ahead and worship TS's bf, I'm sure both of u can find solace and comfort and best if both of u find a group of girls ready to be offered as sacrifice.</p>

              <p><strong>well, to guys like Lorry, i would love to see the crappy
                                          expression on your face when in future, i've a harem of girls under
                                          my arm and going out with 4 girls every day to the extent that i'm
                                          stressed over so much girls i've.</strong></p>
              <p>Okay fine. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  Keep on waiting to see that crappy expression of mine. When your day-dreaming about that, I've already done it. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p><br>- This is coming from a playa (or 'whim' <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">) who at least knows to respect girls.</p>
              <p>Oh. And what is a 'whim', may i ask, Mr Virgin Nikar? <br>You mean wimp? That is some serious spelling mistake you know. Not spelling your name right sure is some serious issue.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="icon_surprised.gif"></p>
