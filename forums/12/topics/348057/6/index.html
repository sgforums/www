              <p>i think there's no more need to mention about what the bf was doing wrong. it's so obvious.</p>
              <p>but what's not so obvious to some, is that TS is also being emotionally abusive, imo.</p>
              <p>you can't use break up as a threat to get ppl to do what u want really.</p>
              <p>the more i think about it, the more annoyed i get.</p>
              <p>people don't change, that's the reality. you either accept them as they are, and appreciate their effort, or you don't.</p>

              <p>Dear TS,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I plead indulgence for this post, for i dont know your background, but just let me hazard a guess.</p>
              <p>You hate the naggings at home from your mom. Her constant haggling you to do your homework or housework is sickening to you. And you don't feel fairly treated because your brother is not nagged but pampered. You dad is tired from a hard days work and left home management to your mom, and do not seem to care. You feel she is a tyrant, and your siblings are of no help, and even would scold you and deem you lousy.</p>
              <p>You go to school and get bullied by other more demanding girls. The teachers either are authoritative or do not care. You are sick of it all.</p>
              <p>You meet this guy and he treats you nice. For once in your life, you feel happy being with him, for he takes care of you. Your need for love and companionship in your presumed cruel world is so strong that you are willing to overlook whatever flaws he has, even abuse.</p>
              <p>I may be wrong in my assumption, and i do sincerly apologise, but you are only exhibiting the classic emotional bondage some modern women still cling on to.</p>
              <p>Love is not bondage in any form. Nor can it be betrayed in any way, more so by abuse. You are not alone. Male or female, we all have our emotional needs, and am willing to compromise. No one wants to be alone.</p>
              <p>But abuse is not something you MUST put up with! This is violence and NO man who calls himself a male beats up women! This is atrocious and a disgrace to ALL modern men!</p>
              <p>However, at the end of day, it is your choice if you want to stick to him. You ACTUALLY deserve better and will meet a nicer man if only you are willing to open up yourself to others, by being friends first always. It is always safe to be friends first, know a person before committing yourself. In this modern age, do not presume that you are beholden to someone if you gave away yourself to him physically. You are not spoilt good nor need to accept  abuse as your fate, as no one will ever love you except him - that is not true  Love is more than skin deep.</p>
              <p>Have more friends and keep those whom are sincere. There are worth their weight in gold and must be treasured, not people who will abuse you.</p>
              <p>Good luck.  </p>
              <p> </p>

              Wow, ts thread become ur thread sia. Ur posts are more interesting than TS. After reading ur thread I find that u are either a gay (without knowing that u are actually more attracted to man) or that you are psychotics. 
              U sounded like a gay that look upon a violence guy. Think about it, maybe u are more interested in looking for a â€˜manlyâ€™ guy than a pretty gal on the street. =)   if u are sure of ur sexual preference, then I guess u nid a doctor. =) god bless you. see a doc soon.
              
              Oh ya. And stop attracting attention in TS thread! She needs help not ur nonsense. Nono I think u seriously nid more help than her. Ur condition is much worse. Go open up a thread urself. =)
              
              One more, being a virgin is nth wrong. Infact u sld be proud that u hav self control and being respectful to ur love 1 and that you are not promiscuous. Dun feel bad or upset about that Nikar 3
              Oh no, I realised wad I have mentioned only apply to Mr nice guy who attracted lots of gals not u. sorry.
