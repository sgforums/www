Take part in courses, interest group, arts, music or even foreign language if both has the same interest. This will boost greater communication in long term.<br><br>Second - keep making mutual friends. The more mutual friends you both have, the more things you could talk as well. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>But seriously speaking, in your case, its not so much about the conversation part - its about your desire of wanting those sweet-lovey message and stuff to return or at least maintain at the usual level you used to have it:<br><br>If it is not within his/her personality to do that - generally, such 'boons' would be short-lived and would reduce in frequency over time. What I meant is that unless is she what I termed it as 'Disciplined Lifestyle.' (Someone who is consistant in his attitude and behavior towards his relationship by demonstrating a set of 'actions' he/she will do regularly. E.g. SMS, phone everyday, etc) - if not, unless you truly mind this aspect, a little communication would whip up miracles when done correctly and strategically. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Talk to her about your feelings and thoughts. Share them. Again, this is another form of conversation that would build your relationship and foster better bonds as well.<br><br>P.S: Don't always compare past and present - this is one mistake everyone does. Time change, world change, love change. We have to look at every factor around our relationship before we proclaim that a problem is going on. Everything ain't stagnant - it's constantly moving, either go up or go down. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>
