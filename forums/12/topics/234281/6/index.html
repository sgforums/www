            <div class='col-md body'>Thats sweet of you.<br><br>Remember the time when you just started to fall in love. Everything looks wonderful and you feel happy, even though, you are actually "giving" in the relationship. Of coz, you may feel indignant that you have been "giving" since the start of the relationship and feels that it is time for you to "receive".<br><br>But, also remember, why do most relationships fail? Is it because it is stagnant? Incompactility? If thats the case, why do they fall in love in the first place and can start a relationship? Because they "give". However, as time goes by, they feel they "give" and now, they expect to "receive". They feel unstatisfied with a relationship when they feel that they do not "receive" as much as they "give". Thus, they feel tired and decided to end.<br><br>I believe love is unconditional. Ppl have the ability to "give". Do it because you feel happy doing it. Think of him when you do that. It will make you happy coz you know he will be happy. Isn't this what makes a relationship? Trust me, he will feel it.<br><br>Cheers.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Me and my bf are also in a LDR. And we only get to meet at most 4 times a month, usually during the weekends.<br><br>Last time we used to talk all the time, through online, SMSes and phone calls. When I was still studying overseas, think our conversations on MSN can last for hours...then when I came back to Malaysia, I would go to a cyber cafe every night to chat with him, simply cos my house got no internet and calling each other all the time is just too expensive...Then after I got internet connection at work, we also chat all the time on MSN until we both finished working...but starting from a few weeks ago we have decided not to MSN each other so much anymore, cos I need to do my work and he also needs to do his...but this is a compromise we have both reached together...I let him do his work in the afternoon, but I set a time for us to talk on phone at night, and so far we have never missed this time, even when he is out he will still call me...<br><br>LDR requires a lot of efforts on both parties, and the most important thing is for you to be open with him and also tell him your concern. Did you ever tell him that you feel that your relationship lacks communication? And tell him that it is harder not to communicate so much since both of you already can't meet so often nowadays...just let him know how you feel, don't bottle it to yourself. That's what my dear has always told me cos he said if I dun tell him, he might not even know what is bothering me...</div>

All ears.</div></blockquote>On one hand, your bf's behavior can be somehow a little suspicious. But there's really no evidence to put him down or maybe not even a need to do so? He could be 'acting funny' behind your back or just like what the other extreme end as some have proposed.. Just too busy with work? Though from what you've mentioned so far, I would personally think he's more like at least a little suspicious....<br><br>Like MCSquare has suggested, it's not quite logical or even adequate that he should be ignoring much of your feelings... Personally I feel... Especially shouldn't be so since you're both still quite YOUNG into this relationship... He should naturally be more concerned than not...? Unless like what others have mentioned that he's too busy with work...? But from examples ya mentioned about him speaking of himself going out and then suddenly no reply and such... Doesn't quite match up?<br><br>What's your star sign?<br><br>Is your bf in anyway quite attractive? Or suppose quite a very successful person?<br><br>Somehow from what you've mentioned, it seems like he in a very much more dominant position in this relationship? At least in a sense? Even if you supposingly have 'control' over him, it's more like from a 'pet' 's position...? Meaning you would have to win his favor and heart...? Something like that...?<br><br>In view of the form of relationship that both of you are holding.. I suppose there's quite a chance that your bf is a flirt of a sort maybe? Or that your relationship might not really have that foundation to it...? You're someone with quite a high sense of insecurity..? With relatively low sense of control over the relationship.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"></div>
