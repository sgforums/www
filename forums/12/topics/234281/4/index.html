IF love wasn't an issue, he has probably some good reason/s why he isn't proactive in upkeeping communication. Of course, you might argue that he could have make time for it if he has the heart to, but I wouldn't not advocate your thinking along that direction since it probably spell unnecessary worries and fears.<br><br>I wouldn't say he is taking you for granted literally, as this is likely to be a small hurdle of three months. You might want to relate your experience to him personally when he comes back and talk about it. After all, should you condemn him for something, at least allow him the chance to explain or at least improve himself if it's troubling you.<br><br>Meanwhile, do what you can to improve things - leave the major talk for later... when he comes back.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
