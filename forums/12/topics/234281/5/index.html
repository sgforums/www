            <div class='col-md body'>I guess, you are not used to your bf being so "cool" to you after 3mths of relationship. My guess is that during the 3mths, you must be seeing/meeting him almost everyday, and now, suddenly, he is away for business trip, you feel insecure that he doesn't keep up with the normal routine of contacting you. (Phone bills are expensive, regardless chatting/smsing! I believe he is using auto-roaming which makes it worse! Per sms in BKK (just an example) costs $0.50 and if you add that up for 3mths, you can faint thinking of that!) Don't worry, this is normal, especially now that he is overseas. He may have lotsa things/matters to handle as this is a business trip. I think the last thing he needs, is insecurity on your part. A person can handle only so much, work may have already occupied most of his mind/energy. Thus, being his gf, i think you should be more tolerant towards his behaviour right now.<br><br>Your behaviour tells me that you feel insecure. Have more confidence in yourself. You must have your own qualities which attracted him to you and thus go into a relationship with you. Don't be swayed by all those negative thoughts.<br><br>Even the most loving couple needs to spend time on their own, in order to grow (mentally) and for the relationship to grow. After a relationship has become stable, you will realise that you dun really spend as much time as before. I guess, this may cause an insecurity in you.<br><br>Besides going out with frens for movie or watsoever, why dun you spend time on exercises? Its going to make you feel better after sweating it out. And pls, dun ever try to test him.<br><br>Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

There is a fine line between positive and delusion.<br><br>Thanks for the suggestion.  i went to the beach to jog yesterday already.</div>
