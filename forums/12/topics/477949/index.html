              <p>I have been living in my hdb flat for about 11 years. I have experienced many different neighbors for the past few years as the actual owner of the house rent out her house. Most of the neighbors that had stayed in that flat were able to get along well with my parents and some of them even continue to be friends with my mother. So I would say that we are not a mean or an unpleasant neighbour to have. </p>
              <p>So currently the neighbour that is staying in that rent out house is a foreigner who is from India. The 'queen' of the household in that family is somehow a crazy witch as she been finding faults with our family.</p>
              <p>Firstly, as we have been staying in our house for about 11 years, we never had any complains about the potted plants that are placed outside our house. The walk way along the corridor are wide enough for any pram or trolley to go through without any trouble. However, the 'queen' apparently find fault with my parents as she claimed that the walkway is too narrow for her to go through. Worse, She once kicked one of my slipper until I couldn't find it again and recently, she kicked my dad's slipper all the way to the area around the rubbish chute. </p>
              <p>Secondly, she is nuts as she got all crazy with us to the point that she lodged a complain to the housing and development board about our apparent 'too narrow' walkway. At this point, my dad could not controlled his anger and frustration because we received complain letters from the hdb board and even had to put up with their attitudes. </p>
              <p>Lastly, she recently called the police because my mum stared at her. She complained loads of stuff about us which is stupid as our family were nice enough to put up with her attitudes and actions which felt like salt were rubbing onto our wounds. She always slam the door loudly when she comes home and purposely kick our shoes away when she walks by.  Moreover, when the police came and talked to my sister, he said that the woman was overboard and that our walkway is wide enough.</p>
              <p>hence, what are your views on my neighbour and what do you think I should do about it because my father who is normally a calm man is suddenly overworked about this issue. They are going to leave soon but I have no idea how soon it would be.</p>

              <p>My uncle got a simlar neighbour just like the TS. Indian and always finding fault. However I lknow my uncle family also not the very kind type because they have been quarrelling with thier previous neighbour for a few yrs(both chinese family) and then move and now kanna the indian neighbour.</p>
              <p>My take is do not go and provoke your neighbous anymore, no matter wat they do to your slippers. Keep your shoes indoors and give and take sometimes. You can be kuai lan only if you are rich and can choose to stay anywhere you like.</p>
