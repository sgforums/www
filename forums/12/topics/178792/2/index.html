            <div class='col-md body'>Used to be a nice guy, could wait hours and hours to get a chance to talk/see the girl I like. Then realize that girls don't like nice guys. Used to hug 1 tree and not have a change of heart, but my friend always say, the forest is so big, why you so stupid only hug 1 tree... Didn't really care back then, totally blinded by love, but now he is right, the tree is no longer there, we need to move on, the forest is so big, there will be another woman out there. I think it's the same case for you.</div>
