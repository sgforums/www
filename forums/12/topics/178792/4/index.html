            <div class='col-md body'>oh my.. snowgiant, for a moment,i thought you really sounded like one of my friends until you mentioned about committing suicide...hmm..my friend wouldn't do such a thingy.. ^^ Anyway, it's good that you've come to your senses...what that doesn't kill you makes you stronger ya  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Your first post reminds me of one of my friends. He's always asking me, why do nice guys always come last? Why can't nice guys get girls like those not so nice guys do? that friend of mine's just like how you have described in "Ode to the Nice Guys "... sometime  last year, he gotta know one of my female friends, and he fell for her, my female friend's a hardcore chiongster who went in and out of r/s very often.... he told me that he's not into chiongsters, but somehow he fell for her. It was a horrible stretch of time for him, coz his feelings for her weren't reciprocated(although once in awhile she's misleading him in a way of another)..... there are some other guys chasing her the same time when he was going after her, she rather chose some chiongster guy who claimed that he loved her, but didn't wanna commit to a relationship, it took him rather long to come to a decision to start a r/s with her (now they are together). I told my female friend "He's such a decent nice guy, you know he is, I have known him for almost have a decade and i can assure you he is, and he'll never let you down like how you claim the other guys did,why don't you give him a chance?" Her reply was "I know he's nice, but seriously he's not my type,it would be great to have him as a friend though."<br><br>As a "middle person" I was really feeling very guilty of introducing them to each other, coz I thought since she's my long time pal, i would really wanna see her settle down with a good guy and live happily ever after...rather than going in and out of relationships and wasting her life on guys who ain't worth at all....<br><br>All i could tell that guy friend of mine, is.. "forget it, she has bad taste, move on will you, you'll eventually find a girl whom you deserve,maybe the time isn't up yet."<br><br>I hope he really understands that it takes chemistry to click. It's not his fault that he's just not the type my friend's looking for....<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>nice story.<br><br>i guess the moral story is girls who don't choose decent guys and end up being cheated/heart-broken/abandoned-and-pregnant deserves their plight.<br><br>nice guys will come in and help. once their confidence is restored, the girls will dive themselves into the same situation and the viscous cycle is reinstated.<br><br>what's the point of changing your female friend's perspective?<br><br>she does not deserve to be with a decent reliably guy. she does not deserve to have any nice guy in her life at all, even as a friend.</div>
