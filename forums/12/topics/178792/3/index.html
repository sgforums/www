She was acting like a friend.<br><br>The insecurity that he felt became a spiral that amplified itself... and the more insecure he became, the more afraid he grew of "screwing things up" by kissing her or asking her to be his girlfriend.<br><br>Plus, the more insecure he became, the less time she seemed to want to spend with him.<br><br>After spending many days and nights obsessing over this girl, the man finally arrived at the conclusion that if she only knew how HE FELT, that she would feel the same way.<br><br>So he made a bold move.<br><br>He told her how he felt.<br><br>He confessed that he was in love, and that he would do anything to be with her.<br><br>She looked at him with compassion in her eyes and said "Thank you... I really mean that... but I don't want to mess up our friendship... you're too important to me...".<br><br>This only confused the man more.<br><br>He didn't know how to take it...<br><br>Did it mean that she really loved him too, but that she was afraid of something?<br><br>Did it mean that she wasn't ready for a long-term relationship?<br><br>Did it mean that she didn't love him, but that she was trying to give him a hint?<br><br>Did it mean that he hadn't tried hard enough?<br><br>Did it mean that he needed to put everything on the line and REALLY let her know how he felt?<br><br>He finally decided that he couldn't go on like this anymore... he had to be with her.<br><br>He had to make sure that she knew just how much he wanted to be with her... so he took a big step, bought her a symbolic gift, and wrote her a long, long letter... again confessing his feelings.<br><br>And then the unthinkable happened.<br><br>She didn't reply.<br><br>He called her three times a day for almost a week before reaching her.<br><br>She made an excuse about being very busy, and said "I'll try to give you a call soon, I have to go"... and hung up...<br><br>...but he never got a call back.<br><br>Over the following months, the man tried desperately to understand what went wrong... and what happened.<br><br>..........

            <div class='col-md body'>SnowGiant,<br><br>Have you died yet?<br><br>If Not, here's what I hafta say.  Committing suicide in the face of rejection is Not only stupid, it's COWARDLY.  If you don't even value yourself, your dignity &amp; your life, how can you expect anyone else to value you?<br><br>If you don't even respect yourself &amp; your life, how can you expect anyone to respect you?<br><br>Finally, if you can't love yourself &amp; your life, how can you expect anyone to love you?<br><br>You may be a nice guy for all I know, but would you be suitable for her?  Are you the kinda person she would like to spend the rest of her life with?  If I were her, I wouldn't choose you either because I don't want the trauma of being threatened with suicide by my partner everytime something goes wrong or doesn't go his way.<br><br>How can you call yourself a guy when you can't even face small things such as rejection?  Other girls have been through worse &amp; survived.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by SnowGiant:</div><div class="quote_body">Yo guys, finally, she is gone.<br><br>Over, gone, finished, and left.<br><br>she was beautiful, some people hated her for it..<br>But I had reasons ...<br>she took a fistful of soul out of my heart<br>put into a blender, and turn it on full speed..<br><br>I want to die..<br><br>I read this well written letter, was edited for me.. but I still<br>appreciate it.. T.T<br><br>Its called.. Ode to nice guys.<br><br>******************<br>Ode to the Nice Guys<br>******************<br><br>This is a tribute to the nice guys. The nice guys that finish last, that never become more than friends, that endure hours of whining and bitching about what assholes guys are, while disproving the very point. This is dedicated to those guys who always provide a shoulder to lean on but restrain themselves to tentative hugs, those guys who hold open doors and give reassuring pats on the back and sit patiently outside the changing room at department stores. This is in honor of the guys that obligingly reiterate how cute/beautiful/smart/funny/sexy their female friends are at the appropriate moment, because they know most girls need that litany of support. This is in honor of the guys with open minds, with laid-back attitudes, with honest concern. This is in honor of the guys who respect a girlÂ’s every facet, from her privacy to her theology to her clothing style.<br><br>This is for the guys who escort their drunk, bewildered female friends back from parties and never take advantage once theyÂ’re at her door, for the guys who accompany girls to bars as buffers against the rest of the creepy male population, for the guys who know a girl is fishing for compliments but give them out anyway, for the guys who always play by the rules in a game where the rules favor cheaters, for the guys who are accredited as boyfriend material but somehow donÂ’t end up being boyfriends, for all the nice guys who are overlooked, underestimated, and unappreciated, for all the nice guys who are manipulated, misled, and unjustly abandoned, this is for you.<br><br>This is for that time she left 30 SMSes, 12 voicemails on your cell phone, and when you called her back, she spent three hours painstakingly dissecting two sentences her boyfriend said to her over dinner. And even though you thought her boyfriend was a chump and a jerk, you assured her that it was all ok and she shouldnÂ’t worry about it. This is for that time she interrupted the best killing spree youÂ’d ever orchestrated in GTA3 to rant about a rumor that romantically linked her and the guy she thinks is the most repulsive person in the world. And even though you thought it was immature and you had nothing against the guy, you paused the game for two hours and helped her concoct a counter-rumor to spread around the floor. This is also for that time she didnÂ’t have a date, so after numerous vows that there was nothing Â“seriousÂ” between the two of you, she dragged you to a party where you knew nobody, the beer was awful, and she flirted shamelessly with you, justifying each fit of reckless teasing by announcing to everyone: Â“oh, but weÂ’re just friends!Â” And even though you were invited purely as a symbolic warm body for her ego, you went anyways. Because youÂ’re nice like that.<br><br>The nice guys donÂ’t often get credit where credit is due. And perhaps more disturbing, the nice guys donÂ’t seem to get laid as often as they should. And I wish I could logically explain this trend, but I canÂ’t. From what I have observed on campus and what I have learned from talking to friends at other schools and in the workplace, the only conclusion I can form is that many girls are just illogical, manipulative bitches. Many of them claim they just want to date a nice guy, but when presented with such a specimen, they say irrational, confusing things such as Â“oh, heÂ’s too nice to dateÂ” or Â“he would be a good boyfriend but heÂ’s not for meÂ” or Â“he already puts up with so much from me, I couldnÂ’t possibly ask him out!Â” or the most frustrating of all: Â“no, it would ruin our friendship.Â” Yet, they continue to lament the lack of datable men in the world, and they expect their too-nice-to-date male friends to sympathize and apologize for the men that are jerks. Sorry, guys, girls like that are beyond my ability to fathom. I canÂ’t figure out why the connection breaks down between what they say (I want a nice guy!) and what they do (IÂ’m going to sleep with this complete ass now!). But one thing I can do, is say that the nice-guy-finishes-last phenomenon doesnÂ’t last forever. There are definitely many girls who grow out of that train of thought and realize they should be dating the nice guys, not taking them for granted. The tricky part is finding those girls, and even trickier, finding the ones that are single.<br><br>So, until those girls are found, I propose a toast to all the nice guys. You know who you are, and I know youÂ’re sick of hearing yourself described as ubiquitously nice. But the truth of the matter is, the world needs your patience in the department store, your holding open of doors, your party escorting services, your propensity to be a sucker for a pretty smile. For all the crazy, inane, absurd things you tolerate, for all the situations where you are the faceless, nameless hero, my accolades, my acknowledgement, and my gratitude go out to you. You do have credibility in this society, and your well deserved vindication is coming.<br><br>For now, I shall take my leave... time for me to commit suicde.. T.T</div></blockquote></div>

She was acting like a friend.<br><br>The insecurity that he felt became a spiral that amplified itself... and the more insecure he became, the more afraid he grew of "screwing things up" by kissing her or asking her to be his girlfriend.<br><br>Plus, the more insecure he became, the less time she seemed to want to spend with him.<br><br>After spending many days and nights obsessing over this girl, the man finally arrived at the conclusion that if she only knew how HE FELT, that she would feel the same way.<br><br>So he made a bold move.<br><br>He told her how he felt.<br><br>He confessed that he was in love, and that he would do anything to be with her.<br><br>She looked at him with compassion in her eyes and said "Thank you... I really mean that... but I don't want to mess up our friendship... you're too important to me...".<br><br>This only confused the man more.<br><br>He didn't know how to take it...<br><br>Did it mean that she really loved him too, but that she was afraid of something?<br><br>Did it mean that she wasn't ready for a long-term relationship?<br><br>Did it mean that she didn't love him, but that she was trying to give him a hint?<br><br>Did it mean that he hadn't tried hard enough?<br><br>Did it mean that he needed to put everything on the line and REALLY let her know how he felt?<br><br>He finally decided that he couldn't go on like this anymore... he had to be with her.<br><br>He had to make sure that she knew just how much he wanted to be with her... so he took a big step, bought her a symbolic gift, and wrote her a long, long letter... again confessing his feelings.<br><br>And then the unthinkable happened.<br><br>She didn't reply.<br><br>He called her three times a day for almost a week before reaching her.<br><br>She made an excuse about being very busy, and said "I'll try to give you a call soon, I have to go"... and hung up...<br><br>...but he never got a call back.<br><br>Over the following months, the man tried desperately to understand what went wrong... and what happened.<br><br>.......... BWAHAHAHAHAHA....<br><br>Anyone felt like this? Or wan to attempt to solve the mystery before I do?<br><br>xP</div></blockquote>It can mean ALOT of THINGS... But SIMPLY PUT... It probably just means that the FRIENDSHIP has been HIGHLY VALUED by her.... So much that she simply don't wish for anything to risk it... This should be the main interpretation in MOST cases, but of course there are also some others which might not fall under such a conclusion..<br><br>Another note. Try not to read TOO MUCH into such forwarded e-mails or SMS. Sometimes they just might not be so much meaningful in a general sense. Sometimes they might not even be sensible. Often try not to use a single case study to interpret ALL future encounters... CHANCES ARE... It won't work...</div>
