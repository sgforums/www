I will never insist i am right when i see something wrong on myself.<br><br>i did REFLECT on myself too, just that she never told me what i did wrong. SHE REFUSED to even tell me anything and just left. You think you know everything about my relationship that you can comment on my personality fairly like a judge?  YOU DONT even know the slightest thing about my relationship and what kind of person my gf is and you're already judging on me.  You think it's fair to me??!<br><br>I never think that i am always right, in fact you ARE the one who always think that other people is wrong. Take this case for example, you dont even know the whole situation of my relationship and you were already accusing me i must have did something wrong.<br>See?  It's your own character as usual - insisting other's people fault.  The first day you met me, you insist i am wrong not to keep a slim and fit body,  you insist i am wrong for not doing something about my social circle, you insist i am wrong for talking the way i like to talk jokingly.<br>You see?  the way you insist a STRANGER is wrong.  What does a stranger's life got to DO WITH YOU ANYWAY ? Is there any business of his got to do with you? Did I do SOMETHING MORALLY WRONG ?  NO !<br><br>Not that i want to say i am right, but I DONT see anything wrong with the way my body is, the way i talk or the way i live my life. Why are you so concerned to criticise others, ESPECIALLY when he is just A STRANGER TO YOU !<br><br>You certainly need more REFLECTIONs on yourself.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

She might have left me because she has fallen for some other guys? She might have left because i have no money?  and she might have left because she thinks i am not romantic enough or i restricted her too much going out with a bunch of wild guys.<br><br>WHy do you always insist i have done something wrong?  you're NOT fair.<br><br>and please, i am not a kid who wants to win and dont want to lose. I dont play kiddish games.<br>I insist i am right because i will not yield to any wrong judgement on myself when there is nothing i have done wrong, especially your judgements...which is very biased to your own views.<br><br>Winning or losing means NOTHING to me .<br>please drill these into your mind.<br><br></div>
