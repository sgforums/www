            <div class='col-md body'>All may seen so dark at the beginning of the tunnel, but as you dare yourself to venture on you will come to the light at the other end.<br><br>Asking you to just look of another guy is almost impossible at this point in time, as you have loved him so much. It would just suggest that you have not been true to the relationship, and of coz it's impossible to tell you not to think about it too, as we're all human beings and we have feelings. Can only tell you that like the sand on the beach, only time can wash away the feeling and pain.<br><br>Well, dun mean to tell you to use hate as a way to escape, but you can divert your hurt and pain on to the things that you're doing now. On the other hand you can try hating him.. (which I dun really recommend) like how come he is able to get another GF so fast?? Doesn't the 2.5 yrs of r/s and 5 yrs of being together mean anything to him??<br><br>Well there's the most you can do, and now you must learn to be on your own, because it will be hard for you to do it as you just suffered recently. all the habits and things that was cultivated all these while had suddenly disappeared. Look for friends to hang out with, or do something stimulating so that it will keep you mind off for a while. All these help...</div>
