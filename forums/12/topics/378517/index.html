              <p>Hi Sure-Fire,</p>
              <p>It is good that you are thinking ahead about your future, but you are being too pessimistic already. No doubt the competition for a job in Singapore is getting tougher by the day, but have faith that as long as you try, you will be sure to find yourself a job. As for IPPT and ICT, who knows?  You may just get posted to a less active unit in the future.</p>
              <p>But putting that aside, you should focus on finishing your NS first. Though there is no one to share your load with you, you are free to rant all you want here. It will make you feel better. </p>
              <p>If you are to continue thinking negatively, I am worried that you may get depression sooner or later. So please do cheer up, and look forward to finish the 8/10 months left.</p>
              <p>Cheers</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Hey Sure Fire, do not think too much about your future... as what Fugazzi said, just take one step at a time... i am now in NS also and left around 8 months to complete it... i have been in a loss before so i can imagine how you feel... no point worrying over something that you cannot control... take things that u can control and manage them well... that is what i am doing...</p>
              <p>sometimes, being alone is not a bad thing... slowly build up your social circle... it takes time bro...</p>

              It's hard to be without friends real ones especially.
                                <br><br>
              You should try to find a hobby start from there.
              Don't fill your thoughts about what's the future is going to become because frankly you don't know even what's tomorrow going to bring!
                                <br><br>
              Be passionate about life. Find something that you love doing. If you don't know what yet then explore! So many interesting things out there. Even reading a good book could be very entertaining.<br><br>
              
              Don't be afraid of life. It's an adventure! enjoy the ride as much as you could! Celebrate your life! everyday! I don't mean partying out each night lol but try to enjoy yourself and everything about yourself.

            <div class='col-md body'><p>Hi there, I can SO relate to you, man.  It feels like everything is so black and white, so "routine".  Well, let me tell u how I overcame this:<br><br>I am still serving my ns like urself.  Am in the service support side.  Altho most service support are stay out, mine's stay in.  So Im spending 80% of my waking hour in camp.  It feels stupid and reduntant just to be in camp waiting for time to pass by and that feeling of booking in really ruins the mood at home.  It was like, my only purpose was to rot and die.<br><br>I told myself, I don't want to continue living like this.  So I made some changes. I decided, why not use the time to pursuit something I want?  I always wanted to learn to play guitar.. so i bought a guitar in camp. At first I sucked alot, but to shorten the story, I am a proud to tell others I am a guitarist =)  Also, I've always admired people who are fit, so I am currently undergoing a fitness regime.  As my unit is not the combat side, we don't really receive much exercise.  So those who O.T.O.T exercise on their own gets respect.  And with that respect breeds confidence.  Its a good feeling.  <br><br>I am thinking of picking up mandarin as well.  Got a few smart chinese fella's here that can help.  I still have a year to go to ORD.  But knowing that when I ORD, I be fit, shred "November Rain"'s solo on guitar and perhaps, even learn some mandarin, its hard to be depressed..</p></div>
