Everywhere he goes, he carries a bottle of water around and he drinks so much water, he keeps going to the toilet. Once he went to my friend's house, drinking water has become such a habit to him that he did not realise the friend's father was busy refilling the <strong>JUG</strong> of water served to him. And he always have the snake powder on his face and he looks like a ghost everytime, and we always like to disturb him. But seeing his old picture, and his face now, there's a big difference.. He's like super vain and there was not much emphasis on facial wash. Just 2 things associated with him. A bottle of water and the snake powder.</div>
