I find local girls quite a turn on. My friends still like local girls. One thing is also because we have something common to talk about also. Local girls can be high earners but as long as she loves me and gives in a lot to the r/s, it is enough. Of course, women with high income might still find a high earner as a husband.<br><br>As for whether men wun stray, I cannot guarantee. But one thing I will never agree is: Men and women are never equal. Im not sexist but it is always a fact. Mentally, physically and emotionally, they will never be the same till the end of time. Men will always have to do the chasing. That is the fact we have to accept.<br><br>As for whether she will be left on the shelf, it depends on the individual. Maybe she is happy being single because she is being true to herself without comforming to societal pressure. It's just how you look at things. Society says must marry means marry meh? Marry only because you truly love the woman not because what people say. That's being true to yourself.<br><br>doko</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In my whole life I seen different type of girls. Please allow me to share. Girls please dun flame if you disagree. Just punch in these for the sake of reading.<br><br>(#1) Materialistic<br>Has loads of 'bfs', outgoing, dun really study well. Very careful and decisive in choosing guys. Always judge by the criterial of wealth (cars, Credit cards) plus good looking or not as no:1. After seeing that the person has cars and credit cards will slowly venture into knowing that person's actual wealth. If the car and credit cards belong to father then she'll rank this person as No:2. Very Unfaithful. The character of the person comes in almost at the last criterial to consider. She is looking for a trophy and not a bf. Similar to #6. But much less looser.<br><br>(#2) Terrible Mistake<br>Quiet, indoor type. Studies well. Sometimes can be average only. But seldom lousy type. Always judge whether the guy treats you well or not first. Looks, wealth is not that important. Character-wise is 2nd grade importance. But if another guy comes and treat her better, she'll sway and eventually fall for the another guy. Relatively faithful. When she loses her feelings for you, better leave her alone. Because she'd resort to any underhanded tricks to hurt you in order to get her way. But advisory note: such girls better avoid. Even when she's your gf, dun ever think about dumping her. She'll do anything to get you back eg. burn your insurance documents to threaten you.<br><br>(#3) 'Church/Holy'<br>Outgoing or quiet. Studies well. Family is normally richer than average. Some look for guys who are equal in financial class. But some also look for guys who are equal in character class. Matured thinking, able to think far, educated. Very clear and decisive on the guys she chooses. Faithful. Very hard to chase. Identify the guy for her by means of chemistry. Relationships tend to last as she chooses her bf carefully.<br><br>(#4) Green Vegetable (Chin Chye)<br>Very easy to chase, faithful. Does not have any preference for any type of guys. Normally is indoor type. But sometimes will have outgoing types. Ranks bf higher than family. Will never dump bf until the bf really goes to the extremes. Can't wait to get married. Some of them are quite outgoing as long as they are single. The moment they are attached, super glues to bf, becomes a housefly. oops... housewife.<br><br>(#5) Chemistry<br>Rather indoor type. Occasionally outgoing for the sake of normal socializing. Prefers to have a bf who start from her circle of friends. Judge by the character of the guy &amp; the way he treats her as No:1 criterial. As long as the guy meets the minimum standard, she will give a bit of chance. Not easy to chase. But will be faithful if she becomes your gf. Best relationships as she chooses her bf very carefully. Matured.<br><br>(#6) Attention Seeker<br>Very Very outdoor type. Always socialising. Can have multiple bfs at one shot. But hardly anyone is serious. Very Very unfaithful. Similar to Materialistic type (Type #1) But is much looser compared to #1.</div>
