            <div class='col-md body'>well, now it narrows down to two possibility. Either its really pure gender discrimination or B did something in the dark to get the job.

            <div class='col-md body'>Agree. It is their loss.<br><br>Are you trying to point out the fact that the employer goes for looks/gender instead of solid qualifications? Some employers are like that. You have to understand that being an employer, they have the right to hire who they want, and in this case the employer probably wants a female instead of a male.<br><br>Please do not take it personally, I am sure that there are many, much better, more transparent and meritocratic employers out there. Don't give up.</div>

She's working in this company now which gave her comfortable salary but she isn't happy working there due to some work reasons. I've always encourage her to find another job, a new surrounding which might be good for her future too. What blaffed me initially is that she keep saying she's sick of the job and yet she refused to change job. It's only later that I realised that due to her defects and her low esteem, she didn't dare to go apply for anoher job.<br><br>I do admit that certain boss does show favouritsm but not all. Of course boss will still have their reasons to who they choose to employ in the end. For any job that requires sales whereby you'll have to meet clients. physical appearance and presentations are important (maybe more important than qualifactions). Knowledge can always be upgraded but looks are hard to upgrade. Most bosses will rather employ someone who has a better presentation than someone who is academically qualified but doesn't look presentable enough. But for a job that requires more of your brain (usually backend positions), boss will rather go for qualifications and experience than to be bother by how you look physically.<br><br>Another kind of boss is, they want fresh people with relavant qualification but zero work experience. Reason? It's easier to train them to work as what the company requires them especially in those engineering line. This is told to me by my boss when he's selecting applications. It's harder to get a person with working experience to follow the company's working style. They are too used to the ex-company and it'll take them a longer time to adjust to the current company they apply for. Short to say, it's easier to bend a young tree then to wait till it's tall and sturdy.</div>

Newer companies would want to have experienced applicants to as to minimised training time and they can get things done faster. for those establised and on the mids of expanding, most will want to get fresh grads to train them up for future aspects for the company.</div>
