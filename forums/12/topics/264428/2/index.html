[Hiller had passed up the opportunity to work on The Godfather (1972) to make this film.] The melodramatic soap-opera, tremendously popular and a financial success (the top-earning film of the year) but panned by critics for its sappy content, was based upon Erich Segal's best-selling short novel of the same name. The film's tagline, <strong>"Love means never having to say you're sorry,"</strong> appeared slightly differently in Segal's novelization: "Love means not ever having to say you're sorry."<br><br>The catchy, haunting, piano-plinking score won the Best Original Score Oscar (the film's sole award) for Francis Lai from its seven <strong>Academy Awards nominations: </strong>Best Picture, Best Actor (Ryan O'Neal), Best Supporting Actor (John Marley), <strong>Best Actress (Ali MacGraw)</strong>, Best Director (Arthur Hiller), and Best Original Story and Screenplay (Erich Segal). Beau Bridges, Michael York, Michael Douglas, Jon Voight, Michael Sarrazin and Peter Fonda all turned down the part of Oliver - which ultimately went to Ryan O'Neal.</div>

A person growing up in a disruptive domestic environment is likely to learn about love much more differently from another coming from a loving family. And of course, when you factor in karmic reasoning - our growth and cosmic lessons will differ vastly, giving rise to different attitude and perception of what love is to them.<br><br>The notion of 'misconception' is not literal; in fact, it's more likely to be a 'pseudo-reality' having to live in their own experience and suffering from the consequence of what have been presented to them. They will classify it as their version of truth in love, accepting and feeding these grime maliciously into their mindset and in turn, behaving like what their thoughts believe in.<br><br>Love is never about destiny - it's about empowerment, realization, choice and learning.<br><br>Many times, it's not so much of how much someone suffered in love - it's about what you come out of it and surmount those challenges. Not everyone needs higher learning in love; you just need to know enough to make your relationship fulfilling.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm not talking about imaginary problems. What I'm saying is, if you're not so intelligent, sometimes you won't even see problems when they're right in front of you. And as I said, some problems don't have solutions, and some problems don't need solving - they just disappear on their own.<br><br>Yes, good thinking skills can help you to get out of the fix. I only said this<br><blockquote>Even if you learn how to think properly, not everyone is the same as you. You may be able to avoid putting yourself in a fix, but you can't prevent others from putting you in a fix</blockquote>because you said "you might not even get into the difficulties in the first place".<br><br>Is it possible to know what is wrong without knowing what is right, or is there a 'right' in the first place?<br><br>If "nobody is perfect" is a lousy excuse for having poor thinking skills, why is it that today there are still so many people with poor thinking skills?<br><br>Going back to the topic on "love", you can try to 'rationalize love', or have terrific thinking skills to know what to do when you run into problems that are love-related. But love is a very overwhelming emotion. Even if you have written several books on relationship advice, you might not be able to do what you know you're supposed to do when the problem comes.
