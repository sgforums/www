First thing in the morning I don't feel like interpreting..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> </div></blockquote>Imagine you are marrying your wife. The beautiful face of your young wife, walking down the aisle. Your eager look breeming with a grin that matches the luckiest man on earth. The vows you 2 made. To love each other in times of peace. In times of trouble. In times of sickness and in times of health.<br><br>Then you have a son. From infancy, the 2 of you took turns to take care of him. Planning his future to get into the best school. Getting him to learn music or arts. That will be in the future but for now, midnights after midnights, waking up in between your sleep to hush your crying son. To feed him and play with him. Don't forget you have to go to work 4 hours later.<br><br>Your son is now in primary school. In a 2 years he will be taking his PSLE. How time flies. 10 years has gone since your child was gifted to you and your wife. 10 years of aging and toiling. You have given the best possible treatment to your son any father could. Your wife worked hard too, Working while cleaning the house. Cooking and taking care of your son. How you 2 have endured the tough times for 10 years.<br><br>5 years later, your son is in his puberty stage. Being rebellious, he has rebelled against your authority, made you mad and skipped school. How you wish he was still a child. 15 years. You can start to see wrinkles in your wife. You 2 loved your son so much that no matter what he did, what mistakes he made, you 2 still forgave him because you loved him.<br><br>5 years from then. Your son entered NS. You understood what is NS. Your wife worries about him because never in his life is he away from you 2 for such a long time. You told her not to worry, it is time for him to grow up. 20 years. You can definately see the wrinkles in your face and your wife's. 20 years of grooming. 20 years of time, sweat, pain, hardship and tears in bringing him up.<br><br>Your son has gone through the basics of NS. He knows the pain and the torture. Then he realised and missed your tender love towards him. He remembered his mother's undying support for him. He realised all these only 21 years later. 21 years he took you 2 for granted. 21 years he thought you 2 were his shield but he saw that you 2 were aging. He knew some day, you 2 will be gone from him.<br><br>So he decided to be a filial son. To love you 2 back. To do his duty as what a son should do.<br><br>This is the more clearer stance I can decipher bah.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
