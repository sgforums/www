Honestly speaking, I think you need to calm down and take a short break from everything. Go to some place quiet or perhaps take some time to be alone for while, like maybe.. going overseas for a tour?<br><br>You need to sort out your feelings and emotions, Because from the way you write your post, you sounded confused and emotional. Watch out! You may be starting to let yourself fall into the Sweetie-guy zone. What do I mean by that?<br><br>First and foremost, when she shares her problems with you, I hope you didn't do any other things except lending her your listening ear. When I say NOT doing ANYTHING else, I MEAN IT! If she ever cried, I hope you didn't hug her so tightly unless she throws herself at you. Even so, it's best not to hug so tightly. Another thing, if she cries, I hope you do nothing else but just hand her a piece of tissue.<br><br>What am I trying to imply here? I'm trying to remind you that it's a trap you shouldn't create for yourself if you are attracted to her. What kind of trap? Well, if you do more than you think you should, then she will be just treating you as a friend.<br><br>Remember, she told you she has feelings for you. That is NOT a confirmation. I repeat. IT IS NOT A CONFIRMATION!!! It is a test of how you are going to react upon hearing these words. How are you going react? Very simple. RELAX. Just relax. Don't take those sweet words to heavily or you might end up hurting yourself.<br><br>Now, back to the jeez.. (the interesting part)<br><br>You said -<br><blockquote>... she would always be out very late every night and I would always wait by her apartment.</blockquote>Ok. Just wanna ask you a question. Why do you want to be her escort? Why do you want to wait for her all the time late at night? You can sit at home and do your stuff, instead of always being there for her.<br><br>Mistake no.1 - You are beginning to show some affection indirectly to her and tell you something, she knew it. Women are excellent in picking up body languages and signals. The problem is... why did you tell her your true feelings in the first place?<br><br>You said -<br><blockquote>why would she always called me sweet names and behave as though we are together every time she comes back late at night. I have tried talking to her but I could never get even five minutes of her time privately</blockquote>Now this is VERY strange already. Calling you sweet names.. and doing sweet stuffs? Well, guess you are pretty happy at that point in time right? She knew it also. Again, she never give time for you to speak to her privately. Do you smell a rat here? Apparently, she's treating you like a friend!<br><br>Mistake no.2 - As you are getting more and more "nice" towards her, look at the mess you create for yourself! Time to wake up. The worse part is that she is using you as a comforter and a friend. Treating you like a boy-friend but all along you are never one. You get the picture now?<br><br>Okay. If you get the big picture already, I suggest you go take a break now and do your stuffs alone. Keep yourself away from contacting anybody. You need some time alone to sort out your over-flowing emotions.<br><br>Need any help, you can PM me. I'll do my best to help.<br><br>yours sincerely,<br>S.H.I.N.</div>

Someone who stands closer than a causal friend, <strong>but nothing close to a relationship.</strong><br><br>She is giving false signal and you picked them up.

Recently I got to know, and fell in love with this girl who stays near our rented apartment. She too is a foreigner.<br><br>We got closer together after all this time and I have even told her how I felt about her knowing very well that she is already attached. She would always tell me her problems she faced with her bf and even told me she had feelings for me. I was happy for a while until lately, she would always be out very late every night and I would always wait by her apartment. Her friends told me to just forget about her as she is attached. But if she really is attached, why would she always called me sweet names and behave as though we are together every time she comes back late at night. I have tried talking to her but I could never get even five minutes of her time privately.<br><br>I am very confused now and suddenly I just feel like exploding. I know I shouldnÂ’t have had developed any feelings for her when she is attached, but I just couldnÂ’t help it. I would have backed off if she didnÂ’t have tell me about her feelings for me. Right now all I can think of is that:<br><br>Is she bored with me already?<br>Is it because of the age difference? (SheÂ’s 28 IÂ’m 23)<br>Is she just using me to past her time?<br><br>SheÂ’ll only talk to me a lot when she had problems with her bf. As much as I donÂ’t like it, I wanted her to be happy, but at the same time, I am feeling very tortured. She claims to some of her friends that I am her boyfriend. So I seriously do not know what is my status with her.<br><br>There is only one thing which I know, is that her bf is very possessive and demanding, her ending up crying all the time. There are times when she wanted to tell me who he is, but I just cut her off saying that itÂ’s not important. I really do not know what to do, should I just back off or should I go ahead and win her heart. I just do not know whatÂ’s giving me this kinds of problems. I seriously hope that all fellow readers could help me out here. I am at a point where by I just wanna explode.<br></div></blockquote>Well its easy to mistaken this kind of actions towards one self.<br>The positive points for a relation you have laid out perfectly.<br>Yet you missed the negetive points which you have yet to put a finger on :<br><br>1. She's Older<br>2. She has attachment in relationship.<br>3. You can't even get 5 mins of private time with her<br><br>She just needs a soul to listen to her problems and someone she can depend on as a good friend. Naturally you will develop feelings for her, with all the "sweet" names caling and her confide in you.<br><br>The points about i made, isn't discouraging you to give her heart up.<br>True that she is attached, But she's not married. If she really loves her boyfriend, you would have no chance. So its really a decision for you.<br>She's still in the void of pain and confusion. She needs someone to lead her out of the Void. Would it be you or her bf ?<br><br>Gd luck.<br><br>Regards<br>Sekundes AkA XEK</div>
