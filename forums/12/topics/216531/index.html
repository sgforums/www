            <div class='col-md body'>You sound just like me. Quiet and easily bullied. But have faith. There are many nice people around. Your husband has faith in you. Looking back over my past jobs, I remember some really wonderful people and some really nasty ones. You see, it is like a bell curve. You have some really nice ones, maybe 10%. Some really nasty ones, another 10%, and the rest just average. Dont let the nasty ones influence your opinion of people in general.<br><br>Sometimes it is the work environment that does this to people, turn them from nice to bitchy. But I dont agree when you say you keep quiet and cover up for other people when they are wrong. People lose respect for you when you 'silently' admit to something you didnt do. Then you become an easy target. Maybe it is time to change into a better environment, and this time you should be more assertive.<br><br>And have faith, yah. There is so many beautiful things. You have a wonderful father and a husband there for you. Your friends. Maybe you also need to build on your confidence. And appreciate your good health, your having a job, and the nature and animals around us.</div>
