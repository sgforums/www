              <p><br>Bald men are sexy. If you want to hide your baldness then shave your whole head. Why are you so shy? My friend's mother at her late 40s is losing hair and balding but she stand tall and have very outward personality. Go see a specialist, I don't know what kind of doctor treat hair loss but go see a GP first and ask for recommendation.</p>
              <p>There is hair implant treatment but its painful and the hair looks a bit fake, people can spot it far away. So you mind as well shave your whole head, it is more sexier.</p>

              <p><br>i have been to nsc specialist n they told me to go back think about it n come back if i want to take the medication.</p>
              <p>so far the pnly medication nsc have is propecia, minoxid hair spray.</p>
              <p>propecia- inhibit dht, dht if u guys have read play a important role in male reproductive function and probably affect my bodybuilding hobby since its after all testerone. have to take for life, results can only be seen after continuous usage for at least a yr .i m not willing to take this risk for the sake of hair.</p>
              <p>n also it seldom cause hair to grow, wad it does is mostly slow down the rate of hairloss n at the best stop it. at my present condition, i would need to grow hair</p>
              <p>minoxid- there is a initial stage of hair shedding. i already got so littte hair, if i shed n it doesn grow back, wad can i do? n also its know to cause dandruff n itch.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>from wad i see. any type of  approved  medication n spray used to treat hairloss has side effects n contra-indications. there isnt a safe soln to hairloss</p>

              <p>my friend's hair looks natural leh. Initially a little stiff but looks so natural now. Go offer yourself to their hair transplant companies and ask for sponsorship. But if it's not your cup of tea, then I'm afraid there's not much u can do against nature.</p>
              <p>My dad started losing hair in his late 20s and he has never solved the problem even after 30 years. So there u go.</p>

              <p>Eh hello, at least be glad that you are NOT a cancer patient yourself. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>I once knew a girl from my JC who was given special permission to wear a hat. Why? Because all her radiotherapy treatments were making her lose her hair. Can you at least show some respect for cancer patients, and be glad you never had to go through what cancer patients have to go through?!?!? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="icon_rolleyes.gif"></p>
              <p>And be glad that you are a guy, and that society is more accepting of bald men than bald women. If you cannot be yandao like Leonardo DiCaprio, then at least you can be yandao like Jason Statham.</p>
              <p>Yes, some girls find baldness to be a turnoff. But some girls find it sexy as well. How did Wayne Rooney find a girl and get married even though he's already balding at the age of 24? If women can't accept your baldness, then they're not worth your time and effort.</p>
              <p>And guess what..... compared to balding, emo-ness is a greater turn-off for women.</p>
              <p>So get rid of your emo-ness already! It is a <strong>very</strong> serious turn-off! </p>

              <p>Hi Dexter,</p>
              <p>My sister just like you, prefer a more natural way of treating her hair loss which she's had for the past year. Few months back, she went for Neeta's Herbal. Their products are indian ayurvedic herbs, totally herbal &amp; nothing to consume.</p>
              <p>I started to see changes in her hair, she used to have bald patches on her scalp - she had alopecia areata. She kept combing her hair to hide those bald patches.</p>
              <p>After the 7th treatment, the bald patches gradually disappear.... She now has completed the 13th with them &amp; continue using the products for maintenance. Now the bald patches are gone as baby hair have grown in those areas....</p>
              <p>*First of all- avoid MSG in your diet, especially when you eat out.</p>
              <p>*I also heard that green tea is good for hair grow, so drink loads of it.</p>
