Thus it seemed to be unconquerable. However, Hercules proved this to be false by breaking the lion's neck). Anyway, my Sun Sign is rather decently placed, having all the common positive characteristic like: affectionate, cheerful and being generally optimistic, thus I don't believe in the one-man island thingy.<br><br>However, I believe in the need for inner peace; our personal ground, space and air we all need from time to time. We have relationship with people, simultaneously, we are also having relationship with ourselves. Aries Moon may seemed like I have an aggressive spirit, quick temper, direct and probably impulsive. However this is completely neutralized by my 4th house placing and having Trine to Uranus in 11th house. My moon sign is not afflicted in any ways as well.<br><br>Through Secondary Progression, my Ascendant is moving towards the Sign of Aquarius; I am feeling the transformation of Aquarius's effect: Eccentric, unusual and different, comparing to the rigid, dull Capricorn ascendant in terms of outlook and outer personality - the mask to the real world.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's so cool to find people who understand astrology on a deeper level. Although i must admit i still have a long way to go in my understanding. I've an aries sun, virgo moon and cancer ascendant. These traits seem to have make be prefer being alone, not by choice, but i feel it's because my cancer ascendant yearns for connection with people of like minds due to my being motivated by feelings. My virgo moon causes my personality to be extremely analytical and serious so much so that people have called me serious many times.I guess being unable to let go at anytime is a problem i have.I enjoy the company of like minds and i believe that one of the most beautiful conversations is silence between people who understand each other on a fundamental level.<br><br>I guess i'm a paradox,with people i enjoy being with i can talk on a vast variety of topics as my virgo moon craves knowledge and intellectual stimulation.I am proudest of my library. Being cancer by nature makes me a collector and sentimental.Having a virgo moon means i have an analytical mind which craves to understand the finer points of everything.Having my saturn in the 3rd house does nothing but furthers my quest for understanding and knowledge.In fact i have so many books on so many topics from astrology to finance that whenever i want something i'm secure(cancer ascendant)in the knowledge that i can reach out into my library and get the info,if not i can go online to find it.<br><br>But i've digressed.So while i'm with people who i can talk to i can really talk and stretch my mind because i enjoy that.If not i am usually silent and will not utter a word,choosing to observe the people around me.Sometimes i like it, but prolong silence just drives me mad,not sure if anyone would understand but sometimes you just yearn to have someone who understands what you are trying to say,who can relate.<br><br>Being a loner can be a beautiful thing in itself.In my humble opinion a balance must be struck,sometimes we're with people who understand,at others we are alone.Too much of anything is bad.However i feel it's important that we interact with people who understand to have any meaningful connection.I guess having my traits makes me want to have a deep connection as i've mentioned earlier it's just me being serious by nature.<br><br>I guess loners would usually have a lot of time to have thought about a lot of issues through in life.I've been drawn to zen because of my need to transcend my attachments.The beauty of astrology in understanding oneself cannot be overstated.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> [/quote]</div>
