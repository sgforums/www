            <div class='col-md body'>I've been a loner most of my life..... maybe because I used to get bullied a lot when I was younger. My father would scold me even more when I told him I got bullied..... apparently he's ashamed of the fact that I'm weaker than others.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>So in the end I kept mostly to myself...... I reasoned, no point making friends if they're going to bully me.<br><br>Eventually I realised..... it's not fun being alone all the time. Sure, in being a loner I spared myself from the difficulties of being with people......all the troubles, all the hassles...... all the grief.<br><br>However, I decided that sometimes it's better to have someone by your side. There's no point in having so many achievements and so many experiences if you're not going to share them with anyone.<br><br>So I came out of my shell and got to know people.... and I am all the better for it. I am now happier and more contented with my life.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>As for the bullies..... good riddance.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, me a loner too. I also seldom starts talks or even approach people to talk.. plus my face always black black .. nt as if i want it..my face born liddat mah.. so people often take me as act cool or wadever which i dont really bother about now..that's y i dont have friends in that sense..<br><br>You can say that loners are losers, which I also think so, as i really want to make friends with others .. well, friends are very important in our life, second to family.<br><br>But what makes your friend a true friend?.. during my sec sch times, i had this bunch of friends who played basketball. on the surface, we looked as if we're all good friends..but behind my back, who would know how they insult me? saying my bball skills sux and such, .. even i m not good in bball, it doesnt means i do not have any pride and have to take such insult..<br><br>Then during sec 3/4 i got seperated from the class and went to a new class, and non of my "friends" went to the same class so i'm on my own then..<br>i met this group of friends, who is kinda playful and sort of.. more active people.. at first they see me not happy..coz of my face again...all thought i xiao pai kia..then they 4 gang up and bully me..and that's the worst day i have in upper secondary.. but dont know y, after a month or so we becames friends, while some of their other friends still hates me.<br><br>I thought the worst was over, and finally met some friends with same interest as me ( yugioh, online games, and such ) .. but how would I thought they were speaking bad of me behind my back.. i once walk pass them without them noticing and i heard them saying i was a dog who was following their "gang" ..<br><br>They were treating me like a DOG! I was so sincere in making friends with them, even tho some of them hated me, i tried to be friendly and hope we can be friends, but in the end i ended up as a dog for 2 yrs...<br><br>Now we've finish our Os and waiting for results..and since sch end, we never keep in contact, or say nv speak to each other, even in msn..<br><br>It's like everybody i met till now, are all only hi and bye friends..and it's only the secondary school.. think my poly life will be much more worst ..<br><br>Since sec4 period, altho i look as if i am still the old me, but i began not to trust people .. those who seems like ur friend will still betray you, talk bad about u .. i swear i didnt offended them, or have any bad blood with them, didnt know why they treat me like this..<br>There's only 1 person whom i will called as a friend, who took the time to told me when and where prom nite were held..and he was not 1 of the commitee who set up the prom nite..juz a friend who bother to tell me..well, tho i didnt go tho, as u can see..they didnt want me to go either..<br><br>So I prefer being a loner..rather than a dog..at least being a loner i will not take insults anymore... i dont trust people now... man, if i continue later i cry ar..too emotional..reflecting my sec sch life haha..</div>

My Sec 3 class for the most part hated me as well. Part of that was because I was a loner... they thought I was being arrogant and anti-social. Ok, maybe I was a little anti-social by being a loner but I am definitely not a snob. Anyway, they would isolate me, talk badly of me behind my back, etc, etc.<br><br>My voice only served to make things worse. You see, I'm a mixed Indian/Malay. Somehow when my voice broke it settled into a mild pseudo-Brit accent. My classmates all thought that I was making up my own accent. Gimme a break.... my elder brother has my voice. My two sisters also have slight accents in their voices..... Can't be we all trained our voices to have Brit accents rite?<br><br>Anyway, my coming out of the shell happily coincided with their waking up their bloody ideas. They realised (most of them, anyway) that they were being shallow in judging me based on my voice.<br><br>Life got much better after that..... I became happier, more content, and my grades went up as well.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
