Hence aft being rejected by frens/gf for like 999999 times, i began to cultivate the mentality that being alone is better. some reasons include:<br><br>1) one loves u more than urself<br>2) U can't be rejected if u are alone<br>3) U have nothin, so nothin to lose<br>4) Its already the worst, it can't get any worst...<br>5) Dun need to bother urself with "small talks", "clickin with ppl"<br></div>

You can't prevent it.  There will definitely be regrets in life, i believe.<br><br>Why are you so pessimistic?  Since relationships can be unstable, I believe frenships are more reliable and lasting.  I'm blessed, I have very caring and good frens around me.  They will always be around for me in times of need.<br><br>Money is always a sensitive issue.  Friendships cannot be measured by monetary terms.  Relatives might even fall out due to money issues, not to mention friens.<br><br>If you find yourself lack of frens, then it's time to reflect.  What have you done or given to your frens?

I will make a suitable companion to help him.'' So he took some soil from the ground and formed all the animals and all the birds. Then he brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and that is how they all got their names. So the man named all the birds and all the animals; but not one of them was a suitable companion to help him.<br>Then the Lord God made the man fall into a deep sleep, and while he was sleeping, he took out one of the man's ribs and closed up the flesh. He formed a woman out of the rib and brought her to him.</span><br><br>( nope, i'm not preaching. )<br><br>Hope this helps.<br></div>
