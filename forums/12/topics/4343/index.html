            <div class='col-md body'>Hello Zizi<br><br>Guys cheaper than gals? Or gals cheaper than guy? Hmmmm..... all i can say is that the statement is just too general lar...... There are some guys ard, who, like what u say, are cheapo (actually i think they really disgrace men!!! haha......), but on the other hand, there are also a group of gals who behave the same way.<br><br>Hmmm.... maybe i put it this way lar, usually guys have control over gals (in the past very lar now not so true as compared lor), but i am sure gers also like to have a bf who could take charge of certain things and have control...... at least, she can 'show' her friends that she have a MAN as a bf, and not a BOY. I am also sure that not much gers can take it when guys who can't take charge or in control of certain things, such as.....errrmmmmmm, can't decided even where to go or what to do that day. It may even be funny for me to say this but i believe some gers even will like it when her bf actually 'scold' her for doing something wrong, at least it prove that the guy is sensible and cares for her.....i think, heh....... this is also a form of control over the ger, agrees?<br><br>Its human nature for a person, be it a guy or a gal, to cover up something that they done which is not rite, such as flirting. Not only guys will give all crap excuses lar, i believe gers will too. Like i say, its human nature. But think the only difference is that when a guy flirt ard, they risks and danger they face is definitely less than a ger...... cos normally its the gers who 'chi kui' one...... and of cos, i have to emphasised, not all guys flirt!!! haha........<br><br>So, whos cheaper? Really have to depends lar, cannot use a bamboo to overturn all the pple on the boat.<br><br>------------------<br>nOthiNg iS ImpOsSibLE In tHiS wOrLd<br>EvEn tHe wOrD ImPoSsiBLe SaYs "i'M pOsSiBLe"</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Haha...<br>Thanks Atti for his/her reply<br>I do agree wif u too.But sometimes gers dun really like their bf to control small things like where to go or wat to do next.Coz some guys onli care about their own feeling to do things.For instance guys who like to play game will usual hangout in the arcade.So if guys were to decide where to go,keke...They will for sure want to go to the arcade to play game.So how about her gf?Wat do u think?In the other hand if gals dun gif their opinion when being ask by their bf when he ask where u wanna go.If there wasn't any answer from the gal his bf might b angry coz he might think tat small little thing u also cannot decide how are u going to success in life?Isn't it?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hello ZiZi,<br><br>Ermmm b4 i began my next msg again, just to let u know Atti is a guy lar......  :p<br><br>Okie, here i go again, heh...... errmmmm, of cos, nobody in this world like to be restricted badly, or in every way or every small thing you do. E.g, if i have a gf, i don't mind she controlled the amount of beer or liqour i have (cos this show she cared for me mah), but i wonldn't like it too if she dun let me drink at all. The same goes for her, if i got a gf who went drinking, i dun mind, but if i found out that she actually over shot her limit, of cos i will control her b4 she got drunk.<br><br>Errrmmm not all guys are the same as u mentioned abt in the 'arcade' example lar. Sorry to say, maybe yr current bf is one lor but i dun see many such guys ard. Yes there are lor but not a lot. Maybe u just haven't met such guys yet.........<br><br>(Okie shall end here cos hopping to yr next topic  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> ) Take care!<br><br>------------------<br>nOthiNg iS ImpOsSibLE In tHiS wOrLd<br>EvEn tHe wOrD ImPoSsiBLe SaYs "i'M pOsSiBLe"</div>

Therefore, to b happy in a relationship, communication is very impt.  I agree that ometimes the guy make the gal angry without realising it, but if u dun tell the guy, how is he suppose to know u r angry, agreed?
