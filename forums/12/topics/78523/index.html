A guy and a gal agree to write on that piece of paper. When it starts, both are excited, as it?s their time working together.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> They fill up the paper with the best of things they can think of.<br>Sometimes the guy writes more, sometimes the gal writes more.<br>Some people write without thinking much, some writes after some thought.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> As the writing carries on, it gets more &amp; more tiring. The couples have to be motivated to keep on writing. This is the commitment and responsibility of a relationship. As long as the urge to write continues, the writing will never end. It will carry on paper after paper until pen?s ink run out. This is the eternal love till deaths do us apart?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Some couples prefer to write together, some write their own &amp; combine the efforts. Neither side should be the one only one writing; else ink may get blocked for the party who writes non-stop. Too tired?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The character of the person is like the handwriting on the paper?<br>Everyone has his or her handwriting. It is very difficult to change one?s handwriting. Not impossible but it takes a lot of time and hard work.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The outcome may not be desirable. It is also difficult to imitate the handwritings of another person. The most one can do is to be tidier or many untidy in their handwritings. Sometimes, to make the writing on the paper look more presentable, it could be necessary for either side to slightly alter the style of his/her handwritings?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> A mistake in love is like a smudge on the paper? Whether purposely or accidently a smudge is a smudge. No matter how well the writing has gone. So far or how lovely is the content, a smudge will leave a mark no matter how well you cover it (eraser, liquid paper, etc..). Whether to keep on writing will depend on the perception of the couple. Whether they mind the content more or the outlook of the piece of work more.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Worst case is when the paper is torn. It?ll leave a very ugly mark.

Many reasons can lead to this ending. One party could be the one writing non-stop and really too tired to carry on anymore. One party or both could be unsatisfied with the content or really dislike what each other is writing (it takes time to know the writing style of someone, it could be halfway through the paper before it is known). Or a smudge exists and either one or both mind (depend on their level of perfectionism). Or it could be what they are writing and what they are contradiciting each other. It can also be the case where one party finds another partner to write with?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Other analogies? Pen users are serious lovers. Those who use pencil like to test things out first. Some even write drafts with other people (many timers). After a breakup, a photocopy of writings so far is made and this is given to a party while the other keeps the original (for memories). Or it could be either or neither will keep the writings. It could also be the original work lies there waiting for the original writers to be back.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> A well-doned masterpiece could be bound into a book and kept forever. Likewise in some cases, it may be pieces of paper lying around. Different people write different things and have different outcomes. In the case of people going through many relationships, it?s just like changing partners to work with.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Some may write things according to the past experiences or have new ideas.

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jolin80:</div><div class="quote_body"><span style="color: violet;">Love is like 2 people filling up a piece of paper?</span><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> A relationship starts off as a clear piece of paper. A guy and a gal agree to write on that piece of paper. When it starts, both are excited, as it?s their time working together.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> They fill up the paper with the best of things they can think of.<br>Sometimes the guy writes more, sometimes the gal writes more.<br>Some people write without thinking much, some writes after some thought.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> As the writing carries on, it gets more &amp; more tiring. The couples have to be motivated to keep on writing. This is the commitment and responsibility of a relationship. As long as the urge to write continues, the writing will never end. It will carry on paper after paper until pen?s ink run out. This is the eternal love till deaths do us apart?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Some couples prefer to write together, some write their own &amp; combine the efforts. Neither side should be the one only one writing; else ink may get blocked for the party who writes non-stop. Too tired?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The character of the person is like the handwriting on the paper?<br>Everyone has his or her handwriting. It is very difficult to change one?s handwriting. Not impossible but it takes a lot of time and hard work.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> The outcome may not be desirable. It is also difficult to imitate the handwritings of another person. The most one can do is to be tidier or many untidy in their handwritings. Sometimes, to make the writing on the paper look more presentable, it could be necessary for either side to slightly alter the style of his/her handwritings?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> A mistake in love is like a smudge on the paper? Whether purposely or accidently a smudge is a smudge. No matter how well the writing has gone. So far or how lovely is the content, a smudge will leave a mark no matter how well you cover it (eraser, liquid paper, etc..). Whether to keep on writing will depend on the perception of the couple. Whether they mind the content more or the outlook of the piece of work more.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Worst case is when the paper is torn. It?ll leave a very ugly mark. Well, the decision lies with the couple?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> To break-off is to stop writing? Many reasons can lead to this ending. One party could be the one writing non-stop and really too tired to carry on anymore. One party or both could be unsatisfied with the content or really dislike what each other is writing (it takes time to know the writing style of someone, it could be halfway through the paper before it is known). Or a smudge exists and either one or both mind (depend on their level of perfectionism). Or it could be what they are writing and what they are contradiciting each other. It can also be the case where one party finds another partner to write with?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Other analogies? Pen users are serious lovers. Those who use pencil like to test things out first. Some even write drafts with other people (many timers). After a breakup, a photocopy of writings so far is made and this is given to a party while the other keeps the original (for memories). Or it could be either or neither will keep the writings. It could also be the original work lies there waiting for the original writers to be back.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> A well-doned masterpiece could be bound into a book and kept forever. Likewise in some cases, it may be pieces of paper lying around. Different people write different things and have different outcomes. In the case of people going through many relationships, it?s just like changing partners to work with.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Some may write things according to the past experiences or have new ideas. While writing, the couples may change their pens. In a new relationship, one party might mind that his or her partner?s pen has been used by other people before.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_exclaim.gif" alt="Exclamation" title="Exclamation"> It also requires both parties to play their part to keep the relationship forever lasting. You only live once. Ask yourself, what do you really want to do and achieve in life?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> If u are to use something describe a relationship wad will use <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_question.gif" alt="Question" title="Question"><br><br>Let?s think, learn &amp; share.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote>Wu Zhi Tian Shu?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
