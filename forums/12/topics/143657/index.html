            <div class='col-md body'>Dear C2on2,<br><br>For some reason, I have a feeling that you already know deep down what this means, but you're only seek to confirm your suspicions.  Either that, or you're hoping that someone here will tell you that there's hope, so that you can justify what you want to do (i.e. continue your fruitless pursuit?).  At the end of the day, if you're rejected, you can take comfort that somebody else told you to go for it?<br><br>No offence, but perhaps the best way to start growing up is to take responsibility for your actions.  You want to go on a wild goose chase hoping against hope that there's a chance, then go ahead.  But ultimately, if things don't work out the way you want, there's Nobody else to blame but yourself.  Remember, you CHOSE the path.<br><br>Notwithstanding the above, my advice is: the meaning is very clear.  The girl may Not be trying to make you wait, but is giving you a gentle hint to give up your pursuit.  If you don't have what it takes to be her guy, you don't have what it takes.  There must be feelings on her part...<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by c2on2:</div><div class="quote_body">If a gal u love deeply, but after your confession of feelings to her and asking if wanna go steady anot. but she reply "i duno" and u waited and waited for a few months and the answer is still "i duno".<br><br>asked her and she said "duno" is not rejection or acceptance.<br><br>and when she asked u to give her like 1yr plus of waiting time.<br><br>wat does it means?<br><br>pls give some advice.<br>many thanks</div></blockquote></div>

"if after the wait, she still dun give u a reply or a negative reply, can u handle this outcome?'....<br><br>I guess the decision of wat you want to do lies in the ans that ur heart is shouting out now... coz that may be wat ur heart yearns most... but u should noe that u must be mentally prepared for unexpected things which might come along the way....<br><br>In any case, give urself some time ... and when u starts to see a clearer picture, you may be able to make a better decision....<br><br>All the best...</div>
