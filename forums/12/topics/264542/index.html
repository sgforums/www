            <div class='col-md body'><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>GUIDELINES IN AUNT AGONY</strong></span><br><br><strong>I) Whenever possible, try not to post people's problem.</strong><br>If possible, introduce them to SGF AA and get them to post instead. Firstly, it's not very nice to post people's problems in a public forum like this? And even if they allow it, I believe that they are still the best person to relate their agony?<br><br><strong>II) If possible, write more... describe more... and explain more about your problem. </strong><br>Some people like to post their problem without giving sufficient information or leaving certain critical information out. It affects people's advice, because certain critical information affects the entire perspective altogether. Of course if there are things which you are not comfortable in revealing, you can opt not to. Or better still, you could PM some of the regulars, whom you can trust and speak to them.<br><br><strong>III) You don't have to write very well, but here's two tips that forumites in AA will be grateful for.  Paragraphing and do not alternative caps writing.</strong><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 1</span><br><br>Please paragraph if you are writing an essay.<br><br>E.g:<br><br>this is embarrassing to say because i have never actually made public in forums what i feel...i hope some of you can advise me quite reasonably and sensibly to the following situation.I met this guy through a girl friend of mine. I didn't feel anything towards him at first sight because quite honestly he is not goodlooking but pleasant enough. After he met me and we went out together(with friends), he told my friend that he thought i was cute. My friend is really good friends with him so she told me what he thought about me. The thing is that the term "cute" is used very loosely so....i don't know.. anyway, what happened next was he asked my friend for my ICQ #. We chat occasionally but i realized that recently he doesn't talk to me if i am online. Is he being shy? or has lost interest? am i just being too paranoid about what he thinks of me? Of course when i start a conversation with him he always replies back but why doesn't he try to start a convo with me first?<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tip 2</span><br><br>Do not attempt alternative caps writing style.<br><br>E.g:<br><br>PleAsE dO nOt wRitE likE tHat bEcAuSe It'S nOt OnlY dAmN bLoOdiE IrRitAtIng, iT aCtUaLLy AffEcTs PeOplE's mOoD iN giViNg pRoPer AdViCes. wOrSt wHen yOu CoMbiNe EsSay... ZeRo PaRaGrAphInG aNd AltErNatE CaPs TYpInG... ChAnCEs arE, yOu aRe UsUaLly fLaMed uNtiL yOu dO sOmeThIng aBouT iT.<br><br><strong>IV) Aunt Agony do not encourage gender bashing.</strong><br>Although it's a common sight in AA, like cats on the street - if possible keep it minimal? Same goes for overly religious discussion?<br><br><strong>VI) Topics out of hand, multiple entries or completely irrelevant are at high risk of being locked.</strong><br>If the topics is slightly off (non-AA related)... it shouldn't be much of an issue (E.g. Mushy Gang Chat topic) - although this is subjected to moderator's discretion.<br><br><strong>VII) No hijacking of thread. </strong><br>Try not to hijack problem threads by posting another problem in someone else's problem thread. Hijack by crapping is not encouraged as well.<br><br><strong>VIII) Aunt Agony ISN'T a replacement for professional counselling.</strong><br>Should you experience crisis that requires professional attention, please call any of the hotline available <a href="http://www.sgforums.com/?action=thread_display&amp;thread_id=238593" rel="nofollow"><strong>here</strong></a>.<br><br><strong>IX) Every poster is ACCOUNTABLE for their own advice. Likewise, every problem-seeker is ACCOUTABLE for whom they seek advice from.</strong><br>Aunt Agony is NOT responsible, should any mishap/misunderstanding/misdemeanour that arise from specific advice/s dispense by individuals. Aunt Agony is merely an online forum for people to air their problems. Aunt Agony is NOT responsible for anything OUTSIDE the boundary of Sgforums - Aunt Agony. Specific individual is responsible.<br><br>Outside the boundaries of Sgforums - Aunt Agony include (but not limited to): chat program/s of any sort (MSN/Yahoo Messenger/etc), contact numbers (Mobile/Office/Home/etc), emails/friendster/etc, personal address or any meet up in reality. The decision to diverge private information or to accept private meet-ups are solely based on one's discretion. Aunt Agony CANNOT be held responsible for anything outside it's own boundaries as stated above.<br><br><strong>X) To err is human - nobody is perfect.</strong><br>Aunt Agony is a thankless job and do give credits to people who have spent a portion of their time lending someone else a listening ear. Nobody's advice is superior than another - what's more important is the willingness to lend stranger/s on the other side of Singapore, a viritual hand to lift him/her spiritually.<br><br><strong>XI) Do not give out other people contacts.</strong><br>Like phone number, email address. This is to prevent the person from being spam, disturb.<br><br><strong>XII) Telling of Age Group.</strong><br>I guess alot of people will ask about the age group when you post a problem. Telling your age group will help as other will know what advice to give. Different Age group have different advice.<br>So do remember to post your age or age group espacially relationship problems.<br><br>Cheers<br><br>Pika: I got help to add and edit hor! Don't say i slack nia...</div>

I don't even think there is possibility for a end result out from studying astrology - even with my entire lifetime, this learning never cease because there's always something new to learn.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers    [/b]</blockquote>So do u think u control fate by the balls , or you let it grab u by the balls ? Then you got your east and your west. Both opposite in their ways but have some similiarities. So which are you ? or are you trying to get the best of both ? the most optimum solution ? I think u are more towards western.<br><br>Since there is no end result out of studying it , why even bother ? or is it the will and passion to go there and try , and look for newer things within it to learn more ?<br><br>But dont u think that looking through these 3rd house or 4th house is pretty much like narrowing down the problem or situation down to a more manageable size with a pre-planned outlook. So if thats the case , using astrology will give me a MORE accurate outlook at the particular individual in the business world ? lets say if its not above love , because i think its pretty much the same because how your relationship is , how u love can also show what kind of character you are , at least generally.</div>

Which is why, I will always refer whoever that PM me, asking me if I could do a reading for them, to both Zacken or Oceanos, simply because I am not a fortune teller. These two forumers are INTO this trade by profession; I am merely in for self discovery and higher learning.<br><br>If you are asking me if that gives me a more accurate picture or assessment of an individual; to me, if everything corroborate astrologically, it merely resolve my own doubts from questioning status quo of this ancient science. Take note that I am challenging status quo of this science because I choose not to feed from what I learn off books written by people ranging several hundred years ago till modern days.<br><br>When astrology tells me about the difficulty of marriage when Saturn is in 7th house - my mind would want to see the 'real thing' - someone with this influence, see if I get to speak with him/her and try to understand from normal dialogue on why has he land himself in such a situation OR if he has this influence, why was it not manifested or how has his freewill made his life easier to manage?<br><br>And why am I learning since there's no end to this?<br><br>Since when is there an end to learning?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Apologies if we don't share this sentiment because I have always thought that learning is forever. I always feel that I am inadequate because there's ONLY so much I can discover or learn in this short span of time here on Earth.<br><br>Anyway, I shall end my words here as I doubt this topic here is appropriate for such discussion. After all, the reason why I remove the previous guidelines is to clear all the chatting.<br><br>Thanks for sharing Maro.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Cheers</div>
