              <p>Why not try to understand his marital status and culture more
              before u date him?  Afterall u are working in the same
              place.  Plus just a pcs of advice, check and make sure that he
              and his family dun have the caste system mindset, most singaporean
              indian dun believe in this anymore, but most India indian must
              practice this, and if he or his family must have this mindset then
              honestly u can forget abt this relationship to workout.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Nothing wrong with dating plp for other races, but yes it
              is superficial if u want to date them becos they are different
              race? No, if u find that the person that suit u happen to be
              from diff. races.</p>

              <p>Wallie, u are welcome, sorry for missing the mauritius part.  I am not too sure do they still believe in the caste sys stuff and would advice u to check it out.  But just bear in mind culture diff. is just one small issue when u go into this relationship, there will be more issue coming out in the future like, how his/u family feel abt this.  Do he intend to return to Mauritius and are u prep to go with him, if he is ok to stay put here.  So many issues, but if both party is committed, thing will still workout.  As a matter of fact, I had known of a large number of interracial/international marriage btw sg guys/gals and foreigner guys/gays that workout fine.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Plus folks out there, pls dun be so nasty, she just asking a simple question, if u guys/gals out there dun intend to help, at the very least dun try to make fun.</p>

But when she opens her mouth - all the ah lian language and from her behavour and dressing - all the low class stuff. Low class as compared to the truly, white classy "Ang Mo' woman .<br><br> </p>

              <p>yeah, and and your statement is perfectly acceptable.</p>
              <p>i'm tired of dating men from my own race to tell the truth because i'm tired of hearing the same things at every date (think, bad conversation, and frog in well eye's view of the world). If one who is interesting comes along, i'd love to meet him. unfortunately i;m beginning to think the only reason i've dated them was because of familiarity. on the other hand, foreigners have a different view and perspective, and can somehow click.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i', prepared to draw flak from my post, but you posting flak has just proven m,y point, thank yu very much</p>

              <p><br> Dating guys from your own race is boring? So are you implying that
              your own race is an inferior race? What should be exciting
              then?  discrete sex? date rape? pregnancy before marriage? one
              night stand?<br> <br> Put it this way, a date is a date whether it is a date with a guy
              from your own race or a guy from another race. Dating man from
              another race does not necessarily make your dating more
              exciting or your life more exciting.<br> <br> Excitement is a state of mind. This state of mind is for you to
              control internally - from within yourself. Don't go around looking
              for excitment but fail to look within yourself. If you find guys
              from your own race boring, you are likely to find this Indian guy
              boring after sometime.<br> <br> Beneath the label of race, religion, culture lies a homo
              sapien. All man are man and all woman are woman. If your
              own race is capable of being boring, guy from the Indian race
              can also be capable of being boring.<br> <br> F<strong>ind a man who can share your interest, your dreams,
              your lifestyle.</strong> I can't think of a better word to
              describe well fed, pampered local woman - slutty is the word that
              comes to mind. </p>
