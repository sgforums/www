              <p>Since Chinese guys go for CMM &amp; VMM what's wrong with Chinese girls dating Indian or Malay guys instead of Ang Mos??? Not everyone likes Ang Mos ok</p>
              <p>Anyway if you haven't already noticed, there are more and more Singaporeans of mixed heritage.</p>

              <p>expanding the gene pool my ass. i'm for multi-racialism and multi-culturalism, but chinese should be with chinese (put nicely, in that sense, i'm a right-winger/conservative although my political inclinations are centrist-left). it's not an inconsistent or hypocritical view. and i think many indians/malays share similar sentiments. i've been to a chinese-malay wedding before - both sides family face black black, and the poor chinese girl had to convert to islam to the disappointment of her parents, without doing anything for the relationships with her in-laws. lol</p>

              <p><br>i agree. on this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one issue</span>, i'm <span style="text-decoration: underline;">strictly</span> right-wing. otherwise, i'm centre-left (e.g. i am pro-choice, and for the recognition of rights of gay people). like i said, i can't explain why either - it's an irrational thinking on my part that is inherent in me. it's like why some guys like breasts over ass, and others ass over breasts.</p>
              <p>btw, if you're ok with interracial relationship that does not require parties to convert to any specific denomination, you are centre-right.</p>

                                indians/malays share similar sentiments. i've been to a
                                chinese-malay wedding before - both sides family face black
                                black, and the poor chinese girl had to convert to islam to the
                                disappointment of her parents, without doing anything for the
                                relationships with her in-laws. lol</p>
                                <p>thankfully, so far, it's just ugly chinese girls with
                                indian/malay guys. otherwise sian.</p>

              <p><br>what of my previous posts do you not understand? it doesn't affect me. people can do whatever they want with their lives. ppl can go fuck a pig and i still wouldn't give a shit.</p>
              <p>sure i give disapproving stares and pass nasty remarks behind their backs (hey, this is the internet, no need for me to be politically correct), but it doesn't affect me at all.</p>
              <p>note carefully, my posts so far have been on the general issue of interracial r'ships. not on the TS or any couple in particular.</p>

              <p><br>i agree. on this <span style="text-decoration: underline;">one issue</span>, i'm <span style="text-decoration: underline;">strictly</span> right-wing. otherwise, i'm centre-left (e.g. i am pro-choice, and for the recognition of rights of gay people). like i said, i can't explain why either - it's an irrational thinking on my part that is inherent in me. it's like why some guys like breasts over ass, and others ass over breasts.</p>
              <p>btw, if you're ok with interracial relationship that does not require parties to convert to any specific denomination, you are centre-right.</p>
              <p>on a side note: i'm a breasts man - junk in the trunk, nty. i like my girls to fit in w24 bettina lianos.</p>

              <p>Hope i am not wrong, this have nothing to do with gender and skin color, i assume u are a chinese guy which mean u will be ok with a taiwan/china/hk/sg chinese gal.  But u won't consider even any other race like korean/jap/viet gal etc...</p>
