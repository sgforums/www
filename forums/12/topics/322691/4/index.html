              <p><br>We?? oh, God forbid, we are like Rojak, so damn mixed up, to tell u the truth, most of us lost our identity already, there is no focus in our culture, or so call Singapore culture, cos the govt paradigm shift is so fast, eg follow switzerland lifestyle, then take on China economic, then invest in India, exchange program with Americans, wha lau, work like tha japanese,  unreasonable and sometime inhuman, i feels that they are running a corporation with machineries rather than a country with humans. I cannot even speak my dialect with proficiency but i can speak Malay and thais due to my nature of work here. So funny.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>So, in the end, we younger ones lack of direction in term of our cultures, a mix of hollywood stuff, MTV hip hop, joo chiat ah pek, bak kut teh, jack place,  laksa, Serangoon style, canto pub, hokkien ktv, Guan Yim Ma temple, methodist church, hotel 81,..race course road indian temple, sri..man north indian crusine, orchard rd trendy..etc etc..and in the end, i agree that sometime, i hv to ask myself, Who am I? or Are they making us look like a fool?</p>

              <p>Anyway, a seemingly harmless post seeking opinions on inter-racial relationships turned into a disastrous debate of races and gender. Honestly, I don't find her remarks of "boring experiences with local men" insulting at all. Some people like new experiences, and it's not that she is trying to seduce a foreigner to get a citizenship, materialistic gains or whatever.</p>
              <p>I'm chinese and have dated many white women when I was living in the States. Despite what 4sg thinks, there wasn't any ulterior motive but just plain mutual attraction. Even though they've great personalities, I wouldn't go to the extend to say whites are superior in any way.  In fact, the Chinese have many morals and cultures that are, in my opinion, deemed more acceptable in a society. I suppose 4sg is uptight due to his own insecurities and low self-esteem.</p>

              yeah i just wanted to step out of the comfort zone. i've always found people from all races attractive in their own ways, just that i had not gone out dating with someone non-chinese before, and I wanted to try. and i'm happy i tried. I shall continue to be more open since stepping out of the comfort zone is not so difficult.
