              <p>firstly, 4.5mil is incorrect, because you have to take into consideration the female gender, you have to take into consideration people not my age range, you have to take into consideration married/attached peep, you have to take into consideration teenagers and children (sorry i'm no cradle snatcher), and last but not least, the PR's and foreigners, then multiply that by 0.77. when you have done your sums, you will find that the eligible pool of chinese local men for a woman in her 20s has shrunk considerably from your quoted figure of 4.5mil, which I didn';t feel like arguing against when you first mentioned it, because it was so absurd, but you quoting this figure again made me feel that you should be taught a thing or two about being able to do simple primary school mathematics.</p>

              <p><br>Hi Lazybumy<br><br>I have notice something about the young generation of men and women. In the age of multi-racialism, growing number of ppl are afraid to identify with their own race. Some are even growing up, thinking their own race as inferior.<br><br>Chinese who thinks their culture, habit as inferior - and so on and forth.<br>Indian who refuses to learn and speak their language - and so on and forth.<br>Malay who refuses to practice their custom and way of life - and so on and forth.<br><br>Nothing wrong with embracing multi-racialism. Indeed, multi-racialism is one of our modern strength. But the greater pillar of our society comes from our own backyard -our own custom, religion and language.

              <p>I've been viewing this thread with some pinch of salt.</p>
              <p>Well, I'd say that Singapore is having some kind of artificial mulicuturalism. You may be partially right that people here are getting a bit, let's say, repelled by certain people where their ancestors come from. With the torrents of "foreign talents" coming in, this will only get worse. It's human nature. Too much a good thing can become a bad thing.</p>
              <p>For the record, I would like to say there's a lot of myopic closed minded people. I can't even begin to fathom the stupidity of some of the questions that people have asked me because my hubby is a different ethnic group. At the end of the day it just pisses me off, and I can't wait to leave Singapore with him.</p>

              <p>Ppl everywhere sure got some form of racialism or name calling. I agree with u that sometimes asian women are looked down upon by the White. But my point with goes back to the initial point I said woman here and developed countries and not about the word 'Chick'. <br><br>My observation in oversea, esp Europe, US and Japan is that the majority of the woman carried themselves ralatively better than our local's. In term of dressing, manner and outlook. <br><br>Me - no sense of humour - there goes another with a stereotype of me again .... sigh...haven't I lighten you up with a joke about your QQ? </p>

              <p><br>Actually, we are only generalising pples out of our life, not fair to others ya, but still there lies so many good men and women who are gracious, nice and with a good heart. Perhap, you are the one good guy.</p>

              <p>But i take it as kind reflection, i dun mind pple here f me or scold me like hell, cos i take it as a reflection, somewhere, somehow, i must hv strike their nerves hard,...it show that if u throw it hard, the reflection will be harder..that i have learned to accept, if not, i will not post here. That is the way we should at thing, ask ourselves why we get f'ed, then for me, a joker, I hv admit that at time I teased pple overboard. We all have different opinons due to our background, upbringing, contact, social life, career and culture. I understand that perfectly.</p>
