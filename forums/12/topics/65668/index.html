If can, try to improve the situation, if not, maybe a breakup would be better. But I guess improving the situation will be a uphill ride for you based on her characters. Anyway, before you comment on her characters, do also reflect on things you have done ... I dun think that faults will only come from one party ... Maybe there are things which would have worked out better if you had chose otherwise. Good luck bro.</div>

Her quarrels and scoldings are a result of her unhappiness. You expect her to support you as a gf, but have you love and cared for her as a bf? everyone recieves and gives love in their own way, it seems the way she recieves love is different from the way you give it. try to find out how she recieves love and let her know how u want to be loved too. If both can give love the way the other party recieves it, then things will get better.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>lotsa my fren told me to juz break up la.. since it seems tt it's not working out.... for me: break up is also good! more freedom... can see girls or go out with friends-who-are-girl without guilty feeling.. nobody check on u.. nobody scold u for this and tt (right guys?  ) ... i won't die if she ask me to break up w her la.... hehe.... but then.. i also think of her feeling.. how if i ask for a break up? will i hurt her or sumthing?<br></strong></blockquote>no one dies from breakups. they die from chosing to end their lives. if she is dispensible to you then what is the point of continuing? please do not continue a relationship just becos you feel "responsibility towards her" or "afraid to hurt her feelings". you will end up hurting her and yourself even more. All breakups will hurt, there is no escape from that.<br><br><blockquote><strong><br>When we're not in the fighting mode... she always ask when we're getting married (funny hor..hehe...) and this happen many times. I dun really like to be asked this question at this point of time..... coz now still to eaerly to talk abt all this...and she also like to force me to want to stay together with her ASAP.... but i'm against staying together before marriage... if i say no ah.. whalau eh.. sky fall down on me and i start kanna blah blah liao...<br></strong></blockquote>my guess is that she thinks things will get better if both if you are under one roof, finally get to see you everyday, etc. but it is clear you are not ready for that so don't. i support your stand on not staying together and "being a proud male v". not easy woah...<br><br>Have a heart to heart talk with her and like yunhaier said - have understanding and compromise. There is still hope.<br><br>may things turn out well for you.</div>

I think end of the day, you should think if you can live your rest of your life wif her ... If can, try to improve the situation, if not, maybe a breakup would be better. But I guess improving the situation will be a uphill ride for you based on her characters. Anyway, before you comment on her characters, do also reflect on things you have done ... I dun think that faults will only come from one party ... Maybe there are things which would have worked out better if you had chose otherwise. Good luck bro.</div></blockquote>Thanks bro.. I like your advise... reallly have to check both parties' attitude..<br><br>Cheers and... dun be so sad leh.. why sadsadguy?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>
