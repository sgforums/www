If it is an ultra obvious botch and no amount of cover up can cover it , then successful.

What do you expect? Sue every doctor just because you are not happy with the service?<br><br>There is a balance . As I told you , in Singapore , there are cases where doctors got sued for blatant negligence. And so far you have not given me your case scenario or details related to this charge . You have only said you heard from many foreigners - no details , nothing. Do you expect to have credibility at all?<br><br>If you don't like your doctor , change. Singapore is not USA or the UK. If he has been negligent in his duty of care - complain to the hospital ( if you are being treated in the hospital) ,Medical Board and then take your case to a lawyer. If he forgot to tell you there is a risk to something and you incur that risk , there is a recourse for action.<br><br>Don't give me the foreigners vs local arguments. For every foreigner claiming to be discriminated against , I can bring in one who says otherwise. Don't even pull our police force into this argument.<br><br>If you do not like Singapore and choose to make such superfluous remarks , why did you bother to even enter Singapore in the first place? Don't go to the former british colonies since you view them with disdain . Stay in your own country and get your special treatment.<br><br><strong> So tell me - which country you came from so that we can see how much<br><span style="font-style: italic;">greater </span> the justice system there  is compared to Singapore, USA, and UK. </strong></div>
