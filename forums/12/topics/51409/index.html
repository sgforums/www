            <div class='col-md body'>Ken has fallen in love with May, who already has a boyfriend...<br><br>Ken and May are very good friends. Their strange relationship blossomed when both of them tried to console each other about their individual relationships long ago. Ken was very sad when his ex-girlfriend broke off with him, and May was the one who kept consoling him, spending time with him...<br><br>Not long after, May told Ken that she actually used to like him... but in fact when she told him that time... she still has feelings for him. Just that May had a boyfriend then, which turned rocky after near to 3 years... The reason May didn't tell Ken about her feelings is she was sure that Ken wouldn't like her. She was right.<br><br>Ken told her, that she wasn't really his type. And if they were to be together... he definitely won't treat her as well... May then replied with something that touched him. She said she wouldn't mind. Ken is a man of principles, he knew very well that he wouldn't interfere a relationship, moreover, when her boyfriend is his friend.<br><br>Shortly after, May went overseas to pursue her studies. At the airport, before she left, she wanted a hug from Ken. Although he promised, but there wasn't a chance for both of them to hug. She left disappointingly.<br><br>Her relationship with her boyfriend finally stopped shortly after her departure. May felt that she has gave in enough. However May, who is a very dependant girl, one who fears loneliness, found herself a new boyfriend over there. When this news got to Ken, he felt uneasy, not really jealousy, but just uncomfortable. Though he knew that May isn't that flirtatious kind, just one that needs plenty of care and love.<br><br>May came back, for a short holiday recently, with her and his boyfriend nearing their first anniversary. Ken and her met up. He stayed over at May's house with a girl friend of May. They chatted quite a lot, updating each other about their lives. The friend was already asleep. Ken hugged May. A hug that he felt that he owed her... excuse? Shrugs. Nothing else.<br><br>Ken realised that May's attitude towards him is rather changed. He thought he knows why. He knows that May grew insensitive towards him because she is sort of avoiding him. Not giving herself a single chance that she will do something wrong. Ken is very sure. But deep down, he knows that everything is so much different... especially after that hug... though both of them, especially May treated as if nothing has ever happenend.<br><br>Ken is very vexed and moody. He hates it. But he can't stop it. He misses May badly, but he can't do much. Near to nothing at all. He thought of dropping hints or even asking May about everything he wanted to know. He refrained. He is still sticking to his principles, though he very much wanted to bend them all right now...<br><br>May is flying off soon, back overseas. Very soon. Ken's last message to her was that he will miss her a lot. As a pal? A buddy? Or something more than that? No reply. Both of them know they share a unique relationship... something more than close friends, nothing near a couple. He knows what he should do. He should just make sure she stays happy as she is right now, and wish her all the best... as a very close friend.</div>
