            <div class='col-md body'>Bear with me fellow members,<br>As u all know, i got retrenched just before CNY <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  Things have been downhill since, but whenever i come to this forum, it never fails to cheer me up, the fake nippon, the bangla and all the craps that are posted here. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  However, certain things have surface which is starting to irritate me (u guys are free to comment if u think that i'm being over-sensitive) I married a Viet wife. Yes it's true. Am married for 5 years plus. NOT through those agency. In the begining, things were good. I dun have a very high education but i'm the very adventurous type who try not to work for ppl instead be my own boss. But failed in quite a few attemps already. Initially she understand the risk I was taking, but now, I think she's had it.... Told me she this evening that she got a job as a clerk for a seafood company in VIETNAM! Damnit, that's given me the impression that, erm... t's like she gave up on me providing for her needs. I mean how much can she earn there? Was told about USD150 per month. I think it's really obvious liao... aiyah, i feel like telling her if she thinks that way, then we should just end it...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br>Btw i have no regrets marrying her... she is a good girl. it's just that....</div>

I think that in singapore, even with a dip or degree, also not guranteed a better life what say me? If dun 'chung yi chuang' I'll still be a normal person leading a limited life.

Problem is he needs a wife who must be willing to accept for who he is and also perhaps a minimum agreement on what he needs to ensure even if he fails.<br><br>I have a friend who go into business as well, but he ensures that he set certain amount of $$ aside to make sure basic needs like roof, food, eletricity and water is catered for. His wife has been supportive of him all these while and had even quit her job to help him out.<br><br>A marriage is not about the guy alone. But neither is it about the girls alone too. It should be the acceptance of each other, be it in luxury or in poverty. A guy is inconsiderate if he does not considers the family need while going into business. A girl is inconsiderate if she leaves the guy the moment he is not doing well.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Divorce or Not, I have a touching story to share with you.<br><br>One fine day, an old couple around the age of 70, walked into a lawyer's<br>office. Apparently, they were there to file a divorce.<br><br>The lawyer was very puzzled and after having a chat with them, he finally<br>got their story... This couple had been quarrelling in all their 40 over<br>years of marriage. Nothing ever seemed to be right. They held onto their<br>marriage for the sake of their children, afraid that it might affect their<br>up-bringing. Now that all their children have already grown up and have<br>their own family, there was nothing else the old couple has to worry<br>about. All they wanted is to lead their own life free from all these years<br>of unhappiness from their marriage, so both of them agreed on a divorce.<br><br>The lawyer had a hard time trying to get their papers done, as he could<br>not understand why at the ripe age of 70 the old couple would still insist<br>on a divorce after 40 years of marriage.<br><br>While they were signing the papers, the wife told the husband, "I really<br>love you, but I really can't carry on anymore. I'm sorry."<br><br>"I'm fine with it, I understand." said the husband. Looking at this, the<br>lawyer suggested a dinner together, just the three of them. The wife<br>thought to herself "Why not, since they are still friends."<br><br>At the dining table, there was an awkward silence.<br><br>The first dish served was roasted chicken and immediately, the old man<br>took the drumstick for the old lady. "This is for you, it is your<br>favourite."<br><br>Seeing this, the lawyer thought maybe there was still a chance, but the<br>wife was frowning when she answered, "That's the problem with you. You<br>always think so highly of yourself, and you never consider on how I feel.<br>Don't you know that I simply hate drumsticks?"<br><br>Little did she know that, over the years, the husband had been trying all<br>his means to please her. Little did she know that drumsticks were actually<br>her husband's favourite. Little did he know that she never thought he<br>understood her at all. Little did he know that she hated drumsticks, even<br>though all he wanted was the best for her.<br><br>That night, both of them could not sleep. They tossed and turned<br>continuously in their own beds. After a few hours, the old man could not<br>take it anymore. He knew that he still loved her, and he cannot carry on<br>with his life without her. He wanted her back badly and he sincerely<br>wanted to tell her that he is sorry. He wanted to tell her "I love you".<br><br>He picked up the phone and started to dial her number. The phone never<br>stopped ringing. He never stopped dialing.<br><br>On the other hand, she was sad. She could not understand why after all<br>these years together, he still did not understand her at all. She loved<br>him a lot, but she just cannot take it anymore. The phone rang. She<br>refused to pick up the phone, knowing that it was from him. "What is the<br>point of talking, now that it is over between us? I have asked for it and<br>I just want to keep it this way," she thought to herself. The phone was<br>still ringing. Finally, she decided to pull out the cord.<br><br>Little did she remember that he had heart problem.<br><br>Early next morning, she received news that he had passed away. She rushed<br>down to his apartment, and saw his body lying on the couch still holding<br>on to the phone. He had a heart attack, while trying desperately to get<br>through her phone line.<br><br>One night after the funeral, while clearing his belongings, she came<br>across an insurance policy that was dated from the day they got married,<br>with her as the sole beneficiary. There was a note in the policy file:<br><br>"To my dearest wife, by the time you read this, I will no longer be<br>around. I bought this policy for you, even though the amount is only<br>$100,000. I hope it will keep the promise that I had made when we got<br>married. I might not be with you anymore, but I want this money to take<br>care of you on my behalf, just like the way I would if I could live<br>longer. I just want you to know that I will always be with you. I love<br>you."<br><br>Tears flowed down the old lady's cheeks like river.<br><br>I know this story might be too heart-rending for a beautiful Valentine's<br>Day like today, but I hope it would remind all of us not to take our loved<br>ones for granted. Never be afraid to express your true feelings when you<br>are with them. Tell them nicely if any of their actions or words upsets<br>you. Say it while you still can. Don't wait till you lose them before you<br>start to regret the ways that you have treated them. Time and tide waits<br>for no man. Life is simply too short for us to fill it with regret and<br>remorse.<br><br>Meanwhile, not to forget "domo balentan o yuroshiku<br>itashimasu" (Happy Valentine's Day).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br></div>
