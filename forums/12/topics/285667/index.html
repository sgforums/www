            <div class='col-md body'>Haha.. After reading the few post up here in sgforums.. I feel tat my prob is v insignficant.. Yet.. I jus feel so frustrated.. I need a vent to let out!<br><br>Now working for abt a year le.. In a clinic as a nurse..<br><br>I reali dunno why but i feel extremely unhappy.. Esp each time it's a sun.. I got the sun blues.. I jus feel so down that the nx dae is mon &amp; i got to go work.. &amp; up crying in my bf arms..<br><br>Jus hate the feelin so much tat i could change from totally enjoying in the dae time to a sunken lifeless person.. I can't slp.. coz i dun wan the nite to end..<br><br>This is my 1st job.. I've no experience anywhere at all.. Thus.. I'm always so afraid of my boss.. Speak to her v softly.. Haha..  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>But thing is.. She tends to "bully" mi.. Mayb i more kid &amp; one of the youngest in the clinic.. My other colleague.. She is a year older than mi.. But she is more streetwise and have worked b4 abt 4 years.. So the way she talk is much more mature than mi.. Boss all talk to them show then respect..<br><br>Whenever she speaks to mi.. Not all the time.. But most of the time she is the harshest to mi.. N alot of things pick on mi.. Mayb coz i'm the nurse there.. Gonna tampa become her personal assistance as well..<br><br>There is alot of work for mi to handle.. From clinical.. sometimes personal..<br><br>I dunno.. Mayb to compare with alot others.. This stress is v minimal.. trivial.. To mi.. I jus hate the fact that my work keep piling.. &amp; i can't seems to do finish anythin! Once i mx to complete anythin.. The nx thing jus pile up again..<br><br>It feds mi up even more that when i'm right up to my neck.. My other colleague.. She is an optometrist.. sorry if i got the spellin wrong..<br><br>Her main scope is to check eye..<br><br>Other than tat.. Jus help out with appointment taking, answering the phone.. tat's all.. mi n the recept we are up to our neck briming with work.. she jus sit there stare at her nails.. urgh!!!<br><br>And u noe the biasness abt my boss??<br><br>My colleague can ask her the same thing tat i ask her.. the result will come out totally different..<br><br>eg, if there is an insurance form to fill up &amp; patient wants it immediately.. She will give mi tat kinda face and ask.. is it urgent? of coz it is!! If not why would i wan to interrupt her inbetween counsultations??<br><br>My colleague go in.. no prob.. jus fill it up..<br><br>Sometimes i tell her.. She will say i say it at the wrong time. shld have told her at the end of clinic.. If i din tell her, she will say u shld have said it inbetween!!<br><br>I'm reali lost.. I dunno wat is the right thing and time to say wat i'm supposed to say!!<br><br>The latest incident.. She asked mi to check out some medicine cost for her..<br>asked mi to call all the drug distributor.. There is a drug guide on her desk.. and i packed her room, i jus kept it to its originalposition..<br><br>called the usual suppliers we ordered from.. Got hell from her coz i didn use the drug guide..Yeah.. i was silly but i reali din think abt it!<br><br>All i could ans was tat it was on your desk, u din pass it to mi..<br><br>She always think i'm reali free i duno why..<br><br>Each time i heard her call my name.. my heart reali sank.. and i will be like.. oh shit.. wat have i done this time??<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dun be sad lah. First job, take everything positively. More work given to you, take it as training. Nonsense give to you, take it as development. I can say I am doing well in my second job because of all the crap i got in my very first job. You learn and learn and absorb and absorb, and one day when you learnt all that you need, you get all the experience you need, LEAVE. But for now, if it has not come to a point where you will die from all these nonsense, bear with it, because you gonna come out better one day.</div>

The first 3 months usually mean probation and sh*t duties. 5 months onwards and if you are still filling forms, calling suppliers, packing pills, counting stock and making phone calls, then it's time to move on because there is nothing in the clinic for you to learn (given you're a nurse).<br><br>Life is too short and you're probably too young for a 4 wall clinic with overweight women past their prime who only know how to put you down.
