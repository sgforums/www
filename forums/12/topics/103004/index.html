            <div class='col-md body'><span style="color: indigo;">Perhaps you already have an answer and only need support for your decision. However, you ought to know that there would be a change in your relationship. How the future would be all depends on how strong you can deal with the reality. If you can deal with life on your own, whether or not forgiving him does not make much difference.<br><br>I feel what you should do now is not to think about whether you should forgive him or not YET. You should be planning for yourself now. What would you do if you choose to leave? Do you have a job? Maybe while you still aren't alone physically, get a job. Prove to yourself you are capable of taking care of yourself and your children. Also, would you want yourself to be dependent as being a housewife now? Man are usually very silly. They look for youth and beauty. Maybe because you have been taken for granted after so many years. IF you still carry on with him, what would you do to radiate that beauty again? I guess the difference now maybe is cause (I dunno how true. Just deduce.) you feel that you are married already. Your husband loves you for who you are. But forgot that after sometime, not taking care of yourself will make you unhappy inside and then reflects on your natural beauty dimming the radiance it used to have. SO Bring that out again. Oh yah. Since he has extra cash for dating the young lady, he probably has extra cash for you to go beautify yourself. Use iT! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"></span></div>

And this is what I deserve? My husband was seeing a young girl, she was only 19yrs and IÂ’m 39yrs.<br>Recently he bought a new hand phone Olio 2288 which he say its from USA, messages started to increase, I asked him, and he said that he was communicating with his boss, I tried checking his hp but I couldnÂ’t find anything, I donÂ’t believe it.<br>I went to a mobile shop and ask for the same model, IÂ’m shock when the sale assistant told me that this latest hp which got a special confidential folders feature which could stall your confidential contacts info, and when they contact you or you contact them, the normal inbox/outbox or call records show nothing, only when a pin was enter than you could read it. He was stupid to use our ROM date as the pin! Why he forsaken our love and our family, was it my fault to grow old, can I forgive him if he break off with that girl?</div></blockquote>Well... If you dun trust him, it is better to leave... Actually, it is best that you two sit down face to face and have a talk</div>
