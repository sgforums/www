            <div class='col-md body'>sorry to hear this but pls stay calm and keep your cool<br>think about your children. it's not just the relationship between u and him at stake but your entire family.<br>i would advise gathering evidence of his infidelity before confronting him as it would give you a bargaining chip should he decide to be foolish enough to want to initiate a breakup but do not flaunt it.<br>however, i hope that that would not be the case. Try to speak to him in a non-confronational manner and show that you believe that he only did wad he did in a moment of folly. Also, dont get your children involved and it's best if they did not know what their father have done. No point in scarring them emotionally.<br>have a good chat with him as communication is extremely important to make sure that the relationship is sustainable. two way communication, not one.<br>seek marriage counselling if required.<br><br>good luck!<br><br></div>

Else marriage is something that both have to maintain and nurture, not to take each other for granted. Both have to compromise to a certain limit otherwise both or one will be very unhappy and problem will arise, be it third party or not.  Sometimes even if partner voice<br>out the problem, the other partner may not agree or too egoistic/proud to admit until the problem worsen.<br><br>However, I should congratulate you that you have a very good n compromising dad !<br></div>
