Provided tat man brings home money for house allowance, kids expense, kids schools fees n etc etc n not gettin any troubles for the family n treat the family good though he was fooling outside.<br><br>U wanna try this method? but its gonna be hard to do i guess. depends on ur character n personality.<br><br>TALK TO HIM!

Who don't commit mistakes?  Look, which human are not attracted by and want to experience nicer things in life?  Given the right opportunities, right scenarios.. will you be so sure that you won't give in to temptation??<br><br>I am not saying that it is right of him to commit such acts but to point out that his ability to withstand such temptation may no longer be that strong.  In addition, human cheats because they think they can get away with it.  Otherwise, he may already divorve Michelle and married that 19 yrs old and doesn't have to buy that HP.<br><br>Well.. just look at www.sammyboyforum.com and you may realised that there is a network of 'hum sap men' and info on freelance and where to get laid.<br><br>Michelle, Whatever the case is.. have a nice and calm chat with him and ask him about his plans for the family before jumping into any rush decision or making stupid actions.

Somehow i feel that the guy has been, as what some other members have said, condemned to the death row before he even has a chance to explain anything.<br><br>Lets look at this step by step. You said that your husband is seeing a 19 year old girl. How do you know that? Did you hear it from someone else? Or did you see it yourself?<br><br>Next. Your husband bought a phone that can store confidential messages. And you read it. All we're assuming is that you saw some 'lovey-dovey' messages sent by the 19 year old girl and your husband. We don't really know, but we're guessing that.<br><br>Okay, if that is the case. I don't see anything wrong with it. Why? Come on, every guy wants to hang out with a younger girl once a while. Even people in their 20's... they're cute and er... young. But <strong> It doesn't mean anything </strong>. Its like how guys say "Oh, if only our wives could be like that girl on tv", but once again, we know where to draw the line between fantasy and reality, and those are only words ... (though it would be good if its true).<br><br>To summarize. You need to give us more details before we can help. But if you don't want to do that, please, at the very least, talk to your husband.<br><br>Sorry for sounding stern or anything, but this is my perspective.</div>

I am not telling you to beg him or anything. If your husband is stupid , he will go for the girl. If he is not , he will still have the great potential to be a player . If things don't work out , you have to accept the facts and move on (separation , divorce etc).<br><br>I know you love your husband but <strong> it is time to secure something for your kids and yourself  FINANCIALLY, should he want to be with another person.  </strong><br><br>Get evidence of his infidelity  FIRST but do not confront him or give him any idea that you have evidence until he tells you of his intentions and admits his wrongdoing.  <strong> Never ever give up the evidence to him </strong> Should he try to divorce you , that evidence will be your bargaining chip for financial security - not only for yourself but your children.<br><br>Get marriage counselling once he admits he is wrong.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Well, a lot of times we blame our partner for all the fault when a third party came along.<br><br>Sometimes, it's best to reflect whether issit you who has caused your husband to stray ?<br><br>I attended a few relationship workshop and many husband mentioned<br>they won't want to return home to a naggy wife, or demanding the husband<br>to do this or do that after a tired day at work.<br>I also realise full time housewife tend to be very naggy and conversation<br>only revolves around children, housework and gossips.
