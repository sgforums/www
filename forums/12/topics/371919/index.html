Where's the pride, and notion of staying here once and ever. who are we??? Are we predestined to be here??? who is our potential enemies?? and will other invade us for our concrete walls and concrete infurstructure ?? How is life going to be in 50 years time in this city?? The country name China Has a wonderful Province city call Shanghai. In this City it had survive alot of nonesense war.. revolution and this city's age is longer than our city we are staying in. It's many time better and bigger than us. Should we ? can we? be like them say in another 50 years??  </strong></span></p>

              <p>Lee KUan Yew is the one who caused the problem.</p>
              <p>He is not dialect chinese but peranakan, that is the chief factor.</p>
              <p>So he insists on the population go and follow his peranakan colonial language.</p>
              <p>Of course when selling the propaganda, he says that is to make things "fair" for all ethnic groups.</p>
              <p>Of course he forgot to say that he himself is peranakan and that community speaks english.</p>

              <p>W e cannot think that we might be lucky if we are rich. How about the poor, naive and elderly? Being selfish i don't think is good, In the name of racial harmony we can ''tolerate'' multi-races and religion in the expense of peace.. How about tolerating the poor, naive and elderly? If they are neglected , ya if you are rich, you won't be affected by any of these group of people, but judge and question your concious why must we torelate other different race or religion in the first place?  Doing, acting with a motive is no good, everything should be open and sincere.</p>
              <p>It takes 3 man to take down 1 enemy soldier here, is that a glory or anything also can as long as we survive?... pride? if we human with proper education do anything just to win and neglect other smaller event in life.. we are worse than animals... even animal got true feelings and  dogs are loyal to their master whoever it follows. The mongols back in the Yuan dynasty are proud and strong... they are fearless in war, fight almost battle with bravery because they honor genghis khan as the world ruler... even till death they feel glory. Each of their guy are trained to take down at least 10 enemy. They fight with pride, awesome unbeatable glory in the great faith of their khan at 1:10 if they can do this... they feel disgrace and not begin a mongol nationality.</p>

              <p>Lee KUan Yew is the one who caused the problem.</p>
              <p>He is not dialect chinese but peranakan, that is the chief factor.</p>
              <p>So he insists on the population go and follow his peranakan colonial language.</p>
              <p>Of course when selling the propaganda, he says that is to make things "fair" for all ethnic groups.</p>
              <p>Of course he forgot to say that he himself is peranakan and that community speaks english.</p>
              <p>Fair.</p>
              <p>Very fair.</p>

              <p><br>From this comment of yours, I suppose that you feel that the Peranakans have been doing a great injustice to the rest in Singapore then, since they have benefited from their proficiency in English.</p>
              <p>I don't support LKY and I'll rather take a neutral stand on politics.</p>
              <p>So if it's not English, what language should have been adopted as the chief one? Hokkien? Then it'll still cripple some of the ethnic groups, no matter what.</p>
              <p>And for the record, not all Peranakans speak English as their main language. There are some who continue to converse in Baba Malay too.</p>
