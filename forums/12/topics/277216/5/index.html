If not, it's basically surreal.<br><br>Countless of guys often give airy speeches like how loyal they are, you know those typical nice speeches that adds minimal 'brand position' and marketing effort.<br><br>It's like a salesman telling you 'Hey buy this car; it has a steering wheel.'<br><br>Duh.<br><br>On a general note, you purchase a car because you wanted convenience; you want to drive and not because it has a radio imbued inside. If you want a radio, you would buy a radio - not a car.<br><br>Double duh.<br><br>Relating back; you can't sell honesty/loyalty as a quality for a dating candidate - it just doesn't stir interest. (Of course woman would want their boyfriend to be loyal and honest - you know the analogy above? Therefore, you can't sell 'duh' as your USP. You know, a golden retriever is pretty much loyal as well, so if loyalty is the only quality you can sell, actually she could just settle for the former). Take note that I mentioned dating candidate - not boyfriend/husband - loyalty for the latter is critical, but loyalty for a dating candidate is like huh?<br><br>People would tell you 'oh that belongs to the husband material', but pray tell me if you can't even make pass the first step and succeed in dating, how the hell are you going to be a boyfriend to your chosen one?<br><br>P.S: CuriousOrange, if you are around, please drop him your two cents.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

My dad always told me to have as many girl friends as i can , so when the time comes i choose the right one and settle down. But i must not play their feelings. Which he has a point.<br><br>Not saying its wrong to love only one person and all that,  live happily ever after through rich or poor. But i think u want a package with the best of everything , which is not impossible , but its gonna take u time. And hopefully that ultimate package will even notice u. But seeing how u percieve urself and others and a generalisation of all the women out there , its gonna take u hella a loooong time.<br><br>Log back in after 9 yrs and tell me u got find one or not . To get such a sweet package , u urself gotta have something that is gonna compliment the package. Oil dont mix with water.<br><br></div>
