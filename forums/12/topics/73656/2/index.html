If they're lucky, they'll figure out what they're about in their late twenties.  In that case, girl, you might just be fishing in the wrong pond.<br><br>The other part of the equation, of course, is where you're at yourself.  Have you identified what things about a partner are really important to you?  I know that despite all of the thought I've put into it, I made the mother of mistakes time and time again.  Having a girlfriend who's a doctorate student and a model, who also happens to come from an influential family, did wonders for my ego, but at the end of the day things didn't quite work and I let it go.  Ah well, at least I still have her as a good friend and a federal judge on my side! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"><br><br>But seriously, it took a whole lot of self-examination before I figured out what I really wanted deep down inside, and right now I couldn't be happier!  It'll happen, don, but it'll take time for growth before it does. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  Exactly.</div>
