As its a intimacy between the 2 people that brings them closer physically and emotionally. Y is that all the young boys that goes to our red light district and after they get laid they keep going back to the same woman there? sometimes just for talk and nothing else cause there is emotional attachment.<br><br>For you i can understand you have low confidence in yourself maybe tot he extend No Confidence? maybe you should try going out with more of your female friends and in time they might ask you out and introduce their friends to you.<br><br>There is always someone out there for everyone.
