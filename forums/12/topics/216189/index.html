This so-caled love thing is just a like a game. Don't take it too seriously. Coz if you are too serious you are gonna suffer. Getting attached doesn't mean you conquered the world. Getting attached means you are sharing your happiness with some lucky girl in your own world. Well, that's my definition.<br><br>When you see that this world has much more to offer than just girls, you will not place too much importance on them.</div>

Never be in a fix looking for that person. Focus on what you want to do first and other things will come naturally. Fustratingly look for it and it will evade you at all cost.<br><br>True love... its more than just accepting the person despite differences. I won't go into there. Just be patient and hold true to yourself. Be yourself naturally and when your patience finally paid off, you will see the beauty of it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

Those of your league, falling into your kind of predicament, often claim to be the 'nice guys' and wondering why 'nice girls' are not coming along even though your expectations are simple. The truth is that either (1) you are looking at the wrong place or (2) you just still stuck in that small social circle.<br><br>Claiming to be 'nice guy' is a subtle form of arrogance because I always see 'nice guys' slamming people they label as 'jerks'. Obviously there are certain category of guys which are probably condemn for life, but a healthy number of others whom the 'nice guys' label as 'jerks' are actually 'nicer' than the 'nice guys'.<br><br>Your problem revolves with your mindset; remove that nice/jerk mentality and focus more on your 'selling' and interpersonal skills. It really amazed me when 'nice guys' are wasting those precious time and effort to analysis the jerks-of-the-world when they should be thinking about how to increase the probability of finding a suitable mate.<br><br>For a start, you may want to enlarge your social circle first. If you can't stand clubber girls, then begin your search elsewhere. Nobody says you got to club to be attached - chose another direction then.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
