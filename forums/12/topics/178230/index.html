            <div class='col-md body'>Hi i am a 17 year old boy with a big problem. I happen to have this need for<br>love. It is like i will do anything just to get it. For some reason i really<br>need it. I never really had any girlfriends in my life. I try but it didn't<br>work. I can't stop thinking about love and how it would be like. I have took<br>some advice and took up a hobby and focus on my studies but i still can't help<br>thinking about it. And i don't know why. I am also afraid that the girl may make<br>use of me instead of loving me. Because i am that kind of guy who is very<br>emotional and kind-hearted. My parents love me. So it's not thier fault. I am<br>not like those teenagers. I don't go clubing, smoke, drink alcohol, or do drugs<br>and have sex. But most of them are. Which makes it hard for me to find a nice<br>girl. Please help me. i am almost having depression. I just don't know what to<br>do. I have tried everything. Please help me. Thank you</div>
