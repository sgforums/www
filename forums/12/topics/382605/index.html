              <p>Hi everyone, this is my first ever post. Hope i won't get flamed or whatsoever.</p>
              <p>I don't really believe in true love. Is there even such a thing.</p>
              <p>Not
              to offend anyone, but our parents may be together because of reliance.
              Reliance on one another over the years. And with a son and daughter
              they just got to carry it on. <br></p>
              <p>Think of it. You can google it. Love does really fade over time, i read about blablabla chemicals that are produced when you "love" someone but it will get lost over time. If you get too involve with your "lover" but already lost your love for her, for example you have children, you wouldnt want to tear the family up. Thus you shut up, you carry on, try to be mr nice guy and try to love her back.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>can someone please educate me what true love really is? a lifetime care for your partner with an unending desire for her? or is it just reliance over time and attempts to keep the peace.</p>

              <p>If you still think "love" is just part of our biology for survival and preservation of our species, so be it.</p>

              <p>I assume your definition of love is between a male and a female who are legally married. As both of them age, reliance upon each other has taken over love. </p>

              <p>if youre cynical about it, then well i can say that humans are naturally polygamous. we were wired to be polygamous, to ensure adequate dispersal of our genes. </p>
              <p>its a very big question youre asking. ppl actually write philosophy theses on this for their PhD. i proof-read one once, and it called into question what is reality? does that that exists in your mind exist? before it questioned love. thats the complicated version.</p>
              <p>for me, i prefer the simple version. which is, follow your heart, youll know when the right one turns up, and if he doesn't, well you wouldn't know if loves exists or not already.</p>

              <p>Love is a weakness. When you start to care, you allow emotions to rule you, to worry about another person when you can never control his/her actions. No human think alike and when disagreements crop up as is likely, disillusions surface, a part of you that spent so much time and effort in caring crumbles, leaving you in pain, a pain that need not be should you not care.</p>
              <p>Robots are to be admired. Single mindedly, uncaring, ruthless if need be, it gets the job done. No attachment, no pain, no feelings.</p>
              <p>But we are not robots, and can never be. We bleed, we can feel, we can sense, and we can think. And with such traits, comes emotions - elation or despair. We need to want, and be wanted, its part of our emotions that makes us human, and thus through our wants and be wanted, comes the illusive chemical need called love, an attachment to that special someone who meets our needs.</p>
              <p>When you found that special someone in this generally uncaring cold and aloof world, who feels exactly how you feel, you will see her as closest to your mirror image - thinks as you thinks, do as you do - leads you to believe this love is true, for the mirror never lies.</p>
              <p>But in the end,....we all are only mortal humans, doomed to make mistakes....only a belief in a better tomorrow gives us the courage to open our eyes to a new sunrise...</p>

              <p>Love is a weakness. When you start to care, you allow emotions to rule you, to worry about another person when you can never control his/her actions. No human think alike and when disagreements crop up as is likely, disillusions surface, a part of you that spent so much time and effort in caring crumbles, leaving you in pain, a pain that need not be should you not care.</p>
              <p>Robots are to be admired. Single mindedly, uncaring, ruthless if need be, it gets the job done. No attachment, no pain, no feelings.</p>
              <p>But we are not robots, and can never be. We bleed, we can feel, we can sense, and we can think. And with such traits, comes emotions - elation or despair.

              <p><br>Most balanced conclusion on this topic.</p>
              <p>Perhaps I should really share my own thoughts on this...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If one were to say true love didn't exist, there would be a perfect argument for every single piece of evidence that would prove that true love did exist.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For example,</p>
              <p>A mother who cannot swim jumps into the rapids to save her 3 year old child from drowning, but dies in the process.</p>
              <p>Person X would say that is true love, a mother dying to save her own child.</p>
              <p>Person Y would say that is NOT true love, and it is merely part of our nature and instincts as mammals to protect the younger ones from harm so as to ensure the survival of our species.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Another example,</p>
              <p>A young boy takes in a hurt puppy and nurses it back to health.</p>
              <p>Person X would say that is a form of true love, that is unconditional love. You don't find that everywhere or anywhere.</p>
              <p>Person Y would say that is NOT a form of love at all, and that it is once again, part of our biology to preserve life and is merely in-built into our DNA to protect a lesser being as a lion would defend its pride from attack.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Final example,</p>
              <p>A couple that has been dating for 12 years finally get married to each other. They have a few kids and live a happy life together.</p>
              <p>Person X would say that is also true love, the supposed ideal conclusion to such a long and steady courtship would be blissful marriage. True love, found between wife and husband, and children and parents.</p>
              <p>Person Y would say it is part of our nature to ensure the continuation of our species via reproduction.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As you can see, Person X and Person Y could go on with their debate FOREVER.</p>
              <p>It's just like the big question, "Is there a God?"</p>
              <p>Person A believes in God.</p>
              <p>Person B does not believe in God.</p>
              <p>Person C didn't care whether there was a God or not.</p>
              <p>Person D believes in God, but continues living his hedonistic lifestyle filled with apathy, vanity and sin.</p>
              <p>Person E does not believe in God, but continues living his life meanigfully with empathy, helping others whenever he can, making a difference.</p>
              <p>So ask me again, "Is there a God?" or "Is true love a real thing?"</p>
              <p>The answer is simple, "Make up your own damn mind."</p>
              <p>I have, have you?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><em>If you believe in true love, then true love will be very real for you.</em></p>
              <p><em>If you don't believe in true love, you can never and will never experience or understand what true love is.</em></p>
              <p><em>So tell me, which one seems like a better choice hmm?</em></p>

              <p>Hi everyone, this is my first ever post. Hope i won't get flamed or whatsoever.</p>
              <p>I don't really believe in true love. Is there even such a thing.</p>
              <p>Not to offend anyone, but our parents may be together because of reliance. Reliance on one another over the years. And with a son and daughter they just got to carry it on.</p>
              <p>Think of it. You can google it. Love does really fade over time, i read about blablabla chemicals that are produced when you "love" someone but it will get lost over time. If you get too involve with your "lover" but already lost your love for her, for example you have children, you wouldnt want to tear the family up. Thus you shut up, you carry on, try to be mr nice guy and try to love her back.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>can someone please educate me what true love really is? a lifetime care for your partner with an unending desire for her? or is it just reliance over time and attempts to keep the peace.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> How true is 'true'? And if there is true love - does it means there are 'false love' too? </p>
              <p>The fact is that people are largely deluded by what they see on screen and apply them wholesale, momentarily blurring the lines between scripted drama and reality. What made it worst is that the notion of 'true love' is often a facade used by many love afflicted (development) individual to disguise some undeserving relationships or to perpetuate certain negative behaviors like abuse or possessiveness. </p>
              <p>By words alone, it may seemed a little illogical to believe in that notion, but in reality, people are actually accepting such diabolical belief in full scale. And this is rather a wide-spread phenomenon.  </p>
              <p>It is wide spread not just because people are unenlightened, but more importantly, they perceive karmic relationship as 'beneficial relationship' insidiously wrapped over by the pretty packaging of 'true love' sold to the world today.</p>
              <p>Some times people asked me 'Yunhaier, help me see if he/she is the one' (astrological perspective).</p>
              <p>I always ask them "so what if I say no? What would you do?"</p>
              <p>"Hah? No ah? Like that lor." </p>
              <p>From there, it's obvious that my comments wouldn't have matter at all, therefore interestingly, why even bother asking? Rational sense would have stepped in if I said something negative to dismiss all that statements as unfounded, while blind faith will be reinforced upon something positively said by me.</p>
              <p>So here's the truth: people decide how 'true' their love is by basing on their own construction of judgement. It is like the postmodernist perspective of reality (that we construct our own reality) - there is no univocal love that binds the superficial concept of 'true love' we gathered from the media - just much variation of the same concept, in which unfortunately is a belief that is susceptible to exploitation or obsessively held by the blinded soul/s.</p>
              <p>The concept of true love is a classic deception.</p>
              <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Love is 'true' by our making; it is not given true as our prerogative. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></span></strong></p>
