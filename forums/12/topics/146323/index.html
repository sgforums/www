            <div class='col-md body'>If it large and runs around when you feel for it, it is probably a benign tumour. But if it is large, painless and does not move around (stays fixed in one place), then it is very suspicious of malignancy. In any case, you need to see your doctor asap...he can put a needle into it and suck out some cells for the pathologist. The pathologist will examine it under a microscope and tell you if it is benign or malignant very quickly.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A lump can be one of the following:<br>- a cyst<br>- an infection in the breast<br>- changes in the ducts and milk-producing glands<br>- a benign or malignant tumour (benign = harmless, malignant = harmful)<br><br>Most lumps (about 80%) are harmless, but there's no sense in taking any chances, is there? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Go see a General Practicioner about this - if he or she can't sort it out on the spot, he or she will be able to refer you to a specialist.<br><br>If you do need a test carried out, it will be either a mammogram or ultrasound scan.  Both are non-invasive (no entry of anything through skin), and it will take a few days to get the results.  If the doctor wants to be really sure that the growth is not malignant, you'll need to do a biopsy where a tissue sample is taken out of the lump for analysis.  The results will also take a few days.<br><br>As everyone else has already said, it's better to play safe.  Go set up your appointment ASAP! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>
