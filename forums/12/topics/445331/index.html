              <p>I have a lady friend whom I've known for 7 years. We knew each other 
              while working at the same place back then. We both got along well. <br> <br> Some 4 years later, I develop feelings for her. After a month of 
              consideration, she told she cant accept me for fear that she will lose 
              me as a friend if our relationship dont work out. I understand that its 
              nearly impossible to be friends after a break up. Though she broke my 
              heart, I never hated her or hold grudges against her for that. I 
              respected her decision. She told me she hoped we could remain friends 
              even after this incident. I'm fine with that but it will take some time 
              for me to get over her since we are working in a same place and see each
               other almost everyday.<br> <br> And so the next 18 months have been rather difficult for me as I was 
              struggling to get over her while still remain friends. There are times 
              when I would ignore her at work as I need to withdraw myself from her in
               order for me to move on. That has always been the most effective method
               for me if I need to forget about a girl. But since we are still in the 
              same place, it was one hell of a challenge for me. Each time when I stop
               talking to her or ignore her, even its just for short time, she would 
              get very upset. She would tend to tell other girls in our place about me
               not talking to her. It seems that I'm somehow important to her even 
              though Im just a friend. Like as if me not communicating with her is a 
              big issue to her.<br> <br> And so now, we are no longer working in the same place and working in 
              different places. We are still friends, she even told me she consider me
               her close guy friend. Thats something no other girls had ever said to 
              me. We both shared personal problems and secrets. Some of my friends 
              advised me to treasure this friendship with this girl even though I 
              failed to make her my gf.<br> <br> I know many people would say that Im one of those guys who will always 
              remain in the "friend" zone with girls. As bad as it sounds, perhaps 
              there is a good thing to it. At least I dont have to deal with her ugly 
              side, which she warned me she tends to act in such a way in a 
              relationship.<br> <br> So my point here is, though she is attached with a guy, she still wants 
              me in her life. She make it seems that I am one of those people who 
              mattered to her in her life. Im really touched, and I appreciate it. I 
              do love her as a friend. I never had any girls treating me in such a 
              sweet way. Being her close friend is like a "2nd place" thingy. Do I 
              really matter to her much judging by how things have been going on 
              between me &amp; her? She might be sad if I really leave her.</p>

              <p>Hi TS,</p>
              <p>lets take things from another point of view, imagine this,</p>
              <p>One of your best gal friend of 5 years says she likes you, but in your heart you do not like her, so how do you handle her?</p>
              <p>1) Tell her straight away you do not like her and break her heart?</p>
              <p>2) Tell her you do not like her but still want to remain as friends?</p>
              <p>Is not easy rejecting a person. As you know how it felt for yourself, imagine in this case you do not like the gal and you do not wish to hurt her, how would you do?</p>

              <p>As a gal, let me tell you the truth, nothing but the truth,</p>
              <p>most gal maybe except me will not reject a person right off the shelves, cos we feel that it is not so nice and good, we dun like to hurt other feeling, and our gal sense of feeling is 10X better than guy, that is why you use to see wife or gf or gal scolding their guys, stupid head or goondo..pig head.</p>
              <p>secondly, we gal like to express ourselves by body language and some signal in hoping that the guy catch the tip of it and let go. Every reject will come with "let just be friend" quote. Get it?</p>
              <p>and thirdly, we gal are very firm about our decision, we seldom go back to take on already eaten grass, unless something big happen out of ordinary.</p>
              <p>Hope by telling you our gal action and feeling, you can rest in peace.</p>

              <p>Try not to ignore her or stop talking to her when shes trying to talk to you, because that is rude and unecessary......If you want to withdraw, you can do it but in a less direct way.......like approaching her less.....but if she approaches you and ask you something, just answer her...</p>
              <p>As to your confused feelings...I can understand it.....but I still think you need not completely wtihdraw and leave her......just be friends like before.......just try to reset and regain your footings.....You can take her as a friend......and dont think too much about it.....there is plenty of fish in the sea....why stress yourself.......</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I have a lady friend whom I've known for 7 years. We knew each
              other while working at the same place back then. We both got along
              well.<br> <br> Some 4 years later, I develop feelings for her. After a month of
              consideration, she told she cant accept me for fear that she will
              lose me as a friend if our relationship dont work out. I understand
              that its nearly impossible to be friends after a break up. Though
              she broke my heart, I never hated her or hold grudges against her
              for that. I respected her decision. She told me she hoped we could
              remain friends even after this incident. I'm fine with that but it
              will take some time for me to get over her since we are working in
              a same place and see each other almost everyday.<br> <br> And so the next 18 months have been rather difficult for me as I
              was struggling to get over her while still remain friends. There
              are times when I would ignore her at work as I need to withdraw
              myself from her in order for me to move on. That has always been
              the most effective method for me if I need to forget about a girl.
              But since we are still in the same place, it was one hell of a
              challenge for me. Each time when I stop talking to her or ignore
              her, even its just for short time, she would get very upset. She
              would tend to tell other girls in our place about me not talking to
              her. It seems that I'm somehow important to her even though Im just
              a friend. Like as if me not communicating with her is a big issue
              to her.<br> <br> And so now, we are no longer working in the same place and working
              in different places. We are still friends, she even told me she
              consider me her close guy friend. Thats something no other girls
              had ever said to me. We both shared personal problems and secrets.
              Some of my friends advised me to treasure this friendship with this
              girl even though I failed to make her my gf.<br> <br> I know many people would say that Im one of those guys who will
              always remain in the "friend" zone with girls. As bad as it sounds,
              perhaps there is a good thing to it. At least I dont have to deal
              with her ugly side, which she warned me she tends to act in such a
              way in a relationship.<br> <br> So my point here is, though she is attached with a guy, she still
              wants me in her life. She make it seems that I am one of those
              people who mattered to her in her life. Im really touched, and I
              appreciate it. I do love her as a friend. I never had any girls
              treating me in such a sweet way. Being her close friend is like a
              "2nd place" thingy. Do I really matter to her much judging by how
              things have been going on between me &amp; her? She might be sad if
              I really leave her.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> If you don't believe in existence of platonic friendship in a purist way, then you probably never will. It's hard to 'develop' it because you just can't believe in it solely from one dimension unless there are major tweaks in your overall belief and coping system in love. It is not impossible - just that the bar of change is significantly high to pursue. It can be done, just notably arduous to sustain.</p>
              <p>The point of you needing to be 'separated' from her presence is ultimately a coping measure - which is rather commonly employed. Perhaps she could do it because she holds a separate belief system, in addition to the fact that she is not romantically linked to you. That makes her easier to decide if she wants to keep the friendship, yet without having to struggle intensively like you. </p>
              <p>But you are not her: you have to decide if this choice of yours is delaying your development in love (with other people). If I were to be brutely honest, it is likely that both of you probably acts as a buffer for mutual emotional support to certain extend - just no title to officiate your role.</p>
              <p>Of course, if one part of your soul feeds on that tiny ray of hope, thinking that 'for as long as you are in the queue, you might actually end up somewhere', then don't be disappointed if things do not turn out to be the way you desired because you made the choice to stand in that queue when you could have easily walk away. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>
