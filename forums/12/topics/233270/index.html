            <div class='col-md body'>I have a gf who been with me for 7 years, She is very nice to me. One month ago i meet another girl. I guess i was attracted by her, we had lunch and phone chats and i could tell that she like me also, i just feel comfortable with her ( We never hold hands or do other things).<br><br>However i realised i cannot carry on this anymore, so i told that girl i was just toying with her feelings. I feel so sad when i said that but i could not be bad to my gf who give 7 years of her best life to me.<br><br>Now i am still trying to get over that girl but at times i find myself at the mrt station waiting to just catch a glimpse of her.<br><br>I really wanted to tell my gf that i did something wrong, i just cannot bear to meet with her eyes when we go out. I even stop holding her hands but i feel so terrible as i had been faithful for the past 7 years, i really feel that i am cheap.</div>

In doing so, what exactly are you trying to achieve? More complications? Nonetheless, she might just question you one day sooner or later if you continue to behave in such strange manners while you're with her....?<br><br>Now... Speaking of your 'unease'... I wonder why you should even be feeling that way in the 1st place? Unless you've not be totally truthful to us? If like what you've said, nothing has happened between you and the other girl... The main problem now you're facing is just dropping her behind your mind... And it's your decision yup? Since you've already taken the 1st practical step of saying you're toying with her feelings, pls do proper follow-up to take her off your mind... At this point, it's very unlikely to turn back to that girl even if you want to... So just drop any foolish thought and stick to what you've already decided and done yup?<br><br>Take it as a past and no longer there... Dilemma would leave you ending up nowhere in between...</div>

If a guy is obviously hiding /lying something about other gals from his gf, highly likely, his heart is swaying. thou' they may not have done anything wrong. but which gals can stand their bf having an interest in others?</div>
