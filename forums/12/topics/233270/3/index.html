Most of the time, the actual reasons are not found beyond the boundaries of your relationship (although it may seemed so). In simple: You may think that it's the girl's appearance in your life, but I would tell you that it's your relationship. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have a different analysis on this...<br><br>1. You want to tell your gf the truth because...<br><br>a. Your guilt is bugging you<br>b. In case gf breaks up with you, you will gladly go back to number 2....(with a clean plate showing everyone that you had been such an honest boyfriend...which increases the possibility of patching things up with #1 in case #2 doesn't work out....hmmm...just because you have been very "honest"?!)<br><br>2. You cannot sleep at night because....<br><br>a. You miss the excitement of having a secret affair<br>b. You suddenly felt that heart-thumping power which you no longer feel with your gf....(reality: heart really thumps with someone new....it will be gone after a while)(reality 2: It's people's nature to want something they cannot really have....)<br><br>3. You love your gf because....<br><br>a. She is your first and longest love and  she knows all your weaknesses and had been with you through your worst times and you wouldn't want to waste that. (in short, you are secured that she really loves you and scared that you might  be losing a gem over colored stones)<br>b. You really are decided and would want her to be the mother of your kids. (Which is what relationships really are, it is a choice. A decision that you have made. To love someone when the excitement is gone, the magic became comfort, when you need to accept things you hate).<br><br>I believe when you wanted to see a glimpse of her. I've been in the same situation then and it's good I found out earlier in the "affair" that he is engaged. I really felt the confusion he went through but it is a silent compromise not to ruin each other's lives that kept us from communicating now. It's been a year and though it is such a short, shallow affair, it is worth remembering. Just get on with your life and believe me, you'll get over it...it is just a feeling.not even love.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>7 years is a long time to be together. But if you are not sure of yourself and commitment, then you should break up for a while.<br><br>From what I have seen, those who are meant to be together usually get back together after a few months, even if they date other people during this break up time.<br><br>Otherwise, if yo ustay together, it's like those marriages where the parents stay together "for the kid's sake".<br><br>This is a bad scenario because the two adults are never happy, the parents never smile, and for the next 30 to 40 years, you are just miserable.<br><br>Another way to see if you should be together is to travel overseas for a few months. You'll really see the nitty gritty of each other than.</div>
