              <p>Previously, I had applied for overseas internship to both Japan and Australia. I didn't get selected for Japan as they had already chosen my 2 other friends.</p>
              <p>But I was chosen to go Australia with another classmate.</p>
              <p>I was really looking forward to going to Japan, but now that I'm only able to go Australia, I'm kinda disappointed. You can say that I'm half hearted about going to Australia.</p>
              <p>I know I can experience many wonder things over there. Money is not that big of an issue but the paid attachment here is something attractive to me. 6 months, each month at least $660</p>
              <p>While for overseas attachment, I get no pay but it's for the experience.</p>
              <p>I'm confident of adapting myself over there. It'll probably be for 4 months.</p>
              <p>Just afraid that I might miss some of the things here, the culture or I might even get discriminated over there (Brisbane).</p>
              <p>Anyone can offer any advice? Please, this is serious. If nothing constructive please don't post.</p>

              <p>Overseas Internship is not an opportunity everyone can get.</p>
              <p>I'm in one such programme now and I admit I sure missed out alot on Singapore.</p>
              <p>But 4months in Australia, its not a totally crazy idea, go for it.</p>
              <p>You can webcam with your closed ones while you're abroad.</p>
              <p>It will be hard to leave at first, but you will settle down eventually.</p>
              <p>4months of your lifespan. Not exactly taxing. Plus if you actually do well on your attachment and get a well written appraisal for it, it will be the most damn it fruitful trip.</p>

              <p>I am happy when u post to respond to people and help them like you do in AA, homework etc which is good since you are doing something proper and helping people. Earning your posts which is your target by such ways would be more admirable.</p>
              <p>However, spending time posting n crapping in lame topics such as the continuous posts topic is utterly lame and personally i would feel such topics are really for people with no life and nothing better to do.</p>

              <p>There are always discriminations around every where you go even in Singapore itself.  Just because of what happened to the Indian students in Australia recently, it doesn't mean you are going to experience the same thing.</p>
              <p>Come with an open mind and learn to mingle with the local people and you are most likely to feel accepted  and respected too.  I believe one of the biggest mistakes many people who come to Australia made was that they only mingle with their own people instead of trying to know the local people and their culture.</p>
              <p>Since you are only here for a short term, make the most out of it.  Go away for short trips during weekends etc.  There are many people out there would love to have the opportunity you have....</p>
              <p>Anyway, all the best and enjoy your stay in Brisbane, Australia!</p>

              <p>Brisbane is a great place! You can ask me, I was there for 3 farking years, I'm even planning to go back there for holiday this August.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> Its winter there now, extremely mild, but superb weather.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>You need not worry about dicrimination in Brisbane, you get a shit load more in melbourne and sydney.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> The asian community there is mainly hong kong, and singaporean, and malaysian, so fret not.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Its a great place I tell you, not so good for living long term, but short term, you will enjoy it and remember it when you come back to singapore.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"> To be frank, I miss that place very much, but not to the point I want to live there.<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
