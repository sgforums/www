              <p>Previously, I had applied for overseas internship to both Japan and Australia. I didn't get selected for Japan as they had already chosen my 2 other friends.</p>
              <p>But I was chosen to go Australia with another classmate.</p>
              <p>I was really looking forward to going to Japan, but now that I'm only able to go Australia, I'm kinda disappointed. You can say that I'm half hearted about going to Australia.</p>
              <p>I know I can experience many wonder things over there. Money is not that big of an issue but the paid attachment here is something attractive to me. 6 months, each month at least $660</p>
              <p>While for overseas attachment, I get no pay but it's for the experience.</p>
              <p>I'm confident of adapting myself over there. It'll probably be for 4 months.</p>
              <p>Just afraid that I might miss some of the things here, the culture or I might even get discriminated over there (Brisbane).</p>
              <p>Anyone can offer any advice? Please, this is serious. If nothing constructive please don't post.</p>
              <p>Thanks.</p>

              <p>I think you may be missing a vital and critical point here. It is  'internship'. The purpose is to prepare you for your future career path, gaining experience in a job whereby you may grow and possibly prosper with a steady income and a path of stability.</p>
              <p>The way you put it is as if you are on a holiday trip! I think best have some time out for a reality check.</p>
              <p>You have to plan now or you will be deep trouble later looking for a real job based on your qualification and education. Find out exactly what you want and how your internship experience will help you in your new job.</p>
              <p>Will you be working with asians more or continental types - are some questions you will have to ask as you did not provide such info here. If your chances are better working with asians, then streamline your attachments preferences to asia or foreign MNCs working in asia.</p>
              <p>If you want to experience culture, it is either you migrate or get a job in a company that sees your value enough to pay for you to expand their business interests there, and at the same time an opportunity to soak in the culture as an expat.</p>
              <p>The other way, which is more safer, take your holiday leaves and enjoy it anywhere in the world, and then find out for yourself which country will hold a greater attraction for you to spend a lifetime in. Otherwise you will get bored if you made a wrong choice.</p>
              <p>But all these is in the future. Remember - understand why you need the internship, do what it is necessary to secure your future first, and then the rock or a hard place will not even exist, for you have a goal in mind, undeterring you in that focused direction come hell or highwater. </p>
