Since you still love your GF, why dun you solve the problem with her instead of just choosing to break up. If you had lost feelings for her already, maybe its more understandable. Of course i dun mean the case of "got new love dun want the old" kindda stuff. If you had a troubled time with your GF, broke up and proceed in a relationship with your friend, then its very logical.

            <div class='col-md body'>feelings can't be control but right from the start, u should know that u have a gf already! i mean... not being out of dated or what, it's just that if u want to start a relationship, be faithful with the other party.. why still go and flirt with other girls?<br>Unless u don't love ur gf anymore.. treasure them before losing them... Guys are always so irresponsible, they always thought that they are the one being hurt but the one that is being hurt are the girls.. do think twice before u do anything!</div>
