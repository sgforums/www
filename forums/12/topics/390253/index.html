              <p>First im a guy, but here's what I think.</p>
              <p>Dunno but I would say she likes you and expected you to ask her first instead of others. And yes girls can do crazy stuff which makes you go nuts :P</p>
              <p>I approached this girl on a train station once (I saw her on school campus some times). She always said hi at school so I thought she's nice I'll give it a shot. Now let me be not the best at reaching out to women in my opinion but I left a good impression since she added me on a facebook like website. And later (dont know how she got my address) she added me on msn. Yet she never speaks to me even she added me. I speak to her sometimes and she doesnt say much. I tried my best I guess, which left me uninterested more and more. Soon school starts and then i'll see her on campus again and who knows what she'll do. I'll just say hi and be friendly.</p>
              <p>But hey I guess that's just girls, and for you? Well just go to her and be straight with her, like in saying that you think she's mad at you for some reason. Just to see what she'll say.</p>

              <p>Well, im not a girl, but i find them similar to Remote control cars</p>
              <p>Most girls would probably not delete you off msn/FB if they know you are just sharing your tickets.</p>
              <p>Compare this situation to remote control car using same freqency, you tested them one by one at the mall and think they all work fine</p>
              <p>However after you bought 2 similar sets home, due to the controller same frequency, they start to pick up the wrong signal from the controller, what i want to say is different girls repond differently to your action.</p>
              <p>The reason she will delete you off MSN or Facebook may not be purely due to your actions of asking people to go out with you, HOWEVER, your actions of doing so might just be the contributing factor</p>
              <p>Try to find out why he was deleted, ask aroud her good friends, ease into the conversation, etc etc, this part will be like tuning the remote control's frequency to suit different girl</p>

              <p>Hey bro,</p>
              <p>Glenn-nl is right. Obviously she has a crush on you and if you are interested in her or interested in having her as a friend. Just let her cool down for a while then one day just approach her and talk about something else.</p>
              <p>Just sit down and think back cos if she likes you there will be signs. The easiest is look at her eyes when you talk to her. You will see brightness and happiness in her eye. Body language also tells. But only the eyes can't lie. If there's this gal that you like and you are the last one that she ask out. How will you feel? Disappointed and Happy but, gals are different.</p>
              <p>Gals or Ladies are very delicate and sensitive creatures.</p>
              <p>The past is pasted, leave it.</p>
              <p>If you only treat her as an ordinary friend then, just move on. Since you ask her last then my guess is that she is not so important in  your life.</p>
              <p>Actually the things she did is using psychology on you. Only this way then you will start thinking of her, why she did that??????? I am not saying that she did it on purpose, nobody notice what they did. It's all out of anger.</p>
              <p>You can also use it on the gal you are chasing after. Get close, get interested, call her almost everyday same timing. 8 pm that means everyday same timing but plus minus 10 to 15 minutes. Her mind will be program that you will call at that time. If you call early she will be elated but if you are late she will miss you. Once you got her in, tell her you will be busy for a while, wouldn't be able to call her everyday. She wouldn't mind. Absent makes the heart fonder but don't dissappear for more than 1 week.</p>
              <p>Everyday you will be making new friends and if you are always entangled with such unnecessary headache, how are you going to live your life?</p>
              <p>Who knows, maybe years down the road you will meet up with her again.</p>
              <p> </p>
