              <p>arrrhhh i must emphasize that my My Results Don't Suck!!!</p>
              <p>&lt;small&gt;(my sch rankings are single digit well er but
                  anyway its juz a neighbourhood school..)&lt;/small&gt;</p>
              <p> i may sound like some retard spending 12hrs aday sleeping
                  in sch and not paying attention in class but my situation is
                  totally DIFFERNT from wad u think.perhaps some of you top school
                  elites never experienced studying in neighbourhood schools.
                  Classmates of lower aptitude hogged up entire tutorial lessons
                  asking the most basic fundamental questions that perhaps even many
                  secondary school students can answer.I can basically learn 90%
                  close to nothing at all.I can only come home everyday doing self
                  study and analysis or mug with my cousins in the library..</p>
              <p>i aint the kinda ahbengs who got no goals in life but before any
                  guy embarks on any ambitious plan.. i think the need for a girl as
                  a driving force is very vital.. going through rigorous sch
                  curriculum 12hours aday and stuck in a situation where theres not
                  even a babe to even desire for at the very least "lit the fire" and
                  keep the motivation going,while my peers in poly are hankypanking
                  with chiobus,embracing in the companies of sexily dressed poly
                  girls for project works while im staring at the clouds waaa the
                  feeling hor..(spotting this group of netball girls they r like holy
                  angels decending upon the earth to me)<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png">i
                  thank jesus christ for bringing them</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Ultimately i started this tread to ask for tips for approaching
                  this "group" of girls as i dont have any connections or links to
                  them in watsoever ways(as stated in the 1st post)</p>

              <p>Hey hey hey. Watch your tone. It's getting unwarranted here.</p>
              <p>Basically, you don't sound like you are in agony. You sound <strong>desperate</strong>.</p>
              <p>If you want tips to pick up girls, this is clearly the wrong forum.</p>
              <p>We have been pointing out very nicely what are some of the areas we think you should improve on. What did we get in return? I think we are feeling disheartened, or worse, angry that you implied that we didn't understand what you want.</p>
              <p>Before the flame boils up, let me dish out some more $0.02 worth of thinking.</p>
              <p>Don't brandish the phrase "top school elites" unnecessarily. Let me make this clear. Not all of us are from top schools. Besides, those who are, like me, are not necessarily elites. When did we ever say that you are someone whose results suck? You are attempting to rationalise your own desperate thoughts by dismissing our advice as from those "top school elites".</p>
              <p>To put it bluntly, you are just plain insecure.</p>
              <p>You feel that your main driving force in life should be a girl. It shows that you are attempting to fill a void in your life with a girl. You just want to get a girl as a security blanket.</p>
              <p>Now let me ask you, so what if you get the girl? What's next? No girl likes to be use as a security blanket</p>
              <p>In case you are still stubbornly thinking that you are right and we are wrong, let me use an analogy to illustrate the situation you are in now.</p>
              <p>Imagine that you are a soldier. You crave for the high that shooting and killing your enemy brings you. You are currently very uncontented wasting your life away in the barracks. You attempt to fill this void by picking a battle to fight. Now, problems start cropping up. First, you are clearly inadequately prepared for the battle. Next, after killing your enemies, what's next? You lack a coherent plan and exit strategy.</p>
              <p>The kind of mentality you have will doom your attempt to pick the netball girls up before you even embark on it. You have a wrong objective, you have no adequate preparation and you have no plans for post-picking-up.</p>
              <p>Failure is the only outcome I can foresee.</p>
              <p>You mention that you are envious that your peers get to frolick around with girls, good-looking ones even.</p>
              <p>The question you should ask yourself is, "So what?" Is getting a girlfriend so important to you now? Are you getting one for the sake of getting one?</p>
              <p>The forumers here have accurately pointed out the problem. You are just plain insecure and you have no proper objective.</p>
              <p>That's why we told you to get a life other than girls. It's not the same as asking you not to get girls. Rather, we want to show you that there are other driving forces other than girls. When you are purpose-driven and successful, you will feel less insecure. Girls will come and they will not be only confined to netball ones.</p>
              <p>Why fret so much about the lack of girls now? You should be thinking how to make yourself more successful (packaging) so that they will flock to you, or at least be attracted to you.</p>
              <p>You can make friends with the netball girls. No doubt, but do some self-evaluation first. What are the chances of you succeeding now? Might as well improve your chances by improving yourself.</p>
              <p>No one say that you can't treat those girls as eye-candy now. Everyone needs an eye-candy from time to time.</p>
              <p>I was once like you at the start of my JC. I was desperate to get a girlfriend or at least get to know as many girls as possible. I was just an absolute insecure no-lifer at that time. 12 hours at home per school day is normal.</p>
              <p>Then I realised that I have to change. If I were to put having a girlfriend as my objective, I will go nowhere in life. Change of mentality was the only way to go for me. I never looked back since.</p>
              <p>Learn to grow up.</p>
