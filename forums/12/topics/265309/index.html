I am talking about something more fundamental.<br><br>I am taking about having a philosophy of life / an approach to life and living that will ensure that you remain happy your whole life.<br><br>For example, if you say... "It is important to learn and acquire skills" and that is more fundamental than "I must learn life skills and I am learning this and that."<br><br>If  "It is important to learn and acquire skills" is "more" fundamental, than what is even more fundamental than "It is important to learn and acquire skills"?<br><br>This way, if you keep asking what is more fundamental.... you will arrive at THE WAY.... hahaha there is no THE WAY or you will arrive at a religion and end up with a bunch of beliefs....... hahaha you must not stop at religion and go even further...<br><br>Why are you contented? What about having dreams of making it big? Being contented is good and, having dreams of making it big is good... but aren't both ideas in conflict? How can you say that you are contented when you have dreams of making it big?<br><br>For example, if you say... "you mean to know the fact. like you are not so wealthly " ... and I will ask you, what is more fundamental than "you mean to know the fact. like you are not so wealthy "<br><br>I can suggest something more fundamental and that is, for example, "You must have the correct facts"... and what is more fundamental than "you must have the correct facts"?<br><br>If you keep on asking what is more fundamental to that which is more fundamental... where will you end up?<br><br>So why is it important to keep on asking... "what is even more fundamental"?<br><br>You keep on doing that and you will achieve what I suggested a couple of posts above made at 03 July 2007 Â· 01:11 PM<br><br>[quote]Originally posted by relax_crown:<br><strong>"Some people live life according to beliefs and that is good (if only it is the right beliefs) but even then, it is not as good as living life IN REALITY"<br><br>don't really understand this statement,can explain Mr Andrew?</strong></div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from"><strong>Originally posted by dreamykite:</strong></div><div class="quote_body"><strong>May i know what is your REALITY and other people belief?</strong></div></blockquote><strong>REALITY is just that REALITY... you cannot argue against REALITY but you can certainly argue against beliefs. There is no my REALITY and your REALITY.<br><br>You cannot argue against this statement "The earth moves around the sun" This is reality.<br><br>There are your beliefs and my beliefs. When you talk about your reality and my reality, you are not talking about reality... you are talking about subjective reality and subjective reality might or might not be REALITY.<br><br>Objective REALITY on the other hand IS REALITY.<br><br>REALITY is irrefutable. You go against REALITY at you own peril. Some people are so "unreal" that they end up in mental institutions. Others are so unreal that they end up depressed.<br><br>REALITY includes the acknowledgment that Beliefs have a part to play in life and living. To ignore beliefs is to ignore REALITY.<br><br>Right beliefs can help you but wrong beliefs can destroy you. Furthermore there are no inherently "right" beliefs... it depends. It depends on how and where and when you apply the "right" beliefs otherwise your so called "right" beliefs will destroy you. If you do not mind being destroyed for your beliefs, that is another issue (think suicide bombers)<br><br>So the question next becomes how to be in touch with REALITY and how in touch with reality are you?<br><br>chew on this for the time being....<br></strong></div>
