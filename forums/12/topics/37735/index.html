Such is a nature of human and it is rather psychologically and socially affecting to be always alone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>I am not saying you must go to a party and befriend every single one in it; true friends come in many ways and it is like wine - it grows better with age. You said you don't trust people - naturally you would have few friends - as simple as that. People would instead see you as a weirdo, a grouch, etc and the tendancy to avoid or not using the chance to fully know you inside out is pretty high isn't it?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Alot of times people who claims that they love to be alone or when among the few friends they have, these people don't seemed to be true friends, etc - I think its always good to self reflect upon oneself and ponder why others ain't like that and why am I like this. Seriously speaking - if everyone have a chance, they would rather be with a good friend, or someone decent. Are you giving this chance to people and yourself? You said you were framed by good friends - all I have to say is, if you found a worm inside the chocolate bar you are consuming, are you going to stop eating chocolate all your life?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

He can CHOOSE to MOVE ON if he really wants to... If he feels that the problem lies with his 'gd friends', then he can always go for a new group of friends... That's the PROBLEM with many humans ya see? They encounter some bad experience with people and they HYPOTHESIZE that <strong>ALL</strong> people are like that...<br><br>TIME to WAKE UP....?</div>
