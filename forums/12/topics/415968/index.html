              <p>Hi Guys,</p>
              <p style="text-indent: 36pt;">This would be my first post in
                                      sgforums. I'm sorry for the long post.</p>
              <p style="text-indent: 36pt;">I am a 14-year-old, Secondary 2
                                      student currently enjoying my school life, but is facing a
                                      difficult proposition. Please offer your opinions and constructive
                                      criticism if possible.</p>
              <p style="text-indent: 36pt;">2 years ago, at the start of my
                                      secondary school life, CCA selection landed me into an unfavourable
                                      situation, undeniably, due to my lack of talents. Frankly, there
                                      were only 3 categories for selection as core CCAs: Sports,
                                      Uniformed Groups and Musical Groups. Unfortunately, the lack of
                                      interest was apparent even to myself in all of these categories.
                                      The other academic CCAs were considered merit CCAs (you must have a
                                      core CCA)</p>
              <p style="text-indent: 36pt;">Hence, as you might expect, I was
                                      forced to join a uniform group - NPCC. Feeling it was not suitable
                                      for me, I transferred into Chinese Orchestra this year, somewhere
                                      around April. Not only does this mean that all previous records and
                                      CCA point accumulation would be completely eradicated, my start in
                                      CO would also be a painful one due to joining late. However, though
                                      there is no presence of real interest in CO, I committed myself
                                      nevertheless to this unexpected responsibility, and hope to perform
                                      in the EOY concert.</p>
              <p style="text-indent: 36pt;">Unfortunately, no matter how hard I
                                      try during this start of the school holidays, (5 hrs of practice a
                                      day) my improvements (if any) were always belittled by my
                                      instructor’s heavy scepticism and the conductor still refuses to
                                      allow me to perform. This dealt a severe blow to me and led me to
                                      contemplating whether the time was worth it.</p>
              <p style="text-indent: 36pt;">However, besides this, my real
                                      interest is in the field of biology. It has become an integral part
                                      of my life since I have discovered the joy of studying biology
                                      during secondary 2. Therefore, free time was often used, willingly
                                      and enjoyably, reading about it. I wish to join Science club in
                                      Secondary 3, and would exchange anything for it honestly. To me, it
                                      was already a lifetime’s devotion.</p>
              <p style="text-indent: 36pt;">The problem is, no matter how
                                      appealing biology is to me, the responsibility of CO still lingers,
                                      and the time consumption is a huge strain on any further extensions
                                      in my real interest. However, I’ve also heard that the lack of CCA
                                      points would significantly bring down your chance for a scholarship
                                      or anything of that sort. Despite this, I know that my JC side
                                      offers Science Club as a core CCA, and hence hope to receive more
                                      CCA points there.</p>
              <p style="text-indent: 36pt;">To be clear, my options are as
                                      such:</p>
              <p><span>1)<span>     </span></span> Completely devote
                                      my time to studying and developing my own interests. This includes
                                      bringing a Bio book to CO camps and treat CO like a joke, only
                                      receiving the participation CCA points and shitting all the
                                      concerts. My main fear is that CCA points might greatly deter me
                                      from future development.</p>
              <p><span>2)<span>     </span></span> Stick to CO and
                                      still try my best to perform well. This might mean neglecting my
                                      real interest for superficial CCA points that “aims to develop
                                      young people better”, and risking my academics.</p>
              <p>Really sorry for the long post :P Would really like some advice
                                      on which path I should take and are CCA points really so important?
                                      If I perform well in Science Club at JC side but neglect Chinese
                                      Orchestra now, will there be any serious repercussions? How
                                      important are CCA points anyway?</p>

              <p>Just sharing my experience, I got posted to St John's Ambulance Brigade instead of my preferred Art Club and felt a little annoyed and awkward at first, but after knowing some friends, the experience transitioned from tolerable to enjoyable, which you might encounter too if you can get to know some friends in CO.</p>
              <p>I understand that your trainer in CO might be a root cause of your dissatisfaction but you gotta understand that school pays instructors to win medals for award recognition, so bo pian have to endure but don't cause trouble or you'll face the brunt of gossips and bad mouthing.</p>
              <p>Since you're focused on prioritising your studies, just participate enough in CCA, and CCA points as Quinsy mentioned, are not that hyped as they are to be. You're better off taking Higher Mother Tongue or something while at it...</p>

              <p>CCA points are used in reduction for JC-entry as far as I know, in the long run, they don't serve anything, but what's more important is CCA records, what have you achieved in the CCA, what leadership positions did you acquire, were you active and such. I believe that university checks CCA records for both entry admission and appeal cases.</p>
              <p>Job applications, maybe they only check the highest tertiary education CCA, not so much on secondary school stuff, or never check at all.</p>

              <p>I really wish I could say the same. People like me who are interested in academics really don't get much of a choice. I don't know if this rule is universal, but my school currently promotes a mandatory core CCA system. Unfortunately, the distinction established between core &amp; merit CCAs is the problem. I don't really think the distinction is necessary too. None of the core CCAs are for me. Also, the competitive nature of my school is just ridiculous, recruiting only the best of the best just to win awards and uphold its reputation.</p>

              <p>Hi TS,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>it's really sad to see another person affected because of their cca. Normally i would advise the person to just drop their ccas and carry on without one, as it is not 'seriously' compulsory if you're attending a neighbourhood secondary school. The 2 points decrease just isn't justified if your 'suffering'. ( although the 2 points applies to poly &amp; jc admission now ).</p>
              <p>But since you're attending a 6-year program, i think it is almost inevitable that you need to get yourself into a cca, ( however i would advise you to drop that cca completely if you have any friends or you know anyone that's doing the same thing. I don't see a point in continuing a cca that you feel that you're being forced into ).</p>
              <p>Next, since your schools offers the programme, you are in the top secondary schools in singapore. I hate to say but you have to bear with all the pressure and bullshit that is non-existant in regular secondary schools. But that's the price to pay to be part of 'better' schools.</p>
              <p>You already selected option 1, so throw option 2 away. And do what you want!</p>

              <p>Hi Guys,</p>
              <p style="text-indent: 36pt;">This would be my first post in sgforums. I'm sorry for the long post.</p>
              <p style="text-indent: 36pt;">I am a 14-year-old, Secondary 2 student currently enjoying my school life, but is facing a difficult proposition. Please offer your opinions and constructive criticism if possible.</p>
              <p style="text-indent: 36pt;">2 years ago, at the start of my secondary school life, CCA selection landed me into an unfavourable situation, undeniably, due to my lack of talents. Frankly, there were only 3 categories for selection as core CCAs: Sports, Uniformed Groups and Musical Groups. Unfortunately, the lack of interest was apparent even to myself in all of these categories. The other academic CCAs were considered merit CCAs (you must have a core CCA)</p>
              <p style="text-indent: 36pt;">Hence, as you might expect, I was forced to join a uniform group - NPCC. Feeling it was not suitable for me, I transferred into Chinese Orchestra this year, somewhere around April. Not only does this mean that all previous records and CCA point accumulation would be completely eradicated, my start in CO would also be a painful one due to joining late. However, though there is no presence of real interest in CO, I committed myself nevertheless to this unexpected responsibility, and hope to perform in the EOY concert.</p>
              <p style="text-indent: 36pt;">Unfortunately, no matter how hard I try during this start of the school holidays, (5 hrs of practice a day) my improvements (if any) were always belittled by my instructor’s heavy scepticism and the conductor still refuses to allow me to perform. This dealt a severe blow to me and led me to contemplating whether the time was worth it.</p>
              <p style="text-indent: 36pt;">However, besides this, my real interest is in the field of biology. It has become an integral part of my life since I have discovered the joy of studying biology during secondary 2. Therefore, free time was often used, willingly and enjoyably, reading about it. I wish to join Science club in Secondary 3, and would exchange anything for it honestly. To me, it was already a lifetime’s devotion.</p>
              <p style="text-indent: 36pt;">The problem is, no matter how appealing biology is to me, the responsibility of CO still lingers, and the time consumption is a huge strain on any further extensions in my real interest. However, I’ve also heard that the lack of CCA points would significantly bring down your chance for a scholarship or anything of that sort. Despite this, I know that my JC side offers Science Club as a core CCA, and hence hope to receive more CCA points there.</p>
              <p style="text-indent: 36pt;">To be clear, my options are as such:</p>
              <p><span>1)<span>     </span></span> Completely devote my time to studying and developing my own interests. This includes bringing a Bio book to CO camps and treat CO like a joke, only receiving the participation CCA points and shitting all the concerts. My main fear is that CCA points might greatly deter me from future development.</p>
              <p><span>2)<span>     </span></span> Stick to CO and still try my best to perform well. This might mean neglecting my real interest for superficial CCA points that “aims to develop young people better”, and risking my academics.</p>
              <p>Really sorry for the long post :P Would really like some advice on which path I should take and are CCA points really so important? If I perform well in Science Club at JC side but neglect Chinese Orchestra now, will there be any serious repercussions? How important are CCA points anyway?</p>

              <p>Hi AHappyPerson,<br><br>I was from RI too and thus I can totally understand your situation. Back when I was sec 1, there I was, totally unfit and unable to join any sports. My core interest was, like you, in academics (i.e. computing). I was very anti-uniform group and thus I got allocated to military band (RIMB). As someone who didn't have a musical background, it was tough and coupled with the long training hours, I decided to give uniform groups a try (not much of a choice though).<br><br><br>At that point in time, I requested for a reallocation to NPCC almost out of desperation. Looking back, perhaps it was the best 'desperate' choice that I ever made. The 4 years I spent in NPCC were my happiest and my best friends all came from there. In case you were wondering if I ever gave up on my other core interest - no. I managed to juggle both NPCC and RI Computer Science Club at the same time (being the chairman of CSC as it was known then before it became Infocomm Club).<br><br>Ok, that's a bit of my history. I believe you are asking if you will be disadvantaged in any way if you decide to sacrifice CO. As a person who came from your school, I will perhaps rephrase your question, does your decision to not concentrate on CO result in your scholarship and/or university applications being affected.<br><br>After reading through your post, it seems like you have an interest in science and possibly science research. Now allow me to tell you the stark reality in scholarship and/or university application - your interest in academics will be of a much lower value compared to other CCAs like music/sports/CIP in the eyes of the interview board and admission authorities. The only exception is that if you apply for a scholarship that deals with scientific research like A*STAR or DSTA. If not, those prestigious PSC ones, they look out for the three types that I listed above. Any achievements in olympiads/research is likely to boost your academic worth but given that the threshold for the interview round in PSC is at least 4-5 As, what's your differentiating factor from others if you only have academic achievements?</p>
              <p>Personally, when I entered JC, because of my lack of physical fitness, I was not able to transition to a post-uniform-group CCA as easily as my peers. I made the decision, which was terribly wrong on hindsight, to just focus on my studies. I achieved the results that I wanted but looking back, what made me different from others? Nothing. I only have grades to boost while others have very good experiences in music/sports/CIP.</p>
              <p>My advice to you - in secondary school/JC, do go out and broaden your horizons but not at the expense of your A levels of course. Join some CIP program or some external CCA like youth groups or grassroot activities. Do it not only for the scholarship/university admission/resume (cmon we need to be practical sometimes) but also for your own exposure. You will not only gain friends but also learn something that you will never be able to learn from classrooms. Do not wait till university like me before you realise it. I am trying to make amends for my wrong decision in JC and I hope you don't make it too.</p>
              <p>So right now, I will ask you to make a decision on whether you wish to quit CO. Currently, at secondary level in RI, it is still good for you to keep a core CCA. On the other hand, you shouldn't be wasting both your and CO's time if you really lack the interest in CO. I suggest you talk to the CCA head and see if you can just maintain your Science Club membership and have no core CCA (to your own detriment of course). If worse come to worst and you need to find another core CCA (because CO is quite busy come SYF), the only option you have is to join a uniform group since it doesn't have any entry requirements. Nevertheless, explore the option and I wish you all the best in making the decision.</p>
              <p>And of course, do treasure your time in NS next time. Keep an open mind (a really open one because it takes getting used to) and you will learn things that you will probably only encounter in army and hopefully you can put them to positive use next time.</p>

              <p>Hi teraexa,</p>
              <p>I can fully understand the rational of your suggestions. Like I've said in one of my posts, CO is nothing less than a great enjoyable experience. That was before my parents asked me what I wanted to do. They don't want me to live a life without purposes. After contemplating for quite a while, I know this is my choice. Being a doctor.</p>
              <p>But unfortunately, juggling would be difficult for me. How should I put it.... Let's just say it is more than a hobby or a liking. I was once a pathetic gamer, but the introduction to my new interest made me quit almost instantaneously. I should first clarify that I am currrently not in science club as I have spent a good half of my secondary 1 life playing maplestory (Really retarded I know), and would like to join next year through the selection test.</p>
              <p>You mentioned the empty feeling after A levels, as a result of your lack of exposure. Pardon me for asking, so what if they've got good CCA experiences?</p>
              <p>Consider this with an open mind: What does a grandeur musical performance in Sydney mean to a person who loves engineering or science? What does a chance to nab thieves as a policeman (NPCC) mean to a person who wants to save lives?</p>
              <p>This is not a rhetorical question: Is there any other reason why you envy friends who have enjoyed different experiences in life besides the fact that they have got better chances at university/more friends than you? Or simply for the fact that their lives are more "colourful"?</p>
              <p>I did not neglect CO in exchange for better academic performance. I don't really care about them. I neglected CO for my passion in the Sciences.</p>
              <p>Thanks for offering a different viewpoint anyway :)</p>

              <p>Unfortunately, a core CCA cannot be dropped :( The only way I
              can avoid it is to play turant, which in itself is morally
              unacceptable to me. Hence, I would continue to maintain attendence
              while dedicating my heart and soul to becoming an outstanding
              doctor.</p>
              <p>Once again, thankyou for your support.</p>

              <p>Well from the rest of your posts as well as this post, you have actually already made up your mind.</p>
              <p>You have decided to:</p>
              <p>1) Maintain attendance in CO</p>
              <p>2) Enjoy your time in Science Club</p>
              <p>3) Work hard for your studies</p>
              <p>In that case, then do just that. It is going to be a torture, but since this is your decision, then stick to it to the end. However, since you want to just <span style="text-decoration: underline;">maintain</span> attendance in CO, then make sure you don't stick your neck out for others to chop when there are extra sai-kang to do.</p>
