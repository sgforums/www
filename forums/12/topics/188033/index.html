It's only inevitable that she gets to know other guys while in school. Just see it this way: if you do go to another school, you'll definitely get to know other girls as well right?<br><br>In a relationship, both parties must learn to give and take. You can have your female friends, but she can also have her male friends as well. You can't expect her to stop getting to know other guys in the course of her studies just to suit your own personal feelings.</div>
