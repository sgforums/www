              <p>I tottally agree with you. The girl who have eyes on another guy while she's in 8 years r/s with her Bf (some more she's getting married next year!!! Dang..) is really can not be trusted. I'm sorry to say this, but the girl most prolly is being bored in her r/s with her Bf and looking for something thrilling. Maybe That's why she's doing this. She might be doing the same to you if you get together with her.</p>
              <p>I think better find another decent girl. There're still so many nice girls out there :p</p>

              <p>i was involved with a girl who has a bf for 8 yrs. we were quite
              intimate for about 2 months ++ she said she loves me alot and feels
              very hard to breakup with her bf, as her bf is treating her very
              nice. she finds no reason to break up with him and yet due to
              family and friend's obligations, she couldn't break up with him. At
              certain time, she said she really would wanna consider me, but she
              felt more practical with him.</p>
              <p>They are suppose to get married in 1 yr time. I felt really bad
              and realized this finally after a big battle of myself, and sort of
              ended this "grey" relationship with her. She was quite sad about it
              either. For 3 days I resist from talking and communicating with her
              in anyways but in the end she wrote me a letter. Should I read it?
              I had already missing her badly but I know I've got to move on. So
              I am not sure if I should read the letter? My friends adviced me
              not to read as it will not do me any good during this healing
              period.</p>
              <p>Would like to know if anyone has any comments on what will the
              contents be? Will it do me more harm to read it? Or should I give
              each other another chance?</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> There are times when a relationship running on seemingly endless marathon will find fatigue sinking in and start questioning its very existence. We all need reasons to function, regardless of how absurd the explaination might be.There are a couple of possibilities for the advert of such phenomenon. For some might think that if fate doesn't allow you both to be together, why even allow you two to meet in the first place?<br><br>Your sub-rosa relationship is a litmus test for her to examine if this man, she is currently dating, is really the one for her. As much as you have enjoys her physical (which includes sexual affairs, if any) and emotional presence, this episode is but circumstances to understand the competitive landscape. By rational thinking, most people slipped back to their comfort zone because if she has chosen you, it's entirely a leap of faith. Blind faith. <br><br>Freedom? Yes. But you are an untested ground.<br><br>Furthermore, she also puts herself at risk of being negatively branded socially (disloyalty). This creates a situation where the risk is far too great and the returns are perceived as low. As we grow older, we become more adverse to risk because the fear of falling will overshadow the need to succeed and her situation is as such.<br><br>A relationship, at best, is merely an imaginary structure that held itself by substances we coined as Love. However, few relationships are running entirely on this fuel alone. The less concrete the identity of the relationship, the less stable the foundation. In fact, we are into a relationship for variety of reasons and as you have learned, she remains with him because of security - a proven track record. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Hence, dating you effectively reinforced the identity of her own relationship</strong></span> and thus, you are unfortunately discarded once her conclusion is finalized. <br><br>The farewell letter might symbolize the end of this sub-rosa relationship, but more importantly, it suggested that she has 'graduated from this short course' and you are no longer needed, in any ways, to provide growth. The learning has ended because she has gain enlightenment by taking actions toward a given direction.<br><br>P.S: In Love, we have a choice to play between the main cast or the side cast. In your case, you opt for the latter. Perhaps in time to come, you might have the wisdom to begin your role as the former.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Problem doesn't lie with the people we meet, it rest with the choice we make... from the people we meet.</strong></span> <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"><br><br>Cheers</p>

              haix.. i think that being 3rd party to break up others is always wrong... 
              but its always take 2 hands to clap, although shes willing, but is it right for you to step in and break the couple when they are getting married in about a year or so?
              
              if i was you, i will try all ways to avoid her, previously i saw your post, you got a farewell letter from her, and you said you expected, i kind of felt relive for the couple for the moment and glad you are not pursuing it anymore, and could move on
              
              but this morning , not within a month, you said you are back to her again -.-"
              
              
              Yeah... maybe sometimes many said love is selfish, you have to fight for yourself, but building your happiness on others people pain isn't one of the option isn't it...
              
              Imagine even you manage to have her in the end, what will her family think of you, humans tend to compare between people, they will take you to compare with her boyfriend. Which i think her boyfriend had already established quite a strong rapport with her family...
              
              My conclusion, leave her alone, making friends is ok, but try not to, cause relationship develops, and when its time to break up, u will feel the pinch even more..
              
              Its up to you to decide... i just giving my point of view.. good luck to every decision you made...
