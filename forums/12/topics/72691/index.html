            <div class='col-md body'><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  Dear sir/madam,<br><br>I am a girl of age 17 and have a problem with my Â‘loveÂ’ life. It begins like this.<br><br>There is this guy, G, who is in the same class as I am. Just last year (the first three months) we are classmates. We hardly talk or have a simple conversation. I knew nothing about him and have no interest in him at all. Then, after three months when a lot of people will transfer to different school/ class. Coincidentally, we took the same subject combination and ended up in the same class. I didnÂ’t know that at first. It was when he asked me about my combination then I knew it. I was praying hard that at least we would be in the same class ( I wish to change my subject combination and so my friends wonÂ’t be in the same class as I am). God answered my prayer and we ended up in the same class again. We seldom talk. Just only last June that we met on the bus and had a decent conversation. I was puzzled because I and G canÂ’t be considered friends and I was walking with a friend, Willy, to school. My friend and I was Â‘interruptedÂ’ by him. He tried to catch up and talk to me. I was standing between my friend and G. We talked until we reached the Lecture theatre in the school. The next day, the three of us met in the bus again. This time when we alighted the bus, my friend purposely quicken her pace. Knowing what she was thinking, I walked faster too. Then G walked faster, trying to catch up with us. The same thing happen next day. The only difference is I walk at my usual pace because I think it is rather rude to Â“avoidÂ” him. At that night, our class had an outing; watch a play. Jane , Val and I wanted to meet up before getting to the destination. Val was very late so we left without her to meet up with our class. Luckily, we reached there on time. G was sitting behind me and asked me Â“you are late?Â”. I told him what had happened. Willy was sitting beside G and she giggled. She told me that I should switch places with her. I was annoyed and refused to reply. Then my other friends are curious and asked willy. She told the females in my class! Over the past few months, I denied that we are couples. However, everything changed.<br><br>Due to that day onwards, he and I talk a lot. I begin to know his strengths and weaknesses. I really like his attitude; friendly, caring.I develop a feeling towards him last November. He is the president of his club.<br><br>I think some things change this year. He did not go straight home after school; he claimed he had CCA. He went back home only before dinner (7.00pm). I asked him (in a teasing tone) whether he had a girlfriend. His reply was no. every wed, after lesson ended, he will rush to his cca venue. Only these past few weeks that I suspected something. Does he like a girl in the same CCA as him? I canÂ’t confirm this.<br><br>1) past few days, coincidentally, we met after alighting the bus.  I go to school early as I thought G will be going to school at the last minute. I wanted to avoid him at the time-being. He approached me then I know it was him. We went to school. In school, a girl in the same cca as him greet him and told him she canÂ’t go to the meeting.I heard he asked why. Not wanting to disturb him, I walked quickly. He quickly ended his converse and caught up with me.<br><br>2)these past few months,whenever I walked past him with a friend of mine. He would ask that friend of mine something. He used to ask me something instead of someone standing beside me.<br><br>3) I saw him and his friend eating lunch with two girls from the same cca. This confuse me as he normally eats with his other two good friends. his good friends were sitting on the bench in front of him.<br><br>4) he would ask me some remedial things via mobile phone (sms) instead to his good friends<br><br>5) He asked about my health after he knew i was sick and how i recover.<br><br>My heart hurts. I have never eaten lunch with him before,. He was always having meals with his good friends.<br>Could it due to the fact that last year, I seemed too friendly towards a few guys? We laughed and walked together. I often mention the same guy to him.<br><br>Is this just a wishful thinking that he likes me too? I donÂ’t have the guts to tell him I do.<br>I wish that I could just forget about him but I know I canÂ’t. I tried and am trying now. I know I would end up getting hurt. How could I forget about him? Is this a good decision? What should I do? I can't tolerate any longer, maybe i will go bonkers of my friend teasing us being a couple. i think G is 'flirty' as he is very friendly and caring towards females.<br><br>pls reply as soon as possible. thanks. by the way u can call me M<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"></div>
