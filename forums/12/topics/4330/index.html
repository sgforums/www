            <div class='col-md body'>Nivlek,<br>This is my first time, I have to take a break after reading a post if not emotions will overflow the river banks...<br><br>All the fond memories that we share.. It's really something... All the jokes and silly ideas that we come up with. All the stories that we tell each other. Though we all have different interests but I think somehow we have something for each other...<br><br>This NS life was never what I had in mind. Not one I will even dream of on my bed. Doing things which not many NS guys will have the chance to experience it. But I'm really happy to know you guys.<br><br>25th of May indeed a date the 3 of ur dear friends will look forward to. It's a day when we started to countdown when we were first enlisted. Finally, now the day has come and passed.. Slowly, we realise that things are not going all that smooth in the direction we expected. We will missed this period of lives. In fact, I already did. It's just a plain admin life, but it's the players in the game that counts.<br><br>I do miss the tok cok sessions everyday with you guys.<br>I do miss the running sessions that we had to orchard, and the last one up Mt Faber.<br>I do missed the days the Tweenies gang rules. Till everyone wants to be part of it.<br>I do miss the times when we play CS in different rooms yet we understand each other.<br>I do miss the long breaks everyday. Not wanting to leave if not for work.<br>I do miss the times when I have the company from u guys when I'm in office.<br>I do miss the half an hour filling bottles and restroom breaks. Just hang around and not do work.<br>I do miss the short shopping trips to those places. a once a mouth thing to reward ourselves for the 'hard work' put in every pay day... hahaha~<br>I do miss the enjoyment we had for suaning Mr Dielahz. It's amazing he din mind a bit.<br>I do miss the trips to your office to disturb you guys there and your work.<br>I do miss my 'tough' NS life. Having to carry my shotgun and chiong everyday.<br><br>All the best for your 4 years in NTU. Hope u will have an equally enjoyable or even better time. Making friends, studying, and enjoying ur hostel stay.<br><br>For Twits, I hope that he will be admitted to NTU or SMU too.. At least it will make him more settled down... Twits... all the best for ur exams, ur driving, uni admission, and ur r/s... doubt u'll read this, but it's a ernest tot that's meant for you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>For Dielahz, doubt he's gonna pursuit a further educational qualification in the mean time.. I wish him all the best in his work.. hopefully he doesn't find pple who will bully him like we do.. heheh~  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)
