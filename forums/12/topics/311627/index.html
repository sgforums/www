              <p><br>if u have break up with her, just dun contact her for the time being. even if you want to be frens with her, can u imagine the hurt and the pain she have go through if she were to see you again? can you understand what is she feeling?</p>
              <p>so just give her some time to move on and you need to move on too.</p>

Trying to study but find myself thinking of the past. Try calling her as friend but she is giving me the cold shoulder. I just want to be friends but she is not willing to.

              <p>Hi TS, just share something with you.</p>
              <p>Firstly it is very normal for you to feel sad and a sense of lost since she's someone close to you. 2 months is a short time and you will probably take some more time to get over her. In order not to think of her, you must have some new direction in life like finding another new girl. Although this sounds like a "jerk", but hey, you wanted to breakup and you had done so. So, you should move on.</p>
              <p>Also, since you had initiated the breakup, no doubt she will feel much much worse than you. You shouldn't even be calling her. Everytime she sees your sms or hear your voice, she will feel sad. It is difficult but do spare a thought for her.</p>
              <p>But if you really wanna be back with her, just tell her you wanna get back with her and see if you get a chance. Being a friend with her at this stage is extremely difficult and hurting for the both of you.</p>

              <p>I believe you got to find the motivation &amp; direction in your life for you to concentrate on your studies. Yes, you have your reason for breaking up with her because she is seeing someone that you stand. If this is the case, then you should evalute on yourself because loving someone is not treating her like a toy. Cherishing her when she is nice to you &amp; breaking up with her when she is doing something you cannot stand. Its about accomodating to each other.</p>
              <p>I am also another person who is going through a breakup during this period of time. It will be difficult initially but you got to find the motivation. Always rememeber at the end of the day, if you are not going to fight for your future, is there any future that you want to talk about to your loved one?</p>
