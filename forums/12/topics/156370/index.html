It's one of those "send someone a greeting" mail with no text and  you have the option to reply. Actually I don't  know why she send me this mail because i have been totally ignoring her. I have known this girl for about 1 year but we are not close. We work in the same company and a lot of guys are after her but yet she still remain single.<br><br>During our first meeting , we were talking happily when she said something that upset me. I know that she didn't mean to say it and she even apologise  after that. I told her that i was upset and she hurt my feelings. Later i regret saying that  to her. I wasn't myself that day.<br><br>After that incident i thought my chance is lost and that she doesn't even think of me in that way. Whenever she is around i let my colleagues talk to her and i just don't bother.<br><br>Few weeks later my frens says that she is very sad but they don't know what had happened. In her blog, she mentioned about "opportunity lost" and "waiting for someone" the more i read her blog, i said to myself....could this girl be talking about me?<br><br>After 1 year this is the first mail i received from her, I feel very happy and sad at the same time.<br><br>Happy - because i thought she was angry with me .<br>Sad - because my colleague is going after her<br><br>I really like to get to know her better but i don't want to get in the way of my fren.
