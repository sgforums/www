              <p>Don't be too affected by what your friends say.  Good to know that you are aware of your priorities in life right now, ie. study and get a degree.  Friendships need lubrication to maintain, so we have to interact with them and be a part of their lives.  However that should not be at the expense of your studies.  Should you skip classes or go out eve of exams if they call you?

              <p>Hah ! You don't know what you're missing ! If a friend is calling you, you should be a YES MAN. Not a NO MAN. You shouldn't be passing such an opportunity to socialise. They're asking you for a basketball game for goodness sake, it is good for the physical health. If your friends is asking you to go pub, disco or take drugs, then you should stay away from them lah.</p>
              <p>You shouldn't be studying all the time, you shuold balance your social and study life. You wait lah, when you start working life will change and you will regret not spending time with your friends. Once you work and your friends get married, everybody will be busy about their lifes and nobody bothers to call you after that. You should cherish your youth and appreciate your friends while you still can.</p>
              <p>Me? Although I am attached with my girlfriend, I really miss the time I spend with my guy friends. Going shopping, bowling, basketball, soccer, outdoor cycling and collecting comics. Now all of them are married and some migrated to overseas. I miss my friends. Bcause i work overseas, its hard to gain new friends. In the office, people are too sucked into work, nobody cares, its politics and people do nasty things atr you.</p>
              <p>Also you are very sensitive man, people say things at you, you should take it as a joke. You wait till you go to the office, people can be even more nasty than calling you horny. Your car tire can get punctured also you don't know. Or your car get scratched.</p>

              <p>I begin to understand that finding a good friend is as rare as a gem... I am always surrounded by insensitive friends... There are always people who will pull me down... right now i am studying uni... i have a friend who make an idiotic comment that i look horny when i am typing notes while listening to classical music... i was like what the... he told others about it... Isn't it irony that people can make fun of you while they get angry when you make fun of them? Not just one instance but a few already... Now, what i need is to study hard for my uni but i keep on having  friends who keep on pulling me down either physically or mentally... they do not need to study during weekends since they only need to work during weekdays... they love to call me out when i am physically at NTU while they are at Pasir ris playing basketball.... sometimes, i really do not know how to fork out time to go out with them.. when i did not go out with them, they make a fuss when i am going out with others... the reason is becos is for my friend's birthday... 22nd birthday for goodness sake... i really dun understand the need or purpose of friends... are they merely acquaintance or normal friends?</p>

              <p>Hah ! You don't know what you're missing ! If a friend is calling you, you should be a YES MAN. Not a NO MAN. You shouldn't be passing such an opportunity to socialise. They're asking you for a basketball game for goodness sake, it is good for the physical health. If your friends is asking you to go pub, disco or take drugs, then you should stay away from them lah.</p>
              <p>You shouldn't be studying all the time, you shuold balance your social and study life. You wait lah, when you start working life will change and you will regret not spending time with your friends. Once you work and your friends get married, everybody will be busy about their lifes and nobody bothers to call you after that. You should cherish your youth and appreciate your friends while you still can.</p>
              <p>Me? Although I am attached with my girlfriend, I really miss the time I spend with my guy friends. Going shopping, bowling, basketball, soccer, outdoor cycling and collecting comics. Now all of them are married and some migrated to overseas. I miss my friends. Bcause i work overseas, its hard to gain new friends. In the office, people are too sucked into work, nobody cares, its politics and people do nasty things atr you.</p>
              <p>Also you are very sensitive man, people say things at you, you should take it as a joke. You wait till you go to the office, people can be even more nasty than calling you horny. Your car tire can get punctured also you don't know. Or your car get scratched.</p>

              <p><br>I suppose you're a fan of Yes Man.</p>
              <p>It's true that we shouldn't close ourselves up to all the possibilities that lie in front of us. Yes, they lead to results that are simply out of our expectations.</p>
              <p>However, TS do have his own life to get on with. I'm sure he does want to go out with his friends to play basketball, to have lunch or for whatever other reasons. He has to prioritise his options.</p>
              <p>Well, he isnt being too sensitive too. It's much to my distaste at times when some of my friends are unhappy when you gang up on them (well, you know. all the usual guy stuff, the wrestling, grappling etc) when they are perfectly fine doing the same to you. If you're willing to do something to others, expect the same from others.</p>
              <p> TS, friends are very important people. Do treasure them, especially those who are in your inner circle.</p>
              <p>Well, have you spoken to your friends about these?</p>
              <p>Talk to them about it and see what can you guys come up with. Shed some light upon them regarding your schedule too. Then, they'll have a better idea of when you're free.</p>
              <p>And regarding taht particular friend of yours, don't mind him too much. Some people are just like that.</p>

              <p>I used to think like you too until I got job transfer to Thailand and then Malaysia, I realised how small Sg actually is. The place where I work and the place my company provided for me to stay is about 25km away. Distance is not a factor. I sometimes travel to the customer place which is 60 km away or even 400km away.</p>
              <p>Yes by all means prioritize your studies. There's no such thing as true friends, friends are human beings, they are not perfect, they also can't hurt or disappoint you. You must learn how to heed things and not take what they say into an offence. If you feel hurt then confront them in an honest way about it.</p>
              <p>Don't let your life pass like this, when you start working, you will start missing your youth. It is more difficult to find new friends once you start working. In the course of my life, I have had various reunions with my ex classmates which brings a lot of good memories back to me.</p>
