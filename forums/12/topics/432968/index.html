              <p>When you go to poly aft ns, you are probably 25 years old or even older!. then you move forward to degree, think you gonna graduate by 30 years old. You sure this is what you want in life? people age 23-30 are already working and earning decent salary. Many already save enough for flat and car while you are still studying. It will be damn demoralising.. BUT! if your dad is a business man. then i doubt u need to think that much.. and i'm just being realistic..</p>

            <div class='col-md body'><p>bro, make sure you choose a course that best suits you. many of my friends dropped out because they chose the wrong course. Nitec or not nitec can still make it one. I flunked my O'levels (D7 for maths) and could not enter into poly actually but one poly accepted me in and I've just graduated recently with a decent GPA of 3. (Who says O'level students that go ITE cannot make it to poly?) You can do it too, its all about understanding why you are in school and what you are studying for. Good luck, never give up or in. Age is not a barrier.</p></div>

              <p>i withdraw poly once, wasted a year, and then i went back. it is pretty common for people to withdraw. and some reasons are due to having no friends. what is done cannot be undone! since u have dropped out and decided to want to enrol back next yr, u should now try to plan for your future, convince yourself that you must graduate with a diploma so that you wont withdraw yet again, and meanwhile keep yourself busy with activities..</p>
              <p>it might be impossible to enrol back into the same poly, because i got rejected, u might want to consider another poly.. and consider wisely which course you are most suitable for.</p>

              <p>it is never too late lah. it is just a few years late...whats more important is you know what you really want to do.. even if u want to go uni take part time course lah. you lack confidence, you have to try to figure out what are your strengths... take a course that you know you know you are better at.. if poly dont have, take private one at least it is something you like..dont go blindly, do something you dont like and try to make it through..it only makes your life hard......</p>
