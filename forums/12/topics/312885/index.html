              <p>hmm..i think the problem here is like she doesn't even notice ur existence to a very large extent..</p>
              <p>y dun u do stuff that normal ppl dun do?</p>
              <p>u can start off by going out on group gatherings.. and better still, ask for her help to plan them with u, den u can contact her on a closer basis.. and when u guys like get comfortable toking to each other(in chinese), u can sort plan more stuffs and go out with her and stuff..</p>
              <p>i mean, after u befriend her enuf, it will be kinda easy to ask her stuff like "hey watcha doing today?" and if its like she's going somewhere alone den u can go with her..</p>
              <p>of coz there will come a point when u will noe whether she will reciprocate ur feelings.. like if she ask u go out with her too.. den shiok la by then...</p>
              <p>but meanwhile, think of some activities and befriend her till the point of close frens kinda thing.. like checking out the poly now and stuff..</p>
              <p>most imptly, u must be prepared for failure.. she may not like u yah..</p>

              <p>i was in the exact same situation as you, and im your age as well. the girl i liked wasn't within my social clique and network at school, but i told her all the same, just so i could look back and have no regrets.</p>
              <p>do it if you want to have no regrets in the future, because you'll know that at least you tried.</p>

              <p>Please read and tell me what i should do, i am begging you =/</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> <br>Theres this girl, lets call her H. She and I went to the same secondary school. We were in the same class for 2 years, different for the last years. we're 17 years old this year, entering poly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i am pretty sure i had a crush on her at about sec 3.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>now you would think that in a couple of months i would have gotten over it, but jesus christ it's been about 3 years and i am absolutely crazy about her . this girl is perfect in every way i can think of, the way she talks, how she carries herself, everything she does, i could type out a 10 paragraph wall of text on how awesome she is but ill get to the point .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>heres the thing, through secondary school life ive always carried the the ' i dont care about boy-girl relationships and other shit, i just want to play dota, and hang out with my guy friends, drink beer, manly man' image. i dont know why i did , come to think of it it was pretty retarded of me. absolutely no one knew about my feelings, when i hung out with people all we talked about was where to eat, what to play and other stuff like that, no one knew me for a 'deep' person. holy shit i would even intentionally keep my msn nicks simple , none of that 'my heart is burning inside, no one knows how i feel' type of things.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>When we hang out we are pretty normal around each other, we tell jokes, talk etc, do normal stuff that normal people do when hanging out. i dont think ive ever hinted to her anything at all, ive mantained the 'i dont give a shit' image very well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>one problem is how different we are. She's the more chinese speaking type, and im more of the english speaking type. We have absolutely nothing in common, she likes anime and chinese/korean drama, I watch mostly US sitcoms etc. I've known her for 4 years, and ive never ever found a common topic between us.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">The worst thing is that she probably has the impression of me as just this guy that plays games, sometimes hangs out with them etc. i'm not even in her circle of close friends !! if she had a personal problem i would probably be one of the last people she would turn to for help type of person to her. she has no idea how i feel about her =/</span></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>now that we are having our long o lvl break, she and I (and our group of friends) hang out a couple of times a week . i feel fucking terrible everytime i get home , i really cannot bear to stop talking and being with her, she runs through my mind all the time. im not very good with words so i probably cant put this in a convincing way, nor are the examples i listed very good, but im willing to bet that no one else likes her as much as i do , i really believe so.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>she's entering the same poly as me in april, couple of weeks time, and to think that other guys are going to chat her up etc just because she is pretty good looking makes me feel really really bad .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i confided in one of my other female friends, but i did not mention H's name. Please please help me out , i dont know what i should do =/</p>
              </div>
              </blockquote>
              <p>me think career is more important than this leh k la what you want you must go for it ASK!!!! ok find a good time have a good chat with her tell her u have a crush with her and fall in love with her then is up to her to say yes or no if yes move on if no also move on .</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ok most important be positive,often negative thought stop us from acheiving the best outcome but it also good for some reason as it were stop you do some terrible things you will regret for life 1.</p>

              <p>wad i meant was..</p>
              <p>once poly start, u will be so busy knowing more friends, boys and gals that if u not in the same course as her, it be next to impossible to like start going out with her..</p>
              <p>unless, u start now or u get lucky.</p>
              <p>dont worry, still young many more years to go.</p>
              <p>like u can ask how many ppl arnd.. how many actually stay contact even though they same poly. with so many meeting place, u might just not meet her.</p>
              <p>so start now. but wad i guess is its just a crush where u think too much cause u spend abit of time around her.</p>

              <p><br>Confidence, man. The moment you start going all emo, you lose everything. Just be your usual self. Take things slow, but not too slow. It's a gigantic balancing game.</p>

              <p>This is the first post I've bothered to make since the SGF layout changed, since you are kind of similiar to me. All the best.<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess/thumbs_up.png" alt="thumbs_up.png"></p>

              <p>Just open your mouth and say.. if you can't bring urself to say it.. den use other indirect means like letter (pls do a good passionate job). No emails or sms please unless u want to kill ur hopes.</p>

              <p>As for clash of interests, i guess opposites attract. Aiya.. no problem de. Can work on it and adapt to it. Been there done that.</p>

              <p>then don talk cock here and start talking and communicate to her..</p>
              <p>1stly, change ur fucking image.. no gals wan to be with a guy who plays around all time. Gals need security feeling..</p>
              <p>2ndly, fuck your dota already, use that time talk to her, sending fun emails, jokes and so on that u find interesting internet.</p>
              <p>3rdly, u must the fuck know what she likes.. mostly couples dont really have much in common. just need to know each other what they like and dislike. TO do this, COMMUNICATE more or simply ask her "what song is nice, can u recommend me? (indirectly u know what kind of song she likes lo)</p>
              <p>4thly stop thinking fucking much, fucking action more than how much u think dude. and seek more fucking advice.</p>
              <p>Last but not least. Fuck start ur move now. and fuck stop your blabla</p>
