            <div class='col-md body'>I'm from private sector and doing sales. Here is my 2 cents about option B<br><br>1) How much you earn not = how hard you work. It depends on a few main factors, i.e. contacts, opportunities, market (which goes up and down), luck. It also depends on your job, mostly to do with commission based then you can achieve "How much you earn = how hard you work"<br><br>2) Setting up your own business firstly requires capital investment, 2ndly contacts and the planning and experience and know-how, so your "abilities" dun really come into the picture.<br><br>3) Banker/Broker needs certificate (which can be easily obtained depending), furthermore, you need the bank/firm to accept you first and not everyone can get the job (even you have 99% confidence in yourself in crossing the round of interview, there is always other factors to consider), meaning to say what you want might not = what you get. So risk is involved if you fail to get these type of jobs that you want and end up getting a fixed salary pay job<br><br></div>
