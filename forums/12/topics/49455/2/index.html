            <div class='col-md body'>Hey Angeline, I am so sorry to hear about your granny. What I can offer to you are my prayers. Sometimes it is better to let go. It could be for the better of everyone. But as for now, just play your part as her grand daughter and be there for her when she needs you. She will surely notice your true love for her, and it will not be forgotten.<br><br>I hope that whatever the outcome may be, the people around you will see that your family may be "small" on the outside, but BIG on the inside.<br><br>Even of your granny has to go, smile and say that it was the best decision as this is beyond your control, and she has probably gone to a better place.<br><br>All the best.</div>

When life ends,  everything will return back to Zero. So y not abandon your ill feelings towards her and let her feel some warmth in this world ? Her life may not be much anymore, so I hope your family and you could accompany thru this last phase of her Life ...<br><br>Bless your Grandma.</div>
