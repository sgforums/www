            <div class='col-md body'>Receive a call from my mama yesterday, that grandma is is hospital.. heard that her condition was quite critical... I dunno how I should react upon listening to this news.....<br><br>Ever heard from my daddy that my grandma wasn't good to him, even after my mummy and daddy married. Although Mummy and Daddy tried very hard to please her but she is kinda biased towards the other kids...<br><br>When I was young, I was kinda close to my grandma. She's a buddhist. She would go to temple to pray and chant and I too would go with her.... and everything was fine. Maybe becos I'm young, and I am not able to "see" anything from the adults.<br><br>Until when I grew up older, I began to find out that the relatives of my daddy's side wasn't that good at all.... they often despised us cos we were not of so wealthy~~ but when they are in need for help, my parents would help them...<br><br>I can remember my daddy help my uncle to pay debts from loan sharks, my house was sprayed with paint, my auntie need $$ my parents also borrowed her without a single word/ hesistation, my 1st uncle had a mistress, my parents also helped him...even we were poor and every penny that my parents saved are hard earned $$ In the end?????? We were often regard as the lowest..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> They would often compared their kids results with us..(my brother and I). I admit my results may not be able to go up to those top schools., But I did tried my best..<br><br>Now grandma is in critical condition, seems like no one is willing to help... and started to push their responsibility away to us again... I haven;t been toking to grandma since sec sch.. and my feelings towards her is not that strong anymore... after many things she have done with my aunties and uncles to my parents... So i dunno how I should react upon hearing this..... Somehow I feel that she is very pitiful.... cos my aunties dun seems to want to care about her at all...<br><br>my uncles? i have 3 uncles, 1 busy with 2 mistress, 1 everyday mixed with uncle beng and seng.... one has only $$ in his mind.... I just hope grandma will be fine...... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>

I dunno how I should react upon listening to this news.....<br><br>Ever heard from my daddy that my grandma wasn't good to him, even after my mummy and daddy married. Although Mummy and Daddy tried very hard to please her but she is kinda biased towards the other kids...<br><br>When I was young, I was kinda close to my grandma. She's a buddhist. She would go to temple to pray and chant and I too would go with her.... and everything was fine. Maybe becos I'm young, and I am not able to "see" anything from the adults.<br><br>Until when I grew up older, I began to find out that the relatives of my daddy's side wasn't that good at all.... they often despised us cos we were not of so wealthy~~ but when they are in need for help, my parents would help them...<br><br>I can remember my daddy help my uncle to pay debts from loan sharks, my house was sprayed with paint, my auntie need $$ my parents also borrowed her without a single word/ hesistation, my 1st uncle had a mistress, my parents also helped him...even we were poor and every penny that my parents saved are hard earned $$ In the end?????? We were often regard as the lowest..<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> They would often compared their kids results with us..(my brother and I). I admit my results may not be able to go up to those top schools., But I did tried my best..<br><br>Now grandma is in critical condition, seems like no one is willing to help... and started to push their responsibility away to us again... I haven;t been toking to grandma since sec sch.. and my feelings towards her is not that strong anymore... after many things she have done with my aunties and uncles to my parents... So i dunno how I should react upon hearing this..... Somehow I feel that she is very pitiful.... cos my aunties dun seems to want to care about her at all...<br><br>my uncles? i have 3 uncles, 1 busy with 2 mistress, 1 everyday mixed with uncle beng and seng.... one has only $$ in his mind....

Do it for both you and your grandma's sake. If she goes, you wouldn't want her to go sadly and neither would you wanna regret not having shown her more love...  Forget about her past mistakes.
