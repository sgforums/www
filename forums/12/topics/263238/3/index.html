            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by jojobeach:<br>Actually, at 4 years old, the boy should be able to self feed.<br>Foods like pancakes are "finger food".  He shouldn't need the older sister to feed him.<br><strong>ummm...the boy is 8mths old the girl tat fed the bb is 4yrs ,eldest is 8yrs...</strong><br>Depending on the dexterity of the child, a 4 year old should also be able to use spoons or forks to feed himself, although they may be messy when they do. Note that he should be using safety forks , available in the infant departments. Do not let them run around with drinking straws or forks, incase they trip and fall, they will get hurt.<br><br>A 8 year old shouldn't have to look after any younger child, usually children who are at least 12 years old are given the responsibilities to take care of younger siblings.<br>8 year old may be considered independent, but they lack the rational to care for young kids.<br><br>I think your friend's wife is trying to sneak in a break since she thinks the children are doing ok with you. Means she actually trust you enough to help her handle the children.<br>I bet you make a good father later.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><strong>@,.@...but she shd at least see i got things to do ma...but i do enjoy having time teaching kids only when im free..</strong><br>About the discipline part, there is always a good cop and a bad cop in the family.<br>Meaning, is your friend the more strict disciplinarian ? If he is, then the mother must play a more lenient role. You cannot have 2 parents being the strict punisher. This is to make sure the children won't feel trap and develop a complex.<br><strong>my frd is strict but he reali has no time for the discipline things...</strong><br>When I was living with my brother's family. My brother was very strict, sometimes his punishments are very extreme. I used to have to use my body to shield my nephews because my brother is very heavy handed when he spank the children. So, my nephews are very close to me, because they know I protect them. Children are smarter than we like to give them credit for.<br><br>Child proofing the home.<br>Meaning you anticipate any possible dangers in the home and prevent it from happening.<br>Children are very curious creatures. They like to get into EVERYTHING.<br>Things you need to be careful are...<br>Electrical outlets. Get some plastic plugs.<br>Control knobs/movable parts, these are finger traps or if they come off, choking hazards.<br>Electrical wirings/cords, babies will chew on it, electrocution and strangulations.<br>Kitchens, knifes, access to fire stove.<br>Sharp corners , example, coffee tables,<br>Unstable furniture, babies learning to walk will grab onto furnitures to pull themself up. Sometimes heavy furniture can topple and crush them.<br>Bath, toilet..pails of water,  2 inch of water is all you need to drown a baby.<br>Chemicals or medications. Toxic to children, always keep them out of reach.<br>Super glues, alcohols... dangerous to young children.<br>Install gates to contain young child.<br><br>Some items you can find in the stores are like electrical plugs, wiring covers, corner protectors, door knobs covers, drawers locks. et cetera.<br>I found a website that has a lot of the stuff I mentioned, But I think this one is not in Singapore. But you should take a look so you know what I am talking about.<br>http://www.onestepahead.com/catalog/section.jsp?siteId=117&amp;parentCategoryId=85183<br><strong>!!!...u hv kids?????i bet u do!</strong><br>Yes is a lot of work, but you only have to do it once. At least untill the youngest is about 3 years old.<br>Also, it is better than having to rush to Emergency Room and wait hours.<br>My brother says it is a small investment to prevent disasters.<br><strong>true...</strong><br>Before that, it is best to keep furnitures to the minimum. Since children likes to climb, it's in their nature to explore.<br>I used to have to pluck my nephews and niece off tables and grill gates. And they can really climb high.... because they have no sense of fear at such a young age.<br>Sometimes I help out my SIL, so she can get some time to do her own stuff like cutting nails, get a shower, run downstairs to tah bao her favourite hawker food. All these little things are great help to her.<br><br>I found the website that offers part-time nanny/babysitter.<br>They seem to charge reasonable rates at $10 per hour.<br>Not sure if the minimum hours apply to part-time service.<br>It is worth it for your friend's wife to have someone come in once a while to give her some "time- off"<br>http://www.a-team.com.sg/</blockquote><strong>this is a great idea!!! seriously u hv been a great help</strong><br><br></div>
