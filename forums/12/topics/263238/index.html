Btw she owns some properties in Sg and she rents all out..in a way or another she is "pro" in this rental thing. My reason of renting out at such price is b cos this frd of mine works 15hrs a day to earn $2k++ and surpport his wife and kids. Seriously i cant take that kind of 700 crap frm him. He told me he can afford like 500 then i offered him at 450 as a small help.<br>[b]1st question-&gt;is my rental pricing reasonable?</strong><br>For this 3weeks my wife and myslf realli tried hard to merge with their life style..trying to live as a bigger family under one roof. My frd leaves for work at like 5am then comes home at like 10pm...always not ard. His wife stays home doing bit of house work and "looks after" their kids. MAIN problem is that i find that she is not able to decepline her kids...the bb we dun say lar cos bb sure noisy one wad...elders daughter has got a bad habit of enjoying irritating the 4yr daughter...and this younger girl has got this freaking habit of screaming eveyone heads off ANYTIME ANYWHERE!! And when she does that her mom jus seems like it "Normal"...its like 3am now and they jus came home 1hr+ ago dunno frm where...the elder girl is suppose to bath the younger one...and hell...they fought in the bath room...the gril reali scream like...i oso dunno like wad..its freaking 1:30am lei!!!the mother inside the room like nothing has happened...btw the girls fight lasted for like 20mins...untill i have to talk to them...and it still didnt stop then i hv to go to knock at their room to tell his wife the kids are crying,fighting...screaming...@#$%^&amp;* she asked my..."She cry meh?"...then i just go bact to my desk to don my work...in my heat i was thinking...U RELI CANT HEAR???<br><strong>2nd question-&gt;wad the fark is wrong with his wife???</strong><br>The 2 daughters got 1 freaking same problem is that they'v got itchy hands!! Whoever tells them not to touch this or that they will freaking do it when u r not looking at them....the 1st week the younger girl manage to hang my PC...for like 2times.Last week the elder girl manage to hang my wife's laptop...last weel oso the younger manage to breat my DVD player's dice tray...WTF is wrong man!!! I seriously wants to help my old frd...hes an ex-convict..its hard for him to manage outside now...i reali want to help...im having stress frm my mom...and i cant bare to see my wife having to put up with this acting like nothing has happened...<br><strong>3rd question-&gt;i reli dunno wad to do...pls help me...pls...</strong>[/b]</blockquote>You have a good heart and pray the superior beings will reward you for your kindness and generosity.<br><br>Now let's deal with your problem:-<br><br>Have a heart to heart talk with your friend about the children's problem. Be honest but be firm in telling him his wife is not doing her part in disciplining the kids. 8 years old is old enough to listen. Tell your friend IF his wife refuse to discipline the kids when he is not around, you will take matter into hand and discipline the kids. Emphasize heavily that you and your wife need your nightly peaceful sleep too!<br><br>You did say your friend doesn't earn a lot, 2k only BUT he has to know you have already extended extra helping hand to him but renting him so cheaply for 5 person! Tell him if his daughter break anything you will make him pay however painful it is for you to do YOU HAVE to do it. Your friend has to know where he and his family stand. Just because they are poor doesn't mean they can take overly advantage of you. Poor people also need to learn good manners and etiquettes.<br><br>If his wife pick a quarrel with you over the kids tell your friend to go live somewhere else. You have done your best as a friend so no need to feel guilty or paiseh one.</div>
