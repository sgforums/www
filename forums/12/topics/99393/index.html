You must be confident of yourself and with what you do.<br><br>And surely enough, do not have the thinking that money must always be splurged on girls, they are not some form of entertainment where money must be splurged on. Appropriately, going dutch will do.<br><br>All you have to do is to open your mouth and ask to "date" a girl. But do not behave beyond what is expected of a friend.<br><br>Anyway, "dates" are meant to be fun, so just relax and enjoy. Every "date" will get you to learn more about communication skills.</div>
