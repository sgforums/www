            <div class='col-md body'>To lose weight - only two things work - what or how little you put in (diet) and what  and how much you put out (work out).  For fast result, try the high protein, low carbo diet - as little rice, bread and noodles (none is the best).  Carbo from vegs/fruits (good fibre) while protein from fish/chicken/tofu.  Work out (cardio - jogging, cycling, etc) at least 40 mins, 3 -4 times a week.  Do this for 6 weeks and you will see some good results, and you can slowly increase your carbo.  Forget about those diet pills or slimming centre.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Read this in the Reader's Digest:<br><br>There are two ways to slim down: Diet or exercise. If you want a quick fix, then dieting is the fastest way. It uses up more kilojoules than excerising. However, do remember your body will burn up your muscles first before they act on the fats.<br><br>If you choose exercise, try to have a fixed regular regime. Minimum twice a week. Each time an hour. Try jogging. Not only you can enjoy the scenery around you, the fresh air may do you good too.<br><br>Studies have shown that those who combine dieting AND excerise have the best overall effect in the long term.<br><br>One more note of caution : Experiments have also shown that people will consume more of a substance when the item is classified as 'low-fat'. This should be avoided.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm... usually i won't answer for this kinda msgs.. but since my frens say i slim down liao i think i can qualify to give advice.<br><br>1. Breakfast eat only 1 piece of bread with anything u want on it. Peanut butter/ butter/ eggs/etc.<br><br>2. Lunch:<br><br>This is what i do for lunch:<br><br>Monday: Lotsa water &amp; fruits only<br><br>Tues to fri:  anything i want but must eat in moderation. Try 2 servings of veggie and 1 serving of meat. For meat, try to eat more fish. Anything with soup is good (ie soup noodles). Oh yeah when u eat noodles, eat more of the white noodles than the yellow ones.<br><br>Sat &amp; Sun: eat anything u want.<br>(Sometimes i skip lunch on weekdays but drink a soup/water with biscuits).<br><br>3. Dinner: Have at least 1 serving of veggie, 1 fish and 1 red meat. Don't forget your fruits!<br><br>For lunch and dinner, cut down on the rice.<br><br>Drink more water and eat more soupy stuff. Liquids fill your stomach. But according to my fren, take liquids in moderation otherwise got water retention...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br>AND.... NO SOFT DRINKS!!<br><br>Occassional green tea / barley / etc. is ok. Stay off coke, pepsi, 7-up etc.<br><br>Excercise at once a week / twice a mth if u're busy. Try to do 10 laps in a pool to start off with. Until your body can take it, do more laps and swim at a faster speed. If you really hate to excercise (like me), don't force yourself to a rigid excercise schedule, eg. every week must excercise.<br><br>Do it when the mood hits u, or when you're bored.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>our primary fuel source for the body is actually carbohydrates.. so by actually cutting down onthe comsumption of carbs and taking in alot of fruits and entering a serious calorie deficit, the body would start tranfering protein outta ur muscles and deaminate it to form carbs.. eventually wasting muscle and become flabby<br>however it is possible to get ur body to adapt to an alternative fuel source which is FAT! ever heard of fight poison with poison? i was fat once and i tried this thing called the keto diet.. but if u r diabetic dont bother going on, it would kill u.. if not then its fine <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br>this diet involves the consumption of large portion of fat and protien in ur diet even saturated fat and cutting down carbs to a minimum and also take in protein..<br>ur body would experience a metabolic shift and become a fat burning machine and no longer a carb burning one! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>if u r interested to find out more, u can PM me and maybe i can explain to u the concepts in greater detail.. but make sure u r not diabetic first! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

He doesn't even see you like what a bf should (beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder), instead he dump you because you are slightly overweight.<br><br>Come on Bubbles, be smart and rational here. Do whatever you need to slim down, look better, etc to get your self confidence boosting, If you succeed, trust me, you won't want to go back to him because other better guys would be trying to court you. Even if you can't slim down, be happy and positive about it. Someone in the world will bound to love you for who you are.<br><br>One very important fact to enlighten you: For a guy, if he DOESN'T love you for who you are, he will remain with you for either of the 3 reasons.<br><br>For company (No gf now, sian half)<br>For money (No money liao, sian half)<br>For sex. (Handjob again, sian half)<br><br>So whats the point? FORGET ABOUT HIM LAR.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>dump him..no point...loving for looks aint the type of boy u need. Though looks are essential in this contemporary age, u cant do anything about it. You go on a diet, u gotta watch for your health. Put your self-happiness above all else. There are boys who love for love and not love for looks. Its just what i feel. Find the right man.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>if he dumped you because you are fat then I think that would be a good inspiration to lose weight and if ever you are successful, don't go back to him again, it is not worth it and if you get to gain weight again then he will dump you again. don't try to win him back because it is not worth it.</div>
