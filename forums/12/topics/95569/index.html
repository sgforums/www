I don't think that you hold any special place in his heart other than to satisfy his sexual desires and fantasies which he would want from your best friend but did not get (i'm assuming here issit the case?) Either way, he would hurt you again and again yet you because of your love to him would be prone to forgive him and carry on pleasing him. This relationship is not even a BGR, u're being made used of!<br>Look he seeks you when he's down and needs company and acts like u're nothing to him in front of you when he's with your best friend.<br>It's really sad for me to say this but I think it's best that u put him out of your mind as he is not reciprocating your love to him and not let him continue to hurt u again and again.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I sympathize with you. I know how it is like to have this weakness, to love someone so much that you are willing to let him hurt you times and again. Soemtimes maybe you do feel helpless because you can't seem to control yourself and end up going back to him.<br><br>I think every human being is controlled by their emotion to some extent. Since he stirs up a lot of emotion in you, I think the best way is to just not see him for the time being. Give your heart time to heal. Spend time with yourself, with your friends. Tell yourself he is not worthy of your love and attention because he is just using you to his own advantage.<br><br>Hopefully one day you will meet someone right for you. Someone who will treat you right and not just use you for his own satisfaction.<br><br>i.c.y</div>
