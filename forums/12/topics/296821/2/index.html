It may be a small matter but such an outburst can be both awkward &amp; embarrassing for him. This is just an illustration what I am trying to point out here is that you should not be self assuming and take things for granted.<br><br>In a r/s, one must be loving and understanding towards our partners and never leave out details. Always think twice whether you have left out certain details that might have made your partner left out or pissed. And as you are aware of your mood swings during your PMS and periods you should always warn your partner about it. If it is getting out of hand, then you should consult your physician and have it examined. Remember health is equally important here too.<br><br>In your post, you did not even mentioned that you had apologized and I would highly recommend that you pick up the phone and say that you are sorry for what you did. It never hurts to be the 1st to admit fault.<br><br>"The fastest way to end a war is to LOOSE it!" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

It may be a small matter but such an outburst can be both awkward &amp; embarrassing for him. This is just an illustration what I am trying to point out here is that you should not be self assuming and take things for granted.<br><br>In a r/s, one must be loving and understanding towards our partners and never leave out details. Always think twice whether you have left out certain details that might have made your partner left out or pissed. And as you are aware of your mood swings during your PMS and periods you should always warn your partner about it. If it is getting out of hand, then you should consult your physician and have it examined. Remember health is equally important here too.<br><br>In your post, you did not even mentioned that you had apologized and I would highly recommend that you pick up the phone and say that you are sorry for what you did. It never hurts to be the 1st to admit fault.<br><br>"The fastest way to end a war is to LOOSE it!" <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </div></blockquote>I apologized. Still no reply. But frankly, I dont know what I am apologizing for. I see no fault in my part.<br><br>I dont know how to explain how i am feeling right now. Sadness + Anger + frustration + confusion. Everything mixed together. I dont know whether I want to continue this relationship. All I want to know is WHY. If he wants to break up, then say up. I will learn to let go.<br><br>What happened was that he went out with his friends for 3 days straight and I asked if he can dont go. So that we can play game together, like we always do. He didnt reply since then. Both of us were at home, so there wasnt an outburst in public or anything like that.</div>

You had apologized - that's good even though you see no fault in your part. Sorry but I had to remind you that you had admitted that it was partially your fault.<br><br>Look here, let me tell you straight. In a r/s there is never a true right and wrong. When the both of you have differences it is always both at fault. One at fault and the other cannot accept the fault. I think one should never emphasize that he/she will have RIGHTS here and there. One should be more responsible not only for oneself but for the other party as well.<br><br>Even you will need time to cool down so does your partner. Don't expect immediate turnaround. Give your partner some time and yourself time to cool down and stop all the negativity that is eating inside you. Why must you always look for that break up when there are possible alternatives and perception. Why don't you go out with your circle of friends for a while and let time do the work? Both of you are young and so many friends just take it easy and have a "break". Have a KIT KAT? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Even though u might have no idea WHY, wanting to know the reason behind his actions and perhaps is feeling insecure about it. I don't get why he has to put his friendster statue as "single" and this obviously aggravates the situation.<br><br>Nevertheless, if you still love him. Perhaps you should wait for a month or so to cool down and try to approach him again. Concentrate on something positive and forget about this incident for the time being.<br><br>Yeah i agreed with aremeis: don't let the negativity and paranoid thinking eats you up. Live your life happily. Maybe there will be a turn of tide since he has not asked for a seperation yet.<br><br>But if he is angry and has ignored U for more a month.Seriously, u have to rethink about this relationship. Can you tahan his ways of handling conflicts in a relationship ? If i'm the gf, i will dump my BF for taking his GF for granted.<br><br></div>
