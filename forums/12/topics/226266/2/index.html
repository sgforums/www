We will post a question here wondering if that someone likes us, or talk about our failed relationships etc. One common trend is that we like so-and-so, or we think of so-and-so, but we think that it may not be worth our while to go and approach that person or something, because of various reasons.<br><br>THAT, actually is our problem, and not whether the person like us or not. When we do something, we have to think of million and one things first, before we dare even take that first step. But, think about it: If we had taken that first step, such as talking to her/him, SMS/MSN or whatever, won't it have solve a lot of problems? Do not neglect the power of 1 small step. It usually is the step to big things and accomplishments. Just ask those who are brave enough to approach people they like, and now is soaked in bliss of love.<br><br>For the TS, since the girl already has a bf, just let it be. The chance of chasing her was long gone..May u find another better one.</div>
