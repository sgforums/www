            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>have a gf of 6 years, both of us are in our mid twenties now, i am abt to leave army and she jus got a new job.<br><br>my personality is i m always cautious in wadever i do and i dun trust pple easily because of my past experiences<br><br>my gf has less of this experiences, during her poly times or even outside life, there are times where pple try to cheat her in sch projects or her money or even insurance scams, i m the one who pull her out of it in the last min, i m not paranoid but all these things prove to be true until later<br><br>she is very well protected by her parents cos she is the youngest child,<br>i can say shes is not streetwise<br>simple things like walkin in the carpark, a car has its reverse lights on, she will still walk straight into it, many at time i have to pull her out of it.<br><br>she has a history of depression, its clinically proven, she cant take stress, when shes stress, she cant think, she will breakdown. she breaksdown during sch projects, she breakdown when we are locked out in a stairccase. during her sec sch days, she has tried to commit sucide, i mean she did but was saved in time<br><br>i met her in poly, 6 yrs until now, we have our ups and downs, n all these while i been giving in to her temper because i knew her history, shes bery emotional n gets angry bery easily,  but we were happy on the whole, i can say shes quite dpendant on me, as in most of the time she will seek my advices in everything she do<br><br>her emotions are more or less stablised during the times wif me, except for small squabbles or she will occasionally breakdown because of work, but given the comparison during her younger days its alot more stable<br><br>the real problem now is her new job,<br>her previous job, all abt 3- 4 of them are all below 2k n squeeze her dry<br>no matter how low or difficult her job is, she will always try her best to do it well, n given her volatile nature she has become a bery unhappy person, shes always calling me n scolding me n yelling at me, she admitted to me this is her avenue to take out her stress, but after which, things jus continue as normal<br>u can say her conceientious working attitude is crashing wif her emotions<br>i have no problems taking all these, because i knew her history, sometimes, i make abit of noise when i feel like i m being taken for granted but things were going fine, most of the time we were bery happy together<br><br>she was approach recently by a US MNC, they offered her a salary of 2-3times her pay now, beginning when she told me , i was quite wary because to me a dip holder who work for only 2-3 yrs to hit this kind of pay is not bery posibble, but she told me this firm is actually her supplier in her previous firm n the boss like the way she do things, n the pay is so high because its paying in US dollars and according to US pay rate. i told her if she feels safe she shld give it a try since shes not happy in her current job<br><br>she will need to go for training in the US HQ wif the director for a week.<br>she say the guy is ok, cos she knew him abt a yr during their business dealings in her previous jobs, but she only knew him as supplier thru fone n email corrospondences not as a person.<br><br>u can say given her lack of streetwise i was bery worried because to me, its like entrusting my gf wif a total stranger in a foreign land. the guy is a married man 10 yrs her senior.<br><br>the first 4 days of her training, things were quite ok, i tried to call her as little as possible, i called her every alternate days, each time prolly jus 3 mins. after her office hrs so as not to disturb her.<br><br>the problem came on the 4th day, i called her a few times but shes not answering, so naturally i was jus slightly worried cos its not her time to start work yet n its her waking hrs, abt half an hr later she answered the fone, she sounded bery stressup n ask why i keep calling, i jus said i wan to see how is she cos i have tok to her for 2 days, i was sounding abit irritated as well cos  i didnt had a gd day, she started yelling n i started yelling, i couldnt take it n cut her off, later i msg her i m sorry, i jus lose it, but her fone was off. i told her if she dun call me back i m going to call her boss or her hotel, i didnt mean it, i jus wan to talk to her<br><br>up till the 7day, the day shes suppose to return, i checked her flight schedule n found her 1st flight was delayed n she missed her transit flight. i tried calling her but her fone was off all the way. 6hrs later, there was still no news, i called the airline , they refuse to tell me anything, i call her hotel , they say they have checked out.<br><br>i kept waiting n waiting, until i have no choice but to call her boss, he did not answer the fone, i send him an sms saying i m aware they missed their flight n how r things, n how is she. he replied a few hrs later " i dont know"<br><br>his reply is chilling because a total stranger is wif my gf in a foreign land n now he tells me i duno. i do not know how is she, i do not know where is she and i do not know  if shes harm, tots of bad things flow to my mind, her cousin was actually murdered jus some mths ago by his roomate.<br><br>i msg him back, saying if he sees her jus ask her to call back home as her parents are worried as well<br><br>hrs after hrs, calls after calls, i was going out of my mind, cos she is so dear to me, until i receive a call from her mom sayin shes ok, i was relieve but i still i hoped to talk to her, i msg her boss again, saying i hope to talk to her , can i have her current hotel room number n name, he gave me a number, i called, but she blocked off all calls.<br><br>her airline has only a flight returning daily, i went to the airport n waited for them, its might be a empty wait because i have already exhausted all means of communicating her n i dun wan to disturb her boss any longer, finally i caught them, she was bery emotional to see me, she ask me to leave her n she tells me she wants to end her relationship, her  boss told me to leave her alone also, saying i m givin her bad time when she is in US, he say he will send her home himself n ask me to give her soemtime to cool down<br><br>i was bery puzzled, because to me, its jus merely a misunderstanding, things happen b4 but her reaction was neber this big, she screamed at me at the airport, as if i cheated on her behind her back or i did something really wrong. 6 yrs all the way, i have neber cheated on her, i have neber touched another girl, shes all i ever had. i asked for 5 mins wif her, she say she wanted to end it, i say wad really happen n  she say she feel suffocated and she wants to do wel in this job n i m in her way. i m addin all her stress on her n she cant concentrate<br><br>i was desperate for her to listen to me, i asked her if anyone has been bad mouthing me, cos of her emotional weakness, many pple have made used of her including her friends who psycho her to cheat my money  when we first met, u can say shes the type who trust n belive pple easily<br><br>she kept wanting to leave home wif her boss but i was desperate to talk to her, i asked if her boss has been bad mouhing her to leave me, i told her hes a total stranger n she shld think properly b4 believing anything, we dun even know his background but somehow all these words became he got a lousy bavkground, he has a criminal record, i duno how come it tansform to all these thigns, but at that time i was really on the verge of breaking down, i was doing eveything i could to get her back, i m not a person who speaks bad abt another person but somehow i duno how the msg was relayed, everything was going entirely wrong<br><br>she left wif her boss, i drove to her place, her dad went down to helped her wif her luggage, i went up n asked her dad whether i can talk to her, he let me into the hse<br><br>but 1st thing he question me was why did i badmouth pple, i duno how to ans him, , i somehow feel even more hurt that my gf told him everything and i duno how they interpret until this way<br>, we were a bery closed couple, we knew each other problems n we have neber let it out beyond any 3rd party, i m in no grounds to compete wif her boss, hes a succeessful regional director who earn easily 5 to 6 digits a mth, i m jus a measly nsf who earns 440 a mth<br><br>i neber had the chance to talk to her b4 her dad chase me out of the hse, all she told me was she dun wan to see me again<br><br>is there really no hope in this relationship anymore ? can a 6 yrs relationship jus be gone in 7 days ?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My first reaction would be WTF<br><br>But there are more than one side to any story. What really went on in the US is unknown, and what are the exact things you said to her are also not clear. Whether her boss is really keeping her as a mistress is also still unknown. Why would she want to leave with her boss? And as you said she's very protected by her parents, so why would her father just allow her to leave with him? - Things to ponder about.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>If i were you i might breakdown. After giving and putting so much love and this happened.<br><br>But do know do silly things.( Things that will get you no where. Teaching the boss a learn will get you no where. )<br><br>If i were you, i will give her like 2 or 3 days to cool down. Then try to find her and talk about things. If she keep refuse to see you, i will go to her house for the last  and only last time. Talk to her dad or mum about this and how u really feel. ABout the bad mouth things, tell her dad that things just came out of your mouth as you were confused and really out of control due to the sudden news that you get (the breaking up from no where). *talk in a nice manner. I know this hard and you might get heated up, but pls ... try ... this is the only way.* Talking in a nice manner really means alot here.<br><br>If things still remain the same.(Your gf still want a break-up) My advice for you is let her regret her choice. Live a better life and work toward a better future. Anyone can earn the kind of money. You can too. I know its hard, saying is easier than doing it. Bear the pain, get your friends out and chill and complain to them. Cry out loud. Its ok to cry out loud. But u must put yourself together after that.<br><br>***PLS DO NOT DO STUPID THINGS THAT YOU WILL REGRET AND THINGS THAT WILL BLIND YOUR FUTURE***<br><br>If things really cannot be your way, bear the pain. You are in mid 20s and a bright life is still ahead. Trust me, you can lead a better life. In this world, NO ONE LIVE FOR ANOTHER. LIVE FOR URSELF.<br><br>***PLS DO NOT DO STUPID THINGS THAT YOU WILL REGRET AND THINGS THAT WILL BLIND YOUR FUTURE***<br><br>May happiness be with you after this situation.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I 'think' (I may be wrong), something has happened overseas. Being the weak minded gf she is, it is highly likely the boss has influenced her and planted seeds of hatred and doubt against you. Alternatively, she has been coerced or unknowingly trapped into doing something she did not intend to do and has been blackmailed for it, wish she cant or would not tell you and maybe she is shouldering all the burden by herself. Perhaps you may be hurt by what she has done hence she is trying to break it off with you asap<br><br>About the lawsuits/legal action, it looks like he is trying to stop you from seeing her and end your relationship with her. When you mentioned he called your phone and warned you not to say anything, it is obvious that he is up to something.<br><br>Right now, what you should do is to take action regarding the guy. Either you seek legal action against him, or legal advice, call his bluff, and so on. All I can say that you have a long battle ahead and it will be emotionally and mentally taxing.
