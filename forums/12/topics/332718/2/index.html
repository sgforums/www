              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> Why insist on getting back together when he isn't ready?</p>
              <p>You seemed to run your relationship based on the fluctuation of your emotions - it's no wonder why your relationship would often vacillate into both extremes and end up snapping violently.</p>
              <p>Before you decide to patch, you got to consider some things very carefully: if the management of your relationship is still going to persist in such a fashion, then you will probably break up somewhere later in the future... again. Coming back together is no magic - it's just a decision to return back to old shit. Returning 'home' on a later date doesn't mean that the old shit are cleanse - it's still there waiting for you to do something about it.</p>
              <p>Unless you make sure that your relationship evolved through your own human revolution - there isn't a point to return - just because your emotions feel like it has to be it, doesn't mean it has to be it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"></p>

              <p>I don't have advice to give, but I'm just sharing what I went through, if you'd care to read. Almost 7 months ago, similarly, I initiated a break with my boyfriend because of some insignificant squabbles. I agree with some of the posts here; he probably let go because I used a break up as the solution more than once. During that period of time, I really regretted. But there was nothing I could do; because unlike you, he gave me a straight 'no' for an answer. So it was all over.</p>
              <p>I did, however, keep my options open. I went out with another guy for about 2 months. But I ended that relationship because firstly, I felt that he did not respect me much, and secondly, it was because I realised what I was doing was wrong; I went out with someone I did not return romantic feelings for, probably to try to forget about my ex.</p>
              <p>Okay, so here's the weird (I don't know how to explain it, so I'll just settle for 'weird') thing. Just about 2-3 weeks ago, my ex-boyfriend (the first guy of course), told me that he still liked me. At that time, I didn't know what to do. I even doubted it and thought that it was a prank, because it was just on msn. Anyway, I now know that it was really him, because I clarified it with him. However, he wouldn't do anything else; he even sound like he didn't tell me anything (he wants me to take the initiative to patch stuff up, I think). And of course, only after my major exams.</p>
              <p>So, well, I'm just sharing this because your problem seems similar to mine. However, I've been through more after the break, so I can without a doubt say that he's still the guy I truly love. For this, I'm willing to wait. Well, for now and the near future, I still am. :)</p>

              <p>hmm. my advice is.. learn what went wrong in ur previous relationship before stepping into the next one. u might be bringing in old baggages.</p>
              <p>the problem could be you're not reasonable etc.</p>
