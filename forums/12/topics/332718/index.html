              <p>hard man... dont always use break up as a way to win an arguement. All it does is to create a larger crack between the 2 of you. Sooner or later the relationship will crumble due to these cracks.</p>
              <p>anyway, I think he is probably enjoying his singlehood for now. What you can do is to move on. Carry on with your life. If you love him, no harm keeping him in a corner of your heart. Let him enjoy abit and one day, if he still loves you, he will be back. Then it will be up to you to see if you accept him. If another better person comes round while he still hasnt come back, then maybe you would want to consider giving him up.</p>

              <p><br>not that i sound bitter or i nv felt what love was.</p>
              <p>i know how u feel now lor.. since he already decide not to go back to u already, just move on. no need to keep harping on this r/s.</p>
              <p>MSN can put anything he like. maybe he feels lonely at home or not used to not having u on a saturday. yet, he doesnt even bother abt u anymore. y cling on?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>maybe he had enuff of u always say "break lah break lah" after a small disagreement. he prob doesnt feel that this r/s is worth it anymore.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i know how girls will act during little couple squabble. we girl will always say "not happy, brk lor" once, twice, 3rd time, he will do it.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>without him, u will survive. unless u are some 15 yr old with a good future ahead of u and wants to jump down from some building and give up everything for this worthless crap.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if u 2 are really fated, even 10 yrs down the road, u will still be tgt. y cry over spilled milk?</p>

              <p><br>i used to "try to save back regardless of wad ppl say" too.</p>
              <p>but in the end, i asked myself (and jusagerl shld ask urself too)</p>
              <p>1. is he truly happy?</p>
              <p>2. am i truly happy?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>mybe 1st few days to a week, u will be very very happy. but after that? he will start to show some unhappines. and u will start to ask " am i really happy?"</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>some times it's not abt wad ppl say, it's abt how u feel....</p>

              <p>U cant blame him... sometimes girls does not understand that when tehy refuses to give in or admit their faults in a relationship, it actually strains the relationship because it gives the guy an impression that the girl is taking everything for granted and want to be treated like a princess... so maybe this time he really cannot take it and insist on breaking up..</p>
              <p>Sometimes i just dont agree that a girl must be treated like a princess or guys must give in to the girl no matter whether right or wrong to show that guy loves the girl...
