            <div class='col-md body'>One word answer: no.<br><br>I will never ever get in the way of two people who are in love.<br><br>If you think that it's easy for me to say that cos I've never been in that kind of situation, think again. I was in such a situation once.<br><br>I fell in love with my junior. She was such a sweet and charming girl.<br><br>Unfortunately, she fell in love with another guy (another junior!)<br><br>My heart ached terribly. I really, really wanted to tell her how I felt about her but I realised that I couldn't. That might very well drive a wedge between them..... They really respect me as their senior (I helped the both of them with their schoolwork a lot)..... and I just didn't have the heart to risk hurting the two of them. In the end, I would end up hurting myself as well.<br><br>So I made a choice. I decided to leave them alone. Rather than risk hurting all three of us, I decided that I should be the only one who gets hurt.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"></div>
