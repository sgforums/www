My bf and I quarrelled and then this girl came into the picture. Everyday call my bf and then slowly they fall in love. Is it love or just a special feeling cos you are down and then someone come into ur life trying to do things making you happy? I actually beg the girl to leave my bf for the sake of our child but she won't, and even told my bf that I'm bullying her and my bf in the end called to scold me. I mainly just ask her to give up my bf and let him come back to me but in the end i kanna back stab by her. Its not a very gd thing to do. I told her if my bf can do this to me he will 1 day do the same thing to her also.<br><br>agree?</div>
