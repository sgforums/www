            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks for your advice,<br><br>My ex told me that I am a nice and trustable person, but just dont have enough time for her due to my studies and work. She want someone to tease her, talk to her everynight. Like a young girl kinda thing. I focus on future but she look at  the current things that makes her happy. Yet, she trusted a guy whom she know for less than 2 months! I dont know, its like entering a trap kinda thing.<br><br>Before we broke up, I asked her to give ourselves some cool down period to salvage our relationship. But just before the cool down period ends,  she initiated for a breakup and her friends told me she was actually trying out to see if that guy is trustable, if not, she would rather stay with me. Yah right, she assume that trust can be tested within a few meetups.<br><br>He is mean, I believe he made my ex to cut off all communication means away from me. Its like hell, dont know what did I do wrong, no head and no tail. Its only recent that we start to comm via email.<br><br>Its like stabbing you deep and dump you at a corner suffering.<br><br>I need to move on and hope that she do not need me in future cos if she really does, something terrible might have happened to her.<br></div>
