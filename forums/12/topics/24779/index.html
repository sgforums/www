            <div class='col-md body'>hi all, calling for help here esp. to the "old birds" in forums. maybe you all can tell me what to do..<br><br>one of my best fren, she left sg for studies in aussie, and before she left, she betrayed the trust of many many ppl around her, mostly her close frens. she did them wrong in diff ways, like cheating their trust and money.. therefore, all of them chose to know find out any news of her anymore ever since she left more than 2 years back.. i am the only one that stayed with her all these while, keeping contact with her thru phone, emails, post, and gifts etc, as i felt that although she did others wrong, and i have heard so so so so much abt her, but she has nv done me wrong.  i really can't describe how hurt i am everytime when ppl start to make v sacarstic remarks abt her, or being v skeptical in her r/s with this guy that she got to noe in aussie... these ppl had reasons to do so too, as she two-timed her previous bfs, got together with them for $$ etc.. there is just too much to say abt her.. but all these while, i chose to look at the good side of her..<br><br>the bf i mentioned above of hers was the one that studied in the same uni as her. i knew that she really loved him. she sounded really diff whenever she spoke of him..</div>

If you like, you can just find out from her why she did those things in the <span style="font-style: italic;">past....</span> But I reckon it shouldn't really matter <span style="font-style: italic;">for now</span>, afterall, it's in the past... And for god's sake, I don't even know if those things people said about her really happened.... Even if they did perhaps she'd got her own reasons for doing them...? Her story, their stories, it's up to you to believe... But take it like a pinch of salt... Most probably you won't really be able to find out the 'truth' anyway? What's more they're already the past... Not directly linked to you....<br><br>If you wanna know more just ask her, but don't push her... If not just drop the case.... Meanwhile just continue to give her your support as a friend.... I BELIEVE your support is VITAL to her 'present existence'.... You can never imagine how IMPORTANT you might be to her at this very moment....? Whatever's in the past, whatever might happens in the future... I say she's YOUR FRIEND now..?<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool">  What else can I teach you which you already not know to help her? Just keep up the <span style="font-style: italic;">good work</span> for now...? </div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>It's good to hear that you are willing to stand by her after all this unfortunate events happened to her. Whatever done is done, she has made mistakes in the past doesn't mean she will do that again. Somehow, I got this feeling that she will change for the better, or maybe she has changed already, becoz of that terrible accident happened to her bf.<br><br>Life is really weird, and I do believe in karma. I'm not suggesting anything, but if she changes for the better due to that accident, then it's really hard, for her bf to atone for her 'sins'. Maybe I'm over-reacting...don't take this paragraph too seriously.<br><br>Anyway, back to the point, support and love is what you should give her now, like what she is doing to her bed-ridden bf now. You know very well that becoz of her past mistakes, most of her friends shun her, except you, so you couldn't possibly leave her now. And being an overseas student myself currently in Australia as well, I know the feeling of being lonely. I do need my friends support back in S'pore much as she needs yours. You are the light, bring her sunshine back to her once again!<br><br>Wish her good...and take care.</div>
