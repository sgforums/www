              <p>This is my first time posting in Aunt Agony. Pardon me.</p>
              <p>What do you guys think when the girl you like couldnt accept you because of a friend.</p>
              <p>There is this girl whom i recently met in my new class.</p>
              <p>at the start, she knows that her friend like mi. so i think she decided to give in. her friend confess to mi. i rejected. she started to blame mi. why didnt i accept her friend. and she kept like "promoting" her friend. i got so angry. what if someone you likes keep promoting others to you.</p>
              <p>plucking up some courage, knowing she also have some feelings for me, i decided to confess to her shortly after. she did the same. we then continued on as per normal. never talk about this topic. one day, i started to ask her if she can accept mi. she did not want to give an answer, and say that she is not worth my time. she ask me not to wait for her, if i can find a better girl. her reason is because of her friend who likes me as well and her past experience. what do you think i should do? &lt;--</p>
              <p>EDIT: last paragraph not important anymore.</p>
              <p>although she said this. went we are out together to study, she acted as if nothing happen. we usually msn-ed every night. yesterday i went out with her, the nite she didnt come online. i sms-ed her and she didnt replied. i dont know what happened. and feeling so bad now. &lt;-- not important anymore</p>
