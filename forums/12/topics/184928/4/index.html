            <div class='col-md body'>Wooing girls? First of all u must have strong interest to go after her! and as what many people say-communication! Trying to know more of her and find out more info like her hobbies,like and dislike,thru conversation more or less know her style and character. U can communicate like MSN or hp. When courting,don't chase so tight while at the same time must show sincerity and keen. Like when sms her few times and no reply is ok but must show consistency! Everyday a few will do. Too much sms will make her frustrated and make u look desperate! U must be yrself and comfortable when courting her.<br><br>Courting gal MUST HAVE A STRATEGY and a VISION! U must come out a concrete plan. Step by step,where to go ,where to have fun,ensuring everyouting r FUN AND NICE for her! By what time ,u want to achieve what lvl with her? Courting gal is just like fighting a war,with plan strategy and well-prepare. Then u can win the war decisively,be natural is one thing,being well-prepare is another thing too. If u r well-plan,most case will take 2-3months to succeed!<br><br>Make an effort to plan yr outing,timing venue. If maybe just a simple dinner or outdoor activities,all must have well info. Like a dinner,what is the food? Is it a Western or Asian crusine? Top selling dish? Price? Ambience? Location? U must find out all the info before u venture there. Nvr go BLUNTLY! During meal time,is the best time to dig more info of her,crap with her and slowly accumulate the info of her.<br><br>Gals like to be special,make extra effort to make yr outing be special. Go to some special place with great ambience to have dinner or interesting and uncommon place for outing. Don go to the same old common pizza hut or fast food outlet to make her normal. Find out her interest and liking to tailor and cater every outing for her. Even when both of u ran out of conversation but the interesting outing u plan will create more topic and interest to talk! Yr every effort will show and she KNOWS.........<br><br></div>

Too much sms will make her frustrated and make u look desperate! U must be yrself and comfortable when courting her.<br><br>Courting gal MUST HAVE A STRATEGY and a VISION! U must come out a concrete plan. Step by step,where to go ,where to have fun,ensuring everyouting r FUN AND NICE for her! By what time ,u want to achieve what lvl with her? Courting gal is just like fighting a war,with plan strategy and well-prepare. Then u can win the war decisively,be natural is one thing,being well-prepare is another thing too. If u r well-plan,most case will take 2-3months to succeed!<br><br>Make an effort to plan yr outing,timing venue. If maybe just a simple dinner or outdoor activities,all must have well info. Like a dinner,what is the food? Is it a Western or Asian crusine? Top selling dish? Price? Ambience? Location? U must find out all the info before u venture there. Nvr go BLUNTLY! During meal time,is the best time to dig more info of her,crap with her and slowly accumulate the info of her.<br><br>Gals like to be special,make extra effort to make yr outing be special. Go to some special place with great ambience to have dinner or interesting and uncommon place for outing. Don go to the same old common pizza hut or fast food outlet to make her normal. Find out her interest and liking to tailor and cater every outing for her. Even when both of u ran out of conversation but the interesting outing u plan will create more topic and interest to talk! Yr every effort will show and she KNOWS.........<br><br></div></blockquote>Wah...so much effort required??? I think I'll go become a monk easier.</div>
