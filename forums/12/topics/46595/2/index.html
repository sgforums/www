Cant he do dat ???<br><br>Guys ... pls gimme advice .. i duno wat guys are tinking ... i reali do treasure tis relationship ... i don wana lose it again ....</div></blockquote>Dear Bubbles,<br><br>This situation involve one problem which splits to relating issues - the idea behind him going out with his collegues and not sms or calling you. Trust me, the faster way to end this relationship is to trash things out in an ugly way and forbid him to go out with his collegues, in which I suppose you wouldn't go to such extend because this shows not only a lack of trust, but petty woman acts.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You treasure this relation and fear that this could show sign that he is drifting. My answer to you is - If he wants to drift - <strong>ANY KIND </strong>of situations, he will drift. However, the things you must do is to cool your worried nature and clarify issues.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Seriously speaking - by right and theory, you should give him the benefit of the doubt unless he probably lied to you before, which made you suspicious when his actions speaks otherwise. Trust is all or nothing - either you give or deny him of your trust.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Second point - when he seemed totally normal when chatting with you on the phone speaks one obvious fact - you are thinking too much and being too sensitive. When there isn't anything wrong, of course you act yourself and the way you always were - which is what you bf is behaving. <strong>He finds it nothing wrong</strong> - this is the difference in preception. All you could do is communicate and compromise your way if you value a long term relationship - nothing can do without this two elements if you desire a long term partner.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>One small issue which you mentioned - he always go out with his collegues in advance and didn't let you know and you long for his company - the one good way to solve this is to book him in advance too. This isn't much of a problem - the real problem lies when you book him in advance and he still rather go out with his collegues - by then you could private message me or post it again to update your story.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You wished to see him and seek for his company - you have to let him know isn't it? Or tell him when he is going out with his collegues - inform you.<br><br>You mentioned further in your post saying about him not picking up your calls and until when he did - he says nothing and I presume it apology wasn't there too and that you both break up once and patch again - he asked for it.<br><br>One thing is I believe - when a relationship is over, rarely there is much to salvage back, majority of the time - it is just lenghtening the same outcome unless very few circumstances. If he wants to patch back and treat this relationship in such a way - obviously there is a need to talk things out. I mean - WHY patch IF you know and going to treat this relationship like the previous time or zero improvement?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Didn't the previous time taught him anything to make him better in dealing with the relationship this time around? This relationship is only a month old (I am saying from day you both patched) and he is already so eccentric.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Advice?<br><br>Communicate! Communicate and more communication. *aiyo I am getting naggy  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"> * There is a need to talk things - after you do communicate with him. You could update your post in here or start a new topic.<br><br>Cheers</div>

Remember me telling you that your case is a 'toughie'..? Actually, its seems for now that there's no SURE way to tell unless something happens or he just decided to let out all his thoughts....<br><br><strong>PERSONAL</strong> This is my personal reply to you. High chance is your bf is straying... He could probably be a flirt and even if he's not, he's far from someone who seems like he's gonna commit and be tied down for now... Even if that is to happen, you'll probably have to accept the fact that it's gonna be years down the line.. And if you've decided to stay for this relationship, it'll probably means ALOT more great 'challenges' ahead with his character.... Personally I won't recommend you to stay in this relationship... You're still rather YOUNG and probably kinda different in the way you view a relationship now as you would in years to come... And you probably won't see a 'fruit' in this relationship until he has more or less stablised in yet many more years to come... By then you'll probably not be so interested in what he can bring to you already... It also depends on what kinda relationship you're looking for? If you're just going for a short-term and can accept the fact that he's not gonna be commited, you probably can stay a while for now if he seems interesting enough for you...? But don't go in too deep if you're just for 'short-term'... Or BEAR the consequences...<br><br>If you've decided that what I've said to you might not be so reliable to you, you might wanna try 'Defy Orders'.... Because nothing in Life is absolute, though chances are what I've said is gonna apply to a certain extent.... In 'Defying Orders', the risk you put yourself into is a DRASTIC CHANGE in you... I've seen a couple of cases in that... Certainly not a wonderful sight...? Your view in love relationship would PROBABLY change quite alot... But also, it depends on how RATIONALE and how well you can control the 'change'... If you constantly keep in mind of this point when it happens in the future, the impact is probably gonna be much reduced.... So what I would suggest is, why not just give this one up and go for another more worthy one..? Never mind how much you've already put in... This is a lousy 'Gambler's Mentality'.... If you're losing, you're LOSING... Never mind how much money you've lost by placing on that betting table, you're probably just gonna lose even more....<br><br><strong>TECHNICAL</strong> The behaviors your bf has displayed is just his characteristics. You might be able to tolerate it for now but there might be MORE to come. Chances of STRAYING is &gt; 75% by Simple Equilibrium Analysis. 2 additional things which might provide you with more HINT of how the situation is like:<br><br><span style="color: blue;">1. How your bf behaves when he's with you and colleagues? Try to avoid you? Little attention on you?<br><br>2. How his colleagues behave when with you? (Especially when your bf's not around..) Extra friendly? Avoid you or feel awkard?</span><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">Last thing I wanna add? You might like your bf for who he was, but sometimes people DO CHANGE... Think about it....</span><br></div>
