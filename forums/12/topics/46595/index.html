He wrk as a Supervisor in Sales Line ... </div></blockquote>Let's continue... Shall we? From the things we've got till now... Your problem's a little 'toughie'... In the sense that it's 2 lines quite ambigiously close to each other now.... Might explain to you later...?<br><br>Now... More questions... Do you spend more time with him alone or such a group with his friends...? Where do you go when you're out with his friends...? Ever notice...? -&gt; How he behave when he's alone with you and when he's with his friends &amp; you (company..)? Does he feel more awkard with you're around while he's with his friends...?<br><br>Is this his 1st job? If not, what was his previous job? How long has he been in this job? Did he started off as a supervisor in this job or was he promoted halfway through...?<br><br>For now... Based on <strong>SURFACE ANALYSIS</strong>, it seems a rather high chance that he could be straying... And you shouldn't be too surprised even if he does...<br><br>It's nice of you to be so understanding of him &amp; his career... But giving him too much freedom might becomes a fault on your part in the future...? It's good to restain a little control in a relationship at times... If he's not even willing to sarcrifice a little more time for you now, I don't quite see what his future would have got to do with you in time to come...?<br><br>You're probably right about giving him his rights to fight for his work, but wanting this man more and restricting him a bit would probably make you more desirable to him... He could be those type of guys who easily take things for granted at times...<br><br>Not sure, but perhaps your age group is not there yet... As the days pass in the future, you'll probably find yourself inevitably demanding more from him... If you don't, you might be in for something even more drastic at some point of your life if this relationship of yours still exist in the future....<br></div>
