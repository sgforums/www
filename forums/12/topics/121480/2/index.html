What have you got to lose anyway? You only lived once remember??? At the most, you will be terribly embarressed when she rejects you...but at the end of your forsaken life, nobody will ever remembers what happened to you and nobody will even remember you as a person. So if you can meet that special someone and fall in love with her, have a great relationship and future...at least there is one person in this world who will miss you when you are gone eventually.<br><br>If she likes you, she will still like you even if you gave her the lamest crappiest excuse in the world to see her again. If she doesn't, she wouldn't blink an eyelid even if you hand-carved a statue of her and gave it to her.<br><br>An average person waits for good things to come to them, but an extraordinary person create good things for themselves and for the people around them. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Well, eventually it is all up to you to make up your mind and take some actions.
