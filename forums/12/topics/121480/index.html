            <div class='col-md body'>Just a few days ago, A friend of mine came from Malaysia Sabah State to Singapore for a short Visit. She is no stranger here as she had studied over here from Secondary to Poly and she left Australia for further studies. It was recently that she went back to Malaysia for a short break and dropped over Singapore.<br><br>How do I get to know her? I knew her through a friend of mine. Which is to mean I never get to see her for more than 2 years until few days back. All we did was chat on MSN and voice chat all these time. She had told me that she would look up for me when she is here from the days we started chatting untill now.<br><br>On Sunday, I finally got to see her in real person. It was amazing feeling. I could instantly recognized her and we are talking like old time friends. I had advised her on relationship and other stuffs when she was in Australia because she did not really have someone to turn to and confide herself. And this went on for like more than 2 years.<br><br>There was a time, she made pineapple tart and mailed it over to Singapore for me and also sending things like dried apple chips and walnuts and other stuffs. I was really kinda touched because of the things she did. Not that because I got special feelings for her or what.<br><br>We went from places to places to do shoppings and eating from places to places. On Monday night both of us was tired after walking around so we sat at Singapore River just opposite the Asian Civilazation Museum. The time was 130am in the morning. The whole ambience was really wonderful. We talked about tons of things and I took out my IPOD and both of us listen to Andy Lau's song.<br><br>It was then I got this feeling that....she could be just the one I have always been searching for.....but how can I be sure? How can I based on just pure intuition? Or should I used logic thinking on this rather than intuition?<br><br>Time flies pretty fast and it was already 430am in the morning. I told her its too late and she gotta get up early to leave soon. So I send her back to her hotel. Words from her "I am really happy to see you and know you" before she got off the taxi.<br><br>Next morning around 12pm. She gave me a called...but damn! I turned my mobile to silent mode so never get to talk to her before she leave.<br><br>I do not know why? I got this funny feeling in me? I constantly looked at the photos that we had taken together. And I can't help myself not to think of her and I do missed her!....<br><br>But I guess this feeling would just go away any time from now.<br>Or maybe not???<br><br></div>
