            <div class='col-md body'>Threadstarter,<br><br>It is possible that by virtue of your "lucky" background, people get jealous and make comments about you, including the so-called close friends.<br><br>You mentioned that you do not like to show off, and that wearing designer labels and driving a "normal" car is no big deal.<br><br>I agree with you, but...<br><br>...you may have overlooked the fact that owning a car without having to save and pay for it already makes people jealous.<br><br>I don't know enough to say that your behaviour is off-putting to others, but perhaps nobody can really see their own faults, can't they?<br><br>And in materialistic Singapore, people do get jealous. Even siblings can get jealous over one another, let alone friends.<br><br>The best way to entertain that cohort of jealous friends is to leave them alone, and not mix with them much.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>You may think that wearing designer clothes and having a car is not 'showing off' because you never really boast about them.<br><br>The problem is what you interpret as "show-off" and what others interpret as "show-off" is different. You tend to associate it with showing off explicitly while some others may be more sensitive to implicit showing-offs. Your possession of a car while studying overseas and wearing designer clothes may not seem like showing off to you because you did not boast about them, but to others, the mere fact that you possess them is enough for them to label you as a show-off.<br><br>In your situation, it takes 2 hands to clap. On one hand (pun may be intended), your implicit "showing-off", not that it's an offence, may just add strain. On the others, your 'friends' are starting to show their dark nature now. It's all part of human nature to be jealous and start finding faults with you.<br><br>As to the solution, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Just improve on what needs to be improved on.</div>
