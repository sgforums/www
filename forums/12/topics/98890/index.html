            <div class='col-md body'>I think action speaks louder than words.<br><br>Like my fiance, I know that he truely loves me when we just got together not too long, and I came down with food poisoning when my parents were overseas, he came over to take care of me, cook for me, clean up my mess (I vomitted so much and choked up the sink but he is willing to clean that up for me as well)<br><br>Or if he knew that I am home alone and most likely too lazy to cook and end up eating instant noodles everyday, he will actually cook and pack dinner over to eat with me. (So sweet <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">)<br><br>Or small things like waking me up every morning without fail, so that I won't oversleep for work<br><br>He's not good with words as well, but he expresses his feelings very well through his actions.</div>
