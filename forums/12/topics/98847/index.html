(p/s: i feel so becoz he seems busy and not calling me as often as before but i dunno if he's realli bo chup me). it's like i may not be pretty.. but i'm definitely not ugly? i do noe of other guys who likes me and i have rejected or tried keeping a distance from them becoz i wanted to stay faithful to him. i'm not like some lao char bo whom no one wants u noe... i noe i have my own identity, my x factor and all tt which other guys so appreciate... am i silly?<br><br>i noe i have said that i want to hold on to it in my last topic but it seems a bit too tough for me... all those discouraging tots keep appearing... and it's not like he's doing anyhting to cheer me up or little things whcih will make me feel better.... haiz.... i dunno...<br><br>and i got this silly idea.. i dunno whether it's silly...? it's like since we're not as close as before, i shouldnt let him touch me anymore rite? no kissing no hugging... would tt be weird?<br><br></div>

When you take this longing and waiting away, love is just a feeling. So when you love one person, and the other person love or don't love you it's his or her feelings. Nothing to be miserable about. But the longing and waiting is the part that is making you miserable. and it is what that is making YOU miserable now too.<br><br>Try to ignore that longing and waiting (and I know it's hard). Ask yourself if you still feel for that person. This will determine if you want out or not in your relationship. What I meant by ignoring the longing and waiting is, if you need to sleep before 11pm sleep. Why bother to wait for that phonecall? If he can't reach you then, he'll call you again. He'll make an effort to do something. WHy are you putting in so much effort and feeling miserable when he doesn't seem to be bothered by the fact that you don't call?

Junior member I am, philosophical maybe I'm not. Thanx for that though  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed">  double duckie in age. Wonder if you understand that.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  Well, if breaking up is the best choice for yourself YOU GO GIRL I SUPPORT YOU! However,  it's not a bad ending I believe. Because, at least you know you weren't alone in the love department. Juz that the need department, you were alone. that's all. get what i mean? If you think that's the best of all.... then that's good. Like I had said earlier, Love is the feeling. YOur feelings were reciprocrated right? Juz not your need of him being there... that's alright. Disappointment sets in only when expectations are set. If he wants you to be with him, and realise how important you are to him, he'll return. At that time, let him know your expectations and give time for them to happen. Working towards them together. Well, if he's not yours, he was juz not meant and fated to be. Girl, at that time, you juz have to say "He was juz not THAT into me." and it's hard to accept that. but that's alright coz someone that is MEANT FOR YOU will appear.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  and I believe, YOU ARE A GIRL WHO DESERVES SOMEONE THAT'S MEANT FOR YOU AND WILL BE THERE FOR YOU WHEN YOU NEED HIM. Do remember, it's the longing and waiting that makes a relationship painful, ignore it....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> </span></div>
