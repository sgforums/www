              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Dear All,</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">At this point of time, when this letter gets out, I believed I will have reached my limit and given up.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Coward I am , stupid I am.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What’s done cannot be undone, since the failure of business, I have been in debt, my sister is so kind enough to offer me help financially but there is only so much that can be done. Still I am in huge debt.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I had a dream, I want to have a family, I want to have a home, I want to come home to a family with my own children. This is not going to happen.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Here came the point of no return, I resort to gambling to try to get the money back to get on with my life, stupid as it is, really stupid wrong move.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">How the hell did I get myself into this situation.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">It’s a value of no return…….$150k.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">The banks are chasing me up till the dead end.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">In the past, when I see people gambling their life away, I was like why so stupid, now that I became one of them.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I really hope people who know me will not look at me in a bad way, I end up taking the worst path in life that leads to the end of it.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I am surrounded by great friends, I have a great family, but the mistakes I have committed has thrown everything off the line.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">This became more prominent when I am at the brim of breakage.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">My Love, My family, my friends……..</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Looking back in life, things has been very good, I had everything that money cannot buy.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Friends, Family, good prospect in work…….all come to a halt at this point.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I HAVE THROWN EVERYTHING AWAY.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I know my parents will be well taken care of by my sisters and I know they have trusted husband by their side. All of them have a happy family.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Parents</strong>, I am sorry that I have thrown a life that was given to me by mum and dad. How I wish I can be stable enough to send you guys out for holidays, coming home to tell you, Dad, this is return ticket for Japan, go and enjoy with mum. But now, everyday I just escape from home, I cannot face you guys.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Sisters</strong>, your brother has become a useless idiot. A really idiot, why am I so different from both of you. I wish I could have seen nephew and niece grow up, but seems like it will be an impossible thing. </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I do not want to drag all of you down this way.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I cannot face anyone, really cannot.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><br><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I cannot face anyone at all………</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">At this worst point of life, there came HER, she brought a little brightness to my life, that put of my decision to end it all. A care and concern I had not experience in these darkest hours.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Her</strong> I am sorry that I ended up dragging you into this, did not expect myself to have fallen for you and it is really a very wrong time. I should not step into this….</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">HOW I WISH we had developed this relationship 5 months ago, this could have stop me from making such a stupid move.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But your presence has given me brightness in the last days of my life.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Your presence give me that comfort……</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"><strong>Six buddies,</strong> I am blessed with the company of close friends who talked to me, but I am too guilty to tell the truth and felt so stupid, I cannot face you guys, the same as I cannot face my family because u guys has become like a family to me.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I am sorry to have not tell the truth, even at this point blank, my ego is still playing me.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I would rather leave then tell any truth.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">But it was heart warming when u guys seat down and ask me what happened.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I was closed to tears.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">All my other friends, there are tons of people who helped me financially that this was possible only because u trusted me, but I betrayed that trust.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">Just want to thank you guys.</span></p>

              <p>Wah I dunno whether you are for real or not. But in case if you are, go google for Nick Leeson, he is far worse than you. He caused the closure of Barings bank, lose billions of dollars, imprison for years, his wife divorced him and then he contracted colon cancer which could have been fatal.</p>
              <p>.....but he survived the cancer, years after he was released from jail, he went to Ireland, settle down there, remarried with 3 kids, now (2 from his wife's previous) and then he became the director of a local Irish football club. He also travels around the world conducting seminars and selling books about motivational speaking.</p>

              <p>hello wavvy,</p>
              <p>   like the earlier reply, you are not the first to be in deep red financially, and will not be the last. Its must be tough to be in debts of 150 000, but look, life is not really about being money.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>  Yes, you are being chased by banks, loansharks or whatever, but you got to fight through the last blood, not through giving out your own blood. Whatever pressure that comes from friends, banks or loan sharks, you just have to simply endure it, the pain, be a real human.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>  At the end of the day, even if you are billion dollar rich, its not really going to make you any much happier. Money is a illusionary stuff. Hence, financially speaking, being million dollar in debt does not need to spell suicide.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>   Just lead a honest working life, even if it means working for many decades , to pay back whatever you owed. Happiness is more than money. Hope you can look beyond that.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>   Humans have a hard time in the history of universe and earth, just to live and survive for some decades. Life is precious. If you want to die, let it come to you next time in a few decades time. Do not need to hurry your own death.</p>

              <p>wah i can't put myself in your shoes but my in laws were cheated of a lot of money 20 odd years ago. They almost wanted to declare bankrupt but they hung on as they had 2 kids; one of which is my wife. Today, they own a successful plastic factory, have 4 cars all fully paid up and the money is still rolling in.</p>
              <p>Imagine if they hadn't walked on back then, they would have never seen the light of day today. And they felt as stupid as you did when they were cheated I'm sure.</p>

              <p>Wah I dunno whether you are for real or not. But in case if you
              are, go google for Nick Leeson, he is far worse than you. He caused
              the closure of Barings bank, lose billions of dollars, imprison for
              years, his wife divorced him and then he contracted colon cancer
              which could have been fatal.</p>
              <p>.....but he survived the cancer, years after he was released
              from jail, he went to Ireland, settle down there, remarried with 3
              kids, now (2 from his wife's previous) and then he became the
              director of a local Irish football club. He also travels around the
              world conducting seminars and selling books about motivational

              <p>also a few months back, there was one article in the papaers whereby a guy owe the banks more than 200,000 and in the end he paid back less than 20,000 and was discharged from bankruptcy !</p>

              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">What’s done cannot be undone, since
              the failure of business, I have been in debt, my sister is so kind
              enough to offer me help financially but there is only so much that
              can be done. Still I am in huge debt.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">I had a dream, I want to have a

              holidays, coming home to tell you, Dad, this is return ticket for
              Japan, go and enjoy with mum. But now, everyday I just escape from
              home, I cannot face you guys.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>

              your brother has become a useless idiot. A really idiot, why am I
              so different from both of you. I wish I could have seen
              nephew and niece grow up, but seems like it will be an
              impossible thing.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>

              came HER, she brought a little brightness to my life, that put of
              my decision to end it all. A care and concern I had not experience
              in these darkest hours.</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>

              sorry that I ended up dragging you into this, did not expect myself
              to have fallen for you and it is really a very wrong time. I should
              not step into this….</span></p>
              <p style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;"><span style="font-family: Times New Roman;">HOW I WISH we had developed this

              <p>Oh please. The devil bought you for 150k only, what a good deal for him. Is it the Great Singapore Sale now ?</p>
              <p>Sure you want to run away. You think death will solve you all the problem.</p>
              <p>Sure it will, death is your escape route.</p>
              <p>BUT the people whom you claim to care about, you just wanna left them a pile of poop to clean up for you.</p>
              <p>Suicide is a selfish act. The devastation and payment is left to your loved ones to carry.</p>
              <p>After you die, your own parents has to go to the morque to identify you and see your dead face and mangled/rotten body. Imagine the nightmare they will have to deal with the rest of their life.</p>
              <p>Everyone around you will be psychologically messed up, thanks to you ofcors.</p>
              <p>Debt is only money. Money can be earned if you are not a damn lazy shit. Get off your lard butt and start your own path to salvation.</p>
