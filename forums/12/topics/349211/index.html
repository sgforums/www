              <p>Studies from the Organisation Study Sexual Differences (OSSD) show that girls are more predisposed to lie because they place a much greater importance in making sure her social circle are kept intact. This would mean lying to cover-up social faux pas or infidelity. This predisposition also extends to guys who place a greater importance in his social life and who are emotional. Why they tend to lie is not yet fully understood, but Virginia N Miller of the OSSD have suggested that such a fear of negative consequence in her social circle can be placed in evolutionary terms - a girl needs to be able to earn the favour of her peers by being cooperative (as opposed to aggresive), in order to gain social status in order to surive.</p>
              <p>It is not fun to think about the lies your girlfriend tell to those they love. But, at the same time, guys tend to be curious about the topics which they try to hide and conceal from each other.</p>
              <ul>
              <li>        Time Together - people lie about the reasons why they can't spend time together or see each other ("I am so busy, I have so much work to do, I don't have time right now")....</li>
              <li>        Past Relationships - partners lie about their past level of involvement ("I never really loved her," "I am much closer to you," "I love you so much more than anyone else")...</li>
              <li>        Feelings, Interest, Crushes, and Attraction to Others - people lie about their feelings and interest in others - often includes ex-partners, friends, someone at work...</li>
              <li>        Contact - lovers lie about their friendships, time spent with others, accidental encounters (running into ex), phone calls, e-mails, and text messages with others. Essentially people lie about intimate, but non-sexual contact with someone else...</li>
              <li>        Level of Commitment – people lie about their feelings for partner, uncertainty or doubts about the relationship - not sure really love or want to marry partner or stay together...</li>
              <li>        Flirting with Others - people lie about flirting with others...</li>
              <li>        Betraying Confidences - lovers lie to each other about keeping secrets confidential...</li>
