              <p>I've dated a lot of mommy boys before.. and heard a few horror stories of my friends who married mommy boys.</p>
              <p>There's nothing wrong loving your own mom. In fact, it is bad to show disrespect to your mother. Because a woman will look at a man who disrespect and ill treat his mother and think " gee.. he's probably gonna do that to me in the future."</p>
              <p>A mommy boy is one who lets his mom dictate his life. He is "yes mom" and will not stand up to his own mom even tho what she wants is unreasonable/impractical and or controlling.</p>
              <p>A mommy boy will have a difficult marriage, especially when his mom is controlling and manipulative to her own desire.</p>
              <p>A mommy boy will let his mom tell him how to live his life, and his wife's life... and his children's life.. because he thinks "mommy knows best".. but you must understand your mother is not "unbiased/impartial". Her job is to protect YOU.. not your marriage nor relationship.</p>
              <p>If you are able to think on your own two feet and tell your mom "no, I don't think that's a good idea." You are NOT a mommy boy.</p>
              <p>Just because she is your mom does not mean she is always right. Nor is your wife/gf ( to be fair).</p>
              <p>Be fair and just. Everyone is looking out for their OWN interest. Look beyond the he says she says.. and use your own brain.</p>
              <p>Your mom has a husband, your father should be the one fullfilling her needs, not you. If your mom is lonely and neglected, you need to go talk to your father and ask him to step up.</p>
              <p>So.. it's not that Mommy boy is not "manly".. it's just that.. a mommy boy is probably not very "smart"...</p>
              <p>Intelligence is something women are attracted to... so that's why we don't like mommy boy.. because they are kinda dumb.</p>
              <p>An example of a mommy boy is ..</p>
              <p>You and your gf is out on a evening date after work. You informed your mother you won't be home for dinner.</p>
              <p>Half way through your romantic dinner with your gf.. your mom calls and demand you go home.. because she cooked dinner.</p>
              <p>A mommy boy will dump his gf at the restaurant and run home to have dinner with his mom.</p>
              <p>A NON-mommy boy will remind his mom he is not coming home, and request his mom to keep the food in the fridge or save it for his lunch the next day.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>

              <p><br>Actually sista, mommy's boys are more akin to women, as their gf, if you know how to act like their mother, you can control them easily. And most mommy boys listen to woman more than to man, so, in a way, they do not end up flirting and going out nightly with those dirty guys of his, that is a good point for whoever is his gf or wife.</p>
              <p>Just imagine, for nearly all his young life, he had been listening and obeying his mother, psychological speaking, he will listen to us and lean toward our advices and command, more so, when his mother passed away, we can have total control of him, can ask him to work, wash dishes, sweep floor, care for the garden, dogs and also cut the grasses...where to find such man now a day.</p>

              <p>Haha, i wun really argue that this is a bad thing. It really depends on the type of girl you're after. Some girls appreciate men who are close to their families - i guess it shows a grounding of sorts. </p>

              <p><br>Depend, listening to parents may not be a bad thing, but for guy, we gal expect them to be more independent. I would rather said, they should respect their parents, weight the issue and give independent decision.

              Angel - you brought up a very interesting  viewpoint that I had only just realized was true !!
              
              Mother and daughter in laws really do not get along cuz the MIL generally do feel that the girls can't take care of their sons.. lolol..
              
              I've always felt that this was such a generalization till my brother got attached recently (as in seriously seeing someone) and my mum completely flipped out. She became such a possessive and psychotic headcase.

              Qianhua cleared, is a stranger? 
              
              If you missed, what, [url=http://www.baby-easy.com/]baby items[/url] after all. The existing situation, what injury War. 
              Busy to do, a stranger dream. Sansei stone drunk roots. 
              Afternoon, dragging luggage out of the still lingering on the moment of the room, decided to embark on the road of separation. So the sun is still shining, but according to the hearts of the sea off dead. You still with the side, grace and Elegant, Qiao Xiao sweet, but brought back the good Chuxian Shi. Ancient Shibaxiangsong, and we just broke up with men and women seemingly peaceful parting of the [url=http://www.baby-easy.com/html/prl0/t259-264.html]baby bibs[/url] delivery. Wanshou slowly walking in the site, not sad not happy. Outsiders are the lovers, intimate and warm, but I do not know disband before Huiguangfanzhao. 
              You still so good, even if it is breaking up. See the enchanting first tempted when, parting the dead in the ashes, ironic joke. Why not do something, so I hate you, so I forgot you. Break up are so perfect, could not find a trace hate your excuse. Is difficult to accept the problems facing the future, just like me happy, just trying to help me ... ... always there are so many reasons, the reasons [url=http://www.baby-easy.com/html/prl0/t259-269.html]baby blanket[/url] for your peace of mind, but I do not know just a joke to me. If you love, these can become the reason you let go? If you love, the world vision of the tongue can be the prerequisite for other people to give up? Our situation, after all, is too superficial. 
              Car started slowly, looking out the window, the noisy crowd looking for your shadow, want to see eyes that hurt me the last deep love. One, the End of the World stranger, the two world man. After one, let go, let go from complete, forget themselves in the Red, deep in my heart, dusty in the present. Wear a headset, listening to cell phone quiet sad love songs, watching the scenery out the window. Huo [url=http://www.baby-easy.com/html/prl0/t259-273.html]baby rompers[/url] Ran came the arrival of the sound between the ears, even all the way to landscape that no impression of love songs so ear is numb. 
              Who think that we can grow old, very naive idea is also very stubborn, is to uphold the faith come to this step, the outcome is unsatisfactory. Asked you why there is such an outcome, you said you did not think it would be the case. Has been regarded figure put it at the end, no end to the hard men of the gas, leaving the end to lose the courage of free and easy. Initiative in your hands. Scattered and dispersed, so who can? Heart, your heart has me? Pig, you have in mind for me? Has been calling you silly girl, in fact, silly me. 
              Standing quietly crowded train ticket hall, is [url=http://www.baby-easy.com/html/prl0/t259-275.html]baby toys[/url] so lonely lonely, because knowledge of the other, they put is eternal life. Set foot on the train, it never going over. Trance feel that parting is not important, but also no longer feel the hurt to heart, suddenly, the extreme injury is numb. So you call, calm tone of excitement in a little talk with you and tell you not by doing what you think, really do not want to do it by your thoughts, why should the people of a deep wound about the direction of their own. As the stimulus for you, you and I will be happy stimulus appears, you will happy. 
              I do not know is opening the eyes of God, or Great God Who can not see passed. You suddenly told me, I left you lost, sad. You tell me you love me, call me back. What is the feeling you know that? Really want to lose to know his heart, really [url=http://www.asicsoffice.com/]asics onitsuka tiger[/url] want to know when I no longer appear in your heart I still have the status of that point. When the wound so deep, has been going out of this sad road, they want me back. At that time really do not believe you, If you love me, be sure to go before this time to tell me? Have lost hope, has decided to let go, you say you love me, How cruel. How do you want I'll put you down? When sad too far, the heart is no longer surging sea, you told me you love me. Days, you have been blind not you? 
              This thought has been able to put down, has to face, has [url=http://www.asicsoffice.com/]asics running shoes[/url] been able to accept this life son of a bitch, but you tell me you love me. Tangled, it is really tangled. Maybe I thought it was only lying to myself that this, perhaps really care about you too, if I believed you. Well, if all still love, still remembered, give each other a read to it. Waiting for me, up to two years, you say you so, really so out. Well, as long as you wait, and we got married two years later, that time we'll hand way of life, until life together. 
              Forever and sometimes do, is there that fate [url=http://www.asicsoffice.com/]asics shoes[/url] is to you. Qianhua cleared, whether a stranger, it is you. The initiative lies in you! 
              You say you only like me calling you pig. Pigs, if love, then waiting for me for two years, up to two years. Two years later, to marry you! chj
