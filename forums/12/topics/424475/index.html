              <p><br>sure, gals like us are easily jealous creature, whether it mom, aunt, grandma or sister, if you treat them nicer than you gf or wife, you got lots of problem, most of my gal frens who are married do not face much problem with their husbands but instead, their Mothers- in- laws. As for Fathers-in-laws, they usually support us, the wife of his son, cos they also hate their own old wife, but no dare to scold them, instead the daughter-in law do the job for them.</p>

              <p>I've dated a lot of mommy boys before.. and heard a few horror stories of my friends who married mommy boys.</p>
              <p>There's nothing wrong loving your own mom. In fact, it is bad to show disrespect to your mother. Because a woman will look at a man who disrespect and ill treat his mother and think " gee.. he's probably gonna do that to me in the future."</p>
              <p>A mommy boy is one who lets his mom dictate his life. He is "yes mom" and will not stand up to his own mom even tho what she wants is unreasonable/impractical and or controlling.</p>
              <p>A mommy boy will have a difficult marriage, especially when his mom is controlling and manipulative to her own desire.</p>
              <p>A mommy boy will let his mom tell him how to live his life, and his wife's life... and his children's life.. because he thinks "mommy knows best".. but you must understand your mother is not "unbiased/impartial". Her job is to protect YOU.. not your marriage nor relationship.</p>
              <p>If you are able to think on your own two feet and tell your mom "no, I don't think that's a good idea." You are NOT a mommy boy.</p>
              <p>Just because she is your mom does not mean she is always right. Nor is your wife/gf ( to be fair).</p>
              <p>Be fair and just. Everyone is looking out for their OWN interest. Look beyond the he says she says.. and use your own brain.</p>
              <p>Your mom has a husband, your father should be the one fullfilling her needs, not you. If your mom is lonely and neglected, you need to go talk to your father and ask him to step up.</p>
              <p>So.. it's not that Mommy boy is not "manly".. it's just that.. a mommy boy is probably not very "smart"...</p>
              <p>Intelligence is something women are attracted to... so that's why we don't like mommy boy.. because they are kinda dumb.</p>
              <p>An example of a mommy boy is ..</p>
              <p>You and your gf is out on a evening date after work. You informed your mother you won't be home for dinner.</p>
              <p>Half way through your romantic dinner with your gf.. your mom calls and demand you go home.. because she cooked dinner.</p>
              <p>A mommy boy will dump his gf at the restaurant and run home to have dinner with his mom.</p>
              <p>A NON-mommy boy will remind his mom he is not coming home, and request his mom to keep the food in the fridge or save it for his lunch the next day.</p>
