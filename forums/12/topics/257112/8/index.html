Both are equally guilty (or innocent) at this very moment.<br><br>So will the two of them, Quinsy and Devil PLEASE refrain from starting any more threads or contributing to anymore threads regarding this matter?</div></blockquote>Yea, i agree with the phrase, "Both of them are equally guilty or innocent". Quinsy stated before that it was her mistake to go and meet Devil, hence I said since she realized that was her mistake, I asked her to learn a lesson from it and stop meeting people so freely in the future. I don't see this as criticizing her.</div>
