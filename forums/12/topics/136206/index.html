            <div class='col-md body'>fwiw, and i quote,<br>All people are free to move on from their relationships, should they no longer be satisfied with them, for any reason; this shall most likely happen if the other party fails to see to their needs, whatever they may be.<br><br>that said, talk about stealing somone/win him or her over/etc is trival, perhaps even to the extent of being irrelevant/missing the point.<br><br>if one is willing to leave an existing relationship for another, then it implies at least that he/she is not entirely satisfied in the existing relationship.<br><br>some of the issues that pops up: why didnt he/she leave sooner? why did he/she choose to stay on? why leave when someone popped into the picture? if someone better didnt come along, will he/she stay in it? are there more important things to his/her well-being? ...<br><br>either way reveals quite a bit about the person in question.<br>but more importantly is how one see those traits. and be prepared for answers, if any, that arent expected. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
