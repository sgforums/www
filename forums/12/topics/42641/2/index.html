I help you! You ask me along larÂ… they sure go one Â… I sacrifice myself never mindÂ… <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>To me what I think lar, never show your feelings. Once your feeling is out, itÂ’s either she control the game or you lose control in it. Take it as a game, be cool, slowly get close to her and play mind games with her. Sometimes treat her good, sometimes treat her cold.<br>Make her think that you like her, but not sure about it.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> Think about it, everyone is happy got people like them one lor. Then, she will want to know, she will want to find out if you really like her. She will try to get close to you. She will keeps thinking if you like her or not.<br><br>When she keeps thinking, she had fallen into your trap, she will start to fall for you. ThenÂ… I will only teach you until here lar, teach too muchÂ…some not very nice people catchÂ… not safe and fair to the girls lar. Then when you get her liao you want to put in feelings, it's safe to put liao. You may think it's bad for her lar, but once you feel bad and show your feelings, she'll be the one playing the game!<br><br>How to make it work is up to you liao lor. Girls is also quite close to this larÂ… but IÂ’m not saying it out lar. If most guys know, they got no fish to catch and rice to eat liao.<br><br>Taught by my scorpio dating master friend G***.<br></div>
