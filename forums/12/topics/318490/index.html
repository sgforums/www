              <p>I lived in a 5-room HDB flat, and on the 7th storey. 2 months ago, a f***king family moved into the 8th storey, which was just vertically above our house.</p>
              <p>The whole family have bad attitudes, the father could shout at any time of the day, even at the middle of the night, and it really woke me up a few times...the mother is an irresponsible housewife, she would hang clothes that were just soaked and were filled with water, this causes dye on some of my clothes and towels. I dont know much about their children, but I know one of them loves to throw snacks or other stuffs towards the ground floor(I saw him doing that), and sometimes it would fly just into my window....the worst case was when he throws a diaper full of s***( I dont know why too)....I had to clean up the room for almost an hour for that T_T...also the whole family walks like elephant, if they are going to the kitchen, toilets or their rooms, you could simply tell from their footsteps.</p>

              <p>sounds like my bloody neighbour upstairs.   To people like that I will first tolerate but there come a time enough is enough.   Sometimes feel like tearing their faces and boxing them.</p>
              <p>Try to resolve in peaceful way by communicating with them tactfully.   If this fails, do a tit for tat, an eye for an eye.   </p>
