In fact, how many pple can forget their ex just like dat...<br>There will surely be some point of time when you recall the past rite? Give the poor girl a chance, learn to be more sympathatic towards her, and be more mature when you see this kind of things, besides, he is your bf now, no matter how hard she tries, the person he loves now is you...

Actually what matters most if your BF - as long as he never do anything tootpid, I guess, forget it man. You get angry, jealous - you also can't do a thing about it.
