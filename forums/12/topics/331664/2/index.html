              <p>I am currently a poly student and I recently managed to start up my own business while I was studying. And so far, I am doing incredibly well. The thing is, I am no longer interested in my poly science course. Everytime I enter the class, I feel so down. Furthermore, I don't have much time to spare for school due to the time commitment that I have for my biz.</p>
              <p>I am planning to take up a business course in a private instituition from poly to degree. This would also help me expand my knowledge on business dealings etc. The thing is, when I start all these classes, I doubt that I would have enough time for my family. BTW, the business courses are also adaptable for working people as in night classes.</p>
              <p>I am strongly thinking of quiting my poly science course and just continue on my business course. However, I don't know how my parents will respond to this. Currently they are unaware of by business because I know if I tell them now, they would ask me to stop all these and continue studying.</p>
              <p>How should I go around this? I don't want to hurt their feelings and all.</p>

              <p>Quit your science and go for your business course.</p>
              <p>Your parents can only guide you.. ultimately.. you are responsible for the path you take.</p>
              <p>Since you are doing well in your business. you should be able to finance your own studies.</p>
              <p>Your parents' main concern is .. will you be able to do well in your life.</p>

              <p>hey everyone,</p>
              <p>thanks for the posts. It seems that the majority is towards me pursueing my business course. I did some calculations on time management and all and I can't cope it with 2 courses at the same time furthermore with my business going on.</p>
              <p>I find that the science course is useless for me to use. And even if I get a science diploma, it's not going to directly help me in anyway for my future. Just have to sit my parents down and tell them of my plans to quit my science course. I just hope that they would take it well.</p>
              <p>By the way, my parents are the type that must have a secured job with CPF and if do any business will fail. Once I just merely mentioned that I want to own a house, a car one day. And these things are the things that my parents have. My mother, she laughed at me. ='(</p>
              <p>But anyways, thanks for all the advises here. Really helps me to make a clearer decision.</p>

              <p>my advice is: go for it.</p>
              <p>successful people didn't get to where they are today by playing it safe. Some risk always carries a greater payoff, and it's not as if you wish to stop studying. You just wish to switch what you're studying, and the truth is in the workplace, once u've got the experience, that counts more than a piece of cert anyway.</p>
              <p>As for your parents, prove them wrong. Parent's aren't always right, and if they get in the way of your success... well... throwing away a possible brighter future to please them is just not smart really. Like I said, go for it and just ignore their conservative and possibly out-dated views. This is 2008, not 1978 anymore.</p>

              <p>CPF is not a big deal really.  It's just taking part of your earnings and put it in a place you cannot touch.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you are successful, just sock some of your earnings into a good retirement fund. And be discipline enough not to touch it until you're ready to retire.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If your parents says anything in respond to your dreams.. even if it's negative or positive... just reply this very simple and straight forward reply .</p>
