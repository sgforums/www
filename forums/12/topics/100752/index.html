            <div class='col-md body'>Sometimes we can pick up on the signs that our relationship is in danger, and at other times, we cannot. In fact, a relationship can dig itself so far deep into a hole, that we do not realize it until it has itself hanging by itÂ’s very last thread. This is why it is important to detect the signs of a relationship in danger. If you are not sure what to look for, here are some questions you should start asking yourself and start observing your relationship with these questions:<br><br>Are you suffering from low self-esteem due to what takes place between you and your partner?<br><br>Do you find yourself lying to your partner or often have the feeling that he/she is lying to you?<br><br>Do you feel more sad or angry than happy in your relationship?<br><br>Are you frequently discussing and complaining about your relationship to others?<br><br>Is it difficult to express your feelings and talk to your partner about your thoughts and concerns?<br><br>Is your trust for your partner fading or has already completely faded?<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'><strong>How To Forget Your Ex   </strong><br><br>I promise that you will never read here a prayer to the circle of life, nothing about what goes around, comes around, of things working themselves out in the wash. However, I will quite unequivocally and with a loud and clear voice repeatedly say; there is hope.<br><br>IÂ’ve sat on the tube late at night being shuttled between the ends of the line having no energy or motivation to find my station. IÂ’ve woken in the morning to what seemed like an endless space next to me, feeling that the universe has cracked into a million discordant pieces. IÂ’ve seen some of my strong gorgeous friends fall into a life lived with hurt and contempt. IÂ’ve sat in cafÃ©s and meetings and hated the world for being so carefree, for having the cheek to get on with life. And through all this sadness, hurt, confusion and drama, there is hope. Life gets better. I got better, my friends got better. And you will get better.<br><br>This is what you will read here, stories and thoughts from the lives of my friends and I and how we got, are getting, better. I hope you will find them of use. I hope that you will laugh at them, the laugh of an accomplice who recognises their own folly in others, how love makes us behave as though we were the unlucky subjects in those tacky hypnosis shows. And of course know that more than likely, weÂ’re going to be like that again. Maybe, in time?<br><br>For now though, don't be hurting. Well, at least don't focus on it. Accept what's happened, if only because you can't change it. Take some comfort that this experience gives you texture, puts iron and compassion in your soul. As Billy Connolly would say, allows you to be Â‘all windswept and interesting? at least for a while. Let it give you knowledge and confidence in new situations, but don't let it overshadow your whole life. That would be a much bigger tragedy than whatever you've been through.<br><br>From our families fussing to our friends constantly trying to fix us up, people view being single as a bad thing, as if it were a state of being broken. Enjoy this attention as the comfort food that it is and recognise it is done with love, but donÂ’t rely on it, and donÂ’t believe it. Think about the power of one, that less is more (you have to allow me some clichÃ©s). The freedom to live your life on your terms. Think of something that youÂ’ve always wanted to do and do it. You have one less excuse now.<br><br>source: <a href="http://www.relationshipweb.com/links/Relationships/Breakups/" rel="nofollow">http://www.relationshipweb.com/links/Relationships/Breakups/</a></div>
