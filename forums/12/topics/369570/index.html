              <p>There are a few reasons why he will break off with you so abruptly.</p>
              <p>One possible reason is due to a misunderstanding, maybe he saw you with someone else and got the wrong idea. Another plausible reason is that he found someone more attractive than you out there and lost interest in you.</p>
              <p>The 2 above suggestions are only possible if he is a prideful ( in the first scenario ) or uncommitted ( in the second scenario ) person. Only you will know what kind of a person he is though.</p>
              <p>Putting that aside, you are probably feeling very down now, but please do not binge or go out to drink because of that. The best thing for you to do now is to focus on transforming your sorrow into "energy", and help out around your house and bond together with your family again.</p>
              <p>They might be upset that you went out of the house 4 years ago, but no matter what, they are still your one and only family. Try to do your part as a member of the family and slowly allow them to accept you again. Don't expect them to be close to you again overnight though, this kind of "change" needs time.</p>

              <p>Hi its commendable that u are thoughtful enough to know that other people hav their problems too. nontheless everyone needs a listening ear occasionally..</p>
              <p>all kinds of relationships(not only bgr) need bonding n hard wrk for them to last and for people to feel close to one another.. being away for 4 years definitely broke yr "closeness" with yr family.</p>
              <p>I guess u were just misguided to put "all yr eggs in e same basket". like what forbidden said u can try doing yr part in yr family again so as time passes they will come to accept u. its hard wrk but u hav to start somewhere.</p>

              <p>You are the one who should ask yourself whether it matters or not. Though from the looks of it, you will probably want to forget that you even started a relationship with this guy, but I am not you, so I wouldn't know if you want to try to patch up with him somewhere in the depths of your heart.</p>
              <p>Regardless of whether you want to do so or not, it is important for you to find out the reason so as to prevent another failed relationship again. Of course, the best thing for you to do now is to build up your relationship with your family again instead of going out to look for another guy.</p>
              <p>And yes, unfortunately for you, I use to be a non-registered community counsellor and I did counselled some of my school mates in the past too, so you might find me to be very naggy.</p>

Whenever i felt sad or got caught in a bad situation, i would keep it to myself and cry alone at night. Do not want to be a 'complainer' or a whiny girl.. I was always thinking.. that people already had so much trouble themselves. tat i should nt disturb them with the trouble i hv got. But it really got to me. I felt so lost, don't know who to turn to... I realise that i had noone by my side at all. Leaving my home 4 yrs ago to live by myself. just returned recently. I thought i would be happier moving back.... instead i felt so empty inside. My parents and my siblings.. i don feel close to them any more. i tried so hard to communicate with them but i felt so tired. A lot had happened within the 4 yrs i spend living out. alot.. sad, bitter memories, the failed relationships, 4 yrs might seem short but it had turned out to be the turning point of my life. I was too naived in the past. wasting my life in a fruitless relationship.. to finally i thought i met someone i could commit my life with... in the end the relationship ended abruptly. He chose to leave me w/o giving me a chance at all. Isn't it a big cruel joke?</p>

              <p>You are encircled with a dark fog that eminates sadness and gloom.</p>
              <p>When a person is bitter and troubled, nothing will florish within 10 meters of him/her.</p>
              <p>Give yourself time to heal from the wounds, and allow inner peace to chase the fog away. Only then should you approach any kind of relationship or your efforts will be for naught.</p>
              <p>How many years was the relationship with your boyfriend? Was it peaceful and smooth , or a roller coaster ride with constant exchange of sarcastic remarks ?</p>
              <p>A joke it is not, but a lesson learned in life.</p>
              <p>Are you truly such a thoughtful person to keep your problems within yourself ? Or are you just afraid to expose your vulnerability to others ?</p>
