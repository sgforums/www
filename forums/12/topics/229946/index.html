            <div class='col-md body'>Need some advice please.<br><br>2 years ago, I worked at this outlet. Some things happened during my short period of work, careless mistakes and screwed up. Then after my initial work was over, I approached the supervisor and asked if there was still a vacancy. Then there was and he accepted me again. Then some careless incidents and made him angry. So I left after my required work period was over.<br><br>Now, 2 years had passed. Recently I contacted a friend who I met during work there, she said most of the people there had been transferred somewhere else. Including all the supervisors I was under and the manager, as well as many other employees.<br><br>Now my long vacations are approaching. I'm thinking of going back.<br><br>There, I had good and bad memories. Had friends and a few 'enemies'. Was bullied by some of the more senior employees. Not in a extreme sense though. I just ignored them if I could. A few guys hated me for some reason and I disliked a few people. But most of the people there are very nice.<br><br>All the good and bad memories are there, and I still remembered the store layout very well (not a valid excuse, I know). I admit I was extremely careless and 'blur king' 2 years ago, when I was still young (waiting O levels). Didn't put my heart into what I was doing.<br><br>But now 2 years had passed. Now, should I apply for job back at the branch? I don't know if I'm blacklisted by the company, or are the people who disliked me are still there (I know some had left).<br><br>This particular branch had all my good memories, as it was my first workplace (first job, damn blur and childish). A few acquaintances there (2 years no see).<br><br>I used to work service then, and I'm very bad at customer service (personality maybe). I want to apply for a job in the store.<br><br>Should I apply back at the branch, and if successful should I accept?<br>Or do you think I should try other branches?</div>
