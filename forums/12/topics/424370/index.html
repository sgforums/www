              <p>it's normal for relationships to be complex. only when they're easily definable then u're in trouble. just decide who u like and go after her lah. boyfriend nia, not as if she's married. </p>

              <p>Well i do have to admit i have been lucky thus far with regards to the fact that there are infact girls that like me . Did almost go into a relationsip with a single girl that i liked and she liked me in Sec 2 but thought it was too young an age to get gf. (mommy's boy here).</p>
              <p>Got this girl in Sec 3 chase me alot but i didn't make a move. Maybe thats why i so unlucky now. (is God punishing me??) I still feel really bad for hurt. Imagine the hurt i caused her by not properly rejecting her....</p>
              <p>Study ?? Well i'm currently the top student in my year group (class nerd) who is taking 4 A2 Alvls subjects.... (getting boring/sian.. my best friends all textbooks for now...) Componded by the fact that i'm currently studying overseas (not in sg) alone and living alone (no parents nor guardians) and the fact that i just changed schools recently hence haven't really fitted in with my friends/classmates. Makes me feel very lonely.</p>
              <p>Sigh.... Best not to disturb the relationship of girl A (girl i like) i guess. What evil one commits will eventually come around eh?? (later kenna bad karma again). She has only been in the relationship for about half a year....</p>
              <p>Well most important question will be:</p>
              <p>How should i forget about her?? as in disconnect the emotional link that we created betweeen us (just remain as friends/classmate or for our case, academic rivals(she's the class female nerd (quite pretty by my standard)).We kinda like each other and i think the feeling's mutual....( she almost always purposely sits beside me during almost all the lessons we have together (about 10hours per week).</p>
              <p>I do apologise for the prolific use of singlish here. I just feel that some dialects or languages convey emotions of people more effeciently,singlish, which i feel is one such example.</p>
              <p>Thanks People!! All replies are greatly appreciated!!</p>

              <p>I think you should respect the guy who is the boyfriend of the girl you like.</p>
              <p>However, you should also not give up on the girl but remain close friends with her.</p>
              <p>Time will reveal your fate, either you will get over her or you two were meant to be together.</p>
              <p>The urge to be together with the girl you like...the urge to have a successful relationship......</p>
              <p>Just bear with it.... like many of us guys :)</p>

              <p>I'm seventeen this year and currently am studying in high school. (comparable to JC 1 in SG)</p>
              <p>Well here's the thing. Ive never had an easy experience with regards to relationships in school. They have always been multilayed with complex connections being the norm.</p>
              <p>For example in my current school;</p>
              <p>I like girl A who has a boyfriend Guy A, but girl A likes me also (i think). Classmate girl B likes me who has a guy, guy B, who likes girl B. Then comes along girl C who is in the same club as me who likes me who once again has a guy, guy C who like girl C.</p>
              <p>I'm not really the social butterfly of the class, more of a loner (as what girl A) told me. Hence im not too sure as to what i should. I really like girl A but she has a boyfriend......</p>
              <p>Is this normal or exceptional. It has been like this since primary school.....damn sian.....</p>
