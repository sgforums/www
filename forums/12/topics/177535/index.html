            <div class='col-md body'>Hi,<br><br>I'm feeling terribly confused over this for quite some time.  I'm attached for 1yr+.  Our relationship has been pretty good.  We used to meet 3-4 times a week however 4 mths back, I got posted to do shift work and we can only meet once a week.  Somehow this has put a strain on our relationship.  She is someone that needs company.  I still love her though.<br><br>I met this gal 1 mth+ back.  We hitted it off very well.  I could say that we had a crush on each other.  The thing is, she is 4 yrs in a relationship too.  We sorta started our underground relationship without our partner's knowledge.  I have met her bf face to face before though.<br><br>Recently, I had a arguement with her coz I dun feel secure with her, mayb the crush has ended (thats what I thought) but she told me tat this is not a fling and she doesnt wanna stop here.  She claims to love me and her bf just as I love her and my gf.  We are both greedy fools.  She could have ended it when we argued but instead she did not.<br><br>I'm totally confused and not happy abt this.  I hope to have the courage to end it once and for all but yet I really do like her.  I dunno why I'm having this feeling over 2 persons.  I'm afraid I'll be unable to get out of it.  I've told some of my frds abt my problem.  All of them told me to call the r/s off and go back to my gf.  Is that the only way?</div>
