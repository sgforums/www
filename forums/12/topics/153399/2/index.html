At that point of time, things that seem important a while ago are not important now. Why? Because compared to all these stars, what are we? Even our planet we live on pale in the light of all these stars.<br><br>Another example. Say you have the chance to climb Mt Everest. How difficult it is to make it all the way up to the tallest peak. Supposed you are at the summit, how would you feel? That's what life is all about.<br><br>Unfortunately, it's the fortunate few who get to do things I've just mentioned. Only they will know what is life. For the majority of us, we just eat, work/study and sleep. Pathetic isn't it? But this has to be the case because not everyone can climb Mt Everest; not everyone has the time to stargaze, not everyone can do the things he/she wants. Life to them is what it is. They don't have a choice.</div>
