True enough, typical MCP guys have positive qualities like unwavering loyalty and some 'overly caring' personality (read possessiveness), but they can't comprehend the concept of trust, freedom and power equality.<br><br>In fact, as long as certain events are not within their span of control, the suspicion gets into them instantaneously.<br><br>It doesn't matter if it was the truth or not - his perceived state of mind is the inexorably truth he so believes in - explaination is merely a red herring. It doesn't matter if your relationship is stable, his wild state of emotions belie fact from friction, listened only to his heart, which has totally been consumed by inferiority complex.<br><br>There's no logic in emotions that has been tainted by inferiority; all his actions merely fill in the void that is missing inside his esteem.<br><br>How long can you remain in a relationship without trust? If you constantly allow your reasoning of 'he's a very rare type of guy' to misrepresent your stand to remain, then you are probably better off without being with this 'very rare type of guy', because your 'rare guy' brings forth a very 'common disastrous trait' to any relationship.<br><br>In that case, 'rare' could he be?<br><br>Telling you to DRESS down because he doesnÂ’t want you to attract attention Â– thatÂ’s another typical MCP method of 'ensuring security'. Crap.<br><br>If you could find him dating someone else after two weeks of breaking up, I suppose you should also be on your route to find new guys... especially man who could handle woman as his equal and not constantly looking for dumber, lesser woman in all aspects.<br><br>His fleeting love also suggested much about the depth of love he has for you.<br><br>I think the answer you seek is quite clear. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I know that I may sound like an "elite" for saying this, but I really don't think he deserves you. If you continue to go for him, he's only going to pull your  standards down -- and by this, I don't just mean academically. He's already asking you to dress down. He obviously doesn't like the fact that you're better than him. It's okay for him to feel uncomfortable and it's okay for him to determine his own standards in life, but he has no right to impose his own standards onto you.<br>Think about the future.<br>What will he say when you go to a better JC than him?<br>(yeah, I still remember that thread about RJ xP)<br>What will he say when you end up going to a good university?<br>What will he say when you get a good career?<br>Has it ever occured to you that he might oppose your progress?<br>Has it ever occured to you that he may eventually be more of a burden than a joy?<br>I honestly think that he's using you.<br>He's insecure and he's using you to give himself more self-worth.<br>But you're better than him and he knows it.<br>Now he's going out with someone he probably feels more comfortable with.<br>Don't run after him. I dont think he even sees your worth.<br>Come on, you're in sec3, right? Or is it sec4 now?<br>There are millions of guys out there. Just focus on yourself for a while.<br>You'll recognize the right guy when he comes.<br><br></div>
