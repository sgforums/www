What he needs is time to think about his situation. In the meantime you can lend him some books or shows to watch, preferably those with good laughter and invoke HUGE amount of hope in the story (if he can sees hope in it...). Know what are his interests? What he likes? Video games? Sci fi? Superstar? Sports?<br><br>As for his birthday, you can call him out and treat him something (what you planned), but try not to use this as an opportunity to ask him to open up. He can only open up on his own accord. If he refuses to go out, you can either go to his house to celebrate or simply pass him the present if you got one for him.<br><br>Be there for him and also <span style="color: red;">be patient</span> if you cherish the friendship with him.</div>

If he says no, don't press the issue and just let him know you're available if he changes his mind.<br><br>If he does choose to talk about it, avoid trying to rush to solutions.  Sit back, listen and make it clear you are doing so.  One good way of letting him know you're listening is if you need any clarification about something he has said, ask.</div>

Just someone reading too much and i mean way too much into things.

Its more of different mindset and perception than depression.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>
