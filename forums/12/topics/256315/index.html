            <div class='col-md body'>the whole story basically means that when u think u love this person u will try n love her as much as u can n u think that u dun like ur original partner...but actuali when u try to see both of the girls from their original status in ur heart, u may realise that u actuali still love ur original partner...the buddha use an example that when 3 joss sticks r afar at similar distance away from u, u cant reali see which one is brighter....but when u bring one nearer(which is use to illustrate what happens when u think u like another girl), it seems that that one is brighter...however, when u put the joss stick back to its original position(illustrating putting the girl back to her original status with u, that is not thinkin that u like her), u may realise that actuali ur feelings for ur original partner haf not been overcome by the new girl in ur life....<br><br>something like that la, not entirely correct though=p but juz try to get the idea loh <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>A man was having a conversation with Buddha in the middle of the night. Buddha was sitting down while the man was standing.<br><br><strong>Man:</strong> O Buddha, I have a girlfriend of five years, but now I have fallen madly in love with a new lady. I really don't know what to do. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br><strong>Buddha:</strong> Are you sure that the lady you're now madly in love with is the one you love most, and will be the very last woman in your life? o_O<br><br><strong>Man:</strong> Yes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br><strong>Buddha:</strong> Then initiate a break up so you can be with the new lady! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br><strong>Man:</strong> But my current girlfriend is gentle, kind, virtuous. If I initiate a break up, wouldn't it be quite cruel and unethical?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br><strong>Buddha:</strong> In marriage and love, it will only be cruel and unethical if there is no love. You're now in love with another lady and no longer your girlfriend, and a break up is the right thing to do.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><strong>Man:</strong> But my girlfriend loves me very much, she really loves me very much.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br><strong>Buddha:</strong> Then she is fortunate.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br><strong>Man:</strong> I'm going to leave her for another woman, and this should cause her to be in misery. How can she be fortunate?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>Buddha:</strong> Because she still possesses the love she has for you, whereas you have lost the love you have for her, because you have fallen for someone new. Accurately speaking, it is a blessing to possess and a misfortune to lose possession, therefore the one in misery is you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><strong>Man:</strong> But I'm leaving her for another woman, she should be the one who has lost me and thus feel miserable.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>Buddha: </strong>You're wrong. You're only an entity in her love life. When you, the entity, no longer exists, her true love will continue on to another entity. Because in her love life, she has never lost true love, therefore she is the one who should be blessed and you the one in pain.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><strong>Man:</strong> She said she would love only me all her life and not a second man.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br><strong>Buddha:</strong> Have you not said something similar before?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>Man:</strong> I... I... I...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br><strong>Buddha:</strong> Look at the three candles in the urn before you, the one that shines most brightly.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br><strong>Man:</strong> I don't know, they're all equally bright.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br><strong>Buddha:</strong> These three candles can be likened to three women. One of them is the woman you have fallen for. There are so many humans in existence, and there are more than hundreds of thousands of women. You can't even tell which is the brightest or point out which is the woman you love now, yet why are you so sure the one you love now is that woman, and even more so, how can you be so sure she will be the last woman in your life?<br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>Man: </strong>I... I...

Love stems from the heart. While you love her, you feel that she is the brightest candle. When you put the candle back to where it was, once again you could not tell which was the brightest candle.

Buddha was sitting down while the man was standing.<br><br>[b]Man:</strong> O Buddha, I have a girlfriend of five years, but now I have fallen madly in love with a new lady. I really don't know what to do. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br><strong>Buddha:</strong> Are you sure that the lady you're now madly in love with is the one you love most, and will be the very last woman in your life? o_O<br><br><strong>Man:</strong> Yes.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br><strong>Buddha:</strong> Then initiate a break up so you can be with the new lady! <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz"><br><br><strong>Man:</strong> But my current girlfriend is gentle, kind, virtuous. If I initiate a break up, wouldn't it be quite cruel and unethical?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"><br><br><strong>Buddha:</strong> In marriage and love, it will only be cruel and unethical if there is no love. You're now in love with another lady and no longer your girlfriend, and a break up is the right thing to do.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br><strong>Man:</strong> But my girlfriend loves me very much, she really loves me very much.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"><br><br><strong>Buddha:</strong> Then she is fortunate.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_surprised.gif" alt="Surprised" title="Surprised"><br><br><strong>Man:</strong> I'm going to leave her for another woman, and this should cause her to be in misery. How can she be fortunate?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>Buddha:</strong> Because she still possesses the love she has for you, whereas you have lost the love you have for her, because you have fallen for someone new. Accurately speaking, it is a blessing to possess and a misfortune to lose possession, therefore the one in misery is you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"><br><br><strong>Man:</strong> But I'm leaving her for another woman, she should be the one who has lost me and thus feel miserable.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>Buddha: </strong>You're wrong. You're only an entity in her love life. When you, the entity, no longer exists, her true love will continue on to another entity. Because in her love life, she has never lost true love, therefore she is the one who should be blessed and you the one in pain.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br><strong>Man:</strong> She said she would love only me all her life and not a second man.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br><strong>Buddha:</strong> Have you not said something similar before?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br><strong>Man:</strong> I...
