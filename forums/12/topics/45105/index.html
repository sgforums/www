            <div class='col-md body'>Hi evrerybody, I'm new here...<br>I'm not Singaporean, I'm just an exchange student staying in Singapore for a year. I go to high school. I really like it here, everything about Sinapore seems to be perfect. However, since I came here I became a slacker at school, probably because I have no motivation and no parents around to supervise me. I often don't do my homework and I even started skipping classes! Not surprisingly, I'm starting to have problems as a result, and then I get depressed and lose interest in my responsibilites completely...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> The reason might be that I can't seem to make any real friends here, and am somewhat lonely. I never experienced this at home. I was always above average at school, had lots of friends etc., did many sports. But now, I don't really do much. Looks like I lost all of my interest, determination and passion in the past couple of months. I miss my family &amp; my friends, so that might be the reason, I really don't know. But something is definitely wrong with me lah. Looking forward to any advice...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

Though things might not be exactly the same as back in hometown, you can very much still do the things you like to do...?<br><br>It's a lousy move to make yourself stressful or troubled during a foreign stay... Instead, try to make yourself as comfortable as possibe and if you would like to, DO join us for some SPORTS OUTINGS and activities...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
