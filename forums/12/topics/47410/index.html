Both rarely meet each other and argument still can take place - this will definitely weaken the foundation of your relationship. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>When people meet up often and share equal amount of quarrels, many a times, it isn't so bad, because when you both meet up, you both will definitely enjoy that kind of good time together, goes together with the pinch of quarreling - it counter-act each other. For your case - its the other way round.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Sign of drifting from the relationship? Chances are - it is.<br><br>How? Advice?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>This is the time to come together for a good talk - not the kind of lunch conversation you would have with your friends, rather the kind people always hated to have for some reasons. To talk with your emotions, good tone and a great spot.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>What must you ask? Simply enlightened him about your feelings and ask if he is feeling the same. Look for a possible solution if this is what both party wished. If not - probably the conclusion would be the same. Its important to let him know and if he desire to do or work for a compromise/solution/ways/etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>P.S: You can't clap with one hand and when the other hands don't react - you just have to forget about clapping altogether.<br><br>Cheers</div>

But it certainly be a QUESTION of.. <span style="font-style: italic;">"Do you still love him?"</span><br><br>If your answer is <span style="font-style: italic;">"yes, I do love him..."</span> Then let's just start with the <span style="font-style: italic;">simple thing</span>...? Tell him that <span style="font-style: italic;">you love him</span>.... Let him know how much you actually love him and care for him....<br><br>A month or two really isn't such a long time as compared to people going on a long distance relationship where bf has to study abroad for years... It isn't much for bfs outstationed overseas at work for long term projects... Or the guys stuck in camp for years of NS service...<br><br>His father's condition would change for sure.. So would he... For better, for worse... Things would change... Just be prepared....<br><br>If you don't really feel for each other, this short break would certainly be such a good excuse for both of you to just walk away from each other's lives... <span style="font-style: italic;">Escape...?</span> Is that what you want...? Is your being together just a prelude... Looking forward to this very day...? <span style="font-style: italic;">go think about it...?</span><br><br>Once in a while in our lives we would get confused or stressed up... But that doesn't mean that we would certainly have to start giving up on everything...?
