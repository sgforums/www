            <div class='col-md body'>I am now and i realise that i am too young to have a rel. In jc and v busy. This girl has been my stead for almost two months liao.. I currently believe that seh is seeing another guy who stays near her.. He was her former crush.. I dont wnt to say this but she shamelessly looked up his add and made friends with him... Now they like chatting everyday i think... usually she will miss call me like crazy but today she did not even contact me at all.<br><br>Cuz she normally stay at home to study but today suddenly go clubhouse to study... for the whole day some more... Weird cuz she hates to be alone... so i suspect that she studying together with this guy.<br><br>She keeps telling me that she is not interested in him. But would yr gf be so shameless... go make new friend and chat with him on msn for an hour yesterday and then today will suddenly stop contacting u... even when she's alone and she's the kind who needs a lot of security?<br><br>I am quite an indepentdent person and now noe that this is not the relationship for me... she took up too much of my time when i really loved her... and now cuz i need to study for exams also she look up this guy and i suspect she with him now..<br><br>Think i should talk it out with her and meet this guy or should i juz give up this relationship in which i have no intention of continueing since she is like this...<br><br>Also her actions are very mixed... she is still very touchy with me till the extent that i don noe if she is really two timing me... I am having the feeling that she is betraying me and i dont like that..<br><br>If i want the relationship to end i want it to end cuz we do not match each others characters... not cuz she went after another guy but continues to lie to me... i am a guy and i have pride... i will not take it lying down if she had indeed betrayed me...<br><br>If we really break up... when would be the best time for it... Cuz even after my exams i still have many things on... so ya... pls coment</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Dear Sy_dreamer,<br><br>It really doesnt mean that when u are in JC, u are super busy and have no time for a relationship. Wait till u go out and work, then u know what is call busy.  A couple can be both working high end jobs and handle four kids at the same time. Now......are u saying u are busier than them ?<br><br>Perhaps a relationship takes sensibility to work things out. From your posting, i would just like to comment that u are not even ready for any BGR.  Neither is ur current so called GF.  Have the two of you asked what is it going to be the outcome of this relationship ? Where is it heading ? After JC, then what are ur aspirations etc etc ? Or is it just pet talk all the time ?<br><br>Ending a relationship and u ask when is the "best time".....sigh......i really wonder why u get into it in the first place. my advice: ASAP....it probably wont hurt u and her too much anyway.....<br><br>sorry to sound like i am slapping u with a cold fish....but thats just how i felt when i read ur post....super cold fish.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Thanks everyone for yr replies... really appreciated..<br><br>I had a talk with her yesterday... she told me v frankly that she was with him... I do trust her but this incident has almost destroyed the love i initially felt towards her...<br><br>She told me tat guy is hitting on her... she don like it... but she don wnt to stay away from him cuz she don wnt to lose a friend.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"> Don she think she's weird? Readers please tell me if i'm right, she is not ready for a rel cuz she only cares about her own feelings and do not bother about how the other party may feel.<br><br>Her reason for initially contacting him: "Cuz everytime i at bus stop keep ogling at him den is like quite perverse, so i had to get to noe him." Readers pls tell me if she is ready for a rel. No sensible person will go out hitting on other guys juz cuz they are cute and live near u. I feel very hurt over wat she did and she now expects me to allow her to be with that guy as friends. Its alright but she tells me tat guy hits on her den she will freak out... but she don wnt lose friend so wont stay away from him.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_eek.gif" alt="Shocked" title="Shocked"><br><br>Ok people, wat i really feel is that she has been too pampered all her life and now she expects me to accept tat guy whom she forced into her life on her own acccord... wtf... pls tell me wat i should do now... beginning to feel this is becoming an abusive rel now...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>gotta agree wif Magnus.<br><br>ur GF obviously has 'some liking' for the guy, maybe she's abit confused, maybe she's using either one of you as a 'fall-back'.<br><br>However, she agrees to let him see the two of u together, and even tells u about him. I can interpret this as trust on her part - at least she has faith in her relation with you, and tells u the truth about what happened.<br><br>Either way, communication is most important. talk to her about what you have been thinking, about what have been making u feel uneasy. try not to flare up or argue. let her do her explaination.<br><br>from then on, its up to u - whether u chose to believe her or not. do u love her enough? trust her enough? if u chose to trust her, dont suspect anymore. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>i just think you two are kids. sorry to say this, but i don't think either of u knows what's love. you do not simply just love someone two months ago and then not anymore. i've been there, done that in jc. i know it's ain't love either. i'm not saying all who are in jc and in relationships dunno what's love, but it takes a few years' time to realize you've been stupid all this while. just part and parcel of growing up and life.<br><br>and yes, you do not call someone you love "shameless". you may feel she's been hurtful and doesn't cherish you, but since you think she's shameless, obviously you've never loved her too. you are not in any pain  either. so it proves its not love.

Enjoy your JC life and peers while u can, u might not know there may be some better gals that comes along your way in the later stage of your life.<br>If u dont like the feeling of wat she is giving u, tell her. Work it out, if not...stay out of it and concentrate on your studies. Sometime we have to swallow our pride when dealing with woman...cannot always nan zi han all the way....<br><br>Cheers</div>

But i really feel a lot of hurt if were to end the rel and wnt to do it only after my exams... ya... I kinda learnt not to rush into any rel again...<br><br>Juz wanna ask... will a childish and cutish girl ever grow up and mature? And rreally.. reallly... was it wrong for her to go look up and talk to tat guy.. or was I being overly sensitive... Cuz i need to noe if it was alright for her to do tat.. Thx</div></blockquote>Hi Sy_dreamer,<br><br>Have u asked urself, what is the difference between ending the relationship now and after the exams ? If u feel hurt, then wont u be so hurt now knowing that ur gonna end it - so it affects ur revision ? Err....i really dont know when is a better time....<br><br>A childish and cutish girl....hrmm...i think everyone will mature one day - at least physically i guess. depends on what kind of maturity u r talking about. actually the word maturity sounds too absolute for my liking sometimes... since relationships are much more relative in nature.  So i dont have an answer to your question....cos i dont even know if u understand what i am saying anyways.....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"><br><br>u keep on bringing the issue that she talk to her ex......and ask if its alright. may i say that u already have that answer indented into ur heart ? that u feel its super wrong and u are super pissed about it ? well, u can be pissed....i can say it aint right .....but whats that gonna do for you ?  why not ask her if its alright ? perhaps shes more sensible than u think and tell u more logical reasons than u can imagine for seeing her ex again ?  Or if not.....u can then close up this loop and end the relationship ? Hrmmm......can i say that u are more physically attracted to this girl then on what is up her brain ?<br><br>But well, if what u say is true - her being actively seeking the whereabouts of her ex....shes looking for something her ex provided or owe last time lor....so whats this thing that her ex provided ? understanding ? owe her money ? ??.....hai.....my dear boy....u really need to talk to her lah....<br><br>-- sorry huh...i read ur updated postings - so u talk to her already.<br><br>ok....now my conclusive advice for u - get away, get away...and concentrate on ur studies. dont worry lah....u will find ur lifetime companion along ur life journey....and hey its a long journey sia....ur still in JC !!<br><br></div>
