Promises to love her forever(or until breakup)? Doesn't most RS starts from friendship? People don't just go out and love someone right? Such RS(crush) most properly wouldn't last.<br><br>The confession is thus the most important part to sort out whos the apples and whos the pears. If anything is said, apples will always only be apples. And even the pears might become apples in the end.<br><br>Theres no idea what kind of impression she has until I confess. No need to pray(freethinker) since whats start out from nothing will only end up with nothing.<br><br></div>

Thanks for all the response.</div></blockquote>yes, telling face to face is always better than any other media of communication.<br><br>i did a wrg thing when i told her over the phone. i wanted to meet her but she wasnt free and keep pestering me to tell her bout it. so i told her. she sound happy and happy avoiding the qns to be together. okay, thou she doesnt reject or does reject me but now we still good frds and we still a pair of unofficial bf-gf. haha. cos i noe she still has something burried in her heart which she still cant release. i rather she put down the emotion barrier and be with me, rather than be with me with an emotion barrier inside her and end up break-up like her previous few un-successful r/s.</div>

I knows what food/drinks she likes and a rough idea about her taste in clothing. I knows who she gets along with in her family and also who she usually hang out with. She have no bf currently and no real RS in the past despite several suitors. Shes very friendly and was a bit of a chiongster in the past. Currently she have no close friends becos they have all lost contact. I knows shes afraid of cold and love swimming. Shes thinking of further studies and she worked in 5-6 jobs before. I know some of her body dimension like height, waist and footsize. Personally I knows quite a bit of her. I can even read some of her body language to differential between she and her almost identical sister. Its amazing how much you can learn from 8 months of chatting and 2 dates.<br><br>Far as I can tell I am ready and since I am geting a bad feeling I might be dragging the whole thing too long. It time for me to take action. I prefer something conclusive now before it affects my life any further. I am not expecting anything to last forever cos of  the no. of marriage breakups nowadays but I would like to start something and try to make things lasted.<br></div>
