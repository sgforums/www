Unless the meal is VERY expensive la... then I think its quite a fun way to distribute the cost. Of course must be 'ji dong' lah. Dont everytime the guy win liao then laugh and laugh, then show the girl like HAHAH I win!... Then everytime make the girl pay then a bit sian lah. OR vice versa.<br><br>Like one.. long time ago la.. decadessss....see this guy asked me out for dinner and I brought a friend  AND it was REALLY STRANGE cos after dinner, we offered to pay him... and.. err.. he say he will take my friend's payment and not take mine.

            <div class='col-md body'>lol there are so many different ways to approach this case ah... i think the guy didn't ask the girl out on a date and she still expect him to pay everything, then it shows what kinda person she is also ba. like that guy i'm talking about, he will ask me watch movie, then it's always on weekends, so i told him i don't wanna go. then if he still wants me to go despite me not wanting to, becuz he said i other day sure no time one, then can't expect me to pay right. In a different case the guy told me he feels good to be able to pay occasionally for the girl. like it is his way of showing concern for the girl and his 'instinct' of being able to provide for the girl. haha is tat true for u guys?<br><br>my 20th post is over............................................. :O..........................................</div>
