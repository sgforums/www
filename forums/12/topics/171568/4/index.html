If you really dun like him, dont even go out with him, or chit chat with him to give him false hope. I m not branding all gals are the same but then, unless you got slight feelings for him, try not to go out alone too often with him.

So here goes...<br><br>I just went to Poly and joined a CCA. There is this guy who insists he fell in love with me after I met him once at the CCA, and has been chasing me until now, which is like 2 semesters liao. He insists on paying for my meals and movie tickets whenever I go out with him, and because we don't have any common friends, I feel very uncomfortable going out with him alone. I made it clear from the start that I did not have any feelings for him, and he told me he knows and just wants to be friends. But would friends pay all the meals and movie tix and buy a birthday present over $100 for a girl who isn't even specially nice to them?<br><br>Then becuz I feel uncomfortable with going out with him alone, I will ask him to join my frenz or ask him to bring his frenz along. Then whenever I do that he will sulk or get angry (frustrated) and say things like, "I want to spend time alone with you" or "I don't have any friends. I only have you". But he told me he knew I didn't want to be more than friends wat... Then how do you explain his behavior?<br><br>I dunno I get these kind of cases a lot, when guys just think that if they go out with me they have to pay for every single thing I do. I mean maybe movie can la but plus every meal the guy so poor thing la... More so if they work for the money. Then if a guy wooing a girl doesn't pay for her stuff does that mean she will reject you? I wouldn't, but I don't noe about other girls. Just very curious about this.<br><br>He might be one who's having a 1-sided interest in you.. Not sure if he pins more hope, but he might be contented with just being with you and enjoying your company for now... Yup... At least for NOW...<br><br>Is he a VERY INTROVERT person..? If he is... Not suggesting anything but just be more caution.. Some of such can have weird temper and you'll never really know when you might step on his toes...<br><br><strong><br>And I donno whether this is common, but whenever I like a guy, when he likes me back, I realise I don't like him already. Why ah? I think I quite alone in that trait cuz normally is the other way around. (eg: U like someone then when you give up the person likes you.) I am wondering whether it has to do with my inability to commit or something. Maybe I don't like being tied down or pressured. Does anyone have similiar cases?<br><br>What a way to start the new year man... I hope everyone will enjoy their hols and new year and ang pows...</strong></div></blockquote><strong>Seen such people like yourself. More like know? Some belongs to the 'attitude' group while other more of the 'flirty' group... That's just generally speaking...<br><br>If you're interested, you should really try to find out more and understand yourself?<br><br>PS. You have a small family?</strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Last advice, ditch him for good. Spend ur remaining 2 yrs in Poly wisely on ur books. Looking back, I kind of see myself in that guy shoes. End up, me and the chick screwed up our studies and ended up with different partners <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>Anyway, try to advance ur studies after completion. Falling in luv down the road will be easy for u chicks. True fact, life wld be harder when u start working in this forsaken world.
