            <div class='col-md body'>On the contrary it is quite normal to feel that your liking for someone has faded once you know that person likes you just as much. Maybe it is because of the human being's tendency to want something that is not theirs yet. Maybe it has something to do with our tendency to take something as granted once we have it.<br><br>As about the guy wanting to pay for your meal and everything, he is doing it out of his own willingness right? Try telling him again that you will never develop any feelings for him no matter how much he spend on you and if he continues to do it, then there is nothing much you can do I suppose. Or you can just directly refuse to accept money from him. It should be really up to you, you have the power to not accept. Sooner or later, if you keep this up, he will understand and hopefully leave you alone.</div>

Everyone has to go through this phase to experience what is life. You must be a attractive lady to have so many guys going after you.<br><br>Ok back to topic. You cannot stop someone from going after you but you can declare to him that he should not be sulking or frustrated if he wants to remain friends with you. If he presist in his behaviour then say you are sorry is time to go. You have given him a chance to be your friend but if he wants to think otherwise is time to leave him.<br><br>You have not given your heart to anyone yet and you feel that you still want to enjoy life as a single. Is perfectly normal, you are still young and pretty go out and enjoy the beautiful world. Travel around and see the world.</div>

So here goes...<br><br>I just went to Poly and joined a CCA. There is this guy who insists he fell in love with me after I met him once at the CCA, and has been chasing me until now, which is like 2 semesters liao. He insists on paying for my meals and movie tickets whenever I go out with him, and because we don't have any common friends, I feel very uncomfortable going out with him alone. I made it clear from the start that I did not have any feelings for him, and he told me he knows and just wants to be friends. But would friends pay all the meals and movie tix and buy a birthday present over $100 for a girl who isn't even specially nice to them?<br><br>Then becuz I feel uncomfortable with going out with him alone, I will ask him to join my frenz or ask him to bring his frenz along. Then whenever I do that he will sulk or get angry (frustrated) and say things like, "I want to spend time alone with you" or "I don't have any friends. I only have you". But he told me he knew I didn't want to be more than friends wat... Then how do you explain his behavior?<br><br>I dunno I get these kind of cases a lot, when guys just think that if they go out with me they have to pay for every single thing I do. I mean maybe movie can la but plus every meal the guy so poor thing la... More so if they work for the money. Then if a guy wooing a girl doesn't pay for her stuff does that mean she will reject you? I wouldn't, but I don't noe about other girls. Just very curious about this.<br><br>And I donno whether this is common, but whenever I like a guy, when he likes me back, I realise I don't like him already. Why ah? I think I quite alone in that trait cuz normally is the other way around. (eg: U like someone then when you give up the person likes you.) I am wondering whether it has to do with my inability to commit or something. Maybe I don't like being tied down or pressured.

But of course.. if a guy's trying to get into the good shoes of a girl... he would be most willing to part with his money... it's something called investment ya... who wants to be with a calculative and stingy guy?? But not paying for all her stuffz.. doesn't mean the gal will reject him... not every gal is that materialistic after all....<br><br><blockquote>And I donno whether this is common, but whenever I like a guy, when he likes me back, I realise I don't like him already.
