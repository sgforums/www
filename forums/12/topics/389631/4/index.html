              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I am in my forties...</p>
              <p>Started my career in the govt sector in 1991.  Left it
              briefly in 1999.  But the new company decided to screw up my
              job role (when I went for my 1st day, they said I was doing another
              job)  and so decided to go back to my previous job. 
              Having gotten my job, I had to repay their faith in me.</p>
              <p>And so, I have been working for 20 years now.  Meanwhile,
              my wife worked up the career ladder to a managerial post and now
              earns $10k per month, with bonus around $160k per year.</p>
              <p>She quite had it with the pressures of her job and now decided
              to become a property agent.  She has a guy friend who does
              part time property agent.  This guy is investment savy - He
              has 10 properties under his name and drives a Lexus RX350.</p>
              <p>Lately, she has been comparing him with me.  Well, I earn
              120 - 130k per year.  Is that really bad?  She said I am
              not aggressive enough in my career.  I am in a line of work
              with skills are that not really needed elsewhere.  I tried
              applying for 2 other jobs 6 months ago, but the fact is, no one
              wants to employ a man in his forties without any relevant
              skills.</p>
              <p>When both of us started work, she was earning much lesser than
              me, I have no complains.  I footed the bills and even paid off
              her 3 months notice in the early years.  Now, she is implying
              I am not earning enough aka a loser.  Tried to talk to her
              last night but hit a blank wall.  I was talking and she
              decided to sleep.</p>
              <p>What has become of a husband and wife??  Where's the simple
              respect for each other?</p>
              <p>*Sigh*  Just want to say it out....</p>

              <p>I think you need to rebuild that communication platform 1st where both must be able to listen to each other's point of view.</p>
              <p>I suppose with your combine income, you guys should have substancial savings by now. So there should not be much of a issue if you guys slow down a bit to enjoy what life has to offer instead of been slave to $$$$.</p>
              <p>Tell her, she cant bring big cars and many houses to her grave anyway and why waste time on them and then miss out what is truly precious, like a wonderful family.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you can bring her to relaxing vacations and amazing destinations. Let her feel the joy of materialism is nothing compared to what joy of inner peace when a person is content.</p>
              <p>Most important is that please dont expect overnight changes. You will need time and patience. Do not force your opinions on her, try to use illustrations and examples and let her come to her own conclusion.</p>
              <p>Finally, I wish you all the best and hope things will turn well.</p>
