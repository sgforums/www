              <p>My job not stable?  Govt job...very stable.  I am doing IT.  Moreover, no one wants my job.  Problem is career advancement is hard to come by when you reach forty.  Govt's thinking is that they would rather nuture and promote those in 30s as they can contribute more before retiring.</p>
              <p>Govt business is very different from private.  Skills are irrelevant.  Tried applying for job in bank and oil company.  No replies from both.  As I said...who is going to want a man in his 40s without any experience?</p>
              <p>For her?  Well, her immediate superior was in the same company many year ago.  Her superior promoted her and gave her commendations.  So, she was lucky.</p>
              <p>Money-wise...we got a condo to pay off and 2 kids to raise.</p>
              <p>Sex is hard to come by...when she feels like it...she will wear a lingerie.  Other than that, sex is around once every 2 weeks and when she feels like it.  When I try to get under her pants, it is damned hard!</p>

              <p>some women are like that, and there are plenty out there. to them, being successful means earning 7 digits annually or more, and driving posh cars and living in either condo or landed properties. she may not be like this when she was younger, but as the years go by, her thinking may be shaped by materialism.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Women being materialistic is common knowledge. also nagging and being disparaging are also second nature to them. I am not sure how you communicate with her better, but if she tend to ignore you, signs are that your marriage is on the rocks. you can either put it up and see show things are going, esp if you have children. if really cannot put up with her anymore, then you have to decide if you want to part with her.</p>

              <p>firstly .... something doesn't compute</p>
              <p>you said your wifey was making in 10+ a month ....and that you were making 120-130k a year .... doesn't that come up to about the same ? .... granted, it's unlikely your bonus will exceed your drawn salary in the goverment service unless you were a minister, there's still the PB. Have you been doing well enough to get those, or have you been coasting along in your job ?</p>
              <p>And secondly, you're in IT, with the influx of an nehs and ah tiongs into IT, or any other fields for that matter, don't expect to make one twenty a year in a private sector job unless your papers' something special.</p>
              <p>You are making more than one hundred thousand a year, that makes your iron rice bowl a pretty gilded one, I suggest you stick to it. The odds are against your wifey succeeding as a property agent. Singapore is so overrun with property agents and insurance agents etc that chances are, everyone knows at least 3 of each. So you'll be the top dog soon enough again.</p>
              <p>Next, if that's the way your wifey treats you, then I would say your wifey's the one wearing the pants in the relationship. And if this is a recent behaviourial change, either your wifey's lost her respect for you as a man, or, she is definitely bonking someone else. </p>
              <p>Either way you got to man up. No matter how domineering or aggressive a woman is, deep down, they are all looking for a man strong enough for them to submit to. It's really not about the amount of money you rake in, or how slick or handsome you are. You just got to make them feel like a woman, and make them think like you're a real man, instead of a meek, submissive, spineless fellow. remember, you're the one with the penis here. It doesn't take another man to destroy a relationship, all it takes is for the woman to stop thinking of you as a man.</p>
              <p>Lastly, if you think your wifey's not doing anything extra-marital, then, it's your funeral. I would say the danger signs are all there, trips overseas without you, late night socializing, and it's apparent that she's been yakking enough to you about the other chap that you know all the details about him. At the very least, don't you think you should find things out,  instead of burying your head in the sand ? this is not the time for a civil servant mentality here ....</p>
