              <p>I got to know a friend and also a classmate. We started off as
              friends and went out tgt on a friend basis. But eventually i liked
              her. However, eventually i found out that she already has a
              boyfriend, and he happens to be a good friend of mine. But i
              couldnt withdraw, i really liked her alot. She did not tell it to
              me sooner as she wanted to be with me. In other words, i continued
              to see her even after having found out my good friend was her bf.
              He found out and condemned the 2 of us. He made things really
              difficult for both of us. I know its wrong of me. I was reluctant
              to type this out. I know i would be hated badly even by u guys
              perhaps. But i really liked her. I know i should have left her once
              I had found out the truth, but at that time i really can't. She
              broke up with him and went with me. However, that friend, perhaps
              no longer, is feeling deep hatred for the 2 of us. I know no1 is
              gonna give us their blessings. I can understand how my friend
              feels. The guilt is haunting me, I am so disturbed by everything.
              But i really like her. I wouldnt give her up to ease my guilt. But
              i can't stand this guilt any longer. I know i deserve it, but why
              can't i juz love this girl i like and who likes me. Please give me
              advise. I'm sorry that some of u might hate me for this.</p>

              <p><br>i did not justify it at all. i just tot that no one can understand wat is going on except the parties invovled. it's the choices of people that they make though. you will never understand certain things unless u go through it urself though. i'm seeing in a neutral light though</p>
