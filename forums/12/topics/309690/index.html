            <div class='col-md body'><p>I got to know a friend and also a classmate. We started off as friends and went out tgt on a friend basis. But eventually i liked her. However, eventually i found out that she already has a boyfriend, and he happens to be a good friend of mine. But i couldnt withdraw, i really liked her alot. She did not tell it to me sooner as she wanted to be with me. In other words, i continued to see her even after having found out my good friend was her bf. He found out and condemned the 2 of us. He made things really difficult for both of us. I know its wrong of me. I was reluctant to type this out. I know i would be hated badly even by u guys perhaps. But i really liked her. I know i should have left her once I had found out the truth, but at that time i really can't. She broke up with him and went with me. However, that friend, perhaps no longer, is feeling deep hatred for the 2 of us. I know no1 is gonna give us their blessings. I can understand how my friend feels. The guilt is haunting me, I am so disturbed by everything. But i really like her. I wouldnt give her up to ease my guilt. But i can't stand this guilt any longer. I know i deserve it, but why can't i juz love this girl i like and who likes me. Please give me advise. I'm sorry that some of u might hate me for this.</p></div>

              <p>In the 1st place, you should have some integrity in yourself when you know that the girl that you liked is attached to your good friend. It is a matter of principle, not a matter of what you like.</p>
              <p>You had a choice in the 1st place but chose otherwise. You are just inviting for a lashing session and a great discount to your character. Simply just have no words for you.</p>
              <p>As for your present r/s, I hope you will cherish your "ill-gotten" and not hurt another soul that is your current g/f. Just beware somethings will come around and hope that you will remember what you had started. What goes round, will come round - just be prepared.</p>
