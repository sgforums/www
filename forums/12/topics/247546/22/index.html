In any case, my issue isn't exactly on how the case is fought. But it became a point where the fight was something else.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>I also see many response which are personally offensive to her which I feel is also uncalled for, and yet no one defends her. If it is purely personal and you are judging her based on her personality. Then unfortunately I cannot condone it.</strong>[/quote]<br><br>Well those kind of silly replies I choose to ignore and disregard them. Focus on the more relevant posts instead then.<br></div><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>Everyone in this forums has their own agenda, if not this forum will not have existed and flourished till today.</blockquote></div></blockquote>So what is yours?<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>Please, I cannot read your mind. So, if you so believe that VK has a hidden agenda. Be our guest, do let tell.</strong></div></blockquote>VK has always had personal issues with Devil, even before the rumours/incidents/allegations/accusations happened. Since then she has looked for every oppurtunity to comment on Devil. She has even admitted to openly flaming Devil.<br><br>You may feel VK is standing up for the victim but as I said in earlier posts, if VK truly had the victim in mind, there were something things she wouldn't have done and certain things she wouldn't have needed prompting to do.<br><br>Sometimes, VK's posts against Devil compromise the good that is supposed to be done. For eg, her opening numerous threads only caused other threads of people genuinely seeking advice to be pused down. And as for VK's threads getting closed, it has been explained before.<br><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>Indiscriminate postings is already rampant in this particular threads. So why do you chose to single me out ? Is it because I did not support your stand ?</blockquote></div>Sometimes the rest is rubbish, hence not worthy of mention. In your case, I see you strongly want to stand up for something, but the thing is what exactly are you standing up for? As mentioned before, I see a distinction between standing up for the victim and supporting VK.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>Just because I do not agree with you does not make me your enemy.</strong></div></blockquote>You should tell VK that as well, she goes on an offensive mode sometimes when somebody else is just trying to inform her differently.<br><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>Everyone is entitled to defend oneself.</blockquote></div>I kind of don't see the relation here now..... are you referring to the victim or VK?<br><br>The funny part is, you seem to repeatedly judge others based on your own narrow opinion. Questionable or not is merely what it is.. questionable. Have you found the answer to it yet ?<br><br>Do not believe this world will conform to your beliefs because you say so. Conformity is detrimental to our safety and freedom. I hope you can understand that as well.<br><br>[/b]</div>
