But you guys seem to be in good position to overtake.<br><br>The harm you're causing is you are bringing attention back to the incident and more importantly, the victim. Who really would appreciate the attention away from that incident and she has already requested for piece. No matter how much you try to flame only Devil, it will still bring the spotlight back on the victim, so spare a thought. A report has already been made so action has already been taken.<br><br>Also, like I said, your continuing to post here will not help anything towards removal of Devil as mod. Your posts here only continue to generate unnecessary conflict among the rest of the forumites and is disturbing what little peace there is left in AA. Especially when you guys are making enemies out of everyone who doesn't agree with your methods and blindly accusing them of siding with Devil. Moreover, the personal insults and comments are unwarranted towards the other people no matter how angry or how unjustified you feel about Devil's case.<br><br>Basically, your continuing to talk about Devil and to flame him achieve nothing.

Also, please remember when you bring up the issue again, you are turning the spotlight back on the victim as well. Have that in mind first. If you think the victim deserves having the spotlight on her again or that doing that to her is justified, then it's a different discussion. One I am not going to partake in, but please note the implications of your actions on the victim. Note also her previous requests to stop bringing up the matter.<br><br>Also, no need to keep getting hostile towards everyone who disagrees with your methods, they mean well too. And don't make blind accussations that they are siding with Devil when they are not. They do not condone any inappropriate behaviour, but it doesn't mean they necessarily agree with your methods either. Being hostile with them is making enemies unnecessarily.<br><br>As you continue to raise up the issue again, consider the victim as well. Also, AA does not need you to keep talking about this issue when action has already been taken.<br><br>As for the instant removal of Devil as mod, people have already explained the process to you. You can disagree with the process, but that's the way it is for now. Perhaps you think AA is better off unmoded, there are those who think not. Then again, these same people have different intepretation of the role of mod.<br><br>Thank you for taking time to note my points, now the choice is back to you what you guys want to do. I'm just glad to have the chance to put my point across to you, whether or not you take it up.<br><br>Thanks once again.</div>
