I agree that we have heard more than enough from VK. And your points to her have already previously been mentioned to her as well.<br><br>Do note also though that VK has not posted for a few pages already. Maybe she's asleep? But anyway, let's just hope we hear enough from her on this issue and we certainly do not want to see her opening more threads about this same thing again. The victim in question has afterall asked for thread to be closed, why does VK not consent I have no idea. But she really should spare a thought for the girl in question as well. Which is why I have always have 2nd doubts about VK's intentions<br><br>In any case, I believe VK should have enough sense not to continue stoking flames unnecessarily although it'd be best if she agreed to close this thread as well. What should be said has already been said and the action to be taken has already been decided. Short of stepping up to be mod, I don't see why VK has anything else to add.<br><br>Having said that, I think we ourselves should try to keep the peace too. Which is why I've abstained from posting despite following the last few pages.</div>

I would for her to prove to us she's not as rash as impulsive as we all think she is. Maybe after some sleep she'll act differently. Let's not comment unless she really continues her nonsensical flaming. Even if she does, she's only proving right what many have said abt her. So no point telling her all over again.<br><br>Let her future posts speak for themselves. Maybe she'll just come in chat? Although she seems to love to make enemies out of everyone who doesn't agree with her. Let's just she how it goes..... She hasn't been posting, hasn't been flaming. Let's not give her reason to start again.</div>
