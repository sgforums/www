People 'like' you simply because they don't know you well enough. They just know what you try to put up front to act up for them. People who bother to think and not blindly just perceive what they can see can too easily see through your tricks. So you wanna celebrate for that? Go ahead.<br><br>Like I've said, there're some people who disgust me. I still do wish to have my 3 decent meals a day.
