Which is why I used the word 'clueless'.<br><br>Before you continue to get mistaken, by commenting about VK, it does not mean we condone any inappropriate acts that have happened offline. Moreover, action has already been taken by the relevant people. Certain posts and topics thereafter by VK have been unnecessary and inappriopriate even. Posts and threads that caused more harm than good. Also, VK's intentions have been questionable.

I have no intention on declaring war on you. <strong>What will you and I gain from it?</strong> The right to boast? Just because we don't agree on the strategy doesn't mean we need to fight.

Do you tell her " girl you have to take responsibility for your perpertrator's action" ???? What kind of logic is that ??<br><br>Do you also tell her " Let's not make a big hoo haa outa it, because it ain't a big deal" What kind of counsellor is that ????<br><br>You might as well feed that poor girl to the sharks.<br><br>I have seen too many, infact way too many girls being taken advantage of, and yet they meekly back off into the back ground because of fear, shame, uncertainty. Is that deem acceptable by you ???<br><br>Perhaps.. just perhaps have you question this.. if VK did not make a big deal outa it, it would just become another story the society shrugs off so easily.<br><br>The fact that VK made so much fire outa this is also not entirely her doing. In this case, it takes many hands to raise such an uproar.<br><br>Have you ever regretted not standing up and fight after you have been taken advantage of ? I did. And I hated that feeling. The anguish of being weak is unspeakable.<br><br>And unfortunately, many of us are weak, that's why people comes into our lives to support us and give us courage.  So that we can do what we normally wouldn't have the courage to do.<br><br>What VK has done is just that, give the girl her courage.<br><br>If it takes this much action to get things done, to move things along. Don't you think we need more stronger rower in the boat ??<br><br>No doubt it takes two hands to clap. But like I said before, just because you can or have the opportunity to take, does not mean you should.<br><br>For what VK has done, she has indeed shine a very bright light on this Devil.<br>So let this be a warning to all users in this virtual arena.<br><br>The way I see it, the word to describe her is not emotional, infact, more passionate. A rarity among souless Singaporeans.<br><br></div>
