            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by viciouskitty74:</div><div class="quote_body">Opps, my bad.  It should be the criminal registry.<br><br>Both registry are side by side at the sub court.  I remembered wrongly which one I went into.<br><br>But here's roughly how its done, when you are insulted, especially on text.<br><br>~~~~~~<br><br>Step 1: Filing of a Magistrates' Complaint<br>A Magistrates Complaint can be filed by any person who wishes to seek redress for an offence that they believe has been committed against them. The person filing the Complaint is known as the Complainant and the person against whom the application is made is known as the Respondent.<br><br>The complaint should be made in the standard Complaint form (click here for the form).<br><br>The completed form should be submitted to the Complaints Counter of the Crime Registry, together with a copy of a Police report, if any and a photocopy of the ComlplainantÂ’s NRIC. The Complainant has to affirm or swear to the truth and accuracy of the matters stated in the application form before a Magistrate. If the Magistrate is satisfied that the application is in order, he may do any of the following:<br><br>Issue a Notice to both the Complainant and Respondent;<br>b) If the Respondents address or particulars are not available, direct the police to ascertain the particulars and thereafter issue a Notice to both the Complainant and Respondent;<br>c) Issue a Summons against the Respondent provided that the Charge(s) are available;<br>d) Direct the police to investigate the Complaint;<br>e) Dismiss the Complaint<br><br>Step 2a : Issue of Notices<br>When the Judge directs that a Notice be issued to both the Complainant and the Respondent, the Crime Registry will prepare the Notices informing parties of the date and time they are required to appear before a Magistrate in chambers for what is known as Criminal Mediation. At this stage, no fee is payable by the Complainant.<br><br>Step 2b: Service of Summons<br>Where a Summons is issued, the Complainant has to pay $1 for the issuance of the summons. The Complainant must serve the Summons on the Respondent. This is to give the Respondent notice that a Complaint has been started against him. Service may be effected by:<br><br>(1) personal service: an authorised person (usually the Court Process Server if the Complainant does not have a lawyer) must hand the Summons to the Respondent personally. The Complainant will have to accompany the Court process server to serve the summons on the respondent. Transport charges for the service of the summons are borne by the Complainant.<br>If the above service fails, the process server may obtain the court's approval to serve the summons by:<br>(2) leaving the summons with an adult member of the Respondent's household; or<br>(3) posting the summons on the front door of the Respondent's place of residence<br><br>It should be noted that a summons cannot be served on a Respondent who is residing outside Singapore. Also, if the Complainant does not know the current address of the Respondent, the court will try to ascertain the address through available official records and effect service there.<br>However, if it can be shown that the Respondent is no longer residing at the address that is reflected in available official records, the Complainant has a duty to find out the Respondent's current address. If the address cannot be determined, the Complaint cannot proceed.<br><br>Step 3: Criminal Mediation<br>When a Magistrate directs that a Notice be issued to both the Complainant and the Respondent, it means that the matter is fixed for criminal mediation before a Magistrate in Chambers.<br>The Complainant must be present on that date of the Criminal Mediation as otherwise, it will be deemed that the Complainant is no longer interested in pursuing the Complaint and the Magistrate will strike out the Complaint.<br>When both parties appear before a Magistrate, any of the following may occur:<br><br>a) The Magistrate may refer both parties to a Community Mediation Centre(CMC). The CMC has a panel of trained mediators who are respected members of society coming from all walks of life. If the matter is settled, parties will sign a settlement Agreement. Where there is no settlement, fresh Notices will be sent to the Complainant and the Respondent to appear before the Magistrate.<br>b) The Magistrate may mediate the matter . If a settlement is reached, the Complaint will be withdrawn and no further action will be taken.<br>If there is no settlement and the Complainant may wish to proceed to trial by way of a private summons, a summons will be issued once the Complainant has prepared the necessary charges against the Respondent and a fee of $1 for each summons is paid.<br>c) The Magistrate may refer the Complaint and the Respondent to a Court Mediator for mediation. If a settlement is reached, the Mediator will inform the Magistrate and the steps taken would be as b) above. Similarly, if no settlement is reached, the steps taken would be as b) above.<br>If the Respondent is absent on the day of the Criminal Mediation, the Court may either issue a fresh Notice or a Warrant of Arrest against him. If a warrant of arrest is issued, it is handed over to the Warrant Enforcement Unit (a division of the Singapore Police Force) for them to execute. The police will arrest the Respondent and produce him in Court. The court will offer the Respondent bail and re-fix the case for mediation. The execution of the warrant of arrest may not be immediate.<br>Enquiries on the status of execution of warrants of arrest can be made to the Warrant Enforcement Unit which is located at 391 New Bridge Road, D0308 Police Cantonment Complex, Singapore 088762, Tel Nos: 6557 5316/6557 5310.<br><br>Step 4 : Hearing of Summons<br>At the hearing the Respondent will be asked to enter a plea of guilty or not guilty. If the Respondent pleads guilty, he will be sentenced by the Court immediately.<br>A trial will be conducted if the Respondent pleads not guilty. The parties will each have to give evidence in open court, to prove their respective cases. They will also have to call witnesses to support their case. The parties and their respective witnesses will be "cross-examined". "Cross-examination" is carried out by the other party or the party's lawyer, who will ask questions on what was said in evidence. The respective lawyers will also make "submissions", i.e. present a summary of your case, and make arguments supporting your case, to the Judge. The whole process may take anything from one day to several days, depending on the number of witnesses and the complexity of the case. At the end of the hearing, the court will decide whether the Respondent is guilty of the offences as charges.<br>In the event that the Respondent is absent on that day, the Court will issue a Warrant of Arrest against him. The warrant of arrest is passed to the Warrant Enforcement Unit (a division of the Singapore Police Force) to execute. The police will arrest the Respondent and produce him in Court. The court will offer the Respondent bail and re-fix the case for mediation. The execution of the warrant of arrest may not be immediate enquiries on the status of execution of warrants of arrest can be made to the Warrant Enforcement Unit which is located at 391 New Bridge Road, D0308 Police Cantonment Complex, Singapore 088762, Tel Nos: 6557 5316/6557 5310.<br><br></div></blockquote>Above was successful against a female, using vulgar language on text, traced thru her friend cos the complainant knows the fren who knows her.<br><br>She was summoned to appear in a magistrate court judge and make to contribute S$2000/- to a charity fund as well as offer a apology in person to the complainant.</div>
