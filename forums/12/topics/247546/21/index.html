You know you got blood in your hands for this case.  Do you want to continue suppressing the truth and thereby causing more victims get molested?

            <div class='col-md body'>Haiz.... This was the exact mentality that Chin Eng and I were talking about. Just because we don't agree with you on one two issues you treat us like your enemy and disagree with us on everything.<br><br>Once again, you are getting a lot of thing wrong on many occassions.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by jojobeach:</div><div class="quote_body">Dear Chin Eng,<br>When you are given a charge whom has been molested by someone she trust. Do you tell her " girl you have to take responsibility for your perpertrator's action" ???? What kind of logic is that ??<br><br>Do you also tell her " Let's not make a big hoo haa outa it, because it ain't a big deal" What kind of counsellor is that ????</div></blockquote>That was never what Chin Eng was talking about. To say something like that is tantamount to putting words in other people's mouths. Chin Eng has already clarfied this so I won't go further.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>You might as well feed that poor girl to the sharks.</strong>[/quote]<br><br>Seriously, there were times VK had to be prompted to spare a thought for the victim. Go figure.<br></div><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>I have seen too many, infact way too many girls being taken advantage of, and yet they meekly back off into the back ground because of fear, shame, uncertainty. Is that deem acceptable by you ???</blockquote></div></blockquote>Where VK is concerned, it has gone beyond that. Action was already taken, VK wanted more.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>Perhaps.. just perhaps have you question this.. if VK did not make a big deal outa it, it would just become another story the society shrugs off so easily.</strong></div></blockquote>That's an assumption by you.<br><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>The fact that VK made so much fire outa this is also not entirely her doing. In this case, it takes many hands to raise such an uproar.</blockquote></div>You added the most to it by starting one thread after the other. Moreover, her posts kind of moved away from the actual incident and got very personal and emotional in nature. Something VK has concede as well. It had gotten beyond standing up for the victim to being far more personal.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>Have you ever regretted not standing up and fight after you have been taken advantage of ? I did. And I hated that feeling. The anguish of being weak is unspeakable.</strong></div></blockquote>There have been other people who have stood up for the victim in this alleged case as well. However, VK's posts and threads are different.<br><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>And unfortunately, many of us are weak, that's why people comes into our lives to support us and give us courage.  So that we can do what we normally wouldn't have the courage to do.</blockquote></div>Again like I said earlier, support the victim and give courage, yes. Support VK then I'd have to think thrice.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>What VK has done is just that, give the girl her courage.</strong></div></blockquote>I think a lot of others have shown their support to the victim as well, and there have been times where VK's actions would have made the girl more scared than give her courage.<br><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>If it takes this much action to get things done, to move things along. Don't you think we need more stronger rower in the boat ??</blockquote></div>Things were being done and already had been done. That is the whole issue here. Action was already taken but VK went on because of personal vendetta.<br><br><strong></strong><blockquote><strong></strong><div class="quote_from"><strong>No doubt it takes two hands to clap. But like I said before, just because you can or have the opportunity to take, does not mean you should.</strong></div></blockquote>Different discussion entirely.<br><div class="quote_body"><blockquote>For what VK has done, she has indeed shine a very bright light on this Devil.<br>So let this be a warning to all users in this virtual arena.</blockquote></div>The warning was already given, VK went beyond that. Spare a thought also for the victim. Also, you must consider if VK's numerous threads and posting caused more harm than good. Blowing something big doesn't always mean it's good.<br><br><strong>[quote]The way I see it, the word to describe her is not emotional, infact, more passionate. A rarity among souless Singaporeans.</strong>Overly passionate is the same as being too emotional. Once again, stand up against wrong doing, yes. But to support VK's actions, no.<br><br>[/b][/quote]<br><br></div>
