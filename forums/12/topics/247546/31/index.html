Do read what's below before you make wrong assumptions about me again.<br><br><blockquote>Originally posted by SumOne:<br><strong><br><br>I think different people have different intepretation of this.

VK has done that on occassion and a lot of other people.<br><br>Never has it been that giving advice (non-professional) was limited solely to the mods alone.<br><br>I think there is a seperate issue here about the role of a mod esepecially for AA. Some people believe the role of AA should be different from that for other forums. I personally see no diff between the role of mod in AA or elsewhere.<br><br>If people wanted to give advice, they don't have to be a mod to do it. If somebody wanted to PM another forumite and ask him or her out, it doesn't require mod status to do so. VK has asked Devil to meet up thousands of times, Devil just didn't agree.<br><br>[b]<span style="color: blue;">My point is this, different people have different intepretations about what Mod in AA is. And also different intepretation of the heading of AA.</span> </strong>Maybe it's confusing, maybe it's wrong, maybe it's politically correct. All I'm saying is please realise the differece in intepretation.[/b]</blockquote>To summarise, different people have different expectation or intepretation about what the role of Mod is in AA. I am not asking you to agree with me on the role of moderator, but understand that there is a difference in intepretation of the role as AA Mod.<br><br>To add, for a sexual predator to make his advances on anyone here in AA or even in the whole of sgforums, it doesn't require mod status to do something like that.<br><br>In any case, Devil has already announced that he will be relinquishing the role of mod, what are you guys asking for now? If you want him to be answerable for deeds offline, a report has already been made.</div>

I don't see the victim and defendant posting much about the case, but I see you VK spamming all corners about the case. The fact is are you one of the victim or are you trying to get others' attentions? If I remember correctly, the victim had made the necessary arrangements about her case and the defendant had also made his stand, so isn't that enough? So why are you opening so many thread about the case? Even if there is anything, the victim and the defendant will settle it either themselves or with the help of others (E.g. police).<br><br>If you are trying to warn others, yes we now all know about it thanks to you.<br><br>If you are trying to make a drama out of it, I say please join the kids central, you might stand a chance.<br><br>If you are trying to help the victim, I say you are only making the wound serious.<br><br>If you have personal grudges against the defendant, please refrain from opening multiples thread and stick to one. I should let you know that there are others way to do it, use PM or even better, burn his house.<br><br>I was refraining to comment about this in the past, but now, this case is hogging up the page, there are nothing much to see except case like this. You know what's I'm thinking seeing this kind of thread? I laugh at the foolishness seen in the thread, to me all this is nothing but jokes. Why? Its all talk and no actions done. If any actions were to done, it will be from the victims or the defendant and not you (You = to all). All I see is 3 factions throwing nothing but rubber bands against each other, thinking that they are helping with the case. First faction is those who stand at the victims' side, second is those who are standing at the defendant side and third is those who are seeing the saga and shooting rubber bands at anyone they feel like.<br><br>After reading all of the threads about this case, it remind me something (from Star Wars):<br><br>1) The Phantom Menace - The victims made known about the case. It all started from the defendant, isn't it?<br>2) Attack of the Clones - After that, clones start to flame each other about the case.<br>3) Revenge of the Sith - Personal grudges from VK to the defendant?<br>4) A New Hope - The case were about to settle down but because of VK opening multiple thread about this, forumers have new hope in shooting others rubber band.<br>5) The Empire Strikes Back - The defendant start striking back... I mean start posting his stand.<br>6) Return of the Jedi - After seeing the defendant's stand, the victim start posting about the case again...<br><br>So tell me what's next?

I don't see the victim and defendant posting much about the case, but I see you VK spamming all corners about the case. The fact is are you one of the victim or are you trying to get others' attentions? If I remember correctly, the victim had made the necessary arrangements about her case and the defendant had also made his stand, so isn't that enough? So why are you opening so many thread about the case? Even if there is anything, the victim and the defendant will settle it either themselves or with the help of others (E.g. police).<br><br>If you are trying to warn others, yes we now all know about it thanks to you.<br><br>If you are trying to make a drama out of it, I say please join the kids central, you might stand a chance.<br><br>If you are trying to help the victim, I say you are only making the wound serious.<br><br>If you have personal grudges against the defendant, please refrain from opening multiples thread and stick to one. I should let you know that there are others way to do it, use PM or even better, burn his house.<br><br>I was refraining to comment about this in the past, but now, this case is hogging up the page, there are nothing much to see except case like this. You know what's I'm thinking seeing this kind of thread? I laugh at the foolishness seen in the thread, to me all this is nothing but jokes. Why? Its all talk and no actions done. If any actions were to done, it will be from the victims or the defendant and not you (You = to all). All I see is 3 factions throwing nothing but rubber bands against each other, thinking that they are helping with the case. First faction is those who stand at the victims' side, second is those who are standing at the defendant side and third is those who are seeing the saga and shooting rubber bands at anyone they feel like.<br><br>After reading all of the threads about this case, it remind me something (from Star Wars):<br><br>1) The Phantom Menace - The victims made known about the case. It all started from the defendant, isn't it?<br>2) Attack of the Clones - After that, clones start to flame each other about the case.<br>3) Revenge of the Sith - Personal grudges from VK to the defendant?<br>4) A New Hope - The case were about to settle down but because of VK opening multiple thread about this, forumers have new hope in shooting others rubber band.<br>5) The Empire Strikes Back - The defendant start striking back...
