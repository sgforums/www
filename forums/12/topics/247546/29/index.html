Let the police do their investigation. All of us should refrain from unnecessary comments in the meantime.<br><br>Hope my post will be the last one.

            <div class='col-md body'>And so... the saga of sgforum continues...<br><br>Seriously, what the heck are you thinking VK? I don't see the victim and defendant posting much about the case, but I see you VK spamming all corners about the case. The fact is are you one of the victim or are you trying to get others' attentions? If I remember correctly, the victim had made the necessary arrangements about her case and the defendant had also made his stand, so isn't that enough? So why are you opening so many thread about the case? Even if there is anything, the victim and the defendant will settle it either themselves or with the help of others (E.g. police).<br><br>If you are trying to warn others, yes we now all know about it thanks to you.<br><br>If you are trying to make a drama out of it, I say please join the kids central, you might stand a chance.<br><br>If you are trying to help the victim, I say you are only making the wound serious.<br><br>If you have personal grudges against the defendant, please refrain from opening multiples thread and stick to one. I should let you know that there are others way to do it, use PM or even better, burn his house.<br><br>I was refraining to comment about this in the past, but now, this case is hogging up the page, there are nothing much to see except case like this. You know what's I'm thinking seeing this kind of thread? I laugh at the foolishness seen in the thread, to me all this is nothing but jokes. Why? Its all talk and no actions done. If any actions were to done, it will be from the victims or the defendant and not you (You = to all). All I see is 3 factions throwing nothing but rubber bands against each other, thinking that they are helping with the case. First faction is those who stand at the victims' side, second is those who are standing at the defendant side and third is those who are seeing the saga and shooting rubber bands at anyone they feel like.<br><br>After reading all of the threads about this case, it remind me something (from Star Wars):<br><br>1) The Phantom Menace - The victims made known about the case. It all started from the defendant, isn't it?<br>2) Attack of the Clones - After that, clones start to flame each other about the case.<br>3) Revenge of the Sith - Personal grudges from VK to the defendant?<br>4) A New Hope - The case were about to settle down but because of VK opening multiple thread about this, forumers have new hope in shooting others rubber band.<br>5) The Empire Strikes Back - The defendant start striking back... I mean start posting his stand.<br>6) Return of the Jedi - After seeing the defendant's stand, the victim start posting about the case again...<br><br>So tell me what's next? Even Star Wars lasted only 6 series, how many more series you would like to start VK?<br><br>The reason I post this is to remind you (you = to all) that I can only see more foolishness if this continues.</div>
