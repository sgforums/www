But what are you doing?  you are just complaining the the alarm is noisy.  Are you checking why is the alarm?  maybe there realy is a fire?  Are you checking?  i think not.  Rather, you are just hushing the alarm and pretend nothing has happened.  I do not know the reason why you are doing this, maybe you are devil's good friend?  or maybe you are just timid.  but i am sure you do not want other gals to be taken advantage of, right?<br><br>Before you complain about the alarm, check why the alarm went off.<br>Before you shut off the alarm, check is there a fire causing the alarming the go off.<br><br>Dont blindly shut off the alarm.</div>
