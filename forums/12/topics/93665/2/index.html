I've 2 exs.  1st one I broke up with him peaceful.  We are still good frd til now and it has been 2-3yrs.  I tell him alot of my problems too including my present r/s.  2nd one I broke up with him cuz he fallen in love with my frd/ex coll.  We are no longer frds and I admit that I'm still holding grudes but who won't when you are being hurt?<br><br>But then I know I'm truthfully forgotten about him cuz I don't wanna him to be happy.  When you doesn't want your ex to be happy, you have already forgotten him.  If you find this phrase familiar you know what I mean. "If you want him to be happy, let him love who he wants."  Since I don't want him to be happy so I keep making the ger guilty by not being frd with her anymore!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My best friend's boyfriend strayed and slept with his ex-gf when she was away from Singapore for over a month.  Anyway, before that happened, she never restricted him if he wanna meet her for coffee or a chat.  She obviously did not give him any more such priviledges after the crap he did.<br><br>Even though he promised to stop all contact with the ex to keep my friend from leaving, it appears that some relationships have just too many loose strings hanging to put a complete stop to.</div>
