            <div class='col-md body'>I have just lost a great childhood playmate as he has went to lived in Australia. He has helped me alot during my days from me being as a baby. He took really good care of me from others bullying me. I can still remember him treating me to eat chocolate favoured cake when i went into his school during recess time with his mother and the most is he  using his pocket money to buy a toy car for me which i think is very good towards me. He take me for his younger brother when he was young around secondary level and he teaches me alot of things like drawing which he knew.<br><br>If were to be given a chance, i will thank him for that he have done to brighten up my childhood days. I really hope to meet him again and see him after so many years, he is an adult now 20yr +, see him.<br><br>Times really changed many things, i was transfered to another school after i was moved to other place. I have lost my best friends over there and when i was in p6 and turning to sec 1, i lost my p6 buddies. Things hasn't gone veri well, and yesterday i have heard from my relative that my childhood playmate has just moved to Australia recently and i haven meet him for almost 6 years. I have not lost contact with him and i can only have the memories of him during his younger days with me. Just hours ago, i received a call from my buddy's mother, asking for his whereabout withhis hp off also. I think i might lost another great friend which i can share my problem with. I really hope that he is fine and return home safely.<br><br>If i were to given a wish, i really hope i can meet my friends which i have lost again like a great,happy reunion. Hope that my wish will come true...<br><br>A Sad Boy</div>

He is the only child, and family is not rich like some of us wastrels. I really admire him for being very mature especially when it comes to money. He doesnt anyhow spend like the rest of us, like to buy 3 for $10 shorts, saves money on transfer rebate by waiting for 20 minutes for the SBS bus, instead of just hopping on to private buses outside camp. You can always talk cock with him.<br><br>I started worrying for him when he started reading Rober Kiyosaki books. Mind you, I do recommend that book, just that I fear his weakness is money. True enough, he started mixing with this !@#$%^&amp;*() arsehole in my camp who introduce him to a MLM business. When he introduce me to it, I was shocked to discover it looks like a very sophiscated disguised pyramid, instead of a legal one. I tried persuading him to come out of the company. Well, I literally bugged him, till under his void deck. But that arsehole has been latching on my friend most of the time, and brainwashing him.

But know what?  Tho all my autograph books were gone..and none of my frens has her contact, I tried hard..searched high and low for my old address book.  And guess what?  I found her home no.!  When I was about to call..I was really nervous..what if she changed a home no.?  What if she can't remember me?  What if....<br><br>Well, eventually I got in touch with her.  And she told me she had tried searching for me too...but she only keep in contact with her malay frens..and none of whom I am in contact with.  I cried in happiness when i finally found her!  Very very delighted, very touched that I found her and she hasn't forgotten me.<br><br>Ask around, your frens might have their contacts and you dunno.  Ya, friendster makes me get connected to my pri and sec schmates..but so what if you hav all the aid and you dun have the heart to maintain those friendships?<br><br>I wish you all the best!  Many people change over time, but there are some who won't.  And you know..most people cherish the times when they were kids..cherish their childhood frens.    Hope you will find back your frens soon.  </span></div>
