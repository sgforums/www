              <p>I realised that as we mature, things get increasingly complicated. I'm very close to this female friend of mine, so close that many of our friends often ask why aren't we dating each other, thing is all along for close to 10years, we've always seen each other as siblings.She sees me as an elder brother, while I see her as a younger sister as our birthdays are 8 days apart.</p>
              <p><br>However since the beginning of this year,after my breakup and hers...we've been hanging out rather often.Like once a week or so as compared to previously where it would probably be like once in a mth or so.She did tell me that one of our close friends frm sec.school did ask her recently, why doesn't she want to get together with me as we're already so close, her reply was that I'm not her type.Sighz...on my part I think I've dev. a liking for her tt's more den friendship and more den bro and sis..its like I've fallen for her.</p>
              <p>I'm on the verge of telling her my feeling and the words are at the tip of my tongue...but I dare not say them out as I fear that I'll lose a really good friend if things doesn't work out.But on the other hand,we really understand each other really well and is there for each other whenever there's any issues.Also I really fear that if I revealed my feelings, and she rejects me...things would never be the same again.</p>
              <p>This really sucks...if only things were simpler.</p>

              She has more or less made it clear to her friends and what not about her ..... towards you- so why be so greedy , appreciate her and be thankful.
              Of course, if u feel the need to reveal or speak up -do so, and whether accepted/rejected - bear the consequences - not blame anyone, what u feel inside u - u own it, be(ing) responsble for your feelings, its ok to state your preferences , your ... but to point the finger at someone is telling the other(s) - i cannot handle my feelings, i cannot handle my peace ......add on ....   IF it does not resonate with u , lump it.

              <p>That's the trouble with opposite sex hanging out too much. Often times, they start off as innocent "brother-sister" relationship, or buddy-buddy relationship... then as time goes by, one side think he/she likes the other party, then tell the other party, then the whole relationship crumbles and can't even be friends becuz it feels awkward. But then again, there are others which develop well.</p>
              <p>At the end of the day, if you think you really like her, not becuz of your own boredom or whatever, you take the chance. But also that the risk that you can be friends no more.</p>
              <p>Those who think that can "still be friends" are in denial, cuz its not the same anymore.</p>

              <p>IMHO i think she has always treated you as a friend.</p>
              <p>Its truly platonic to her. Some people draw lines clearly, and that is why you have always been close to her.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If she even had a slight hint of liking you, she wouldnt hang around for these 10 years waiting for you.</p>
              <p>Even if she does have a liking for you, its just second to all the others she had have a relationship with before.</p>
              <p>In other words, it can work if you both agree to be together, but what is the point playing second fiddle to each other.</p>
              <p>So think, its much better to maintain this friendship. Dont give it up.</p>

              Be friendly lar, friendSHIP - It eventually sinks, Relate lar, relationSHIP - eventually sinks also lar - that is existential nakedness.

              <p>When we both are in our respective r-ships...our partners do get jealous or feel insecure when we hang out. When we were out sometime earlier in the month when I brought her to Marina Barrage to be my model for a test shoot,after the shoot we went for dessert and she mentioned to me that as I broke up first, her ex suggested that she hook me up with one of the other single girls in our gang.Cuz he doesn't like the idea of us &lt;my best bud and I&gt; hanging out too often etc.same for his previous ex.</p>
              <p>To come down this path, I seriously thought loooong and hard.I'm not somebody that expresses this type of feeling impulsively and am dead sure before even mentioning it.</p>

              Its an exorable sink lar, however, i would add this - just a guess - its palpable that you are mired in the past - its gone, the reality is what u are facing now - not here , but when u are all alone - no one is privy to ur thoughts, feelings, being honest and and a good dose of courage to see ....  i left it blank , cos only u know what is hidden within u is being a friend to yourself. 
              Like i mentioned before, though there are no hard and fast rules when it concerns the matters of the heart - u are free to emote, and share what u feel with the other, however, she is not obligated to reciprocate; acceptance or rejection - is your predicament, not hers.
