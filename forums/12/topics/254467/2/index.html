Though, it is expected, but rejection still hurts!<br><br>Well, thx for all the thing you guys had said, but sometimes it is really hurting when she tell you, lets be friend, though out of all ways of rejection, this might be the less hurting one, but the pain of rejection nvr goes off! =)<br><br></div>
