            <div class='col-md body'>Well then , it's probably an ego thing whereby you want to own her and not entirely love her, that's why you can't bear to see her being "used" by this other guy, that's why you cut ties with her. I've been through this before, i felt really angry at the start because i felt like my effort's gone to waste but then i thought to myself, i'm not gonna torture myself by crying over her in my heart for the rest of my life, i'm gonna use my precious time to better myself, make myself a better man and definitely by becoming a better man, you'll definitely find a better gf HAHA<br><br>and somehow, breakups and rejection becomes a form of motivation for me and it should be for u too and i guess you've gotta fail alot in life to become successful. I'm not gonna tell you to give up on her, i'm not gonna tell you that there's alot of other types of fish out in the sea, but i'm just gonna ask you whether you truly wanna be happy again? and you're telling saying YES infront of your screen right now, from this day on, you'll take up japanese, read motivational books or do whatever shit that makes you happy and stop brooding over her or talking about her to your friends. that's how i got over mine.<br><br>Time does not heal, but it takes time to heal[i]</div>
