            </div>
            <div class='col-md body'>Alright this post I took alot of time to think of it and finally I posted it out.<br><br>I met this girl, lets called her Alice. I know her in Sec 1 and we were in the same CCA, the prefectorial board. During the first years of secondary school, we meet everyday when school ends in this children society setup so-called child care center named the oasis. So, theres lots of board games and lots of stuff in it. The all time favourite is of course Carom, but we love playing Chinese Chess. So apart from the guys, we were playing Chinese Chess and things were going well for us. As during that time, I aint matured enough to think about relationship problem, but I do know that he has a boyfriend and I get along well with her. Furthermore, I must include, I doesnt have the looks, nor do I have the money. Though it is very seldom both of us were toking either on phone on msn during those times, but our relationship get better then just hi-bye friend. So as we reached sec 2, I did not go to the oasis like sec 1, instead, i started my basketball life and it seems like everyday is a must to play basketball. I stayed back in school to play till 7pm then will go home. I totally lost contact with her, but because of CCA, I still do see her once in awhile during meeting. So until sec 3, the science lab assistance picked up a rabbit from outside and decided to rear it in our school backyard. Well, at that time, I am also consider as an animal lover? I went to the backyard almost everyday to feed the rabbit, play with the rabbit and she came too. Well, she plays with it too and again, we were like just friends relationship. Its always rabbit that got into our topic and at the same time, she is indulge with a 4 way relationship ties. 3 guys which shall be known as Calvin, Benjamin and Jeremy. So Calvin is my basketball training partner, he doesnt know I get along very well with Alice, but he is a well known flirt, Benjamin is my buddy in my CCA. He is a normal technical students and he has a very strange attitude. Jeremy, my president in my CCA, had crush on her. at the same time he had very good grades. So I helped her to deliever the message and found that she likes Benjamin. I pulled both of them together and I lost contact with Alice. Soon, the couples had quarrals and they started to say breakup. Well, I patch them up and cool them down. Both of them, lasted for 1year and a half. So a few months after they broke up, I came to knew about it and I seek out Benjamin, then I contacted Alice. Soon we came in close contact.<br><br>So, during november, when I was suppose to be collecting my results, Alice came and told me that she will give me support for my results, so I though,, okay. I opened up my result, a close shave and I make it to O levels, I was real happy, I hugged her and I changed to my outside clothes ane we went to celebrate in XXXXX shopping mall. Well, soon after, I went back home and talk to her on the phone till the night is over. But soon after, I did not initate the next call till december, when one of my closest teacher is celebrating her daughter first month old, we decided to have a conference on the fone. I was included and so is Alice. Everyone is talking and talking, till a point when one by one, everybody knock out except for me and her. We chatted till 4am. After the long and tiring night, I finally began to have feelings on her. So the next day, I met her at her mrt station because she has been complaining, everybody is living 3 stops away from her, she had nobody to go with. So when we reached woodlands and bought the presents. The next day, we met again, but this time, me and alice met first to get beer at cold storage. It is a fearful exprience! We were underage, yet we were getting alcoholic drinks! NVM about that, so we reached my beloved teacher house, chatted abit, took a few photos with the baby and it is time to say good bye. So everybody left together and finally when we reached the bus stop, Alice forgot her sunglasses, so I went back with her to get the sunglasses. We chatted on the way there and on the way back. Finally, I asked her a question, don't you have any guy in mind now? Her answer is yes. So she told me that, Jason (also one of my buddy), is her flings. Yet, she likes him! I was shocked and stunned and whatever that is suitable in that fit the situation means its. I told her, okay, but it seems like he knows nothing about it. So, after awhile, it is my CCA camp. She came back as one of the seniors and I wasn't around, everybody told me how drunk she was and I started to panic for her. Cause the most 'Tiko' man was there TOO! Well, at that time, that bastard was a good friend of mine, he knows that I love Alice. So, after the incident, I called Alice everyday, she will reply with a very gentle tone and sound very energytic! Soon, it is already a habit that I was chatting with her and even exchange SMS-es everyday. Both of us do initiate SMS-es. Though I do it most of the time and the SMS even include words like, I miss you. The love for you is overwhelming kinda stuff. Well, it is kinda sweet at that moment. So she suddenly ask me to go to church with her. I was like, Okay, I shall give it a try, if it was other girl, I might say no, but it is her, I agreed to her and went to church. Alright, I admitted, I goes to church is because I wanted to see her. She is the only reason why I am going to church. =) So we meet up on regularly for CellGroup and Service. I am super happy and she is happy too! So during her collection of results, she cried badly that she did not enter any of the JC, she entered MI instead. I gave her a pat on the shoulder, console her abit, but soon after she collected her result, I lost sight of her. So, we continue to go to church for a few months and due to my prelims, i had to stay away from church for a few weeks. I told myself, for her, I am going to get into whatever school she is studying in. In the end I did badly, she doesnt know a thing about it and she suddenly told me that she is moving. I went to her house, helped her move a few things over connect her PCs together. i did it for a motive though. I want her to go online at night so tat I can chat wif her on MSN. Soon, I became very ill, she keep asking me to go to a doctor, yet I told her, its okay but I cough like hell! So, finally, she took me to the doctor and during that few hours, I played with her hair, joke with her, poke her all sort of things happen. Never once in my life time, it can be so happy in a polyclinic. I told myself, after all these, she might have already fallen for me. So until July, my birthday came. I forgot everything about it, I was in school and she fulfilled her promise, she told me that she is going to make a memorable birthday for me. I said, you sure? On that day, she called me and ask me where I am, I told her I was at the basketball court, why. She said nothing and she hang up the fone. A short while later, I saw a girl with MI uniform, holding a cake with candle lited, and a present in hand walking over to me and tell me Happy Birthday. During that point of time, my mind went blank, all my training mates look at me, I was blushed. I told her thanks, but deep in my mind, I would wanna hug her, and gave her a peck on the lips and tell her, I love her. In the end, I sent her to her mum and I went back home. So we were like couples even before my birthday, I helped her with her handbag, we goes out together without any other people interferrence. A few months later, that 'Tiko' Bastard call me. At the same time, Alice was on the other line, so this freaking bastard switched over to conference mode and I kept quiet. He called my name a few times, yet I did not answer, so suddenly he asked Alice, do you know kalach likes you? she answer ya, but I treat him just like a brother. After he finish that line, I hang up the fone, and both of them knows it. I felt very disappointed, very devastated and very upset. I got rejected just like this. I haven even pick up my courage and that guy slam these rejection right into my face. Though I know, I must face the reality, but isnt it too soon, cant I even just prepare myself for that? So nvm, juz blame everything to myself, again for a few days, they were unable to find me. So at last, I go back to Alice, i believe myself again, she at least like me alittle, well those were just presumtion. A guy came into life, his name is JUDE. I hate his attitude + his ignorance makes me feel like puking. But this guy is just as close as I am with Alice in the past. So I told Alice, if ever he is with that guy in a relationship, I will break several ties with her. So, finally one day, she told me, JUDE is officially her bf, I packed everything that she gave me into a envelope, gave her back and send her a final goodbye message. Till now, 2 years has pass and I was thinking about her almost everytime I passes her house, going to place we went before, the lines that she said and the songs she told me about. I tried to get myself a few Flings to forget about her, but it doesnt work at all.<br><br>Well, if anybody had any ideas on how can I forget about her and make her fade away frm me faster? Though I really wish for her to be back and befriend me again. but it seems like its impossible.<br><br>Well the above story i typed might missed out some parts, because my hand were simply too tired typing all of the above, i tried to summarize everything already. If you still find any part strange or things like this, tell me which part it is and there might be add on. =) sorry for the inconvience. =X</div>
