            <div class='col-md body'>I totally agree with Veloren.<br><br>You are being used as an emotional tampon (i feel kinda strange using this word.). And why buy something when you can have it for free?<br><br>Her actions have indeed shown that she is attracted to the guy, more than you. Why? Because she choose to have that unofficial relationship even though she could have a normal one with you. And how long has that been?<br><br>Think about it. Is it so hard for her to tell the guy, who doesn't meet her much at all, to say "Dood, i dun like you anymore. I'm going to elope with my ex-bf, who treats me like the way i should be treated!" or something along that line.<br><br>No. Its not hard for her at All. She just doesn't want to. And why? Why would she choose someone who can't spend time with, and have a unofficial relationship with him, than to have someone who treats her nice and all.<br><br>Its all about <strong>ATTRACTION.</strong>. Attraction for other guy &gt; you.<br><br>Well, read my topic for more information.<br><br>And meanwhile, its your choice whether to stay or not. We have told you what we can.</div>

"i won't be able to know what is the right thing to do cause i am looking at it with my eyes and not my heart"<br><br>would appreciate more comments and take on this issue. never knew singaporeans out there can be that rational. lols</div></blockquote>Kinda difficult to tell now...<br><br>From 'SURFACE', I would guess there's a possibility that she's 'AFLOAT'? Meaning she can't settle her thoughts down properly...<br><br>You could be right on her 'rebound' part... There MIGHT be a CHANCE that she wants you yet is AFRAID to too close to you again... The current relationship she's in now with the other guy is probably just a 'cushion'... Unawaringly, might also acts as a way to make her feel 'safer' while being with you... It's like a sense of 'security'... As much as she might want to place you in a relationship, she would rather see that the other guy is 'real' and you're not... Love is less hurting when someone you don't really love too deeply disappoints you... And yup.. She's probably afraid of that 'hurt'...<br><br>Hmm... Age of her and the other guy... Star signs pls...?</div>

Is she mature in your thinking? I bet not? Until at least about 5 years down the line or so, would there be a chance for recovery &amp; patch back...? Anyway, don't pin too high on it to be a 'success' there after also...?<br><br>Why did you do the things you said you did to her? Hmm... For a moment you might be suffocating? Out of spite? Tolerance level for her has gone low? My GUESS? As much as you might love her truly, you might be having quite a hard time tolerating her temper and 'nonsense'...? How long have the 2 of you been together...?<br><br>18... Things are starting to change... And it would continue to change probably...? 23-26...? Hmm...<br><br>Currently she's probably having both of you just the sake of having the relationships...? Currently won't be a good sign... And like I've said, don't expect the situation to change for the better so soon..? And thereafter, more clashes to come in between the 2 of you... That is IF you managed to patch back?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cool.gif" alt="Cool" title="Cool"></div>

"if she was holding me back from anything? whether i mind this whole thing now?" i did not answer her cause i did not know what to say. as much as i want her back, i only want her to be happy. i really wonder what is on her mind now.<br><br>right now i am taking this stand. as in just standing by her side in case she needs me. many people say i am foolish but i believe those of you out there who have really love a person y'all would understand what i mean. i believe that i need to mention that i let her down greatly before and she lost alot (if not all) of trust for me. but since then i have been trying to make up to her cause i know she is the missing rib. but then this had to happen. what do you people think? kind comments appreciated.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </div></blockquote>hmmm...sounds like she doing two-timer in a very nice way... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_razz.gif" alt="Razz" title="Razz">  maybe i'm wrong too but......<br>perhap ask her and her unofficial guy out to hangout with you and u'll have a clearer picture of what going on... see if she still hold ur hand or what so ever..... or she holding the others....<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>
