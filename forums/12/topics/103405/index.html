            <div class='col-md body'>hi people, this is the first time i'm doing something like that so please put up with me. got this problem (nothing new.. lols) and it has been bugging me for the past 2 months or so.<br><br>my ex and i broke up abt 2.5 mths back after 3 years together. during the initial period i did not ask to get back with her cause i thought she wanted freedom and needed to spend time with her friends. just as i was abt to ask her if we could give it another shot, i realised that there was this other guy in her life. she told me they were in an "unofficial relationship" because he could not devote his time to her. she told me not to wait because she said it would be unfair to me but i told her that she is the one i know i love.<br><br>i emailed her telling her that maybe we should cut off all contact so that it would be easier for us to move on but she said she hope it would not be the last she would hear from me because i would always be someone she cares for. so from there we moved on, talked occasionally at night. meet up about once a week. she sms-es me or calls me when she has problems and sometimes its as though i don't exist. my friends tell me she is making use of me. when we go out, we still hold hands, hug and things like that so i am in a position now where i don't know what is actually going on in her mind. there was once when i sent her home she cried so hard cause she said she is very sorry that she can't make things right. during out last outing, she asked me a few questions. "if she was holding me back from anything? whether i mind this whole thing now?" i did not answer her cause i did not know what to say. as much as i want her back, i only want her to be happy. i really wonder what is on her mind now.<br><br>right now i am taking this stand. as in just standing by her side in case she needs me. many people say i am foolish but i believe those of you out there who have really love a person y'all would understand what i mean. i believe that i need to mention that i let her down greatly before and she lost alot (if not all) of trust for me. but since then i have been trying to make up to her cause i know she is the missing rib. but then this had to happen. what do you people think? kind comments appreciated.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"></div>

And when you told her that she's the one you want, she knows that she can look for you when she's down/need emotional support.</span><br><br><strong>so from there we moved on, talked occasionally at night. meet up about once a week. she sms-es me or calls me when she has problems and <span style="color: red;">sometimes its as though i don't exist. </span></strong><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Doesn't the sentence in red tell you that she only finds you when she needs emotional support?? </span><br><br><strong>my friends tell me she is making use of me. when we go out, we still hold hands, hug and things like that so i am in a position now where i don't know what is actually going on in her mind. </strong><br><br><span style="color: blue;">So let me ask you. Why do you think you can still hold her hand, hug her, kiss her, when both of you are NOT TOGETHER?<br><br>Simple. Because she can't do that with her boyfriend (who has no time for her). And she is sure that she can do that with you, because you have indirectly told her that you'll be there for her 24/7.<br><br>Before you argue, let me ask you a question: <strong>Why would you buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?</strong><br><br>You (the cow) give her free emotional support (milk) whenever she needs it, FREE. Since she can get whatever she wants w/o committing to a relationship (buying the cow), why would she still need to go back to you?<br><br>You are like an emotional tampon now; used when needed, discarded when not.<br></span><br><br><strong>there was once when i sent her home she cried so hard cause she said she is very sorry that she can't make things right.<span style="color: red;"> during out last outing, she asked me a few questions. "if she was holding me back from anything? whether i mind this whole thing now?"</span> i did not answer her cause i did not know what to say. as much as i want her back,i only want her to be happy. </strong><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Translation for sentence in red: "You don't mind being my emotional tampon, right? And I didn't force you into being an emotional tampon, isn't it?" </span><br><br><strong>right now i am taking this stand. as in just standing by her side in case she needs me. many people say i am foolish but i believe those of you out there who have really love a person y'all would understand what i mean. i believe that i need to mention that i let her down greatly before and she lost alot (if not all) of trust for me. but since then i have been trying to make up to her cause i know she is the missing rib. but then this had to happen. what do you people think? kind comments appreciated.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> </strong><br><br><span style="color: blue;">Your stand is not wrong. But what benefits are you gaining by doing that?<br><br>You say you are trying to make it up to her, fine. Even if she forgives you, what makes you think that she will still come back for you? Do you think she can still trust you, after what you've said and done? She probably thought that you were just fooling around with her. If not, why would you still go for another girl when you were in a relationship already?<br><br>IF you are really the only guy in her heart, she would NOT have agreed to go into a relationship with another guy in the first place.<br><br>Kind comments are for those who wish to keep deceiving themselves.<br><br>You can continue to listen to her troubles, talk and chat with her, but STOP ALL FORMS OF INTIMACY. Because both of you are JUST FRIENDS. Tell her that if she wants to be intimate, she HAS to get back into the relationship. Like I've mentioned earlier, she won't see the need to get back to you when she can get the emotional support she wants.<br><br>I can only give you so much advice, but the decision is still yours.</span><br></blockquote></div>
