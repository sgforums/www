              <p><br>Dude, I am sorry to know of your predicament.  Thanks for telling us.    Don't ever take her back, she is not worth it.    I believe it is the sex thing that made her go back to him.    I am sorry, but she seems a slut to me.    You have to deal with your emotions and move on later.     Don';t take her back even one day she comes begging on her knees.</p>
              <p>There are other better gals around, take your time.    Meanwhile, spend your time now to gradually get over it and move on. </p>
