I don't care about what people say about my height. When your personality is nice, people will come to you. This is a fact. As for your gf situation, not every lady is like this. Those are just ladies who look for outer appearance, or money. My thinking is still that so what if I'm short, I live for myself not for others. Being short doesn't mean we will cause harm to others. Unless there's a law stating that being short must die.</div>

Some are even shorter than you though they are in the prime of their lives.<br><br>But they don't <strong>look</strong> short. Why? They have extremely fit and buff bodies that more than compensate for their short frames.<br><br>I am taller than all of them save one, and I am not even 1.7m. Imagine that. Yet, some of them look taller than me though they are a good deal shorter simply because they have bigger chests and arms etc<br><br>If you can't grow taller, grow more muscles.
