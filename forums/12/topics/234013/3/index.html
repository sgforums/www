            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Elementa,<br><br>I feel for you. I know people who are about 5'3 to 5'5 and they have also had girls tell them they are too short.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I have a question for you.<br><br>How did you get a gf in the first place?</span><br><br>If things are so horrible, your situation should be- you have never had a gf. You must have some personality so that's good.<br><br>There are a few things available to you:<br><br>1. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ask your Doctor about it. </span>There is some surgical technique to lengthen your limbs. Depending on how much discomfort you can take, you can gain up to 2 or 3 inches. That's a lot.<br><br>There are also some treatments to "fix" pimples and pimple scars too.<br><br>2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Concentrate on making money.</span><br><br>Girls love guys who are successful.<br><br>3. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Develop your personality</span>.<br><br>Being short doesnt stop you from being all you can be.<br><br>4. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Even though things arent perfect for you, focus on positives.</span><br><br>Remember that Dr Tan who is a wheelchair, but has been in marathons on all 7 continents in a single year. I'm sure he'd still prefer to have real legs despite his achievements.<br><br>5. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Go to the gym or exercise</span>.<br>If you're gonna be short, be short and strong, not short and weeny looking.<br><br>6. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do other things.</span><br><br>This makes you more interesting and you can have more friends.<br><br>One thing girls judge a guy on is whether or not the guy's life will benefit her's. Is the guy popular? ie will she get any social benefit or status? She will go- wow! he can do so much. He's awesome! Wakeboarding, Archery, Tennis, Badminton, Bowling, Fluent in both English AND Chinese and knows some Japanese!<br><br>7. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dont worry about other people</span><br><br>I know this is easy to say, but there are always going to be people who are taller, stronger, smarter, better looking, richer, have better jobs, better pay, better gf's.<br><br>The only thing we can change is ourselves.<br><br>Sorry about the long message dude.<br><br>And sorry for the lecturing tone, but I just had to get it out in the open <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

Told to me by my fren whose really tall, said that have to drink milk more often, and skip ropes or play basketball around 12am-3am, as you are more likely to grow taller, and lie flat down on the ground after you are done.
