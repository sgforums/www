Other than that it is unneccessary to fret. Those comments in your head like "alien", "not good looking", "big head small body" don't help in anything but instead only add on to your misery (for unneccessary reasons, you can do without them), so remove them from your mind. Everything other than girls is irrelevant to your height.<br><br>Ok so about girls now... good if you can find a girl who doesn't mind your height, or else you can be like me and be single for life. Sex can be found with money.<br><br>Find a hobby or something and don't be obsessed about girls.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Your lack of height should make you hungrier to succeed and work harder in spite of the prejudice against you. Remember that Tom Cruise and Napoleon weren't much taller than you.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>1.58m for a guy...I really think is still okay. Instead of focusing on your height, which u cannot change, probably change other aspects of your life. You mentioned your face is full of scars, than go see skin doctor, do resurfacing or something. Or better yet just improe the way you communicate to people. Instead of physical attractiveness, build up internal attractiveness too. Or improve the body , like have a propotional / muscular and fit body instead. For gals I think height is not the most important thing lor, moreover there are short gals everywhere in singapore. Those cute petite gals.</div>
