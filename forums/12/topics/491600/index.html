              Anyone same as me ? I am married but I want to have my own friends. My hubby has a lot of friends. He just came back from a diving session with his group of friends. Don't ask me to make friends with his friends. They are all guys and often, it is awkward being all chatty with a friend's spouse. You get what I mean ? My last personal friend from secondary school last contacted me many years ago and now I have literally no friends !!!! So what if I have a facebook account ?  I can add a lot of strangers but they are not my friends ! People do not meet up no matter is get to know by Facebook, online forums. There are people who form whatsap groups but never meet up. Don't say I should reach out to people. I have tried but I am always the one pro-active ???? !!!!!!! 
              I regret never made myself a lot of friends during my schooldays and now I am GRUMBLING about no friends !

            <div class='col-md body'>Their wives/gfs are those 'follow their bf/hubby wherever they go' type. They are not keen to make friends with one another. From their facial expression can tell. No smiles, wait for you to talk only. I have tried but to them, it is just like accompanying their bf/hubby go wherever and only show up when the guys bring them along.  To summarize, they are not friendly to start with. Example : One of them even refused to share with me where their buy their cute cameras from, when I asked them in the attempt to break the ice and to be chatty, the girl's answer is : 'We cannot tell you one hor !

              I have thought about it. Most probably I am a quiet person ? But didn't I took the initiative to BREAK THE ICE ? They are JUST NOT INTERESTED. I have tried to be chatty on several occasions, it just won't work. They are only ENTERTAINING me infront of their hubby/bfs.

              <p>you have to relax. sometimes too many friends also is not good, so be careful what you wish for! </p>
              <p>facebook is a good way to find back lost connections. thats what my parents did. </p>
              <p>how about neighbours or the aunty at the market? you can try talking to people you often see around your area.</p>
              <p>friendship is companionship, someone to talk to when you have problem or share happiness and sadness. its not easy to force new friendships with strangers too. </p>
              <p>try creating facebook, find back those old school mates you remember their names. </p>
              <p>dont compare yourself with your husband lah, definitely he dont think like how a woman think or can truly understand your heart. so firstly, hopefully you can find something to talk to around your area first, then at same time do facebook, find old school mates, see how they are. </p>

              <p>Sometimes through out the years, i learn how to keep my circle small. </p>
              <p>So i decided to have very few good friends than a bunch of friends who wants me to their own convenience when in need of something. But never be too careful! </p>
              <p>I know that you would like to enjoy and have some girls-time.</p>
              <p>But i can suggest you can take up some classes like hobbies?</p>
              <p>Maybe from there you could start making friends.</p>
              <p>Go do some volunteer work or something, there's actually a lot of way to make connections with new people. Do something out of your comfort zone.</p>
              <p>Like attend some workshop or something. Do the things that you can have a social gathering with anyone new and from there, friendships can be formed!</p>
