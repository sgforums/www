              <p>Alright this is what happened to me lately ( a year 1) wont say what poly .. My CCA involves a sub com and a committe. Sub com are all year 1s. Just recently they were picked but I wasnt chosen. </p>
              <p>Now if I was some non participating guy I wouldnt be very pissed off. But the thing is I devoted alot of my time to go help at events, around 5+ events. Even events I wasnt really called for! but instead 2 girls who barely went for events were chosen! as well as a guy who only went for like 2-3 events. They only go for workshops and outings WHICH I too go for! </p>
              <p>The year2s know my contributions well cus I always see them and they thank me for it , but my chairman year 3 barely even recognises my help and I feel he sorta hates me (he is always trying to avoid talking to me) </p>
              <p>Also because there are no adults in our club AND everything simply relys on the chairman WHO barely listens to his council.. Plus is very demanding. Nothing can be done, I'll be chosen over people who barely contribute shit to this club all cus of this bias chairman.... </p>

              <p>You mean chairman plays favorite lah.</p>
              <p>Since u are not appreciated then just sit back and relax lah. </p>
              <p>CCA is just CCA wat.. As a student your priority is to excel in academics.</p>
              <p>Your stellar CCA doesn't count much in the working world lah.... It's merely a bragging rights hor... Don't have also nobody cares lah. </p>
              <p>Last time got one CCA top top , but now work as admin assistant every month take home pay $2500. Wheres the glory now?</p>
              <p>Next time u become chairman of big corporation, don't do the same to others under your level lah.</p>

              <p>What makes you think he doesnt appreciate you for your hard work? Maybe hes trying to make those slack bastards contribute and giving you a rest???</p>
              <p>This type of chairman then good. It shows he has a mind of his own.This is why he is chairman ok? If he think how everyone else is thinking then anyone also can be chairman liao</p>
              <p>You should slap the year 2 ppl instead. They say "thank you" to your face but behind call you goondu for being too garang.</p>
              <p>Plus have you spoken to him or not? You sound like you have a valid reason for going? If No then don't any how spread gossip ok? Got politics liao but worst are those gossip mongers who put others on the crucifix without finding the truth.</p>

              <p>Ah you're right. I realise did sorta over react and didnt think much more openly but now I've come to the conclusion that well this is how things work in real life and that my chairman most probably had a good reason for not chosing me (I hope). Ah he may or may not have been bias I thought he was cus I felt he was like super nice to everyone besides me. And yeah thats true.. No one takes CCA seriously (well my chairman does but no one else in my club or sch does) and I shouldnt too cus its just like a side thing eventually year 3 its useless alr. So now I sorta dun care alr, sub-com no sub-com doesnt matter as long as I get to have some CCA points can alr. Plus I'm doing pretty well in academics alr but should maintain that and not get involved in CCA too much.  Eitherway I realised that if I went to subcom I would have less time for my other CCA. </p>
              <p>Ah yeah I havent spoken to him on the matter cus I dun feel like its really appriotate to ask him. I asked one of my seniors (while pissed off not thinking straight) and he said he didnt know why either. yeah I wont spread gossip. well he's not a bad chairman but he's very demanding.</p>

              <p>Hey!!! I was just kidding about no one taking the CCA seriously. (There are people who take them seriously..Your chairman is one of them...and then theres you... :) Every chairman need a good supporting crew..you can be one of the shining diamonds amongst the pile of shit..</p>
              <p>Our opinions were to help open your mind, not an ultimatum. There is truly no right answer, just possibilities.</p>
              <p>YOU decide what or where you want to go. Don't let people/or experience define who you are..but instead YOU decide what you want to learn from them.</p>
              <p>Academic skills isnt everything. CCA can help develop character too.</p>
              <p>Sorry but it seems to me your still a little pissed so pissed until you want to bo chup your cca liao.....just ask him politely why la -__- at the same time let him know how you feel too....he is a chairman, not a mind reader..neither are you...how he know what you want...and also how you know what he thinking....-__- ask la..</p>
