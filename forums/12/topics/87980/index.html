At least tell her what you had for your meals and ask her about her meals. Old folks don't need attention, they prefers company. Accompany her to watch TV or have meals with her.<br><br>It is better for you to show your appreciation for her this way while she is still alive rather than to lament and regret over it when she is not around.<br><br>Anyway, I hate people who tells me about how sad or regretful they felt for not spending enough time with this and that before he/she die. I prefer to appreciate the people around me and those that I love while they are still alive and even if they do die tomorrow, I will not miss them so much because we had many wonderful memories together...that is for as long as my memories allows me to hold on to them.<br><br>Do something about it and show your appreciation for your grandma while she is still around, don't wait.<br></div>

Just make her happy as much as possible.<br><br>Old ppl tend to tell us that what they wish for before they leave this world. Just listen to what he or she has to say.
