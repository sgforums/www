Do not let this falter you - instead, it must built you up and you ought to learn and grow from this LDR. LDR is difficult to maintain because it requires EXTRA effort, and not just your normal way of leading a relation and it has to comes from both ways.<br><br>Cheers</div>

I am not saying you will defintely win her back - but a plan moved can greatly increase your chance of winning. Especially if she has her Moon sign in Aries (touched her enough and she is yours).  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"><br><br>Good luck alright?
