            <div class='col-md body'>hmm.. the problem is not just abt acceptance. i just wish ppl would value their purity more.<br><br>its true love covers all faults. but its also true we all want the best of our future partners. i think the idea of saving ourselves for the one we marry in the end. its really something special i guess. and i really admire those who are able to do that.<br><br>but i still feel that the value of virginity is really really low... isn't that something worth keeping like a precious jewel until the right person who will love you and commit himself/herself to you, then give that person the jewel of yr purity as a gift.<br><br>a groom was at his wedding, his lover looks at him and asks, "do you love me with all your heart?"<br><br>the groom replies "yes i love you with all my heart"<br><br>but next to the groom stood over 10 other women who each held a piece of his heart.<br><br>the bride cries out asking who are the other women, the groom sadly replies that the other women are from his previous relationships b4 he met her, and he did love them too. "but what is left of my heart, i give to you"<br><br>to me, just sleeping around with every person that you love, or you think you love, is like giving a part of yourself to that person, bound together as one. so how much of yourself is left for the true person who would be with you for the rest of your life, who will always be the person who will be truthful to you, to be there when u need tt person, who will be the one who will accept your flaws in characters which the previous ppl of previous relationships could never fulfil?(thus leading to a breakup)</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hmm one thing i see is kinda a misunderstanding of love.. i tink its true in a sense that to reserve yrself for the person you love.. but is love merely a feeling? or is it more.<br><br>love to me is not just feeling, but a commitment oso. feelings come and go, sometimes quarrels will make both parties feel rotten. and sometimes u will hv feeling for many people<br><br>so in a sense, u love many ppl, so does tt mean u give yrself to everyone u have feelings for? afterall u really do love that person.<br><br>thats why its better to wait till marraige, cuz in marraige, there is commitment. love involves commitment, for example, christians keep saying "God is love, God is love... blah blah..." but love is not without action, Jesus loves, and He took the death penalty for us.<br><br>a mother loves their children, she will sacrifice herself for the child. thats is a commitment, she is commited to love and provide for the child.<br><br>its not just merely feelings. thats why its better to wait, till someone is willing to be committed to you, thats real love.</div>
