            <div class='col-md body'>I used to hide my feelings. But recent events have made me realize that the more you tried to hide, the more you will end up deluding yourself. What do you expect to achieve when you hide your feelings? Do you seek to be with the person you have the feelings for or do you just want to continue loving him even though there will be no outcome in the end? If it is the latter, mebbe it is better if you can channel your energy into forgetting...<br><br>If not, gather your courage and ask. The longer you take, the more miserable you will be once the truth is out. If he says yes, you have nothing to lose and if he says no, at least you can concentrate on moving on.<br><br>i.c.y</div>
