But you must first understand where this defect lies and if you are equipped with the strength and wisdom to strike out and start a human revolution.<br><br>A dull person is languid because the way they lead their life probably doesn't give them the opportunity to expand on human interaction. These people are likely to invest their time in solitary activities that usually doesn't require much personal interaction between people.<br><br>And the flourish of internet probably worsens this issue, if people start reckoning that it's a good substitute for reality.<br><br>Love is not a miracle that dissolves all problems into nothingness; ironically, being in Love is like looking into a magical mirror of truth: it expose all our inner negativity and coerced us to face directly with our weakness, especially our personality.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Only through the eyes of Love, would we understand how much 'defects' we have developed unconsciously over the years. </strong></span><br><br>A person who doesn't know how to speak must learn to challenge himself to talk. Albeit he might not be the best speaker, but at the very least, he learns to speak, which is paramount to one's spiritual growth. The growth doesn't lies with the ability to speak, but rather, the notion of having to surmount his weakness.<br><br>A dull life is but a transitory condition that can be shattered by having to invest your life, effort and time into something more worthwhile that could enhance your personality and life, especially if it involves an assembly of people, in which one must interact in such social setting.<br><br>One can be insipid, but one doesn't have to accept the fate of a dull life. For everyday, there's always 24 hours for all. The difference between one from another is the time used by them individually.<br><br>In summary: one cannot be a dull person that is interesting or an interesting person that is dull. Being in love doesn't make you an interesting person automatically - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>if your current life doesn't allow you the condition to be interesting, you will always feel inadequate in conversation because your vocabulary is limited.</strong></span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

But you must first understand where this defect lies and if you are equipped with the strength and wisdom to strike out and start a human revolution.<br><br>A dull person is languid because the way they lead their life probably doesn't give them the opportunity to expand on human interaction. These people are likely to invest their time in solitary activities that usually doesn't require much personal interaction between people.<br><br>And the flourish of internet probably worsens this issue, if people start reckoning that it's a good substitute for reality.<br><br>Love is not a miracle that dissolves all problems into nothingness; ironically, being in Love is like looking into a magical mirror of truth: it expose all our inner negativity and coerced us to face directly with our weakness, especially our personality.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">[b]Only through the eyes of Love, would we understand how much 'defects' we have developed unconsciously over the years. </span></strong><br><br>A person who doesn't know how to speak must learn to challenge himself to talk. Albeit he might not be the best speaker, but at the very least, he learns to speak, which is paramount to one's spiritual growth. The growth doesn't lies with the ability to speak, but rather, the notion of having to surmount his weakness.<br><br>A dull life is but a transitory condition that can be shattered by having to invest your life, effort and time into something more worthwhile that could enhance your personality and life, especially if it involves an assembly of people, in which one must interact in such social setting.<br><br>One can be insipid, but one doesn't have to accept the fate of a dull life. For everyday, there's always 24 hours for all. The difference between one from another is the time used by them individually.<br><br>In summary: one cannot be a dull person that is interesting or an interesting person that is dull. Being in love doesn't make you an interesting person automatically - <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>if your current life doesn't allow you the condition to be interesting, you will always feel inadequate in conversation because your vocabulary is limited.</strong></span>  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers[/b]</blockquote>thanks alot for ur help! ok i shall state here how i usually spend my time.<br><br>i read widely<br>i play the guitar<br>i hang out with different groups of friends alot. however im somehow still not a very good conversationist. but is it because we all hardly share common interests?<br>i use the internet<br>i visit the gym regularly<br>i practice karate and play basketball<br><br>but i hardly watch tv though..<br><br>so basically i do quite alot of stuff on my own. but i go out with friends alot. are there any recommendations on other activities i can do that would help??<br><br>It definitely has something to do with my confidence level and the fact that she is my first. i havent been close to girls before so i dont know what to do! it seems very natural for my other friends to talk to so many girls easily. girls try to know me but sometimes it appears that after awhile they kinda get bored?<br><br>=(</div>
