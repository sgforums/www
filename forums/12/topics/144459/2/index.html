I guess in a semi bochup plus frustrated manner.<br>How old are we? Both are in our late 20s.<br><br>Actually, when I confessed to her I liked her, she treated me better during the week, just that she seems to be always busy. I also overheard her telling her friends that she is really busy for the week and couldn't find time for "some guy." She even told a friend she couldn't join her for certain activities and the reason was that would her friend be "responsible for finding her a boyfriend" if she were to join for her activities. Of course, I don't really know who she's referring to.<br><br>But this week, I heard her friend teasing her about her boyfriend, which she didn't deny. She was also busy planning yet another gathering with her friends and seems to have forgotten about me asking her out. That's why I asked her if she has a boyfriend or she was joking with her friend.<br></div></blockquote>LOW CHANCE.<br><br>Btw, you could be getting too nosy and irritating in her eyes for your own good...<br><br>If you still bother with the friendship even without attempt for the BGR, you should start toning down a little...?</div>

I learnt it the hard way and was totaly embrassed when was told by her straight in the face that she is not talking about me.<br><br>If you want to countinue in your dream state, no one can pull you out but yourself . Sometimes in life you got to learn it the hard way to remember the lesson taught to you.</div>
