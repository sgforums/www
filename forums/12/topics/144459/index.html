            <div class='col-md body'>Need some advices from the experts...<br><br>OK, there's this girl whom I confessed to that I've a liking for and asked her out for a date. Her reply then was that she's busy. I asked if she's really busy or if it's due to some other reasons and she said that its really because she's busy for the whole week. Other than that, she showed no sign of rejecting or avoiding me. That was roughly a week ago.<br><br>I was thinking of asking her out again, but to my surprise, I heard her mention to people about her boyfriend. As far as I know, she is still single. So I asked her about it if she had a boyfriend. She told me that she wouldn't answer the question because it's her private business.<br><br>I told her that if she really had a boyfriend, she could at least let me know since I did tell her I liked her. She just say that she didn't wish to answer that.<br><br>So how should I interpret her response?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by tnt4ever:</div><div class="quote_body">Need some advices from the experts...<br><br>OK, there's this girl whom I confessed to that I've a liking for and asked her out for a date. Her reply then was that she's busy. I asked if she's really busy or if it's due to some other reasons and she said that its really because she's busy for the whole week. Other than that, she showed no sign of rejecting or avoiding me. That was roughly a week ago.<br><br>I was thinking of asking her out again, but to my surprise, I heard her mention to people about her boyfriend. As far as I know, she is still single. So I asked her about it if she had a boyfriend. She told me that she wouldn't answer the question because it's her private business.<br><br>I told her that if she really had a boyfriend, she could at least let me know since I did tell her I liked her. She just say that she didn't wish to answer that.<br><br>So how should I interpret her response?</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Its a subtle rejection.<br><br>There are a couple of possibilities with:<br><br>I) She probably doesn't want to eliminate you totally because you could serve as a backup just in case where her relationship fails.<br><br>II) She doesn't like you and doesn't have a boyfriend. She refuse to admit whether she is attached because she wants to reject you, doesn't know how to and doesn't want to lie. This is probably the 'best' solution to her.<br><br>Regardless of whether is it I or II, it's still upfront rejection first. IMHO, avoid girls playing mind games, unless you desire the challenge.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>How she answer? I guess in a semi bochup plus frustrated manner.<br>How old are we? Both are in our late 20s.<br><br>Actually, when I confessed to her I liked her, she treated me better during the week, just that she seems to be always busy. I also overheard her telling her friends that she is really busy for the week and couldn't find time for "some guy." She even told a friend she couldn't join her for certain activities and the reason was that would her friend be "responsible for finding her a boyfriend" if she were to join for her activities. Of course, I don't really know who she's referring to.<br><br>But this week, I heard her friend teasing her about her boyfriend, which she didn't deny. She was also busy planning yet another gathering with her friends and seems to have forgotten about me asking her out. That's why I asked her if she has a boyfriend or she was joking with her friend.<br></div>

From your update, she may not be content with her current boyfriend, but it doesn't seem like you'd fit the bill of her "Mr. Right" either.<br><br>The girl may not have given you any negative answer, but she doesn't seem to be sending you any encouraging positive signals as well. With each update, it certainly looks like you may be on your way to finding the answer to your own troubles.</div>
