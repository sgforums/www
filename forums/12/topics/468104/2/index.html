Shes only 4 yrs old. But how can I survive here without any means of living? no work? Companies dont want to get us they all want DP's and LTVP's to avoid paying levies. Im too stressed and hopeless :'( "
                                          
                              
              Hi Myra. I read your post. I had advised many female foreigners that were married to Singaporeans in the past that they should not depend on their husband for income and they should work too in Singapore just in case this kind of thing happens to them. I read your post over and over again to get a better picture of your situation. Just to get more information from you. Hope you don't mind me asking you. 
                      
              Were you and your ex-husband married in Singapore or overseas? 
                      
              Have you ever worked in Singapore and holding any kind of work permit before your marriage with your ex-husband? 
                      
              Now you and your ex-husband are already divorced, hope you don't mind me asking you this question, who got the custody of your child. You or your ex-husband? If you want to bring back your 4 year old daughter with you to your own country, Singapore authority have no right to stop you from doing that as long your 4 year old daughter has a Singapore passport. So does she has a Singapore passport? But again here the question is, who got the custody of the child, you or your ex-husband? Because if your ex-husband got that custody of your daughter, by taking daughter back to your own country, that is kidnapping and it is a crime here in Singapore. 
                      
              To my knowledge, if your daughter is studying in Singapore, you are what we call 'sugar mommy' in other words since she is still young and studying, she needs someone to take care of her welfare. Therefore you need to work to support her and you are eligible for a dependant pass just like most PRC mothers with kids studying in Singapore school. 
                      
              How long have you been living in Singapore and did you have Long Term Visit Pass? Or did you stay in your own country and visited Singapore often to be with your former husband and daughter? 
                      
              Was your daughter born here in Singapore or in your country? If she was born in your own country, the Singaporean father can still registered her as a Singaporean. 
                      
              What nationality are you? If you are a Malaysian, there shouldn't be any problem for you to find work here in Singapore, because no need Security Bond, only monthly levy. Other nationalities, can still find work here in Singapore but will take sometime and $5000 Security Bond is compulsory for employer to secure to hire non-Malaysian foreign workers besides a monthly levy. 
                  
              Long Term Visit Pass holder with a Singaporean spouse and Dependant Pass holder are exempted from the $5000 Security Bond and monthly levy.

              <p>Yo boys n girls.  I am also caught in the same situation now... anyone found out if ICA has LTVP or other visas for divorced parent (foreigner) of a Singapore citizen?... mine is 7yo ... will prob just call ICA to-morrow and find out...</p>
              <p>Been 20 years+ working in SG and can confidently say I am more Singaporean than most 18-20yo by now, singlish/hokkien and all... married and divorced an SG girl too n have many many brothers in Singaland ... :-)</p>
              <p>BTW Myra, hope u sorted out a visa to stay with your daugther! ... it's heartwrenching when u cannot see your child due to admin issues ... and everyone makes mistakes, yes (divorces do happen!)... we must strive to remain part of our children's lives no matter how hard it is... </p>
              <p>Thanks!</p>
