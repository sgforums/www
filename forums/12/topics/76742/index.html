In return, he did. Did he like you? My answer is HOW to? Below is an example of what he would say if he posted his stuff here.<br><br><strong>'It was a clubbing day where me and my friends agreed to to chill out at Devils. I was dancing/drinking, enjoying the ambience and music - suddenly this girl came up to me and ask for my number. Well, she looked decent and I gave it to her in the end. The best part is that she stayed a block away from me....' </strong><br><br>This was probably was took place - no emotions, no love at first sight, no nothing - how can he fall for you because nothing was made to further this friendship and it all happened within a short span of time? He is standing at an advantage - knowing that you are interested and he could remain where he was and still enjoy whatever is there to gain. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You have two options:<br><br>I) Take time to know him as a friend. Doesn't mean that you have to jump into a relationship or anything - with the assistance of time, the godly image you have in him may be ruin when you discovered his human side.<br><br>II) Forget about this whole thing - he resembled your ex-bf, which contributes to a whole chunk of reasons why you had the courage and foolishness to do something like that. You may be sourcing qualities of your ex in him - you could be moving on the wrong track if you are blinded and confused by emotions. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Try to avoid him for 1-2 weeks and see if he looks for you. If he does, it'll probably mean that he really loves you. When you find the right opportunity, ask him if he is really interested in you and wants to start a serious relationship. Oh and try not to use the word "serious relationship" as guys are quite afraid to commit themselves to this kind of things.</div>
