              <p>there's this guy he's really sweet and nice to me. went over to his placeand we made out. nothing much just kissing and cuddling. and i thought he really likes me but a month later, we drifted but i saw this coming. even so, we made out a couple of times too and then things escalated after some time even though we drifted bc we started talking again. he fingered me before but no we didn't fuck.</p>
              <p>a few days back he started to talk to me again and i was kinda annoyed w him bc he'll come to me when he needs something from me. and then he wanted to sext and send him a video of me fingering myself which i obv didn't. i never say much bc he's the horny one lol. he asked me to go over to his place but i managed to come out w excuses for the past few days. then yesterday he asked me to go over in the afternoon but i said no bc i had something on. he got kinda pissed bc i kept rejecting him and he said "do you want people to know i fingered you?" and "so you want people to know?" stuff like that. i had no choice so i went over. we didn't fuck or what but things is kinda bad and i want it to stop. i know he'll come back again but i don't know what to say to him. i went over ytd bc i had no choice he's somewhat threatening me by saying those kind of stuff (eg exposing me to others) what do i do?</p>

              <p>be firm and dont give in to him. otherwise it will give him the
              impression that he has succeeded and will continue to pester u. in
              the worst case, he will spread about fingering u but if u look at
              the bigger picture, this kind of thing typically happens during
              courtship and dates so it is really nothing to be shameful
              about as many girls would have gone thru it too. once he is tired
              of chasing, he will give up and move to next target. </p>
