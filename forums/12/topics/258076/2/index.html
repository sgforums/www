            <div class='col-md body'>scold her back, she has her faults and she has to admit it. knowing herself would be late doesn't mean she can hush hush it up till the last moment after u left her workplace. i HATE people like that.<br><br>next time, if something like this happens again, go ahead with the dinner without her at the designated time. when she arrives, you can either continue the dinner or eat elsewhere and u all can keep her accompany.<br><br>time waits for no one. that is a fact.<br><br>but the same could be said for you in time.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by mikki:</div><div class="quote_body">The dinner gathering was for 4 people. 2 of us(A and B)had to work that day while another friend and i were free. I made reservations for 6pm as i thought even if A and B could not make it at that time,at least there were still 2 of us. Initially after i booked the table for 6pm,the rest commented that it's a bit early,so i decided to turn up at the restaurant at 6 to ask if i could change to 7pm. However,after shopping,my friend and i were hungry so we decided to have some appetizers and not postpone the timing after all. In the first place,A has already said that no matter what time we arranged to meet(6 or 7pm),she would be the last one to reach since her knockoff time is 7pm. She had said she would reach latest by 8pm. And when i called her at ard 6.30,she did not know she would have extra work to do. (i guess her OT is really last minute notice) So she only told us to "eat slowly".(for the 2 of us who were having appetizers) Yup,so our meeting time was 6pm but since it was a buffet dinner,anyone of us who couldn't meet at that time,could arrive late. It was ok for the 2 of us who were early.<br><br>Anyway,really thank everyone here for your quick responses. A just smsed me in the morning to enquire abt the tour thingy. Haha. I asked her(in a sarcastic tone,i must admit)was she angry. She replied that she was just disappointed that she rushed her work that evening and yet could not make it for the dinner. Ok,i can understand that. I can also understand that it might be due to her disappointment that she "scolded" me. Sometimes,i get angry with people when i'm disappointed with them too. So,yeah~<br><br>Btw,again she mentioned just now that she was "angry" that day cause we knew the closing time but did not inform her. And i replied that did she ask us abt it when we called her at 6.30 and how were we supposed to know that we must tell her that??? She did not rebutt after that.<br><br>Well,we are alright now. LOL. </div></blockquote>OK. I'm glad both of you are on good terms again.<br><br>Sometimes, it is not easy to be a gracious host.<br>Most important is to try to be understanding to other's predicament.<br><br>Try to anticipate possible problems, and be more pro-active in solving them.<br><br>Good luck to your trip.<br><br>Please get together and talk it out.<br>Set out the plans clearly so there is no misunderstanding.<br>Make sure all of you are on the same level in terms of where and what you want to do during this trip. Expenses and comfort level. Very Important.<br><br>The last thing you want to do is ruin the trip with any arguments.<br></div>
