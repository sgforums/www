            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by stephano:</div><div class="quote_body">I guess it was normal that people keep telling you to break up with your gf, and I understand why, but I guess I feel that Lovelorn?, you shouldn't give up, and that you should give your relationship another shot.<br>It seems to me like she has been affected by you, and I believe that she does have feelings for you.<br>She may want you to improve your dress sense because she thinks it will benefit you better in the long run, and she might have your interests at heart.<br>Being 17, you are young, but many relationships start from a young age, my parents have been dating since they were teenagers, and they are still together and happily married.<br>Being on the rebound doesnÂ’t guarantee that she doesn't have feelings for you. Plus 17 year olds aren't as prone to having heavy excess baggage.<br>After all, you are still young, if this relationship does not work, it will not be the end of the world, and you'll still be able to move on, but if you give up and regret it later on in life, there will be nothing you can do.<br>Love is blind, and if you love her, you should try your very best to accept all her quirks and demands. If you think she's unreasonable, but you still love her, you should accept her and weak points. ThatÂ’s what love makes people do.<br></div></blockquote>I don't agree with you but I do agree with you on certain things.<br><br>First of all, your parents era and this era is different. I'm not saying love then and now is different but as the society grows, human's requirement in life change.<br><br>Secondly, he's only 17 and I'm not sure about her gf's age. But at this age, what are their needs in life? When I'm 17, I live a fu*k up life and other than studies and exams and spending money, what do I know? I don't have family commitment. I don't have to pay bills. I don't have to worry if I've got money for my next bill. Everything seemed so easy and the only difficult part is facing the people around me and exams.<br><br>Im 28 now. Inbetween those 10yrs, my needs in life change and my perception of life change. I have to worry about bills now and I have to worry about my own lifehood and I have to worry about my future with my gf who might be my wife in near future (I certainly hope she'll become my wife).<br><br>Not to mention the other stuffs, just take a look back at my own love stories. At 18, I get to know my first gf and I really love her alot. I started working right after my O Levels and she proceed to Poly. Things were beautiful initially but a year later, things turn sour. What we could see eye to eye in the past, we argued over it. Then I did something wrong which triggers the breakup. I felt guilty over the things I've done to hurt her but it was too late and for 9yrs I buried myself in that guilt and it's only recently that I finally let go and release myself. And since then, I laugh at my own stupidity for torturing myself for so long and I realised that in actual fact I wasn't really the only one at fault.<br><br>Looking back, if I have the ability to turn back the clock to then, I probably would have handle the situation differently. In that relationship, I'm always the one giving in and taking all the craps. It wasn't really that we see things eye to eye initially but just because I love her I look at things from her view. Im totally lost in her world. And when things start to turn sour, my old self is back and I start seeing things in my own view.<br><br>If Lovelorn can see the future, I'm sure he'll know what he should do right now. If it's just purely teenage love, then fine. But then it's starting to affect his studies over this relationship and it's rather obvious that his gf is determine in her decision, then why bother to make himself more miserable and continue to let his studies be affected?<br><br>No gf, find another. He's still so young. With good qualifications and good jobs next time, with a stable life, he scared he can't find a gf who will appreciate and love him as an adult?</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by Lovelorn?:</div><div class="quote_body">Hi. I am having this problem wif my gf and all help is greatly appreciated and welcomed. Now to begin...<br><br>A few mths back, I started liking this girl in my class and I wanted to pursue her but didn't haf the courage to at first. But after much persuasion and encouragement from my other friends, I told her I liked her after our major exams and all in November. She accepted me after 1 week of me confessing my love to her. But thinking back, I think dat she accepted me too early and too fast. She once told me dat she wld normally let her all ex-bfs court her for around 6 mths b4 accepting them. I feel dat the reason y she accepted me so fast was becoz she was she needed someone for support and a shoulder to lean on as she recently broke up wif her ex at dat time. She told me herself dat she was emotionally unstable when accepted me at dat time and it was the " most appropriate time" for me to enter the scene.<br><br>The past 1 mth wif her was magical and almost ethereal. It was sth I've never experienced b4 in my entire life and I enjoyed myself a lot (this is my 1st r/s). But there were times when we wld argue and it wld mostly be my fault.<br><br>In 1 incident, I asked her too many qns like "wat was she doing?", "where was she at the moment?" and she got mad at me. The reason? Becoz her ex used to interrogate her all the time. he didn't really trust her and I reminded her of her ex and she hated him most for asking too many qns. I was in a camp at dat time and I was very concerned for her well-being dat's y I had to ask her how's she doing. But it was kinda my fault for not understanding her situation but then again, she never tells me anything at all.<br><br>Let me point out to u now dat she bottles up most of her feelings and is unwilling to tell anyone abt how she really feels. I feel dat this is the bane of our r/s and I'll elaborate on it further later.<br><br>The next incident was entirely my fault and I admitted it to her. I took our 1 mth anniversary as 28 days instead of the full 30 days and she was really mad at me. But wat saddens me the most was at dat time, she pointed out to me dat maybe she was not the right one for me. I totally disagreed wif her at dat time and insisted on a "No!" all the time. She msged me and told me dat she was not angry but disappointed this time. She told me dat she had never been angry or yelled at me b4 but she was juz disappointed at dat time. When we went out the next day, she did not speak to me at all and was cold to me at times. I didn't dare to strike up a conversation for fear of incurring her wrath and she took dat to say "I pity your future gfs coz whenever u make them angry, all u can do is keep quiet". But she wld always forgive me at the end.<br><br>Recently, she had upped her tendency to criticising everything abt me. She only used to call me stupid and blur and I admit dat it is partly true. But it is getting worse now in a way. She wld criticise me abt not being up to her expectations, my dress sense, how physically weak I am (I was down wif a bad fever last wk), etc... And there was one time when we were out eating wif frens, she told my frens dat she went to a fren's youth gathering the other day and the 1st thing she said abt it was dat "there were no cute guys there at all, except for maybe one but he was attached already". I was thinking to myself, "Was she there to accompany her frens or was she there to look out 4 cute guys?". In a way, I felt that she was not showing me any respect at all. She oso gave me the irritated look once and turned away at one time dat day.<br><br>For the past few days, I felt dat the strong love dat I had for her when I first entered this r/s was wavering. Last nite, she told me over the phone dat she kinda missed singlehood and suddenly, I found myself blurting out my pent-up feelings abt this whole case. I told her dat we needed time off and dat we ought to take a break. I wanted to suggest to her this 2 wks later so dat she could enjoy her Christmas and New Year's festivities but I guess it was too late after I told her most of my feelings. Again over the phone, she remained indifferent as though this didn't affect her and when I asked her abt it, she told me dat she was okay. But after we put down and I msged her good nite and hope dat this didn't affect her, she told me dat of course she was affected by this and dat she was disappointed, pissed and upset. I msged her, telling her dat I wanted to meet up wif her and talk abt this today but she told me she is not free today.<br><br>I have a lot of activities going on right now and in a way, they are clouding my mind and adding on the stress that I already have. I was madly in love with her when we started but now, I feel as though my feelings for her are just a faint glint of light. She is the kind who doesn't show her feelings dat openly and I am the kind who expresses my feelings very openly. She shows her love for me only now and then while I do dat all the time. So I guess it is my fault in a way coz I felt as though I am not being loved and up till now, I can't really tell if she loves me or not. Even when I used to ask her to share her problems wif me, she refuses to tell me while I openly tell her wat I am facing. So I dun really know wat is going on in her life and how I can help her.<br><br>I haf my A lvls to worry abt next yr and I know dat this problem will most probably resurface if we are to carry on coz it juz seems very hard to resolve it wif her as she is not willing to voice out her thoughts abt us. I admit dat it is my fault for my inexperience in relationships as this is my first. I am very useless and I dun think I am mature enuf to care for her at this point of time. She is a very nice girl and I dun want to see her hurt becoz of me. She definitely deserves someone better than me, someone hu is up to her expectations.<br><br>Now, all I need is some advice from u guys out there. Do u think I shld carry on wif this r/s? Shld we juz take a break frm each other and get some time off? Or shld we juz break up completely? I m really lost abt this... All comments are welcomed... Thanks...</div></blockquote>just 1 question, wad is the first letter of yr gf's name? she sound so fucking familiar.</div>
