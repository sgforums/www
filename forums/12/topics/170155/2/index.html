            <div class='col-md body'>Pls stop thinking that she is the good one, everything that has happened is your fault and that she deserves a better person. In fact, I think she is the one who doesn't deserve you. Why? because first, she entered this r/s with you, giving you the reason that it is the most appropriate time for you to enter her life just because she recently broke up with her ex. What kinda reason is that? It is definitely not the reason to go into a r/s with someone.<br><br>i think she is just taking you as a rebound guy, and now that she is finally able to forget about her ex, she wants to discard you. From the way things go, I think she is trying to make you break up with her, by criticizing you and complaining about small and petty things.<br><br>And you said she is much more mature than you? She doesn't sound like a very mature person to me.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hey guys, thanks for all your comments. Really appreciate it...<br><br>To tell u the truth, I agree wif wat most of u guys say. Dat maybe we r juz not compatible wif each other. But somehow try as I may, I can't seem to forget her at all... I tried to patch things up with her yesterday. I poured my heartfelt feelings out to her over the phone. But even after dat, when I asked her if she had anything to say, she juz said dat she was too lazy to say anything at this moment. But somehow, I could sense dat she was crying and I wld really hate myself if I made her cry over me... But before I called her, she sounded normal in her SMSes, asking me if I am alright or not and dat she agreed dat it was partly her fault for making me so insecure. Dat's y I took dat quite positively and when I talked to her over the phone, I asked her if she was willing to give me another chance and she said yes. I thought dat wld mean dat this 'episode' wld draw to a close very soon but I thought wrongly. She didn't reply at all to any of my SMSes last nite. I dunno if she was busy or she was juz thinking thru abt this whole thing. Even until this afternoon, she still hasn't replied!<br><br>By the way juz to let u guys know, after I told her dat I liked her and before she agreed to be my gf, I asked her if she needed time off to forget her ex and she said no. I thought dat there was really sth wrong even though she said no and dat was when I told her in an SMS dat I think I ought to step back for the time being and let her sort out her own feelings before we start our own r/s. But becoz of dat msg, she avoided me the whole day! By then I thought dat I made a huge mistake by telling her to take some time off and dat's y I immediately flocked to her so dat she had someone to seek comfort from. I hope dat answers curiousOrange's qn on y I did not run when she was emotionally unstable. She juz needed someone at dat time and I thought dat I could be dat someone.<br><br>And I totally agree wif Yunhaier. It is a COMPLETE MYSTERY as to whether she loves me or not. She told me yesterday dat she is the kind hu is not willing to divulge any of her problems to anyone. Not to her best of frens and even not to her own family. So I was thinking thru last nite, dat even if we got back together this time, I haf a very strong feeling dat the same problem will resurface the next time and wif a larger magnitude and at the most worst time of all(e.g. during my A lvls).<br><br>But I can't seem to forget her and deep down inside her, I believe dat she can't seem to forget me either... She told me once dat she was beginning to like me during dat course of our 1 mth together and I believe her for dat. So I am really at a loss here...</div>

It is messing you up.<br>Trying to be rational and being practical is the department you seemed to fail.<br>You are being rational, but yet allowing your emotions to rule.<br><br>Indeed her attraction towards you is Love or not, is a mystery.<br>But we are sure you're a subsitute.<br>Can this subsitute figure nurture into a main role in her life? Can it nurture to Love? We won't know.<br><br>She obviously have excess bagguage and she needs someone to fill that role.<br>Her replies to tell you what kind of person she is like reveals her unwillingness to change, for you. Her emotions being unstable is natural and you might thought you are the someone for her to lean on.<br>Ever wondered that any other guys would have done the same and she'll accept them too?

Probably the 'attraction thing' about you to her... Afterall, which woman won't enjoy someone who can be especially caring and concerned over her..?<br><br>I'm not sure if I should agree with the others on perhaps she already have the thought of leaving you but waiting for the right time... But somehow I just (personally) thinks that you're like a good piece of meat fed up to her mouth... Not exactly of her taste but nonetheless delicious enough to feed her...<br><br>Her problems... Sharing them with you? Like you've mentioned, she hardly share such with others... She would have naturally share them with you if you're of that 'calibre' but quite obviously (or at least in her eyes), you're not... Another way for her to share them with you is through the communications and trust developed within the relationship... Which is something seriously lacking here.. You're often busy with interpretations and 'maths', which makes you hardly in a truly involved state within the relationship.. BUT RATHER, more of a care-taking position...<br><br>ALL IN ALL, I think you would not find TRUE HAPPINESS with her... But should you learn to be more 'balanced' in your relationship adjustments (as the others have suggested),  and 'weigh' less of things.. Your future relationship could very well be a very much brighter one...
