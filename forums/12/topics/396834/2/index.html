              <p>It is held in many mental health circles that masturbation can relieve <a title="Major depressive disorder" href="/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"><span style="color: #002bb8;">depression</span></a> and lead to a higher sense of <a title="Self-esteem" href="/wiki/Self-esteem"><span style="color: #002bb8;">self-esteem</span></a>.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-36"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Masturbation can also be particularly useful in relationships where one partner wants more sex than the other – in which case masturbation provides a balancing effect and thus a more harmonious relationship.<sup id="cite_ref-BadgerHerald_37-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BadgerHerald-37"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Mutual masturbation, the act by which two or more partners stimulate themselves in the presence of each other, allows a couple to reveal the "map to [their] pleasure centers". By watching a partner masturbate, one finds out the methods they use to please him- or herself, allowing each partner to learn exactly how the other enjoys being touched. Intercourse, by itself, is often inconvenient or impractical at times to provide sufficient sexual release for many people. Mutual masturbation allows couples to enjoy each other and obtain sexual release as often as they need but without the inconveniences and risks associated with sex.<sup id="cite_ref-BadgerHerald_37-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-BadgerHerald-37"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>38<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>In 2003, an Australian research team led by Graham Giles of <a class="mw-redirect" title="The Cancer Council Australia" href="/wiki/The_Cancer_Council_Australia"><span style="color: #002bb8;">The Cancer Council Australia</span></a><sup id="cite_ref-38" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-38"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></span></a></sup> found that males masturbating frequently had a lower probability to develop <a title="Prostate cancer" href="/wiki/Prostate_cancer"><span style="color: #002bb8;">prostate cancer</span></a>. Men who averaged five or more ejaculations weekly in their 20s had significantly lower risk. However they could not show a direct causation. The study also indicated that increased ejaculation through masturbation rather than intercourse would be more helpful as intercourse is associated with diseases (STDs) that may increase the <a title="Cervical cancer" href="/wiki/Cervical_cancer#Causes"><span style="color: #002bb8;">risk of cancer</span></a> instead. However, this benefit may be age related. A 2008 study concluded that frequent ejaculation between the ages of 20 and 40, may be correlated with higher risk of developing prostate cancer. On the other hand, frequent ejaculation in one's 50s was found to be correlated with a lower such risk in this same study.<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>A study published in 1997 found an inverse association between death from coronary heart disease and frequency of orgasm even given the risk that myocardial ischaemia and myocardial infarction can be triggered by sexual activity.</p>
              <blockquote>
              <p>The association between frequency of orgasm and all cause mortality was also examined using the midpoint of each response category recorded as number of orgasms per year. The age adjusted odds ratio for an increase of 100 orgasms per year was 0.64 (0.44 to 0.95).</p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>That is, a difference in mortality appeared between any two subjects when one subject ejaculated at around two times per week more than the other. Assuming a broad range average of between 3 to 5 ejaculations per week for healthy males, this would mean 5 to 7 ejaculations per week. This is consistent with a 2003 Australia article on the benefits against prostate cancer. The strength of these correlations increased with increasing frequency of ejaculation.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>41<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>A 2008 study at Tabriz Medical University found ejaculation reduces swollen nasal blood vessels, freeing the airway for normal breathing. The mechanism is through stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and is long lasting. The study author suggests "It can be done [from] time-to-time to alleviate the congestion and the patient can adjust the number of intercourses or masturbations depending on the severity of the symptoms."<sup id="cite_ref-41" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-41"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Masturbation is also seen as a sexual technique that protects individuals from the risk of contracting sexually transmitted diseases. Support for such a view, and for making it part of the American sex education curriculum, led to the dismissal of US Surgeon General <a title="Joycelyn Elders" href="/wiki/Joycelyn_Elders"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Joycelyn Elders</span></a> during the Clinton administration. E.U. Nations include masturbation in their sex education and promote the practice. (see above)</p>
              <p>Sexual climax, from masturbation or otherwise, leaves one in a relaxed and contented state. This is frequently followed closely by drowsiness and sleep – particularly when one masturbates in bed.</p>
              <p>Some professionals consider masturbation to function as a cardiovascular workout.<sup id="cite_ref-42" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-42"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Though research is still as yet scant, those suffering from cardiovascular disorders (particularly those recovering from myocardial infarction, or heart attacks) should resume physical activity (including sexual intercourse and masturbation) gradually and with the frequency and rigor which their physical status will allow. This limitation can serve as encouragement to follow through with physical therapy sessions to help improve endurance.</p>
              <h3><span id="Blood_pressure" class="mw-headline">Blood pressure</span></h3>
              <p>Both sex and masturbation lower blood pressure. A small study has shown that in one test group, recent full intercourse resulted in the lowest average blood pressure in stressful situations. Masturbation then led to lower blood pressure than did no recent sexual activity.<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <h3><span id="Pregnancy" class="mw-headline">Pregnancy</span></h3>
              <p>Masturbation involving both a man and a woman (see <em><a title="Non-penetrative sex" href="/wiki/Non-penetrative_sex#Mutual_masturbation_as_a_form_of_non-penetrative_sex"><span style="color: #002bb8;">mutual masturbation</span></a></em>) can result in pregnancy only if <a title="Semen" href="/wiki/Semen"><span style="color: #002bb8;">semen</span></a> contacts the <a title="Vulva" href="/wiki/Vulva"><span style="color: #002bb8;">vulva</span></a>. Masturbation with a partner can also theoretically result in transmission of sexually transmitted diseases by contact with bodily fluids.</p>
              <p>Male masturbation may be used as a method to obtain semen for third party reproductive procedures such as <a title="Artificial insemination" href="/wiki/Artificial_insemination"><span style="color: #002bb8;">artificial insemination</span></a> and <a title="In vitro fertilisation" href="/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation"><span style="color: #002bb8;">IVF</span></a> which may involve the use of either partner or donor sperm.</p>
              <p>At a sperm bank or fertility clinic, a special room or cabin may be set aside so that semen may be produced by male masturbation for use in fertility treatments such as <a title="Artificial insemination" href="/wiki/Artificial_insemination"><span style="color: #002bb8;">artificial insemination</span></a>. Such a facility is known as a <strong>masturbatorium</strong> (US) or men's production room (UK). A bed or couch is usually provided for the man, and pornographic films or other material may be made available.</p>

              <p>A man whose penis has suffered a blunt trauma, severe bend or other injury during intercourse or masturbation may, rarely, sustain a <a title="Penile fracture" href="/wiki/Penile_fracture"><span style="color: #002bb8;">penile fracture</span></a><sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></span></a></sup> or suffer from <a title="Peyronie's disease" href="/wiki/Peyronie%27s_disease"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Peyronie's disease</span></a>.<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>48<span>]</span></span></a></sup> <a title="Phimosis" href="/wiki/Phimosis"><span style="color: #002bb8;">Phimosis</span></a> is "a contracted foreskin (that) may cause trouble by hurting when an attempt is made to pull the foreskin back".<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>49<span>]</span></span></a></sup> In these cases, any energetic manipulation of the penis can be problematic.</p>

              <p>Sexual climax, from masturbation or otherwise, leaves one in a
              relaxed and contented state. This is frequently followed closely by
              drowsiness and sleep – particularly when one masturbates in
              bed.</p>
              <p>Some professionals consider masturbation to function as a
              cardiovascular workout.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="#cite_note-42"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></span></a></sup> Though research is still as yet scant, those suffering from
              cardiovascular disorders (particularly those recovering from
              myocardial infarction, or heart attacks) should resume physical
              activity (including sexual intercourse and masturbation) gradually
              and with the frequency and rigor which their physical status will
              allow. This limitation can serve as encouragement to follow through
              with physical therapy sessions to help improve endurance.</p>
              <h3><span>Blood pressure</span></h3>
              <p>Both sex and masturbation lower blood pressure. A small study
              has shown that in one test group, recent full intercourse resulted
              in the lowest average blood pressure in stressful situations.
              Masturbation then led to lower blood pressure than did no recent
              sexual activity.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="#cite_note-43"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <h3><span>Pregnancy</span></h3>
              <p>Masturbation involving both a man and a woman (see <em><a title="Non-penetrative sex" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Non-penetrative_sex#Mutual_masturbation_as_a_form_of_non-penetrative_sex"><span style="color: #002bb8;">mutual masturbation</span></a></em>) can result
              in pregnancy only if <a title="Semen" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Semen"><span style="color: #002bb8;">semen</span></a> contacts
              the <a title="Vulva" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Vulva"><span style="color: #002bb8;">vulva</span></a>. Masturbation with a partner can
              also theoretically result in transmission of sexually transmitted
              diseases by contact with bodily fluids.</p>
              <p>Male masturbation may be used as a method to obtain semen for
              third party reproductive procedures such as <a title="Artificial insemination" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Artificial_insemination"><span style="color: #002bb8;">artificial
              insemination</span></a> and <a title="In vitro fertilisation" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/In_vitro_fertilisation"><span style="color: #002bb8;">IVF</span></a> which may involve the use of
              either partner or donor sperm.</p>
              <p>At a sperm bank or fertility clinic, a special room or cabin may
              be set aside so that semen may be produced by male masturbation for
              use in fertility treatments such as <a title="Artificial insemination" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Artificial_insemination"><span style="color: #002bb8;">artificial
              insemination</span></a>. Such a facility is known as a
              <strong>masturbatorium</strong> (US) or men's production room (UK).
              A bed or couch is usually provided for the man, and pornographic
              films or other material may be made available.</p>
              <h3><span>Problems for males</span></h3>
              <p>A man whose penis has suffered a blunt trauma, severe bend or
              other injury during intercourse or masturbation may, rarely,
              sustain a <a title="Penile fracture" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Penile_fracture"><span style="color: #002bb8;">penile

              <p>There is no scientific evidence of a causative relationship
              between masturbation and any form of mental disorder. Excessive or
              compulsive sexual behavior is generally understood to be a symptom
              rather than a cause.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="#cite_note-49"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>50<span>]</span></span></a></sup><sup><a rel="nofollow" href="#cite_note-50"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>51<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>Compulsive masturbation and other compulsive behaviors can be
              signs of an emotional problem. As such, that may need to be
              addressed by a mental health specialist.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="#cite_note-51"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>52<span>]</span></span></a></sup> As with any "nervous habit", it is more helpful to consider the
              causes of compulsive behavior, rather than try to repress
              masturbation.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="#cite_note-52"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>53<span>]</span></span></a></sup><sup><a rel="nofollow" href="#cite_note-53"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>54<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
              <p>There is discussion between professionals and other interested
              parties as to the existence of, and validity of the concept of,
              <a title="Sexual addiction" rel="nofollow" href="/wiki/Sexual_addiction"><span style="color: #002bb8;">sexual
              addiction</span></a>. Compulsive masturbation is regarded as one of
              the symptoms of sexual addiction by proponents of that
              concept.<sup><a rel="nofollow" href="#cite_note-54"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>55<span>]</span></span></a></sup><sup><a rel="nofollow" href="#cite_note-55"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>[</span>56<span>]</span></span></a></sup></p>
