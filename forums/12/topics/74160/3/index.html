            <div class='col-md body'>Buddy,<br><br>Just gotta move on , though your heart finds it hard to do so.  Just get on with life, be busy with other stuff, hobbies, meeting other friends, it helps.  The worst thing i did when i encountered your experience is not to share and stay in the room.  Depression sets in very fast and you loose focus in life. Damn dangerous boy! Get up and move on my man.  Now i am married happily and can look back and laugh at myself, at least i've been through a failure and can understand a little more of your situation.<br><br>Cheers!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><br>In my opnion, if you really want to forget about her, you got to just concentrate on other stuffs. Find something that you like and concentrate on it. It will helps to forget her a bit. Or indulge yourself into work may helps also.<br><br>I will also suggest that if she really makes you feel very hurt up to a level in which you cannot even handle and remain conscious, you can try not to see her or contact her. I know it's extremely hard... I have been through it also. By not contacting her, you will gradually change your lifestyle and you will meet new friends and then she will just remain as a small portion in your memory. It may took years...<br><br>If you still remain in contact with her, it is almost impossible for you to forget her and the feelings will always be there everytime you saw her. The feelings may grow stronger and stronger if you truely loves her.<br><br></div>
