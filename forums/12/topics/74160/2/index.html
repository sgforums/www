I can understand your situation. Sometimes there is just no definite reason why she wants to leave you. She doesn't think about you, your relationship, your memories and anything. She cares only for herself and that is a fact. The fact that everybody cares for themselves still exists in this world. Her decision to leave you is probably to the best of her benefits. Never think that it is also for your own good unless you are enjoying your tragic moment right now.<br><br>I know it is very difficult for you to move on right now. You don't feel like doing anything and don't know what you can do. Time passes very slowly on you and you can question yourself what you did to deserve all these sorrows but you can never find an answer. This is the sad part of life as a guy, but on the other hand...I guess you wouldn't want to be the person to initiate the breakup as you loved her too much. So ultimately she has to be the bad person to initiate the breakup with you. You are a nice person, I hope you will find somebody who will appreciate you for who you are and not because of what benefits you can bring to her.<br><br>Girls are very much like your guys friends. You have good friends, bad friends, friends you don't want to get closer to, friends you have to guard yourselves against their intentions most of the time, and friends you don't even want to see them again. It is very difficult to find a good guy friend who will eventually be your best friend, and so is the true fact that it is also very difficult to find a good girl who will eventually be your girlfriend. Keep an open heart and good things will come your way. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
