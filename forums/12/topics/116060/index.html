            <div class='col-md body'>hi, personally i think ur bf should spare a thought for you, he should be more sensitive towards ur feelings...ask him to put himself in ur shoes, if ur ex bf keep calling you to chat, how wud he had felt?...<br>i can only say that once u're in a relationship, either one have to be more sensitive and think of each another's feelings...have to always keep a reasonable distant with their ex...afterall, they used to be an item, sure have feelings for that person no matter what....<br>and for his ex that keep calling her, i think she might be up to no good...who wud wanna call on their ex so much if they know they're already into another relationship, this only goes to show she has motives or something...<br>up til now, i think u shud have a good talk to ur bf regarding this issue, let him know that u're very uncomfortable abt the whole thing...if u're jealous, juz tell him so, these kinda thing shud not hidden from him....let him know how u feel for him...</div>

Tell yourself you are better than his ex gf. She's the loser and you are the winner. You are feeling <strong>insecure</strong> at the moment. Wake up in the morning in front of the mirror telling yourself you are the most prettiest girl in the world.Now don't give a fcuk what people says about you. Don't act confident. Be confident.</div>

There is nothing wrong with you feeling jealous or insecure cos afterall you are his gf. Sometimes a girl really need to get down and dirty in order to protect her own interests and in this case, it would be your bf. Don't worry about being seen as ungracious or unladylike in doing such things...cos girl tends to lose out in a relationship and this is one of the way where you can prevent yourself from getting hurt and also keeping your bf in line. There is nothing wrong if you ask your bf not to keep in contact with her anymore...just not keeping contact with his ex-gf. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>You could tell your bf that you are interested in getting to know his ex-gf. Let him arrange some sort of meeting up with his ex. If you happened to click well with his ex-gf, then you should try to know more about her...especially her weakness while still being nice and friendly to her. Of course...never be too genuinely nice to her or she might be tempted to steal your bf away. In this way, you could keep both your bf and his ex in line while you are figuring out his ex-gf's intentions and her weaknesses. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"> But remember to cut away his contact with his ex-gf if you detected any hanky-panky incidents going on behind you back. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Keeping bf in line is probably one of the biggest challenge a gf could ever face during a relationship. Achieve that and you will definitely have a pleasant relationship, else...you are just waiting for your entire world to come crashing down onto you. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br><br>Good luck and ohh...don't worry if you end up looking bad in front of your bf, you can always correct that image after you have won the battle. Guys are much more easier to satisfy than girls...and they are easily forgetful people. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br></div>
