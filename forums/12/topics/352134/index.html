              <p>I'm sure somehow somewhere in time, you've heard people calling someone "sissy", the very usual "gay" and probably other more demeaning words. And fact is, people have called me that at different points of my life.</p>
              <p>Being a more gentle-natured person, i consider myself quite a friendly and fun person to talk to, and one most people - including girls - can talk to. Maybe it's the way i talk or the way i might sub-consciously act, people have found it to be effeminate.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, honestly, i don't do alot of thing guys usually do. I'm not sporty, i don't play games or watch soccer and i'm not the type that looks out for "babes" wherever i go. Basically, not the typical manly or macho-ish guy.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless i still have been able to find good friends who can probably see past my "effeminate" or "gay-ish" behaviour. But i just find it saddening and demoralising when people (especially new people) judge and stereotype so easily. I have now become reserved of my own actions in order to avoid hurtful comments from people or even ignore their "unworthy remarks" but somehow it always returns.  </p>
              <p>Is anyone is the same circumstance as me? Maybe you can share what you have experience so i can learn how to deal with it better.</p>
              <p>I'm sure there'll be some of you who are the type who don't like this kind of effeminate behaviour, so hopefully if you will just ignore this thread if you have nothing better to say. thanks.</p>

              <p>What i can say to you is that you are some sort of deviance. You deviate from the rest. What you are and what you do or rather your character is different from most people.</p>
              <p>That is why people judge you differently. Obviously when you are a guy, you dont do sports, you do watch soccer or play games, you dont look macho or what.. then what do you do? Dont tell me you like knitting sewing or reading story books?</p>
              <p>Usually when people are differnt from the rest, they are outclassed. True you may have some friends that "see past" your feminine nature, but are you sure they really see you as the same as other guys around?</p>
              <p>Which guy in this world dont look at other girls? Even those with gf or wife will still loook at other girls.</p>
              <p>I think by saying you click with girls, most of them regard you as some type of sisters.</p>
              <p>I believe you should start changing yourself, be a guy.</p>
              <p>Anyway you did not tell us ya age, and you have a cocky attitude based on your replies to the others. I can imagine you with ya ah gua or feminine attitude and with such a cocky attitude, I tell you, you will suffer. I can also think that most probably you have not attended the NS, because in the NS you meets lots of people and you will encounter much worse remarks.</p>
              <p>Also if you cant accept people's remarks, dont post here in the forum. You want to ask, you sure expect criticism.</p>
              <p>All i can advise you is if you want to feel normal infront of you friends, then you be normal. Be just like the rest, dont stand out. Understand?</p>
