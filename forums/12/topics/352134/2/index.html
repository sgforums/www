              <p>lol not really la . u dun have to show tat ur a guy when ur a guy. Wat gays do are looking at guys with tat kind of sexual lust. Wat gentle man does is wat ur doing. Theres always this difference between being a gentle man and a man. Just like the way ur sitting. A man sits on the chair with his leg crossed on the other in a 90 degree. A gentleman cross his legs with a 45 degree angle. U call the minister a gay when he sits with his legs cross in a 45 angle ?</p>

              <p>b4 u deemed me as an immature flamer..</p>
              <p>let this 16 yr old boy TEACH u wat to do...(note that i use the word teach not tell..)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>now u say u are more mature than many of us..<br>but all of us are in fact more mature than u.. why?</p>
              <p>because in ur 1st post u said everyone keep saying remarks to u saying u are girlish..</p>
              <p>b4 that.. let me tell u my REALLIFE STORY.. DEFINITELY NOT ONE PART IS EXAGGERATING!</p>
              <p>From kindergarten 1 to pri 6.. my life is hell.. <br>how bad?</p>
              <p>every week kena beaten at least once.. usually 3 or more ppl..</p>
              <p>everyday kena bias by teacher.. even if ppl bully me.. teacher auto come to me and scold me for bullying other ppl...</p>
              <p>everyone looks down on me..</p>
              <p>every hour at least one person call me a "fatty" in sch..</p>
              <p>why?  because i am fat.. because i am too different from others... because i act so wierdly that i am of total different world with other ppl...</p>
              <p>i did not noe.. i just cried every night on my pillow... who could i talk to? no one.. not my family.. definitely no friends, no teachers..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>wat did i do then? </p>
              <p>i realised that this world has no such thing as ppl going to according wat u are..</p>
              <p>u have to stick to the standard rule..  of cuz i act as everyone.. do wat i like, ppl say i fat i challenge them in other ways.. i become a worse boy... but my life strangely turned so great.. that i am able to smile at least once everyday...</p>
              <p>of course ppl saying bad remarks to u is their fault.. similarly, the teachers and peers bullying me, its obviously their fault..</p>
              <p>but u have to change to make ur life better... it is ur life...u dun live to blame other ppl..</p>
              <p>so what if it is their wrong? it is u who suffers in the end...</p>
              <p>and dun tell me u find no logic in my words.. i am a child who experience first hand situation far worse than urs...</p>
              <p>emotional abuse, physical abuse, any kind of dam abuse.. i experienced it all in kindergarten and primary education..</p>
              <p>so.. what u can do is... do something useful in ur lives...</p>
              <p>in ur post u state u dun do sports, dun watch soccer, dun look at girls, dun do anything wat guys usually do... then wat u do?</p>
              <p>cmon.. if u have strange hobbies.. then at least do wat u like.. do something that is urself.. i am sure being a male.. u will have something to do as a man...</p>
              <p>and yeah.. when watching drama and movie... see how man and woman walks.. they walk total differently...</p>
              <p>i am not asking u to walk so suavely.. but at least dun walk like a girl..</p>
              <p>and socialise more... not with girls only.. with anyone...</p>
              <p>and let me tell u wat.. the feeling of coming back from hell is great... 4 yrs and i am still experiencing and enjoying life after that primary education...</p>
              <p>this is because i started to act like a normal human.. not being outcast... able for ppl to talk to.. able to develop relationships with everyone... do wateva i like...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so now look back.. when u say ppl are immature when they criticize u, wat did u do to ur life, or rather urself...?</p>
              <p>complain? whine? push blame? faulting others?</p>
              <p>so u very mature?</p>
              <p>if u still think u are mature after reading this, i have nothing to say...</p>
              <p>and let me tell u, i am telling u because i see u genuinely is stuck to ur own world..</p>
              <p>i hope u will reflect on urself.. and yeah.. male dun neccessarily play sports, watch soccer and look at girls.. u can play computer games like a nerd, and girls still go to u.. boys still treat u like close friends... when ppl critisize u, it will only be for joke or in anger...</p>

              <p>I'm sure somehow somewhere in time, you've heard people calling
              someone "sissy", the very usual "gay" and probably other more
              demeaning words. And fact is, people have called me that
              at different points of my life.</p>
              <p>Being a more gentle-natured person, i consider myself quite
              a friendly and fun person to talk to, and one most people -
              including girls - can talk to. Maybe it's the way i talk or the way
              i might sub-consciously act, people have found it to be
              effeminate.</p>
              <p>Furthermore, honestly, i don't do alot of thing guys usually do.
              I'm not sporty, i don't play games or watch soccer and i'm not the
              type that looks out for "babes" wherever
              i go. Basically, not the typical manly or macho-ish
              guy.</p>
              <p>Nevertheless i still have been able to find good friends who can
              probably see past my "effeminate" or "gay-ish" behaviour. But i
              just find it saddening and demoralising when people (especially
              new people) judge and stereotype so easily. I have
              now become reserved of my own actions in order to
              avoid hurtful comments from people or even ignore their
              "unworthy remarks" but somehow it always returns.  </p>
              <p>Is anyone is the same circumstance as me? Maybe you can share
              what you have experience so i can learn how to deal with it
              better.</p>
              <p>I'm sure there'll be some of you who are the type who don't like
              this kind of effeminate behaviour, so hopefully if you will just
              ignore this thread if you have nothing better to say. thanks.</p>

              word teach not tell..)</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>now u say u are more mature than many of us..<br> but all of us are in fact more mature than u.. why?</p>
              <p>because in ur 1st post u said everyone keep saying remarks to u
              saying u are girlish..</p>
              <p>b4 that.. let me tell u my REALLIFE STORY.. DEFINITELY NOT ONE
              PART IS EXAGGERATING!</p>
              <p>From kindergarten 1 to pri 6.. my life is hell..<br> how bad?</p>
              <p>every week kena beaten at least once.. usually 3 or more
              ppl..</p>
              <p>everyday kena bias by teacher.. even if ppl bully me.. teacher
              auto come to me and scold me for bullying other ppl...</p>
              <p>everyone looks down on me..</p>
              <p>every hour at least one person call me a "fatty" in sch..</p>
              <p>why?  because i am fat.. because i am too different from
              others... because i act so wierdly that i am of total different
              world with other ppl...</p>
              <p>i did not noe.. i just cried every night on my pillow... who
              could i talk to? no one.. not my family.. definitely no friends, no
              teachers..</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>wat did i do then? </p>
              <p>i realised that this world has no such thing as ppl going to
              according wat u are..</p>
              <p>u have to stick to the standard rule..  of cuz i act as
              everyone.. do wat i like, ppl say i fat i challenge them in other
              ways.. i become a worse boy... but my life strangely turned so
              great.. that i am able to smile at least once everyday...</p>
              <p>of course ppl saying bad remarks to u is their fault..
              similarly, the teachers and peers bullying me, its obviously their
              fault..</p>
              <p>but u have to change to make ur life better... it is ur life...u
              dun live to blame other ppl..</p>
              <p>so what if it is their wrong? it is u who suffers in the
              end...</p>
              <p>and dun tell me u find no logic in my words.. i am a child who
              experience first hand situation far worse than urs...</p>
              <p>emotional abuse, physical abuse, any kind of dam abuse.. i
              experienced it all in kindergarten and primary education..</p>
              <p>so.. what u can do is... do something useful in ur lives...</p>
              <p>in ur post u state u dun do sports, dun watch soccer, dun look
              at girls, dun do anything wat guys usually do... then wat u do?</p>
              <p>cmon.. if u have strange hobbies.. then at least do wat u like..
              do something that is urself.. i am sure being a male.. u will have
              something to do as a man...</p>
              <p>and yeah.. when watching drama and movie... see how man and
              woman walks.. they walk total differently...</p>
              <p>i am not asking u to walk so suavely.. but at least dun walk
              like a girl..</p>
              <p>and socialise more... not with girls only.. with anyone...</p>
              <p>and let me tell u wat.. the feeling of coming back from hell is
              great... 4 yrs and i am still experiencing and enjoying life after
              that primary education...</p>
              <p>this is because i started to act like a normal human.. not being
              outcast... able for ppl to talk to.. able to develop relationships
              with everyone... do wateva i like...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so now look back.. when u say ppl are immature when they
              criticize u, wat did u do to ur life, or rather urself...?</p>
              <p>complain? whine? push blame? faulting others?</p>
              <p>so u very mature?</p>
              <p>if u still think u are mature after reading this, i have nothing
              to say...</p>
              <p>and let me tell u, i am telling u because i see u genuinely is
              stuck to ur own world..</p>
              <p>i hope u will reflect on urself.. and yeah.. male dun
              neccessarily play sports, watch soccer and look at girls.. u can
              play computer games like a nerd, and girls still go to u.. boys
              still treat u like close friends... when ppl critisize u, it will
              only be for joke or in anger...</p>
