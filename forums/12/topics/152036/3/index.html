            <div class='col-md body'>I'm was in this situation once before. My ex didn't keep shouting at me though, but she kept complaining especially when we didn't meet. I has a very tight schedule and after school I just wanted to rest and relax.<br><br>My personal opinion: I chose to let go 'cos I couldn't keep up with her expectations. I didn't want to disappoint her over and over again, 'cos I found out that I was unable or unwilling to make time for her sometimes, thus my decision. I rather let the hurt happen once than make it happen over and over again. I'm not sure 'bout how your ex thinks, but this is from me.</div>

In simpler words is dun be too 'calculative'.<br><br>Everyone needs care and concern. I am not accusing u of not being attentive enuff to his needs, cuz in fact u do not leave much scenarios for us to understand ur situation better.<br><br>But i believe he must have being the one who's giving in most of the time and naturally u accepted the fact that it's ' li shuo dang ran'. &amp; gradually took him for granted &amp; I can assumed that now u r unable to adapt to his sudden outbreak or changes..cuz last time he's not lidat...<br><br>I can only say... it's up to u to salvage ur relationship.. He will not crawl back into ur arms again...cuz he's afraid of getting hurt too. Dun think u r the only one who's hurt..he too isn't a stone.<br><br>Be strong, take the initiative to convince him wif ur changes &amp; tat u appreciate what he has done for u in the past. I believe he will appreciate u better and things will work out smoothly for both of u. Do not rush him into a decision, care for him as a friend mayb that might help to build up the chemistry too.<br><br>Take care.

Guys prefer strong and confident girls as well. I can really understand how you feel as I went through this before. You must maintain a happy and cheerful you loh, How would he dare to approach you when you are so sad and miserable.<br><br>Things are so unpredictable that you cant always expect it to happen in the way you wanted. It may or may not happen. be strong! This is just part and parcels of life to be learnt.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Feeling miserable is natural and that anyone in ur situation will be experiencing.<br><br>Choosing to end ur life is the most foolish solution and can nv be the solution to the problem u r facing right now.<br><br>Have u ever tot of how wud ur family feel when suddenly their daughter is gone? And how abt ur frens? There's alot of people around u who cares and loves u. Trust me, it maybe that u haben realised it cuz u r too eager to patch back wif ur ex-bf and cudn't think logically.<br><br>I ve commited suicide 5yrs ago and that really wakes me up. &amp; i can tell u that I am extremely guilty towards my family especially my mother.<br><br>All the while she cares and loves me alot, even though she's naggy like most mother. And i m so selfish to end my life for a relationship. Nothing is thicker than blood... especially ur family. Thinking back, i felt really remorseful and unfilial to abandon my family.... for a guy whom might not even care if i ever really perish from this world.<br><br>If u die, yes, ur ex will feel sad and guilty.... but he will still learn to get over it. U will only etch in his mind forever... and sooner or later he will find himself a new gf... So is ending ur life for him worth it??<br><br>Try to contact ur frens more and indulge urself in more activities.<br><br>Thinking abt him all the time will not help u feel any better. Cuz he is not giving u the kind of respond that u r expecting..... Maybe u can find a better guy? Who's willing to sacrifice for u? God knows right?? Be optimistic Ohyeah.<br>You can do it.
