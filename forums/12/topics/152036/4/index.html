            <div class='col-md body'>just read your case.<br>a few things for u to note:<br>1. Your guy is in the army. He has very little time, coz he probably only can book out over the weekend. Thus his social life is limited, aside from his campmates. So, that makes him finding another gal very minimal. Given the circumstances, your possibility of winning him back is there.<br><br>2. Be concerned about him becoz you ARE concerned about him, NOT becoz you want to win him back. There is a big difference btw the two. One has the true sincerity of concern, which ur guy will feel it, and gradually understands u HAVE changed, and not coz u wan to win him back. The other will just cause him to think that you are just trying to win him back, and will increase the pressure.<br><br>3. Fishing is an art. To bring in the fish, u must learn how to release the line, then bring it nearer, release the line again, then bring it nearer. Just keeping pulling the line will cause it to break.<br><br>Good luck. Do your best. Let things go on naturally. If you two get back, good for you, but if not, let the chapter end and move on.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Smudgey, you're a good friend, so please don't take what I'm going to say negatively, ok?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>Some battles are just Not worth fighting.  If both of you are always arguing, or Not feeling happy with each other, sooner or later 1 party will give up on the relationship.  If you think about it, why don't you let some trivial things slide?  Don't need to "we need to talk" ever so often.  Don't need to scream or shout either (Not saying that you do so).<br><br>Some things Hamster does may bug me at certain times, but if it's Not too serious, then usually I'll just keep quiet about it.  ESPECIALLY when I'm in a bad mood, when I know it's likely I won't listen to his defence.  However, on a certain day when both of us are in a good mood, I'll drop it as a joke.  Then we'll just talk about it, &amp; it's over.  We share a bear hug &amp; both parties are happy.<br><br>A relationship is Not about having someone's way all the time, or even those times when we're blatantly in the right.  It's about knowing which battles to choose to fight, &amp; which ones we can simply let go &amp; step back.  Doesn't mean you hafta keep quiet forever, you can wait till a day when both are cheerful &amp; just drop it jokingly.  You'll never know how pleasant things can be when it's cleared up.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by smudgey:</div><div class="quote_body">I think if you ever ever want this relationship to work, you'll have to change the way you talk to him during a quarrel... I know it's hard. I myself is still trying to control my emotions, what I say, and how I say it... not easy but do you think the relationship is worth it???<br><br>You have made it known that you want a patch back. so now what you can do is tell him You are willing to try to change... ask him to meet you 1 or 2 weeks later (set a date) and you'll wait for his answer. then let him think about it. during this 2 weeks try not to bug him or pressure him. let him have time to seriously think about his options.<br><br>Be prepared for the worst. meet him two weeks later and hear his answer. but bear in mind that he have been very patient with you in the past. so if his answer is yes, you better really seriously work on changing that attitude (try counting slowly to ten, when you find yourself worked up, taking deep breaths).<br><br>That's all I can think of right now.</div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>*nods in agreement*<br><br>Sometimes what guys need is Not what I call the "peripheral things" -- gifts, or even cakes or cards.  Many girls make the mistake of thinking these "peripheral things" are the core of a relationship, &amp; represent their love.<br><br>The core of a relationship is loving, caring, understanding, forgiving, trusting.  After you get these right, THEN you think about the peripherals.<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by drx:</div><div class="quote_body">want to ask u something.<br><br>Can u stop pushing your guy over the edge?<br><br>Everytime u meet, u asked can we be lovers, can we patch back and does he love you at all or not. I can even feel the heat from here. He got to work especially in the army where life is tough and just one wrong move can kill a person.<br><br>Cool down.. you likes to be pester everyday? True love need not be said out in words but felt through the actions of the other party.<br><br>If you say you love him then be patient a bit. What is the point of him saying that he still loves you when in his heart he does not mean it at all?<br><br>Your ex is giving you another chance so treasure it well.. if he does not why would he even borther to talk to you?<br><br>My advice for you is<br><br>1) Stop asking whether he loves you or not.<br><br>2) Do something nice for him like bake him a cake or make a nice necklace with his name on it.<br><br>3) Learn to control your temper.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

Just WHEN will you stop bugging your poor bf?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused">   Don't you get it?  If he's asking you to concentrate on other things instead, he may be willing to be a friend for now, &amp; perhaps later, he MAY consider (or he may Not).  However, if you continue bugging him like this, you'll only push him further from you.<br><br>I'm Not ur bf, but I'd been pestered like this by an ex, &amp; I know how irritating it is when my ex kept pestering me for a chance, blah blah blah.  Fan2 si3 le4!  I'd kept giving in &amp; patching up just to shut his damn mouth, but his nature couldn't be changed, he was too fan2.  I kept breaking up with him.
