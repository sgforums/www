            <div class='col-md body'>I think if you ever ever want this relationship to work, you'll have to change the way you talk to him during a quarrel... I know it's hard. I myself is still trying to control my emotions, what I say, and how I say it... not easy but do you think the relationship is worth it???<br><br>You have made it known that you want a patch back. so now what you can do is tell him You are willing to try to change... ask him to meet you 1 or 2 weeks later (set a date) and you'll wait for his answer. then let him think about it. during this 2 weeks try not to bug him or pressure him. let him have time to seriously think about his options.<br><br>Be prepared for the worst. meet him two weeks later and hear his answer. but bear in mind that he have been very patient with you in the past. so if his answer is yes, you better really seriously work on changing that attitude (try counting slowly to ten, when you find yourself worked up, taking deep breaths).<br><br>That's all I can think of right now.</div>

Am I correct to say that?<br><br>I have told him once more that is it possible for us to get together HE said that if he said that it is possible or impossible, he knew i would wait... in the end, he said that if there is a chance, we will be together.. It depends on fate... i feel so sad.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  i ask him that whether is it possible for us to get together in dec, he just replied that he dun know wat will happen in dec.. i feeling sad again....<br><br>he kept saying i was not the cause of the breakup, i knew he was trying not to make me feel guilty....the more he did it, the more i feel guilty<br><br>I smsed him that i will changed for a better person for his sake to make him accept me again. i will do it..<br><br>I feel he still care for me... but he is hurt by me....<br><br>my friend felt that i dun have to go to the extent to beg him to patch up.. but i was the one who broke up such relationship.

            <div class='col-md body'>want to ask u something.<br><br>Can u stop pushing your guy over the edge?<br><br>Everytime u meet, u asked can we be lovers, can we patch back and does he love you at all or not. I can even feel the heat from here. He got to work especially in the army where life is tough and just one wrong move can kill a person.<br><br>Cool down.. you likes to be pester everyday? True love need not be said out in words but felt through the actions of the other party.<br><br>If you say you love him then be patient a bit. What is the point of him saying that he still loves you when in his heart he does not mean it at all?<br><br>Your ex is giving you another chance so treasure it well.. if he does not why would he even borther to talk to you?<br><br>My advice for you is<br><br>1) Stop asking whether he loves you or not.<br><br>2) Do something nice for him like bake him a cake or make a nice necklace with his name on it.<br><br>3) Learn to control your temper.<br><br></div>

It depends on fate... i feel so sad.... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad">  i ask him that whether is it possible for us to get together in dec, he just replied that he dun know wat will happen in dec.. i feeling sad again....<br><br>he kept saying i was not the cause of the breakup, i knew he was trying not to make me feel guilty....the more he did it, the more i feel guilty<br><br>I smsed him that i will changed for a better person for his sake to make him accept me again. i will do it..<br><br>I feel he still care for me... but he is hurt by me....<br><br>my friend felt that i dun have to go to the extent to beg him to patch up.. but i was the one who broke up such relationship. He said the way i did it had lost all the woman's pride.<br>am i wrong to beg him??? i just feel that i have hurt this person, it is correct for me to do..... maybe i am such a shameful....</div></blockquote><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> Cirumstances.<br><br>You are brought into a scenario where you causally issued the decree of break-up in a moment of folly... only to regret as soon as your order is given. You can never say you didn't have the time to consider about it because the minute you declare a break-up, regardless of how unintentional this declaration is, you have vividly created a huge chasm, dividing and widening the emotional distance.<br><br>Some people got closer after a break-up, but according to my experience, that is <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>a sacrificial exchange of a temporary closeness, for some degree of damage to the relationship.</strong></span> Emotional intimacy is achieved through certain criteria, but definitely, a break-patch cycle is never part of it.<br><br>It is likely that you have wounded him somehow and brought him down to his knees, through the realization of how weak this relationship actually is, when he is serving his national liability. His despondent attitude is natural; he could never see himself standing on equal grounds with reality (or possible competitors) and fighting to salvage his relationship. His fatigued body and jaded emotions makes him feel so worn out.<br><br>Somehow, he would feel that even if he wants to give it another try, when similar thingy occurs, there is little he could do if you want to end the relationship.<br><br>This is belongs to an issue of understanding and empathy. He may need some time to think through things and you could also take this opportunity to reflect. There will definitely be a cool-down period; therefore decide after the heat is gone.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I have to say I agree with drx on this, you have already made your wishes to get back together mre than crystal clear, now the ball is in his court. it's up to him.<br>Let him think.<br><br>put yourself in his shoes, if you were very confused at this point in time and he kept bugging you asking to get together even after telling him you don't know yet.... will this make you more or less willing to restart the relationship?<br><br>Give him time.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by drx:</div><div class="quote_body">want to ask u something.<br><br>Can u stop pushing your guy over the edge?<br><br>Everytime u meet, u asked can we be lovers, can we patch back and does he love you at all or not. I can even feel the heat from here. He got to work especially in the army where life is tough and just one wrong move can kill a person.<br><br>Cool down.. you likes to be pester everyday? True love need not be said out in words but felt through the actions of the other party.<br><br>If you say you love him then be patient a bit. What is the point of him saying that he still loves you when in his heart he does not mean it at all?<br><br>Your ex is giving you another chance so treasure it well.. if he does not why would he even borther to talk to you?<br><br>My advice for you is<br><br>1) Stop asking whether he loves you or not.<br><br>2) Do something nice for him like bake him a cake or make a nice necklace with his name on it.<br><br>3) Learn to control your temper.<br><br></div></blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>hi ohyeah,<br><br>Guys in army are usually under stress and pressure. You might not be the reason for the break up but u r indirectly. I mean, u may have known his pressure in the army but have yet to stand in his shoes to really understand or feel what he has undergone.<br><br>He just need a break man.<br><br>Kana tekan in army and go home kana yelled by u, who can take it?? Right? Let him have some time to cool off. He didn't give u a definite answer whether to patch back anot cuz he doesn't want that kind of stress again. Maybe he's exhausted &amp; irritated of this kind of relationship and his life in army. That's y he chose to escape and avoid ur QUESTIONS. I don't think he loves u no more, juz that he needs some time to balance himself.<br><br>Gal, i know now u r trying ur best to win him back.. but dun go overboard by questioning him all the time. and dun expect him to wait at his phone for ur sms and calls anymore. U change for the sake of urself not for him. Dun u think if u can curb ur temper and emotion well, u will live a happier person?<br><br>Give him some time. Surprise him with little messages and  drop it in his mailbox. Let him know that u care for him....his health, his family and life. All the best to u!! ANd hope u will not get back to ur old self again.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by -ohyeah-:</div><div class="quote_body">now... i am kind of worried...wat if i have changed myself for better..and he still refuse to patch back...<br><br>COz he knows how is the feelings like when a couple break and patch back.. he himself has experienced this b4.<br><br>So i dun know how firm his decision will be when he c me there is a change in me.

Not sure if your guy can be one of them. Ultimately be sincere and understand that he might possibly be emotionally tired and scared to re-enter into the relationship.<br><br>Give him time and space, let him know that you're there and waiting for him. But if he doesn't appreciate, maybe it's really time to move on. If it's not meant to be, better to let it go.</div>
