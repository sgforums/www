Because he too from army and said he is too busy at army. How long you 2 being together?<br><br>I indirectly caused my breakup also because I sent an email stating how I feel about his faults in a nice way as I think he is not comfortable in talking to me personally.  he ignored my emails and treated me coldy after the email after that. What I did is shouting at him through smses.<br><br>I asked in sms whether is he losing interest and wanted a breakup. then suddenly sms me to not wait for him as he is <strong>busying in army</strong> no time to reply my messages. after 1 week I cant stand having a break up on  the sms. For me I felt breakups through sms is the most shitty yucky.<br><br>I called him up and he said he dont love me anymore because I was too fan, keep demanding answers from him through the sms. I did wonder if I never sent that email and never suggest whether he wants a breakup or not? How long will we be together? I think not long because the beginning is totally different from the end. no consistency. gets duller as times goes. a 1 year plus relationship to get so dull so quickly. I feels very tired up.<br><br>3 months plus already I still feels so terrible and miss him quite badly, but he never called or sms or msn me. I did sms and msn him. I felt I am so weak with no pride. I needs time bah. Maybe he never love me before.<br><br>For your case, just 1 week less from your breakup, all the quarel words and anger may still be there, since you have already asked to patch back and he refused. Have pride, and leave him alone already, if he feel that he still miss you alot he will contact you. maybe give him 1 or 2 month time to think about it. if the guy really love you, 1 or 2 months he will start to miss you badly already. If you really meant alot to him, he will starts to worried about where are you and calls you up! good luck!!<br><br>Did you wondering about what causes your quarels, maybe you can think whether are you not understanding about why he react in some ways? Try to understand each other, men and women think differently. Shouting is strongly blaming on someone. especially guys they hate to be blamed and dislike feeling incompetence to help in your problems. A guy felt appreciated when you are happy because of him. All the best and hope you 2 can overcome this barrier!</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><span style="font-style: italic;">quote from  Tier:<br>I think your case sounds similar but different from my case. Because he too from army and said he is too busy at army. How long you 2 being together?<br><br>I indirectly caused my breakup also because I sent an email stating how I feel about his faults in a nice way as I think he is not comfortable in talking to me personally. he ignored my emails and treated me coldy after the email after that. What I did is shouting at him through smses.<br><br>I asked in sms whether is he losing interest and wanted a breakup. then suddenly sms me to not wait for him as he is busying in army no time to reply my messages. after 1 week I cant stand having a break up on the sms. For me I felt breakups through sms is the most #%$@ty yucky.<br><br>I called him up and he said he dont love me anymore because I was too fan, keep demanding answers from him through the sms. I did wonder if I never sent that email and never suggest whether he wants a breakup or not? How long will we be together? I think not long because the beginning is totally different from the end. no consistency. gets duller as times goes. a 1 year plus relationship to get so dull so quickly. I feels very tired up.<br><br>3 months plus already I still feels so terrible and miss him quite badly, but he never called or sms or msn me. I did sms and msn him. I felt I am so weak with no pride. I needs time bah. Maybe he never love me before.<br><br>For your case, just 1 week less from your breakup, all the quarel words and anger may still be there, since you have already asked to patch back and he refused. Have pride, and leave him alone already, if he feel that he still miss you alot he will contact you. maybe give him 1 or 2 month time to think about it. if the guy really love you, 1 or 2 months he will start to miss you badly already. If you really meant alot to him, he will starts to worried about where are you and calls you up! good luck!!<br><br>Did you wondering about what causes your quarels, maybe you can think whether are you not understanding about why he react in some ways? Try to understand each other, men and women think differently. Shouting is strongly blaming on someone. especially guys they hate to be blamed and dislike feeling incompetence to help in your problems. A guy felt appreciated when you are happy because of him. All the best and hope you 2 can overcome this barrier</span><br><br>I have been wif him since his first time being a recruit to segnant..... abt 1 years.<br>I am the one who let my emotion over run my head. SO whenever i am angry, i nv think.....<br><br>i cant bear the thought of not talking to him at all.... not talking for a day, i felt so lost..... unable to do anything..... so i rather call him alternate days... and i am happy that he is not avoiding my calls. He also feel that I have taken him for granted and he felt he has pampered too much... I nv realised that I have gone too much that cross his patient limit.....<br><br>I wan to talk to him abt us.. but he doesnt have the time and i dun dare to talk. i scare wat if i talk abt us, he begins to avoid me... but i dun wan to drag...<br><br>i really at lost... sometimes i feel he gives me some hope...<br><br>i feel that i am the one to let him down and hurt him so i feel that in order to patch up wif him, i have to make the first move to touch his heart... i am willingly to put down my pride....<br><br>i dun know how long he is willingly to talk to me abt us again.....</div>

At this moment he is feeling really pressurized I guess. Stress about facing quarels again, stress about whether can the relationship work well. He really need to sort out whats important to him.<br><br>You maybe feeling frustrated that he never listen and start shouting at him, but he is feeling totally upset about not being able to make you happy. Try to work this out by understand each other needs better. He still cares about you but just dont want to give you any hopes. He couldnt think because he needs a moment to himself to sort out his thoughts, maybe he need to hide in his own space and think about it. Give him time to think. Guys arent like us, words come so easily to us but not to them.<br><br>If you think he really cares for you alot, and there may be hope in the relationship still. Then dun give up easily again, saying breakup easily let him think that you dun really treasure this relationship as well. Tell him that you hope to get back together when he has cool down, give him a week like what brutus said. Stay calm and cheer up~</div>
