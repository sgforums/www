            <div class='col-md body'>Yes, love can be nurtured, but right now you may be bugging her to the extent of pissing her off. To put it bluntly, it seems she may not be interested in you or attracted to you, but does not want to hurt you with a point blank rejection.<br><br>If you have to love someone deeply in order to begin a relationship with him or her, then many couples wouldn't even come together in the first place.<br><br>Help yourself first, be a friend. Don't push it. Bide your time.<br><br>Don't think you could ever be 'just a friend' to her? Better let go then.</div>
