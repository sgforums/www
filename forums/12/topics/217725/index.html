She been sending me lot of picture of herself.<br><br>After 2 days, I expressed my feeling to her but was rejected and reasons given was it was too fast and she like it slow. She was scare off and was told we can online be friend online and not possible for us to meet up and she do not want to comit now. Strange thing happened here, on the same conversation she ask me if I would marry her if I make her pregnant. I reply, not possible as you mention we cannot be together. She then said, why are you always in different frequency.<br><br>I then reply I will but will use a cap if needed and she again said if cap don't do as I do not like the feeling of rubber. Do you think I still stand a chance despite her saying we are too fast? If no, why is sh asking me the question of pregnant and marry.<br><br>On 1 occasion, I ask her about her weekend and was told she went out with her gf for shopping but when I ask her again last night, she mention to me she went out with a guy instead. I ask her about her progress with the guy she is seeing few day ago, she told me they are olny friend but then last night, she told me her like the guy and is waiting for him to make the move.
