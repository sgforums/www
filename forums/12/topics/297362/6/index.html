            <div class='col-md body'>Both are still consider infant in law. even if so. the police will usually ask the parents of both parties to settle the matter themselves. and they have to consider the fact that if really wanna report the issue, the 12 year old boy gonna have a police record all his life. Reporting means drawing a line between the 2 families and that's for a lifetime. think twice. Like what i've said. ask both parents to sit down and clarify the issue. but if the talk comes to nowhere.. then i guess. u gonna report.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

That does not absolve his responsibility totally however his parents and teachers are to be blamed.<br><br>For the girl she's too young to understand the REAL significance of the assault. She does not need to grow up hating guys or what. She can be talked to at a later age, say 10-12. Meanwhile it's more important to make sure she does not get messed up emotionally(police action will not solve it) and that she learns how to protect herself.<br></div></blockquote>Hi crimson soldier,<br><br>The argument in this thread can go on for a long time with no real conclusion in the end because weÂ’re just running circles based on what we Â‘feelÂ’ is the likelihood of truth.<br><br>I just hope that in a real life situation, as an adult, even as bystander, you act as you should because even if you err, you err with the safety of younglings in mind (that is basic common sense and basic morality). Juvenile molesters/rapists on the other hand need counseling, probation, psycho sexual screening etc to make sure they are set on the right track.<br><br>Confront the situation rather than sweep things under the rug is the right thing to do no matter what happens eventually. Young perpetrators of sexual abuse may be victims of vulgar media but it is not for you and me to estimate the level of harm on anybody (leave it to skilled workers and the authorities).<br><br>If sex education for 13yos in developed countries has progressed from discouraging premarital sex to encouraging safe sex, you seem decades away from how modern youth has evolved.<br></div>
