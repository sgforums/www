I know that the law won't do much about it but still worth scaring him into respecting women.<br><br>It is about stopping a behaviour now rather than him growing up to think he can do it to other girls and ultimately landing in jail.<br><br>It is also making sure that the little girl knows that her parents believe and support her regardless of what happens. She should not be deprived of any right to speak up. </div></blockquote>Are you a parent? I would probably guess no because of what you poted. Neither am I but at least I'm young enough to remember what it's like being a kid.<br><br>I agree that it's important to stop this sort of behaviour but scaring him into it won't do a thing because in his mind nothing has changed. He needs to be educated why it's wrong to do it and the consequences and implications of his actions.<br><br>If you just report it to the police he'd still think of doing the same thing but now is afraid because he might get caught. Rather than not wanting to do it anymore the only thing stopping him is the possibility of getting in trouble. Kids with that mindset will then find ways to avoid getting caught.<br><br>You should be responsible and not leave it to the police to do the parenting.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Frankly I am looking at it this way: How would I react when my daughter gets molested by a boy , regardless of how old he is.<br><br>I will talk to the boy's parents first if he is below 10 years old. If they don't give him a good thrashing as in I cannot see the bright red cane marks on his legs and arms, I will report it to the police. Let his parents deal with the shame of it all .<br><br>I will also KEEP my daughter the HELL away from him and I will make sure the other relatives are appraised of the situation so that their own daughters do not get the "problem".<br><br><strong>Who gives a crap about relations and "face", when it comes to my own flesh and blood. </strong><br><br>I don't believe what I am hearing about people saying  <span style="font-style: italic;"> ai ya ,just 12 years old kid - give a chance</span>.  I will only give a chance if his parents thrash him well enough to make sure that he remembers the lesson for life and respect girls more.<br><br></div>
