I would probably guess no because of what you poted. Neither am I but at least I'm young enough to remember what it's like being a kid.<br><br>I agree that it's important to stop this sort of behaviour but scaring him into it won't do a thing because in his mind nothing has changed. He needs to be educated why it's wrong to do it and the consequences and implications of his actions.<br><br>If you just report it to the police he'd still think of doing the same thing but now is afraid because he might get caught. Rather than not wanting to do it anymore the only thing stopping him is the possibility of getting in trouble. Kids with that mindset will then find ways to avoid getting caught.<br><br>You should be responsible and not leave it to the police to do the parenting.</div></blockquote>I am no parent but I know what it is like to be bullied in school by 10-12 year old boys who should know better. And parents who don't listen until my hair got truly cut off and they saw a boy kick me down the steps of the bus (the highest point of 2 years of bullying). I was a chubby kid but my weight dropped to the point of being underweight from school money stolen plus being called Piggy.<br><br>My father threatened police action on the boy's parents (the one who pushed me off the bus) - they literally gave him a damn good thrashing to appease my father.  The boy bully and his group kept the HELL away from me after that.<br><br>If I had broken a bone , the case would be taken to the police immediately.<br><br>So do I want my child to go through this phase? Never. Ever. I want to my child to know that I believe her and I will support her . Not wait until something bad really happens.<br></div>

If it is my daughter, I am not throwing her case to the gutter over relations and crap. I am going to show her what gets done to people who do her wrong so that she will have the courage to speak up next time something like this happens.<br><br>If the parents are relations, I will tell them first and see what punishment the boy get. If he gets a light punishment as in I don't see the bright red cane marks on his arms and legs.  Basically if he cries and his parents and him apologises to my daughter , I consider the case closed if my daughter is happy. If not, to the police I go.<br><br>I give relations this type of option : punish your son  and acknowledge the wrong did to my daughter. If not , police and I will make sure all the relatives with daughters will KNOW what your son did to mine.<br><br>If the court won't take on the case and yes likely the court won't , the police presence at his house will be enough to intimidate him into not repeating the behaviour again and act as a caution to his parents to control his behaviour.<br></div>

No one is guilty unless proven so by the court of law!<br><br>By what you typed above, you seem to have the mentality that all those who go to court are already guilty. Don't forget, A might be innocent after all. Just by reading a few sentences typed out online, you get so worked up!<br><br>What justifiable molestation???<br>The judge will simply decide if he did molest her or not.<br>Assuming if the police decide to charge him in the first place!<br><br>There have been numerous cases where the police were forced to drop several assault cases due to lack of evidence in recent memory.<br><br>It isnt about i call the police, and he go to jail. It isnt as simple as that.<br><br>The police will decide if the boy is worth charging or not. But based on words alone.
