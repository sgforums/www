He doesn't sees it the way you do, for his mindset has been taught to him that having a relationship is a form of expediture. He doesn't sees love as a form of motivation (to succeed in life), self actualization, for the soul or whatever. Inevitable, most Singaporean men are like that and because of it, he will be paid with what his mindsets tells him - that he is inadequate and therefore, makes no decision.<br><br>You will probably feel stagnant hanging around him with such dubious status; chances are, you will opt out soon enough (Unless you have strong fixed signs or prominent planets in Cancer, Pisces and especially Scorpio). Feelings, many times, is not a reason enough to payback all these suppression of all dimensions. (In Mandarin we called it Wei Qu)<br><br>My advice is to leave the friendship as it is, minus the kissing part. If the man you like can't seem to commit for any reason, whatever reasons he gives is a good enough reason. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You only need willingness to commit</strong></span>, without it, nothing helps. If he is not in a state ready for a relationship, with your presence, it wouldn't make much difference, afterall, he also choose to give up his potential foreigner gf.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>
