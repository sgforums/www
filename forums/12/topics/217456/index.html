You may not need to show mercy, but there's also no need to go to the other extreme. Unless you are really in <strong>desperate</strong> need of money, I suggest you do not do need as such actions will only protray you as a jerk and serve as an illusion for her and her friends to believe that she was right to dump you.</div>

What a babe!<br><br>Your mistake was forgiving her. You did not forgive her. She did not earn the forgiveness when she dumped you.
