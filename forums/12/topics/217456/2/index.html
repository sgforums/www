Or some may argue that as long as the TS is ethically correct in his action, he will not have to care about what others will say about him.<br><br>But I think that no matter how successful the girl is going to be in her spread of lies, some people will believe her and the TS will suffer to a certain degree, may not be large, but will. The compensation to this? None, since I also do not believe that the girl will give him back the money.<br><br>So why do something that is surely going to result in something bad without getting anything in return?</div></blockquote>thats why he should start some constructive true speading<br><br>he may not get much back materially, but sometimes the satisfaction is imense, thats a subjective thing of course.<br><br>+ i don't think it will result very badly on him as mentioned.<br><br>even if he doesn't ask for the money i think the truth should be spread around abeilt done in a perveicved upright and convert manner<br><br></div>

Spreading truth will only be perceived as spreading rumours by your ex's friends. Exercising your right at this point in time is only going to make you look bad.

And if then you start telling pple how many years ago she dumped you and you didn't even bothered to ask your money back from her, people will be impressed. As for teaching her a lesson, perhaps you can prepare a speech first, since she had come back to you once, there's a good chance she will want to get to with you again since her present bf is jobless and is unable to sustain her spending habit.<br><br>Patient my friend.

Or you trust her enough for that...<br><br>Be prepared to SUCK THUMB if she doesn't wanna pay you back... You can try asking... But ultimately it'll be DIFFICULT to trace back....</div>
