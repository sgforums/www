              <p>Have this step-brother, he just came into Singapore from Philippines at early June, Dad, who is married to his mother, decided to put him in my small room.. Nowadays HDB already so small, I still have to share this room with this little brat.</p>
              <p>I'm writing this because I find myself to have alot of trouble trying to accept him, he can't even speak English and my Dad wants to enroll him in K2 next year, he will be 7 next year, so it will be 1 year "retain". The plan was to train him to speak in English by next year registration (If I'm not wrong, registration starts at late December?), but at this rate, this boy's going no where man. This Filipino accent is so deep rooted in him he can't even pronounce "Up" properly, how is he even going to communicate with the 6 year olds in K2? </p>
              <p>He also likes to ask me for my iPod touch, think I can safely say it's mine since it was my birthday present, yeah? After he gets the iPod he will anyhow press and press, he restarted the progress of my games countless times.. And when I tell him "Don't press this and that.." he won't even understand me, then continue to press stuff randomly. </p>
              <p>At night.. He will be very noisy, jumping around and pretending to fight in the air, typical kids I know. But his standard of playing is completely different, it's extremely rough.. I have seen with my own eyes how kids in their country play, they will fight/play until one gets injured, he got 2 teeth knocked of his mouth because he was playing with his cousins and he fell. A couple of days back, I saw him playing with my younger sister (product of his mother and my Dad), he twisted her arm by grabbing on to it and turning it around his body. I immediately shouted "Stop!" but he was like Huh? Then ran off.</p>
              <p>This is probably because I hate kids but was wondering if his behaviour is actually appropriate for a 6 year old? I often comfort myself that I was this way before, and he grew up without a father until my Dad adopted him, but it's really frustrating to see my peaceful home turn into Philippines, his Mother likes to travel to and fro Philippines and bring back relatives, and obviously, one trip costs more than $600 and with another kid to bring around, definitely would cost a bomb. But my Dad never says anything, my elder sister and I have never travelled this much when we were young before he married to her, because he says it's so expensive but now taking the plane is as common as taking bus.. Surely my Dad has financial problems right..? (We are not wealthy at all)</p>
              <p>Was wondering if it is actually pointless to bring this boy in and turn him into PR because he definitely won't be accepted locally with this anti-FT thing going around now a days!</p>

              <p>if he turns out well, with support from his family, learn to adapt, study well, lose his accent by teens, his life will turn out well. </p>

              <p>Your father got no money, yet still want to act hero... At the expense of his own family..But not uncommon lah. There's a lot of men who leave good family only to start a shittier life with someone else...like they just need to punish themselves or something. Weird stuff.</p>
              <p>Your step brother probably has some form of ADHD, I've seen kids like this before.. Hyperactive and duestructive. When they act up, u see blanks in their eyes, like their body is doing stuff, but their brain is not connected.. Send him to a child psychiatrist, there's meds..usually they start giving to children after 5 years old. </p>
              <p>Where is his biological dad ? Is he a drug addict ? Does he has some mental problem? Your step brother may have inherited some problem from his father side.</p>
              <p>As for you, I suggest u request politely from your father to rent a place elsewhere. Tell him u need some personal space now that the house is too small. Or.. Where is your mother, can u go stay with her instead ? </p>
              <p>Personally, I'd rather rent elsewhere.. Better your father spend money on your lodging then let your step mom splurge on air fare.</p>

              <p>Half brother means he is blood related. Example, Father have kid with another woman ( not your mom). Doesn't matter if he has the kid while still married to your mother, or not.</p>
              <p>Step brother means, no blood relation. Marriage based. Example your mother marry another guy and his kid from previous marriage is your step brother.  If the man not married to your mother, then the kid is not your step brother.</p>
              <p>Ok? Good.</p>

              <p>May I ask? Why did your father marry a filipino? Btw, are u
              indian, chinese or malay? </p>
              <p>For me i dont like to share my things, and bringing a foreigner
              into my house is considered invasion of privacy. Its really up to
              you though. If u really like the boy, you'll teach him if not just
              heck care. Is this all ur dad's fault!?</p>

              <p>I have no answer to the first question, he just told my sister and I one night "Kids, Daddy is going to remarry *Shows picture* this is her, any objection?" We were very young then, I was probably Primary 5-6 so I never thought this would happen.. I am full Chinese.</p>
              <p>Yeah, the feeling of bringing a foreigner in your home is really terrible. There was one night, my Dad was overseas, my Step Mom, my Elder sis and Younger sis all at home. Then she brought all her friends over to have dinner, around 7-8 Filipinos in my living room. I don't even have space to eat in the dining table, in my room can hear the Tagalog flooding everywhere.. Like a little Philippines village.</p>
