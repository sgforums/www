              <p>haven't actually known personally any non chinese singaporean marrying a filipino</p>
              <p>how did your dad met her anyway?</p>
              <p>but the friends over thingy seems common? my filipino friends and colleagues like doing that as well quite often. they're rather friendly with each other.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and like someone else said, you should learn a little tagalog. maybe not for the same purposes. they'll like you better and things'll get easier for both sides</p>

              <p>Want babysitting, get a baby sitter, want maid service pay a maid . Want to cheapskate, the women will eventually make the men pay one way or another. There is no free lunch in this world. Men don't pay, they will make his children pay. </p>

              As long as his father legally married the pinay. This pinay is the wife. As wife  if he dies she is legally entitled to half his estate  And the remaining  divided equally by his children (her's included again) This is in the case of no will in existence. If there is  a will, it depends on how his father wills it. Where HDB flat is concerned .  if the father has included his new wife as  the joint owner( ie a joint tenancy ownership) , then upon his death, the house goes to his  "wife" automatically - The children gets ZERO!
              
              If this guy is smart, he will tell his fathe to include his name as well a shis  orginal siblings name's as joint -tenants in the  HDB flat so that  this  so calledPinay step mother" cannot lay her hands on the flat. And also he cannot move out of the flat to keep hi sstatus as  co-owner there.

              <p>Dont be foolish lah. Fight over the inheritance for what. You will be just as greedy as that foreign wife.</p>

Since his dick has voted in favor of handing over his assets to that new wife in return for use of her pussy, you fight also useless lah. They want to take , let them take.</p>
              <p>As long as your father is paying for your education, take advantage of the opportunity to ensure the future you earn a very decent income, so you will not need for your father's assets.. by the time he divy up everything he has after his retirement.. there won't be much left over anyway lah.</p>
              <p>That foreign stepmother want to despo money, then let her go despo, she will have to take care of your father in his old age.. all you need to do is make sure you are financially stable and take care of your mother lah.</p>
              <p>Work hard, study hard and be better. If you slack, that stepmom will see you no up, and she will have good reason to cut you off.</p>

              <p>When I was studying I met this Pinoy administrator lady married to a local. She is very unfriendly and give us students the black face. No doubt she does her job but when she talks to us, she is very on the surface level. Her predecessor was more friendlier and down to earth.</p>
              <p>So Mr TMarcus may have a very big problem in his hand because Pinoy women are not stupid, they know what they want ! Inheritance could be a big problem.</p>
              <p>Tmarcus have two choices - make alliance with Pinoy stepmom. Gain her favor. 50% chance that Pinoy stepmom would accept him. Or the other 50%, Pinoy mom favor her kids more and see her step kids as the threat.</p>
              <p>Or fight all the way to the end.</p>

And when those ppl come over, just come out, say hi, and when you walk past them etc u go toilet or what…just smile at them :D just hope they aren’t the arrogant pinoys????</span></p>

Then for some fool reason the girl decided to unfriend me, turned the male pinoy and the other foreign workers in that co. against me and my friend. They even started to bully us. From this, I really really really dislike arrogant pinoys. I’m ok with most of them so long as they don’t show attitude. But ever since then, I’m wary of any foreigners.</span></p>

              will be just as greedy as that foreign wife.</p>
              <p>Your father assets he earned it himself, he is not obligated to
              give everything to his offsprings.. if he desire he can will every
              penny to charity. Since his dick has voted in favor of handing over
              his assets to that new wife in return for use of her pussy, you
              fight also useless lah. They want to take , let them take.</p>
              <p>As long as your father is paying for your education, take
              advantage of the opportunity to ensure the future you earn a very
              decent income, so you will not need for your father's assets.. by
              the time he divy up everything he has after his retirement.. there
              won't be much left over anyway lah.</p>
              <p>That foreign stepmother want to despo money, then let her go
              despo, she will have to take care of your father in his old age..
              all you need to do is make sure you are financially stable and take
              care of your mother lah.</p>
              <p>Work hard, study hard and be better. If you slack, that stepmom
              will see you no up, and she will have good reason to cut you
              off.</p>

              Sorry to tell you this one hor  you wrong. I already made enquires . If  hs nam eand his siblings name in the HDB flat - step mum cannot chuck them out . In fact if  she is wife of fathe r  but her name not in flat she has  no claim on his flat which he originally bought with his deceased wife and churen. As longas if Pinay step mom name not in the falt - it is still better than if Pinay step mom name in the flat. simple as that lah!

              <p>I was chatting with another old chap couple of days back.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>he invited his son in law to stay with him but the relationship turned sour, so he decided to move out.</p>
              <p>reason being when he was younger he never thought about what the future's gonna be like and decided to put his daughter's name as co owner thinking one day it's going to be hers anyway,(she paid her share to him of course) she was not married then.</p>
              <p>when the relationship turned sour(quite sour from his description), he thought he might as well move out since the son in law don't look like he's gonna offer to move out, he don't feel like chasing him out and spoiling his relationship with his daughter, so he might as well just sell it and cash in for retirement funds. his daughter and son in law decided to buy his share from him.</p>
              <p>can't recall what the issue was but he apparently purchased more than once from HDB so he can't do HDB again, he can't afford current rates of $400,000 for the same thing on resale market. so he's in one of those studio 30 yr flats now.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I think I've heard quite a few transfering co owners names leading to a bad end sort of stories.</p>
