              <p>OK, i am an introverted n shy person. hardly have any friends. always a loner, stay at home.</p>
              <p>never really been on a real date before. so i go dating website look for date. but of all the girls i chat or message, never reply one. why so like that one? i think because that stupid website got too many guys liao...too many competition n spoil my market. worst is those handsome n rich n sweet-talking guys...i lose out to them.</p>
              <p>then chatted with one girl on the website chat, who agreed to go out with me.</p>
              <p>so i borrow my mama's car, because must impress girl with car right?</p>
              <p>she dont want to give me her number or email msn, so on that day 10 feb she msg me by internet sms to meet her at her block downstair.</p>
              <p>so i drive my mama's car (hehe feel so happy), to meet her, a beautiful girl, n i suggest go to chinatown to see the CNY festive bazaar, but she dun want, coz she say she hate the place becoz very squeezy n hot.</p>
              <p>so after pick her up i suggest go bibocity, n she say why not drive inside sentosa? so go there, eat at a cafe called Taste of Singapore (some high priced local hawker food with beautiful presentation in restaurant setting, obviously catered to tourists).</p>
              <p>Then drive around sentosa, walk around n enjoy the night life n look at the RWS entrance.</p>
              <p>then go siloso beach n watch a laser projection show, then walk walk along beach, sit down talk talk, then drive around town n go to a quiet cafe to eat n chat till midnight.</p>
              <p>then i told her i m leaving for holiday to japan during CNY. when i came back on the 18th, i log into website, never seen her online.</p>
              <p>until today leh, i always otaku at home, hoping to see her online on the website chat box, so i can chat with her. but never see her on the website leh. n i she never give me her number or email or facebook, so theres no way i can contact her.</p>
              <p>so now i feel sad, why for 4 days no contact me? i bought some gifts for her from japan...want to give her one.... i hope she make a contact with me...at least an internet sms (pray she never lost my no.), or i hope she log into the dating website so i can chat with her (pray she did not forget her log in ID or password to the site)</p>
              <p>so today i feel emo n sad leh. i think i like that girl. i hope there will be a 2nd date for us.</p>

              <p>why you neber ask her real contact when you are in Sentosa ?</p>
              <p>Why so you go tell her you go Japan for CNY ?</p>
              <p>CNY is a beri sensitive time period for a couple ok ? You choose to vanish/disappear during this timing.. her alarm bell start ringing.</p>

              <p>If she is meant to be yours, she will try to make herself available to you one way or another. If she wants to go all out to avoid you in every way possible, there is nothing much you can do about it. But if you want to be optimistic, maybe she has been busy of late? Either case, take this as a lesson learnt. If being yourself doesn't leave a long &amp; lasting impression on her, maybe she doesn't see you as her type and in turn, may not be your type too. And one more thing, have more confidence in yourself.</p>
