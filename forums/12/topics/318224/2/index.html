              <p>Married men said miss you??? You don't even have to ask stupid question here. You should have done the following already :-</p>
              <p>1) Shout at him in the face in front of everyone and said 'Bu yau lian! Married still trying to chase other girls.</p>
              <p>2) Telephone the wife and tell her the husband is in the seven year itch phase! Then sit back and watch the fun</p>
              <p>3) At most you run far far away from him not come here ask stupid question like this UNLESS YOU also itchy 'hiao' because you interested in him too!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>

              <p>1) Confront him!</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> <span style="font-size: 10pt;">Where does the fault starts? From reasoning
              or behaviour? </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Can we safely say that one is guilty of
              'sinning in love', even if infidelity does not manifest into behaviour?</span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I am not commenting the above idea along with
              the logic of 'One must see fire before one understands the destruction of a
              conflagration' - but rather, if a fire is sure to occur, there's little you can
              do to stop it. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In simple: you might be interested to know
              what's going on between your man and his colleague, but I think prior to that,
              it's equally important to understand where did the inflection first begin that
              led him astray potentially. Evolutionary Psychologist would have claim that
              monogamy is against the instinct of man and it's part of the Natural Selection
              to spread his seeds - but that's only if human are without cognition and a
              spiritual soul, as the latter is extremely crucial in our development in Love. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">I think we all must come to an understanding
              that we cannot stop people from leaving or becoming unfaithful if that is what
              someone desired. Love and marriage is bounded by freewill - even transcendental
              beings are powerless to meddle against the freewill in Love. Therefore, if this
              very freewill is geared towards committing transgression, unless components of
              the source is evolved, if not the consequences are often dire. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Because I do not know your man, neither does
              your relationship - it's almost impossible to make accurate assessment as you
              ain't clear yourself. Knowing this, I say, take some ample time to understand
              your entire issue first. Avoid jumping into conclusion, thinking that your man
              is promiscuous. There might be suggestions, but there are many dimensions to
              unfaithfulness and some of these might not be intrinsically motivated (which
              means that a marriage is still potentially salvageable, for as long as certain
              components of the push factors is resolved). </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">P.S: Before I end my post, I just like to
              say: please do not dismiss divorce from your option totally. I am not encouraging
              you to consider this ultimatum, but rather, you still must allow yourself this
              option IF development of your situation becomes irrevocably putrid. Nobody
              should suffer abuse, neglect or helplessness over a vast period of time,
              without any viable mode to change their circumstances. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">You don't have to use it, but you must be
              able to find it when you need it. </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">This is what I am advocating. </span><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"> </span></p>
              <p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Cheers</span></p>

              <p>Woah there fellas, what's with the runaway train? I may sound a little naive in this world where apparently pessimism is equal to realism but are we not going a little far with no information? No context?</p>
              <p>the literal words 'i miss you' are nothing... I miss my mates back home and some of them are girls, does that mean I miss them the same as I miss my fiancee and she should be worried? hell no, but i still miss them... not even remotely in the same league as how i miss my fiancee when she's away but the words are the same.</p>
              <p>I get the feeling you might have added the dark corner bit... all the same Kris would probably know I was missing someone long before even i did... maybe if he's hiding it from you you have a right to be a bit upset but unless you have reason to be suspicious above that and he's always been good and faithful to you in the past it'd be foolish to assume anything just from that - especially as he knows you can get sensitive about that stuff. It <i>is</i> possible to be just friends with a member of the opposite sex... I really think talking about divorce from this with no more context or info is going just a little bit overboard guys... the more you push something the more it tends to become true... what happened to benefit of the doubt and innocent until proven guilty? surely they extend to someone you love and trust enough to marry in the first place? if it turns out his intentions are bad, sure, skin him alive, but don't declare war over a few pipes that <i>could</i> be used in nuclear weapons... we all know how it ends - everyone gets hurt and noone wins.</p>

              extend to someone you love and trust enough to marry in the first
              place? if it turns out his intentions are bad, sure, skin him
              alive, but don't declare war over a few pipes that <em>could</em> be
              used in nuclear weapons... we all know how it ends - everyone gets
              hurt and noone wins.</p>

              <p>A joke??? U must be joking?? what to do?? sometime we gals have to ask ourselves, aren't we killing our own gender by snatching and loving or playing with married men?? If that gal know that he is married, why she still go with him???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I mean we can blame it on men lustfullness and unfaithfulness, but i choose to blame we gals ourselves for going after or being together with a married man. Aren't we hurting our own sisterhood??</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>There are many virgin, young, handsome and single guys in sg, why go for married old uncles??? scratch my head???</p>

              To TS,
              
              Just get ready your SOP lar.
              
              1) If you husband really have sex if another gal, what will you do?
              
              a) divorce ?
              b) kill him?
              c) forgive him if he is sorry?
              
              Sick and tired of hearing repeat stories of wives worried about their husband got another girl or not and in the end when the husband are caught in bed, the wives will still forgive them for straying.
              
              Why do you even  have to think so much when you already decided to forgive him when he say sorry because of your daughter?
