            <div class='col-md body'>Hi life^stop,<br><br>I am in the same shoe as you three years ago. That was why I feel that it's time for me to tell you how you are actually feeling subsconsciously in your heart.<br><br>In my opinion, you does not love or like the girl. You do not even have the basic care for her. I apologise if I am too harse but that is exactly how I feel. You only love yourself. You only think of how you are feeling instead of being in her shoe. You have expectations in her and if she cannot meet your expectations, you blame her. Does this consider love or care? I really doubt so.<br><br>Do you expect her to be always around waiting for your sms 24 hours everyday? What do you expect her to do? Instead of blaming her, why don't you understand her? Remember that you are just her friend. Even if you are her bf, she will feel pressurised by your behaviour. It is clear cut that she just wan to be a normal friend with you. Nobody knows what will happen in the future but at least for now, she just want to be your normal friend. But you still keep on expecting more from her until she feel that she cannot take it anymore.<br><br>I can understand how you are feeling but I feel that you should grow up and be more matured in handling your emotions. Instead of letting your emotions overcome your logical thoughts, please be more understanding.<br><br>From your previous message, I see that you have watched "My Sassy Girl". But do you really understand the message behind it?<br>It is not just "Fate" or "Destined to be". It shows how a guy loves a girl unconditionally without any expectations. The girl tell him to wait for two years at the tree and even after the two years, the girl did not appear. But yet the guy did not blame her. He can understand her feelings and continue to look for her. Did he ever expect anything from her like what you do? The answer is a straight "NO".<br>Did he blame her for not contacting him over the years, the answer is also "NO". This is what I called love and true care. Even if they are just very good friends, this is what a good friend should do.<br><br>At least as a friend, you shouldn't expect her to reciprocate to your feelings if she doesn't feel the same way as you do. Give her time and stand by her whenver she needs you. Of course unconditionally if you really care for her.<br></div>

The answer is a straight "NO".<br>Did he blame her for not contacting him over the years, the answer is also "NO". This is what I called love and true care. Even if they are just very good friends, this is what a good friend should do.<br><br>At least as a friend, you shouldn't expect her to reciprocate to your feelings if she doesn't feel the same way as you do. Give her time and stand by her whenver she needs you. Of course unconditionally if you really care for her.<br></div></blockquote>Won't you feel stupid if you waited two years at the tree? Is the guy in the story that blind?<br><br>Another thing is that life^stop don't even have chance to be her casual friend...let alone, quoting your words, "stand by her"...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi Doenitz,<br><br>Everybody have different perspective and interpretations of a good friend.

"Y am i such a failure that i cant get any gers?"  several ppl say i am a good guy, looks decent too but y i cant get any gers?<br><br>well i do not learn still. and found another new crush. but from the first meeting with her, i share my ideals and what kind a person i am. and her response was ultimately negative. that night i walked home from the interchange alone at midnight.<br><br>i decided to get myself away from all these stuffs, all these bgr problems and to make myself better, stronger and more ready so that there would be mutual attraction between me and gers then just one sided love like all the stuff i had gone thr.<br><br>SO LIFE^STOP, UR LIFE DOESNT STOP HERE. SHE IS HERE TO MAKE U STRONGER, MAKE U REALISE THERE IS NO ABSOLUTE IN THIS WORLD. WAKE UP FROM UR DEPRESSION AND THINK NO MORE OF HER.<br><br>another exp, another ger i declared my feelings for her, but she dislike me and begin to avoid me like i was a plague. think i was too insistent then. i asked her to me my gf twice and she reject me flat. and she send me an sms "Dont bother me anymore, sure there are more better gers then me."my world fell then. but i braced up and maintain my composure. i didnt contact her since. it is not like my survival depends on her.<br><br>so life^stop, i bet u got better things to do. hang out with frens, work out. gers are not everything in ur life, u will find better ones one day. but in order to be with them, u must be strong and be a man not a boy.</div>
