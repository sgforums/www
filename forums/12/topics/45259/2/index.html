She's the best?? OH man.. I bet there are much more girls out there better than her.. Someone who kNOES how to appreciate you AT LEAST!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You cared for her... But that doesn't mean that you have to buy her things buy her breakfast etc etc... All this are jus your doings and being ZHI ZHOU DUO QING!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Why spend so much money on a preson who doesn't appreciate you AT ALL?? I don't see a point on spending money on girls jus to get her or to show your care and concern.. YOu told her that you like her.. This is a wrong move!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>YOu know her only for 2-3 months.. how well can you know from her during these time?? The most is only the outer shell of her.. How far can you proceed now?? Zero! Do she likes you also? If NO, then why in the first place you confess to her.. You scared her give her a shocked..  SOme girls feel proud when she knows someone is chasing her.. and then they will make use of that guy.. but some girls know liao.. they will back off.. cos they know they don't like that guy.. and All she treated you is jus a friend...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You buy her gifts and treat her eat.. which girl wont reject.. cos someone is there to pay everything for them.. and the worst thing is YOU aint HER BF... ANd there she can get all these from you..  YOu Arent an ATM!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>At the beginning, she still can talk to you.. chat with you.. cos she's feels that is ok.. But as time goes by.. she feels that you are beginning to fall deep into this.. and knows that your feelings for her are strong.. The more you keep pushing her and doing things for her.. the more she wanna avoid you..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You treat like a friend but what's your motive and actions done doesn't seems like jus a friend to her.. For a guy who the girl doesn't even have a slightly feeling for him.. the more you keep on pestering her sms her.. ask her out buy things.. she will feel very irritated.. and then in the end.. she will stop replying your messages.. if you call.. she give excuses.. like what she did.. She said she'll get back to you later.. But what did you found out?? She went to bed...   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mad.gif" alt="Mad" title="Mad"><br><br>Its a sign for you to ask you to back off a little while.. And if she really doesnt have any feelings for you.. then jus let it be.. Feeling this kind of thing.. is very hard to say.. it comes naturally.. You can force anyone to love you in return!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>If she doens't appreciate what you have done.. then MOVE ON! Why still hang yourself in the air?? Crying?? Come on.. This is not goin to help you anyway..   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Get up go get somethings to do.. carry on with your life.. make yourself occupied.. DOn't wonder that she's the only one in this world.. YOur social life and love circle.. doesn't only CIRCULATE around her..!! YOu have better more things to do than ONLY HER!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>Give yourself some time.. and give her sometime too... DO some soul-searching for yourself.. and see if this girl is worth wat you've done! MEanwhile if you really wan to be her friend.. Jus treat her normallly as what you treat to other ppl.. Don't always put all your attention to her ONLY!! ANd another point - Girls are very sensitive over such things.. Try not to always call her and out of sudden jus buy a gift for her.. unless is special occasions.. Not as an when you like!   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Btw how old is she??  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I'm sorry...just thinking of her is so painful already... my first post here..hope maybe anyone can listen <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote>Firstly: As long as she is NOT your girlfriend, she has all the right to treat the way she wants, unless she con your money, beat you up, etc.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You only known her for 2 - 3 months, fallen for her, and started the chase. Express yourself, and she seemed disinterested even though you shower your love and concern as if she is the only girl you ever gonna love this lifetime.......<br><br>What's the use of doing things you know it doesn't do you any good? What's the use of people who doesn't appreciate what you are doing?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You wanna seek for that kind of girl who will return that kind of attention and appreciation to you - obviously she is not that kind of girl. When speaking to her, she sounded bored - such a strong hint that she isn't interested in you.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>In love - nothing is absolute. As long as you acknowledge a certain degree of liking within yourself and intiated the chase - there is always a risk of failing - this risk calulated by external evironmental factor, your personality, physical looks, etc - which will give rise to either a high risk or a low risk.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>So you can't demand her to treat you the way you want regardless of how simple and small isn't it? Love comes willingly, and for the non-willings - it never works.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>P.S: Liking someone who is not interested in you is still the only surface 'injury' to the heart - seek someone who appreciate you, and you will discover that love isn't just one-sided and you will be well-rewarded.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Life^stop.. i'll share my experience about this.. last time.. i fell in love with girl A.. i was really in love with her.. ask her to go out.. but she always refused.. i bought her b'day present.. bought her dinner and sent it to her house.. and give another gift.. but she still didn't want to go out with me.. until one day.. she sms me said that please don't bother her again.. (btw: we've been friends for 4 years).. at that time.. i really feel shock... finally.. i make up my mind not to contact her... end of story..<br><br>2 years ago.. i met with girl B.. i oso really felt in love with her.. i'll do anything for her at that time.. she always wanted to go out with me.. i asked her out for dinner in fancy restaurants... ask her to go to church.. and give much attention to her family.. i remembered that time 2 o'clock her dog was sick... i drove to her house..then driving like crazy to find veterinarian.. we've been doing this almost 1.5 years.. we always went out together (me and her).. to cut the story short.. i've done lots of things for her... about 6 months ago.. she was trying to go out with one of my best friend.. and now.. she become my best friend's gf...<br><br>if you were me.. which one will u choose? girl A or girl B..<br>frankly.. I really appreciate girl A decision.. because with that.. she didn't waste my time.. my money.. my attention..<br><br>be grateful that currently she didn't make a response to you.. before u fell into deep sea of love <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"><br><br>i knew how it feels.. but trust me.. as time passes by.. you'll forget about her...<br></div>
