            <div class='col-md body'>The mistakes you made at the "strategic" level<br><br>Confessing too soon<br><br>This is the biggest mistake you made.Are you new to the Game?You should have built up a firm foundation of friendship first before even thinking of confessing your feelings to her.The crux of any relationship is friendship.You need to be very close friends first before anything else could happen.Sure,there are couples who get attached within one or two months or even a few days of getting acquainted,but  personally,I think such relationships are built on a weak foundation as the friendship element is not there yet.It is not possible for the two of them to understand each other very well within such a short duration.I feel that such relationships happen because of physical attraction.As time goes by,one of them even both might  feel that maybe the other half is not what he/she initially makes him/her out to be and thus the relationship encounters some problems with its attendant heartbreaks,tears shed etc etc...So next time,if you feel that you are attracted to another gal again,keep it cool.Do not reveal your feelings yet.The thing is if you confess too soon and it is not mutual,it is going to be very difficult even to be platonice friends because of the awkwardness.I think that is the reason why she gives you the cold shoulder nowadays.Play it cool,keep quiet,establish a close friendship with her,in the meantime,you can gauge whether she might be an ideal partner.You can also find out whether there is a chance that she might want to be more than close friends with you by the hints gals like to drop from time to time.Critics of this assertion of mine will argue that you will feel worse after being friends with her for a number of years and being rejected after "waiting" for a number of years.My counter argument would be:during this period of time,keep your expectations low and always keep your options open.Have this mentality of "hoping for the best while always prepared for the worst." It will stand you in good stead.Even if she rejects you eventually,you two can still be friends,you can still meet up with her as the friendship element is already there.At least that is better than what you are experiencing now,right?<br><br>Giving her too much attention<br><br>You buy gifts for her.It is quite obvious to her what are your intentions even if you do not confess.Brother,I do not know what kind of gifts you bought for her so far,but I have to say that you have wasted your money.You have heard of the saying "Nice guys finish last." That is only partially false.There is a grain of truth in that but there are also limitations.You know why? I think you adheresto the idea that we guys should always be very nice to gals,we should pamper them always.You are dead wrong.By always pampering her,you are not winning her heart,but after a while,she might start to take you for granted and treats you as a non-seasonal Santa Claus.I feel that you have come on too strongly on her by showering her with excess attention.That,I think,has turned her off.Sure,be nice to gals,but never to the extent that you become a yes-men who says yes/agrees to everything she says.Like this,you become too predictable.Gals like guys with backbone and a sense of mystery around them! So do not be too enthusiastic.Keep aloof from time to time.By the way,what have you bought for her so far?<br><br>I think my comments make a lot of sense.nevertheless,I do not,repeat,do not claim to be the final authority on such matters,in fact I am still learning as I go along-education is a lifelong process!<br><br>Dear Friend,I truly can feel your pain.I am not you,but I just want to tell you that I share your pain.I have been through such nonsense before.It is like the whole world collapsing around you.The sky is so dark.It is like having nothing to look forward to tomorrow when you wake up. Your heart is as heavy as lead now and every step you take is hard and laboured.Right? As i said,I have been through trying times before.That time,when I discovered that my crush got attached,I did not mutter a single word for two days It was that bleak.My advice to you is to take a short break.Do not contact her for say,two weeks? In this two weeks,do things you like and avoid anything that is associated with her.Best is to do strenous exercise,you will forget about her! Keep your mind occupied!<br><br>I give you a few inspirational quotes,hope they will alleviate your pain.<br><br>"You gotta keep breathin' coz tomorrow the sun'll rise and who knows what the tide could bring." -Chuck Noland(Tom Hanks) in Cast Away<br><br>"There are places in this world that are'nt made up of stone...There's something inside...something they can't get to,can't touch,it's yours..."

I'm sorry...just thinking of her is so painful already... my first post here..hope maybe anyone can listen <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_cry.gif" alt="Crying or Very sad" title="Crying or Very sad"> </div></blockquote>'best thing you ever known' dun make you cry. the 'best thing i ever known' in my life doesnt make me cry. How can someone who dun  show you love and make you cry be the 'best thing you ever known'?<br><br>DUn just look for THE best, you wil end up hurt and defeated.  Just look for whats best for you and remember the best for you love you  and will not make you cry  out of sadness.</div>

If she like you or prefers your company then at least she would respond. Otherwise at the end of the day only one lugi is you.

            <div class='col-md body'>hi...was reading all the postings. Tink everyone said alot to encourage u here.<br><br>There are many types of gers in this world. Think guys can be bad....gers can do the same too esp. the century we leave in. Gifts and concern are your appreciation to her but perhaps she was never ready for this special attention. Really, you ought to "love" and "respect" yourself more....cos at the end of the day, ppl will not turn away from you. Only a person who's at heart a happy person can in turn make another happy.<br><br>Carry yourself with more dignity. You have not committed to her in anyway more than what u have done yet. It's time to stop.<br><br>She could have make herself clearer with you but perhaps she does not know how. She thinks by driving you away with her actions, that should be good enough. Let her be. U have the courage to own up to how u feel but she does not, how could she be the best thing that ever happened to u?<br><br>Take care ya.......listen, dun think of what u do for her anymore or how she's treating u. Take it that you tried but was never meant to be. Better than not makin effort at all, rite?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>When love is deep in the heart, there are no regrets. it's all must have happened for good reason..when it is time for you to part, there will be tears to shed, and memories to share....  it's best for u to learn from your experiences...maybe God wants you to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one so that when you finally meet the right person, you will know how to be grateful for that gift..... think about it deeply... :p</div>

I'm in a situation almost the same as u, the ger i like is treating me cold and hot.... I'm very confused right now. For ur case think its pretty obvious that she dun have any feelings for u. At least u can withdraw right now whereas i'm in the middle of a cross junction, dun know which direction to go. It easier to say than done but since u r enlisting for national service soon, think its a very good opportunity for u to forget abt her.. In the mean time, go out and enjoy life...</div>
