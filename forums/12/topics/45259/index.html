The things that u described about how you think she treated you is quite disturbing.....what do you actually like about her when you know that she treats you like that? Do you actually prefer to like someone who doesn't care a hoot about you? I don't know.....maybe she has some qualities which attracts you and you could say it out? Good luck.</div>

I know this feeling...kinda sucky rite when u feel tat u are not treated appropriately. 1 lesson I definitely learnt was tat dun get ur expectations too high and if u wanna give, do not expect ppl to reciprocate. And if they really do, den treat it as a bonus.</div>
