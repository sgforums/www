            <div class='col-md body'>keep ur options open still... give her time and dun bug her too much... not being her bf yet simply means that u need to back off the gas a little so as to let her take time to absorb whatever care and concern u provide... dun hold too high hopes but do take appropriate action as and when u think it's suitable... dun over do stuff, u might freak her out...<br><br>there's nothing wrong telling her that u have feelings for her, judging by how she reacted, it seems that she's lost herself... cause she may be thinking that she might have sent out signals in the wrong direction to u... so communication frequency's compromised... i'd been snubbed a few times too...<br><br>dun feel down... if u're blur bout things urself, who can be clearer? emotions will soon mild itself... dun think too much, things are not as difficult as u think they are...<br><br>worst case, if really u 2 cannot be a couple in time to come, do remain as friends still... do talk with her or write her a letter or email her to sort things out... sometimes it's better off to be friends... crap around and stuff...<br><br>all the best dude!!</div>
