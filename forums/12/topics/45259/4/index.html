Might as well start training for it.Exercise can help you forget your worries.<br><br>Reading through all your posts again reminds me of my experience.We were doing fine as friends initially and I was very happy with that,did not expect any thing else.Then she had a new boyfriend,started working and things changed completely.Before she got attached,we met up once in a while  say once every 2-3 weeks to have coffee or watch movies and that was one of the most happy phases in my life.We could get along fine,can talk about our lives and stuff like that.But after she got attached,she said that her boyfriend did not like the idea of us seeing each other thus I have not seen her since 18 July 2002.Not long after that,I went overseas for four months.While I was not in Singapore,I sent her something nice with her and her boyfriend's names on it via mail.Check this out.<a href="http://www.namesonart.ca/Frames.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.namesonart.ca/Frames.htm</a> The total cost of that gift added up to S$70+-the most expensive gift I bought for anyone. After I sent it,the first thing I do in the morning was to check my email,hoping to receive an email from her,saying "Thanks,I've received your present." And everyday,there was no reply from her.By the way,I sent a similar gift to my godsister and she took the initiative to tell me that she had received the parcel,but not my crush.So a few days later,I sent an overseas SMS to her asking her about it. She said she received it A WHILE AGO etc etc...<br><br>That was the turning point.From then on,my feelings for her gradually dissipated.Of course,I felt hurt by the way she treated me as a complete non-entity.I felt heartbroken that she sort of acted as if I had an obligation to send her something,the way she did not notify me when she received the parcel.My friends said that it is basic courtesy to at least just acknowledge that you have received the present.How would you people feel if you were in my shoes?Anyway,that is water under the bridge now.I am doing fine.I have learnt from that experience many things.Ultimately,it is her loss.My friend said that if you can think that way,you will feel much better.<br><br>Hmmm...I might try asking her out for coffee again come July.No harm trying. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br></div>
