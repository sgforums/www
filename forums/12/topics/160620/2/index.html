Most people, who claim to wait for someone, often practice this what I call 'looking for the horse while riding the donkey'. If Love had you SO 'devoted'... so deep till you are 'left with no choice' but to wait... you will probably spent the rest of your life waiting this for meaningless someone and missed out opportunity on other potential partners. The TRUE form of waiting; is just to wait placidly until something happen. But the fact is that ultimately, these people moved on, with time, because they discovered it was impossible from the start.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>You THINK he/she is the one for you... do you think you are the ONE for him/her?</strong></span><br><br>Don't kid yourself - to wait for someone has NOTHING to do with loyalty and since it has nothing to do with it, what is so touching about people waiting aimlessly? Loyalty and devotion only applies to people who are <span style="text-decoration: underline;">IN A RELATIONSHIP</span>... for anything else, it is foolishness and unacceptance.<br><br>I used to have people who swore to wait by me... for their own emotional agenda. I knew it was baseless and told them please don't make such comments, but they insisted in their own emotional ways. I laugh... not thinking that they are stupid, but rather, intrigued by how Love works.<br><br>These people are currently in their own relationship, revelling in bliss happiness. And obviously, I am happy for them to be able to exercise those loyalty in their current relationship instead of someone like me.<br><br>If you see devotion as a good characteristic, shouldn't you spent those precious quality on someone that is WORTH your devotion and not cover them up with a white lie by claiming that you are simply waiting and equates that to devotion.<br><br>These self-gratifying thoughts are merely tools to remain you in waiting list.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

Or did you just plainly wait and wait and wait in silence?<br>If you had done something to persue your happiness, even if you fail in the end, think you should be able to tell yourself you've done your best to woo that person. Time doesn't matter in this situation then cause you never waste time.<br>But if you just sit there and wait and wait without doing anything, even if you wait for your whole life, then you'll just be a silly idiot who isn't moving forward.<br><br>No matter if you are the one waiting for others or others waiting for you, sometimes it's just not the right time to have the answer and the only way to have an answer is to move forward in life. If you don't have your answer now, move on. Waiting on the same spot won't change anything.<br><br>Example, there's a treasure chest 100m right in front and there are others in search for it. You saw it but you refuse to move an inch forward. Do you think the chest will move to you just because you are the one who saw it first? The answer is no. Move before the others saw it. Even if the others saw it, if you move fast enough, there'll still be a chance that you'll get the chest of treasure.<br><br>Logical?<br><br>It applies to me and that's what happen when I decide to woo my gf. And she's already my gf.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>
