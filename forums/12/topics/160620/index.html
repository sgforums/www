My gf is Malaysian and she lives there while I'm Singaporean and stays in Singapore (mind yah..she's not in JB but in Trengganu which is 9hrs bus journey on a one way single trip).<br><br>Although we kinda make a point to talk on the phone everyday, but ultimately it's still not the same as being together physically whereby I can feel her, see her, hear her. I'm a normal person who has my own physical needs and the fact that I do really miss her a lot, my heart aches whenever I miss her. Sometimes I do wish that I can let myself out for some fun (anyway she won't know if I dun say), but then again, I do realised that it's not a matter whether if I allow myself to do that but rather is a fact that I don't wanna do that just because I love her.<br><br>I think I'm getting a little off track here. Bottomline is, just do what your heart tells you but never hang on to a hope that she/he will be touched by your loyality towards her/his feelings. If you are prepared to love her/him all your life, do it without expectations.   <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>to thread starter, It all depends on you whether you are able to let go, some ppl may know that they have no future with the gal they like, but nevertheless they can't bring themselves to let go, hence they wait patiently HOPING for a chance to be with the gal. however.... as we are all human, things changes, Feelings fade, or changes over time. thus, while waiting for a chance to be with the gal, somewhere along the way your own feelings may have changed and u realise you are no longer pining for the gal.<br><br>to those who talk about physical contacts, yes physical contacts are essential to a healthy relationship. what I mean is everyday physical contact, like holding hands, hugs, kisses, touching of face... if you have a gf and after 5 years you have yet to even hold her hands, then is it any different then a platonic friend? however beyond all that I have mentioned above, it is really up to the individual.<br><br>I think the tactic "if you really love me, show me by making LOVE with me" is really crap!!! If you really love a person, you'll respect her enough not to push her into anything she's not comfortable with. if you find yourself pushing and pushing you partner to be intimate with you.... then sadly, I don't think it's love, IT's LUST!!!</div>
