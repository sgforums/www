              <p>He just mentioned that he is a doctor, 'studying medicine'...when he

              <p>Like I've said, his answers are

              Firstly, doctor is only prestigious in singapore because of the very limited seats available in nus class.  And male doctors in sg automatically receive the rank of captain if they defer their service and come back and serve after graduation.
              
              Back to TS, post... there isn't very much difference in what people study at the undergraduate level in medical school no matter which country you're in.  So, yes he could be a doctor from nepal sent to sg for training, and at the same time take up some business courses so he can be promoted to registrar level in his hospital which handles some decision making and administrative work.

              <p>Nah, don't get me wrong..I am not jealous of him or something. But felt that somehow, the teacher was treating him with biasness and kept dragging the topics to be taught longer and longer...I mean we only have limited sessions.</p>
              <p>Even the teacher got a 'culture shock' and kept mentioning that he should just straight up take the examinations instead...so many times.</p>
              <p>I mean, in a class, there should be a level of equality, not a discrepancy when someone is like, obviously so much better than the others and thus, maybe indirectly distracting them a tad bit.</p>

                                      voice was too soft to be heard...but the teacher was particularly
                                      interested in him from the time he walked into the class.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But I seriously find it suspicious as to why would he take such
                                      a class that is obviously overqualified for him?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For those curious, it's a business statistics class we had and
                                      it's a simple one compared to said, a doctorate degree????</p>
              <p>His answers were pretty vague too like 'yes, degree' 'yes,
                                      medicine' 'yes, this' 'yes,that' and all the while the teacher was
                                      like showering him attention and even some sort of hinted or mouth
                                      the words for him and all he does was go 'yes, yes, yes'</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>He even answered one of the questions in a simple exercise
                                      wrongly.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I seriously find it hard to believe.</p>

              <p>Nothing suspicious about it.</p>
              <p>Nepal is a under- developed country.</p>
              <p>He probably suffers from inferiority complex when he comes to Singapore for "upgrading". Infact.. he probably feels intimidated by students like you who lives a much more sophisticated life than Nepalese.</p>
              <p>Taking a direct exam without going through the system requires a LOT of confidence.</p>
              <p>He is probably here to check out how the system works and build up more confidence .. before he attempts an exam.</p>
              <p>I am pretty sure he don't quite enjoy too much attention from the teacher.</p>
              <p>Perhaps you can befriend him.. and make him feel more at home.I'm very sure he will appreciate the kindness and the opportunity to network a little.</p>
              <p>Some classes I attend.. also has a few professionals sitting in for the lecture. Usually they just want to be left alone by the lecturer but enjoy the friendship from fellow students.</p>
              <p>Their purpose is not so much to "pick up industry knowlege", rather they want to know how classes are being conducted in our country so that they can go back to their home country to teach or influence the school structure there.</p>
              <p>Anyway.. instead of being so suspicious and resentful towards the "doc".. why don;t you befriend him and ask him personally ?</p>
              <p>Your teacher is the one that shouldn't be making such a big deal out of his nationality. If he/she is really so interested.. he/she should just approach the Nepalese doc outside lesson time.</p>

              <p>i don't think he's a those kind of conventional western doc. no offence meant, but have you seen any doc or lawyers from NUS attending private sch? no, and they never will</p>
              <p>maybe he's a traditional nepal doc or something, like our chinese sinsei</p>
