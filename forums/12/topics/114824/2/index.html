            <div class='col-md body'>A simple version to prove my hypothesis<br><br>Let us define True Love as wanting to give up everything for the other party and not wanting the other party to sacrifice himself or herself for the other since they want the other party to be happy<br><br>Assuming True Love exist and both parties have True Love for each other and believes in the other party having True Love for the other. This implies that both parties will give up everything for each other. However, this contradicts the definition of True Love as in expecting the other party to have True Love for you, you expect him to sacrifice his all for you when in actual fact the definition of True Love forbids such a sacrifice from the other party. Hence True Love is a paradox in itself and should not be expected.<br><br>Love between couples is conditional no matter what... two cannot live as cheaply as one.</div>

Since True Love or Perfect Love is intangible and non-existance, the pursue of it will render a person in pain since it is an unattainable goal.</div>
