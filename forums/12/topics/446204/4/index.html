              <p>I suspect there must be something you didn't do right... It can't be your looks because they already willing to go out with you, so something must be about the way you behave or speak... The only thing I am not very happy about Singaporean girls is the materialistic mentality... personally, I don't really like Singaporean girls but my gf and ex are all Singaporeans and one thing I realize they always like to take money from me because of this or that whatever... I sometimes feel like I am buying a product rather than getting a girlfriend... but in the end 1 girl managed to pass my "tests" just so that i know when in time i become broke or what, she will still be there for me... all those who never pass my "tests", i stop contact with them ler...</p>
              <p>one thing i know... Singaporean guys are very much in demand especially overseas. because they have certain atttributes like hard working, taking care of family and stuff like that.</p>

              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>I am a guy approaching my 30s. I have been trying to find the
              right girl for me until now I have yet to find. I am not disclosing
              my race nor my nationality. All I am saying is that where I am - I
              am not progressing.</p>
              <p>1) I went after this girl at church. We went out for few dates.
              Then she said to me that she is not interested in me and we should
              be friends. So I agreed. however after I attended a church meeting.
              Her brother in law didn't like me - when I went in one of their
              meetings - he slammed the door to my face. And then the some of the
              church members became very hostile towards me. This made me
              discouraged to make my first move for fear of being flamed.</p>
              <p>2) I met this girl who work for a bank at a church camp. I got
              her phone number through the address book. I contacted her in
              effort to make conversation. Then her text messages became more and
              more longer to reply: sometime 1 day or 2 day. After 3 or 4
              calls - she never pick up. I gave up.</p>
              <p>3) I attend another church. Met this 25 year old girl. At first
              she was very nice to me. We chatted. Then she ask me out a few time
              but unluckily at the time my boss force me to work long hours. I
              had to say no. Then this other 25 year old guy at the church went
              after her. She became very show off to me and told me that she want
              this guy over me. This lady go and bargain high high price at
              me.</p>
              <p>4) I did work two years serving the church. Suddenly this lady -
              she is in her 40. She suddenly ask me out many many times. At first
              she needed my help to shift some furniture and escort her to
              church. So I gentleman escorted her. Then she became more
              aggressive started asking me out more often. Then the church people
              also wanted to match make me with her. The church leader go and
              make a meeting appointment for all church members but nobody turn
              up except this lady and me. Then she propose we go out together. I
              turn her down because it starting to make us look like a
              couple.</p>
              <p>I am not interested in lady in (4) because I am looking for a
              girl who is in her late 20s or at least early 30s - I want to start
              a family. I got many friend who marry at 35 or 36 with wife of same
              age now struggling to have babies because of the age. Anyway, I
              know this 40 year old lady for 1 year, i know I am not interested
              in her because she is very different from me. Moreover she is older
              than me. I don't want to marry somebody older than me</p>
              <p>5) I met this girl at the office. About 6 month ago. She broke
              up with her boyfriend. They had an argument and boyfriend gave her
              a blackeye. So i was so excited to make my move. I decided to chat
              more with her. At first ok. Then I decided to ask her out. Suddenly
              some co worker became very hostile at me. They started to mock me.
              She also became very unfriendly to me and treated one guy at the
              office better than me. After valentine day - she accepted that guy
              as her new boyfriend.</p>
              <p>At first I pursue her. But she kept avoiding me. She instead
              delegate one lady to distract me. This lady keep on asking me out.
              I am not interested in her. Because the lady she delegate to
              distract me - like to go night club and get drunk. She is quite a
              drunkerd.</p>
              <p>Conclusion:</p>
              <p>I am frustrated. So many years here wasted. Cannot find
              life partner. So hard to find. I go to gym and diet to make myself
              look good. I dress well. I even go and study MBA to improve my
              skills. I go and serve in the church. In the end - what do I
              have to answer for? A 40 year old spinster lady?</p>
              <p>On the other hand. My older 40 year old brother who is so
              so straight guy. He never had girlfriend before. He is so innocent.
              Apparently he was still a virgin. Then when he migrated to
              Australia - he met one ang moh lady. Within two week they became a
              couple. Within 1 year they got married. The ang moh lady even
              younger than him.</p>
              <p>I have been here for 30 years and cannot even find a girlfriend.
              This is ridiculous. Mankind have existed for over million year and
              still able to find life partner to continue the human race.
              Nowaday, woman is getting more affluent. Make it impossible to find
              life partner.</p>
              <p>I am thinking of going to Australia to find life partner. Over
              here (may not be singapore) it is getting impossible. I am not
              getting any younger.</p>
              <p>Why is it always like this:</p>
              <p>1) Why cannot find boy and girl like each other and then
              progress from there? Instead have to find girl that bargain high
              price - chase her then always get rejected.</p>
              <p>2) Why always I like the girl but the girl don't like me?
              Ironically those lady I don't like, they like me? And these lady
              who like me normally are too old (I want to find a lady who is of
              child bearing age and very important I must have chemistry).</p>

              <p>You say only...you wait la..very easy to talk. When your son

              <p>I just read TS story again. You are again jumping into
              conclusion. Did he say he went after one after another. I don't
              know. It could be that he did it in a span of 5 or 8 years. Maybe
              after this one fail. He wait 1 year and then try. You mean to tell
              me that if TS fail, then he should go to the cave and never again
              woo another girl???? I don't see your logic.</p>
              <p>Come on, Kitty. What do you expect a guy to do? We are human
              beings. We need to woo a potential life partner.</p>
              <p>We are not frogs whereby we dump our sperm into the pond and
              then expect the female to lay eggs into the pond to produce tap
              poles and then abandon the babies.</p>
              <p>We are human beings for goodness sake. Guys have to woo
              girls.</p>
              <p>You are being very unfair towards me and TS. Why you see us in
              so negative light. God teach us to love your neighbour as your love
              Thyself. Was TS unloyal to his girlfriend/wife? No because he is
              single. As long he is single he is not betraying anyone. It is
              natural for a guy to want to start a family because as he age, it
              is harder to start a family later in life due to economical
              pressure.</p>

              <p><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="icon_arrow.gif"> Using similar methodology of changing the
              'external' environment will not help very much unless you gain
              certain insights on what's inside to amend and evolve before things
              could realistically improve. Attempts made to dress well, look
              good, beef up in gym are positive improvements. However, then
              again, these are still external changes to certain extend, which
              may not be the root of issue you need to resolve to help you move
              forward.<br> <br> Then again, it's hard to understand what is require to evolve from
              within unless you know the real reason why you are constantly
              rejected (given the fact that nobody here knows you personally).
              The reality is that we will never know for sure and the only
              probable way of finding that conclusion is through deep-honest
              reflection, which may run into problems of seeing things through
              tinted lens and our individual blind spots.<br> <br> I have some points for you to think about:<br> <br> (i) You do seem to be able to secure dates; just that the deal
              falls through (somehow) after a couple of sessions. Hence, I see
              this as an interaction, chemistry and/or personality related issues
              that require 'intervention', which are in fact internal
              issues.<br> <br> (ii) Your source of dates comes from the same stream (church). Even
              though you dated different people, but the environment is largely
              the same, which means that diversity is limited. Instead of
              migration, what you could do is to expand this stream beyond that
              of church. However, this does not change point (i) raise
              above.<br> <br> It is natural for some people to be anxious, if they feel that they
              are not 'achieving' a classic lifespan development of life (e.g.
              need to have friends, need to be attached, married, have children,
              etc). It is a matter of your priority and needs at this current
              stage of life, which other people may not have any problem to begin
              with in the first place for sympathy to occur. For example, if my
              skill sets are always in demand and I am constantly employed, it's
              hard for me to understand what it feels like to be retrenched and
              unemployed because a fairly bias conclusion I <em>could</em> (not
              necessary will) make is that this person is probably 'inferior',
              thus he is eliminated by competition.<br> <br> Also, you have quite precise expectation of what you want for a
              partner, but be careful about letting these expectations govern
              your dating experience when it should be the other way round. It is
              totally anti-seductive when a woman feels that a man is constantly
              checking her out based on his expectation of what he wants because
              in this equation, there is <em>nothing</em> about the woman
              herself.<br> <br> Be aware not to transform your needs into a self absorbed imaginary
              of your own individualism. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="icon_idea.gif"><br> <br> Cheers</p>

              <p>You simply go say nasty thing without even saying it constructively. Why cannot be longwinded. Politician like Nicole Seah go out there and say thing long winded what.</p>
              <p>You seem to be the kind of person hurt by person similar to what you describe.</p>
              <p>maybe one day your son will become spinster and you become old old grandma with no grandchildren. maybe your husband will leave you and divorce you. I feel so uber good.</p>
              <p>U are worse than a granny. So nasty. Only know how to flame. SO uneducated like gendanken. What is wrong? I like to be whinny. A lot of people are whinny. Lee Kuan Yew is whinny and he can win control of singapore and develop the country. Not like you, total uber loser.</p>
              <p>What is wrong with being eager to try to find life partner? You see as if it is despo. You are so hypocrite. You expect the guy to sit down there and do nothing? Ridiculous. I hope one day, whoever who is with you will leave you. Because you are so intolerable, so ridiculous and so lack of understanding. You call yourself kitty but you are a monster. You have so little understanding. I suppose you are very verbally abusive. You are a lousy mother. You most likely verbally abuse your kids. Because if you can say such stupid things, means you have bad character flaw and you make a lousy mother, wife, woman, whatever.</p>

              <p>Who said anything about a lesson?  The ability to learn is a sign of intelligence - thus far you have demonstrated none (remember sni<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>p</strong></span>e?), so providing you with a lesson is a fool's errand.  Remember, you're the fool, so you might want to waste your time trying to give yourself a lesson. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Well of course you don't get what's funny - after all, he who laughs last is most likely to be the butt of the joke. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>You?  Take a PhD?  I'd be surprised if you got past secondary school - again, you have delusions of adequacy. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Well gee, if I'm already nasty as you say, wouldn't your famous karma already have come along and shown me what for?  Like I said, it's bullshit and you've just proven it. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>what entertainment? You are nuts. People are writing serious things here and you are totally childlish. See? You are just coming here and poking ridiculous attacks. It doesn't affect me at all. All i see is a childlish and immature person like you.</p>
              <p>On the contrary I don't think you are having any fun at all. I can feel you are in total pain. You are egoistically arrogant and you feel the need to defend your injured pride. Somebody have hurt you so badly in the past that makes you become so negative, so defensive and so despo to attack other people. You are so damn vulnerable. I can feel your misery and hurt miles away.</p>
              <p>Again you are nuts. Why suddenly go and say this thing about my education? Who is the uneducated. People here are suppose to post constructive comments not childlish and immature ones like yourse. Where is your education? You are so bent on attacking people. Are you so full of hurt and misery?</p>
              <p>Did somebody in the past abused you to make you become this way?</p>
              <p>Karma doesn't come immediately.</p>
              <p>I can see your fear far far away. Why you react so strongly? Because you fear the karma, that is why. You are so afraid that you try to make yourself sound confident and make yourself sound like you are entertained. But deep down inside - you are trying to appease the gods by trying to justify your arguments with childlish taunts. You are just nothing but an immature kid with full of hurt and abuse. You tryin to hurl abuse at others because you feel it is unfair that you have been hurt and abused yourself.</p>
              <p>CHinese calls it fate. Christians call it retribution. Indians call it karma.</p>
              <p>See people like Gadaffi and Saddam Hussein - that is karma. You are next to join them. In hell.</p>

              <p>Of cors, you'll see, they'll claim they are so "popular" in real life. Too bad they didn't know it wasn't because they are nice. It's just that their friend's are the ones being kind to them.</p>
