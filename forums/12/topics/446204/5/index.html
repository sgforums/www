              <p>You are actually quite right about a lof of these people who flamed you.</p>
              <p>Hello Kitty is a closet gay pretending to be a girl here, he is a poly student and goes around thinking he is a princess and will trample on anyone or thing he thinks is/are more inferior than him. So just ignore this one cus he is basically a standup comic with no substance.</p>
              <p>Gedanken is a married guy with white wife in Australia. Struggled like shit but end up going nowhere in his life. To pay for his "expensive" panty droppers, he had no choice but to suck up to his white boss and hostile co-workers to make a living. Top it all off, his white wife doesn't want kids with him. ( due to his inferior genes perhaps ?)</p>
              <p>So, yes, these people are very bitter about life, and the only way they can feel good about them-self is to come here and garang bash unsuspecting people like you.</p>
              <p>After they log off from SGforum, they need to put on that fake smile and act all well mannered to others who really don't give a shit about them.</p>
              <p>Of cors, you'll see, they'll claim they are so "popular" in real life. Too bad they didn't know it wasn't because they are nice. It's just that their friend's are the ones being kind to them.</p>
              <p>Now do  yourself a favor, don't waste your time getting pissed with these lot of sad sods.</p>

              <p><br>Thanks for the advice.</p>
              <p>Yeah you are right, I did sense that there are something wrong with Hello Kitty and Gendanken. They come across to me, as persons who have been hurt badly in the past. It is no surprise that they let go their bitterness here. They think that they are superior and this is where they can practice letting go their anger because in the real world they themselves get bullied and laughed at by their peers.</p>
              <p>Gendanken have no offspring? Gosh no surprise. Just see the way he speaks. Nobody can stand him. If I am his wife - I would quickly ask for a divorce. No wonder he is so angry and reacted so strongly. He already knew - Karma got the best of him.</p>
              <p>Hello Kitty - pretending to be somebody she/he is not? No surprise. In the forum - everybody gets to be somebody they are not. Sometimes people need a taste of the real world. Unfortunately, not the case.</p>
              <p>Well yes just ignore them. But I felt compelled to say something because I really feel pity for them. They just come here to blast people as they are people who are so persecuted in their real life that they have to come here to pretend that they are popular personalities flaming other people. When the real topic here is to post constructive and helpful comments not irrelevant and flaming people for no good reason and taking it personal because they have had their own fair share of bad experiences (Gendanken and Hello Kitty). Gendanken is just so so petty. He flame me just about everything - about me staying far from singapore. About my education standards. About my status. He even called me a despo without even having any evidence of me or any knowledge or me. Just pure flaming. He just live to see fake reality.</p>

              <p>Hello Kitty is a closet gay pretending to be a girl here, he is
              a poly student and goes around thinking he is a princess and will
              trample on anyone or thing he thinks is/are more inferior than him.
              So just ignore this one cus he is basically a standup comic with no
              substance.</p>
              <p>Gedanken is a married guy with white wife in Australia.
              Struggled like shit but end up going nowhere in his life. To pay
              for his "expensive" panty droppers, he had no choice but to suck up
              to his white boss and hostile co-workers to make a living. Top it
              all off, his white wife doesn't want kids with him. ( due to his
              inferior genes perhaps ?)</p>
              <p>So, yes, these people are very bitter about life, and the only
              way they can feel good about them-self is to come here and garang
              bash unsuspecting people like you.</p>
              <p>After they log off from SGforum, they need to put on that fake
              smile and act all well mannered to others who really don't give a
              shit about them.</p>
              <p>Of cors, you'll see, they'll claim they are so "popular" in real
              life. Too bad they didn't know it wasn't because they are nice.
              It's just that their friend's are the ones being kind to them.</p>
              <p>Now do  yourself a favor, don't waste your time getting
              pissed with these lot of sad sods.</p>

              <p>If I were ever to see your round form on the street, I would push you onto a busy road. But since I'll never have that pleasure, I will be content with the satisfaction that your child will amount to nothing more than a failure in life. You will never be able to prove us wrong and we will never be able to see it happen, but we will have the satisfaction of knowing for sure.</p>
              <p>Nothing you can do will change that. In fact, it might benefit him or her more if you do nothing at all, because of who you are. This is something you will never be able to change.</p>

              <p><br>FINDING GIRLS???umm girls here have the social welfare i think if anything goes wrong like free $$$$ i think.so they should be happier i guess.girls smile alot here especially the young ones.but they dun take care of themselves properly.when u see a pamela anderson  duplicate at a mall dressed in t-shirt n shorts,u might think she might smell like flowers n roses.but truth is due to hot weather n humidity they didnt wipe their behinds properly and thus the humidity make them smell bad even from a few metres away.</p>
              <p>grass...depends on luck and circumstances.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but one thing good is u can order dvd porn from usa and japan to your hearts content!u can even buy guns in town.....get industrial stuff which u cant get in spore....build things with it............etc..food is cheap especially raw meat.</p>

              <p>Is it easier to find gf in Australia? I mean you have all sorts of women there - migrant asian girls, Aussie ang mohs, Eastern europeans. You mean to say it is hard too?</p>
              <p>Are Australian girls more?</p>
              <p>1) Open thinking</p>
              <p>2) Willing to try dating</p>
              <p>3) Easier to marry but easy to divorce</p>
              <p>4) Not afraid to befriend new people</p>
              <p>5) Free thinking but along with affluence become more demanding</p>

              <p><br>im sure they are easy to get.but since ive been in spore most of my life.....im used to hardcore porn dvds!im not into humanoids physically.has been badly treated in spore society and is now stuck to porn dvd..</p>
              <p>even their cars are easy to get.used to be average for a sedan car in very good condition~$15k,but suddenly same price went down and now average price for sedan is $7~$8k.mercedes are even cheaper than anything .i think its due to fact that ford has car that cn park by itself thats on sale here at like $18k brand new.</p>
              <p>i guess getting a girl would be great.but its up to ones personal choices.</p>
