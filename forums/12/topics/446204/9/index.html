              <p>You call up your friend and ask him out for a movie or golf - he say he is not free because his girlfriend or wife wants him to take her out, do house work or feed the baby.</p>

              <p>ans:yes,im used to it.most of friends are married since army days and quite a few up till now have no kids.more than half of them are not having any kids.because unlike u who hail from malaysia.u have abundance of places and opportunities in malaysia etc from land price,cheap housing for malaysians as compared to foreign property would be owners,cheaper food and cheaper cars.the living and bringing up of kids in spore   is rather unhealthy nowadays and the food is not exactly good.</p>

              <p>ans:i dont really find friends good to talk to as its kinda boring from start.so i go for hobbies like work,gundam and other experiments which are interesting,fascinating and incredible.thats enough to keep u occupied all day 24 hrs 7 days a week.</p>

              <p><br>1) No. You are so wrong. Malaysia is one of the toughest place if not toughest, most likely second to Singapore. Remember - most malaysian chinese women bare many similarities to Singaporean girls.</p>
              <p>Cheap housing? No longer. Even houses here cost millions. Salary is crap compared to yours. We cannot increase wages because we are still low skill society. Cost is going up. Bringing up kids here is horrible because the education system is shit. The education has been lowered to help the majority increase their passing rate. This is why more and more chinese are migrating overseas.</p>
              <p>2) Easy to find life partner? Wrong again. Our chinese population is only 5.5 million compared to singapore population of 5 million. Worse still - we chinese are spread all over the country unlike you all - you all are in one tiny space.</p>
              <p>Inter-racial marriage? Bad. Very few chinese guys want to marry indians. Marry malay? Bad because many chinese don't want to change religion to muslim and living malay life is boring because they don't drink alcohol, now entertaiment - no cinema, shopping is boring.</p>
              <p>Chinese girls in malaysia are becoming more harder to please - more materialistic. Although maybe not as difficult as singaporean women.</p>

              <p>spore is toughest place for male sporeans as they are forced back by law to serve army athelete remedial trainings which is almost 8 months in a year every year after working hours.u would see stars as u wont have enough sleep after work and forced army athelete remedial trainings till the age of 40.</p>
              <p>the above problem will dwarf your female problems  or any other issues found in malaysia or even the ability to focus on the civilian job or your business  the next day  due to physical over exertion in athelete remedial trainings. and the need to report to a designated area after work. which takes 2 hrs to and fro.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and if u cant make the dates for the army athelete remedial trainings almost 3 days in a week till age 40..u could find yourself in an army prison without your clothes.</p>

              <p>Yes they are worst ! Singapore girls can be difficult but sometimes I find it interesting talking to singaporean girls - because they are more intelligent in conversation. Talking to malaysian girls can be rather boring and sometimes malaysian girls talk like they are very phobia especially to single guys. So conservative.</p>

              <p><br> 1) No. You are so wrong. Malaysia is one of the toughest place if
                      not toughest, most likely second to Singapore. Remember - most
                      malaysian chinese women bare many similarities to Singaporean
                      girls.</p>
              <p>Cheap housing? No longer. Even houses here cost millions. Salary
                      is crap compared to yours. We cannot increase wages because we are
                      still low skill society. Cost is going up. Bringing up kids here is
                      horrible because the education system is shit. The education has
                      been lowered to help the majority increase their passing rate. This
                      is why more and more chinese are migrating overseas.</p>
              <p>2) Easy to find life partner? Wrong again. Our chinese
                      population is only 5.5 million compared to singapore population of
                      5 million. Worse still - we chinese are spread all over the country
                      unlike you all - you all are in one tiny space.</p>
              <p>Inter-racial marriage? Bad. Very few chinese guys want to marry
                      indians. Marry malay? Bad because many chinese don't want to change
                      religion to muslim and living malay life is boring because they
                      don't drink alcohol, now entertaiment - no cinema, shopping.</p>
              <p>Chinese girls in malaysia are becoming more harder to please -
                      more materialistic. Although maybe not as difficult as singaporean
                      women.</p>
              <p>3) No. I want to try finding. I want to keep on searching.</p>
              <p>After searching - I can have all the time in the world to play
                      with my gundam toys.</p>

              <p>I assume you are a Malaysian Chinese?</p>
              <p>It's common in Chinese societies for girls to be materialistic. Malaysian girls are certainly materialistic like ours, but at least I notice they are more willing to do some of the work.</p>
              <p>Anyway Malaysian fresh graduate pay is also around RM2000 ($2,500). But a semi D will cost you RM350,000 ($1,200,000) and a car will cost you RM40,000 ($90,000). A full tank of petrol will cost you RM50 ($90). Singapore figures in brackets.</p>

              <p>Semi D now cost over 2 million. Car cost 40,000? Maybe second hand car - hahaha. You got to be kidding. In my country - nobody can buy car unless we opt for the stupid proton and perodua. If you want a nice Jap or continental car - get ready to fork out 120,000. A VW Polo - small car cost 140,000. Ridiculous. Why? Because the stupid government wants to protect the local car Proton by taxing the Jap and continental cars. The stupid proton have a lot of quality problems. After 3 years - speedometer break down - bumper collapse - expensive spare parts - breaks break down. When I got my first proton - the stupid manufacturer forgot to adjust the camper - causing my car to swerve wildly whenever I break my car. I almost got killed !</p>
              <p>Even link houses now cost 1.2 million. And so yeah - condos are still cheap but expect to fork out 300,000 to 500,000.</p>
              <p>Yes our petrol is cheap. But that is not going to be in the long run. Our government is running into budget deficit. They are blaming the subsidies and want to cut the subsidies. They have already cut sugar and other food subsidies. Two years back - I used to be able to order a plate of mix rice for 3 - now they are charging me for 6.</p>
              <p>I suspect elections are coming round the corner. If the ruling government wins - they are going to cancel the subsidies. They are blaming the subsidies for the burgeoning budget surplus but in fact its those dirty and corrupted politicians who use tax payer money to fund their stockmarket buys - land developments - military projects - private investments - properties that is causing the budget to explode.</p>
              <p>Our salary? Like shit. Cost going up but because we are low skilled nation - employers exploit us - pay us like 1500 to 3500. Pathetic. Our currency is a piece of shit. We need to keep low exchange to export our products. Now we are facing stiff competition from Indonesia - China - India and Vietnam. I cannot even afford to travel to USA and Europe because I need pay 3 or 4 times as much as what a normal Westerner would pay in their country.</p>
              <p>So when our govenrment decides to cut down fuel subsidies - my people are going to suffer even more than you singaporeans because our foreign exchange is like shit 3 times lower than the USD - now even SGD is 2.5 times more than ours. Plus our salary is low like shit.</p>

              <p>If a semi-D cost RM 2 million, at 2000 square feet, it would cost RM1000 or
                   $420 per square foot. That is the exact same price as a government 
                  executive condo in Singapore. Is that logical?</p>
              <p>Yes, foreign cars were equally priced in Malaysia and Singapore. But last year Singapore COEs hit $56,000, a foreign car has not changed price in Malaysia. Foreign cars are cheaper in Malaysia, even with the Approval Permit included. A domestic Proton still costs RM40,000 though.</p>
