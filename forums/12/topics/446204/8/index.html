              <p>I am not a girl. No - you are wrong. Most men do want to settle down into relationships. No world is an oyster.</p>
              <p>Used to it? I don;t think so. SO you re telling us when all your friends around you are married and settle down - just you are the only person around - you don't feel lonely?</p>
              <p>You call up your friend and ask him out for a movie or golf - he say he is not free because his girlfriend or wife wants him to take her out, do house work or feed the baby.</p>
              <p>So you continue to do things you like to drown out the loneliness - like coming to this forum/playing with gundam toys? watching movies? drowning in work?</p>
              <p>Men was never made to live alone. Why else you think god created women?</p>

              <p>ans:yes,im used to it.most of friends are married since army days and quite a few up till now have no kids.more than half of them are not having any kids.because unlike u who hail from malaysia.u have abundance of places and opportunities in malaysia etc from land price,cheap housing for malaysians as compared to foreign property would be owners,cheaper food and cheaper cars.the living and bringing up of kids in spore   is rather unhealthy nowadays and the food is not exactly good.</p>

              <p>ans:yes,i dont call them after they get married unless they call me or when they r on the internet while they are umm........"working".</p>

              <p>ans:i dont really find friends good to talk to as its kinda boring from start.so i go for hobbies like work,gundam and other experiments which are interesting,fascinating and incredible.thats enough to keep u occupied all day 24 hrs 7 days a week.</p>
              <p>u should try it one day if u have nothing else better to do.</p>
