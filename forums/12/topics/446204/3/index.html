Are you those type of take the joy of making snipe remarks to other people to boost your ego? Karma is watching you. You better watch your words. If you think you are so so good. Loads of karma is coming to you.</p>
              <p>I am only joking about Fifi. Obviously both of us don't have intention to meet.</p>
              <p>Are you living in a dream world? Obviously Fifi and I never had any chance to meet like this. I am only joking with Summer Hill.</p>
              <p>Come on, are you like still pre-schooling? Can't you tell the difference?</p>
              <p>Look u started it. I am not making any snipe remarks about desperate women.</p>

              <p><br>In my dictionary is snide. I don't care. I don't take lessons from uneducated fool like u. Since u will face the karma. U laugh, wait and see. But in real life u will see the real pain that is going to face u - reality. See whether u can make snide remarks at people in real life like the way u do here.</p>
              <p>Don't be smart with me. You can't even tell the difference whether I was joking about Fifi or I was serious about Fifi. You just take one comment and turn it into a snide attack. You are so pure of misery and judgment. Your education is not very high isn't it? Where did you get your common sense from? From the bottom of barrel of sludge? scraping and accusing other people to boost your low ego?</p>
              <p>Barrel of judgement - that came from u. So u saying u r ripoff?</p>
              <p>Look who is talking? You are the bottom feeder who is giving snide remarks to feed your ego. Who is accusing? You ! Look in the mirror. Is it much to look at? BAsed on your words, I think your appearance is as bad as your demeanor.</p>
              <p>Karma exists far from dream world. You will await your punishment. When somehting bad happens to you. You will realise the words you said.</p>
              <p>Anyway. Why am I a despo? Just because I support the TS? Gosh. You don't even know me nor my background. You pointing fingers and accusing me of being this and that. WHat next? You are going to say I am LKY's henchman. You are really in dreamworld.</p>
              <p>I am feeling sympathetic to TS's situation.</p>
              <p>A snide egoist u r. I can imagine - u must be feeding on the barrel of sludge at the bottom to boost your ego. Do you need that or are you in dream world because you don't want to wake up to your real life - a true nightmare.</p>

              <p>WHy? I only post 16 times. Expand my comment and make it become a novel and put so many lies. Say woman scared of me lah. Say they run away from me lah. Based on that Gendanken know me so so well.</p>

              <p>Half the people here post wrong spelling. Wrong grammar. Who cares?</p>
              <p>What is so darn funny anyway? I am not laughing. Only you are. Why don't you laugh at yourself. Because you are pathetic - bottom feeding sludge. You are like a vampire or some evil spirit that needs to feed on perceived misery. You delude yourself to think that I am in the same position as TS. When that doesn't work. You target my english. You really need a life. For goodness sake. All day long. You feed on your own ego.</p>

              <p>Snide Snide Snide. What are you going to do about it? Laugh all you want. You need to stroke your ego?</p>
              <p>Karma will come to you. Don't believe? Then go around and be nasty to everyone else like you are here. Oh I forgot - you are nasty/miserable/lonely.</p>
              <p>I don't even live in singapore. How the hell am I going to meet up Fifi. U are crazy. U jump to idiotic conclusions. Suuure I have intention. Suuure. YOu are warped. You can't even tell the difference from your warped mind filled with misery.</p>

              <p>Who said anything about a lesson?  The ability to learn is a sign of intelligence - thus far you have demonstrated none (remember sni<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>p</strong></span>e?), so providing you with a lesson is a fool's errand.  Remember, you're the fool, so you might want to waste your time trying to give yourself a lesson. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Well of course you don't get what's funny - after all, he who laughs last is most likely to be the butt of the joke. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              <p>Well gee, if I'm already                         nasty as you say, wouldn't your famous karma already have come along and shown me what for?  Like I said, it's bullshit and you've just proven it. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>
              <p>Anyway, being a fellow of neither significant education nor intelligence, you've obviously missed how you've been digging your own grave all evening.  Never mind - you've served your purpose providing entertainment for the evening, and maybe by morning the penny will have dropped.  Then again, maybe not, and then fun will begin afresh tomorrow. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/teeth.png" alt="teeth.png"></p>

              To TS:
                      
              Please get a life. Life is not just finding a life partner, get married, set up family and that's all. There are still so many meaningful things in life to pursue other than just getting married.
              Have you been successful in your career? Have you invented/designed something or think out of the box that might change and influence the world? Have you ever started your own business and be a successful businessman? Have you yet tried going to every place around the world in your life? Have you tried to help other people in the other parts of the world who are not as fortunate as us? Have you ever dreamt of going into space? Have you ever explored and physically feel how advanced technology is and how vast is our natural habitat on Earth?
              And even in the micro persective, have you ever thought of earning a lot more in your income to provide better lives for your parents or even plan your life after retirement?
              If you really can't find a life partner you want, why not divert your time, resources and energy to fulfill other more meaningful things?
              You only live once, why waste your life and time away just to find a correct partner, get married and be miserable by marriage after that? Cherish your freedom when god gives you and don't be lead by the nose in life because of social norms.
