              <p><br>All the single guy in the church is thinking the same thing as he is thinking. The only difference is that some guys in church is smarter in their approach. Some are good in talking to girls and have charm. They don't obviously exhibit their desperate nature to the girls at church which may make them phobia.</p>
              <p>This guy have the same motivation. However he has let his desperation rob him of his ability to serve his church. Of course he genuinely want to serve but his is also facing pressure and dilemna of society. Understandably he is not as good as other christian guys at church who don't have to go and approach fellow sisters because they are more better looking, have charm and impress them with their heart of service and dedication to the church. So he took wrong turn and didn't approapriately approach women.</p>
              <p>I hope u dun feel disgusted. It is too strong. Next time when u have a son and maybe if he is unable to find a life partner by the time he reach 30 - obviously you be worried. So u have to have emphathy. Be understanding. Find out his underlying weakness and problems and source as to why he does this. He didn't make a big sin like kill somebody or lust somebody. He only want to do the normal thing - find life partner.</p>
              <p>If u r married or attach - very sure your guy has some skill in wooing u. Some guy to thing differently - there is no standard bearer way of doing thing. His approach may be wrong. Be more understanding toward the TS. Perhap his problem is not as worst as people in somalia starving but this is wht the forum is for - everybody has a problem and we want to help in the issue.</p>
              <p>If u r churchgoer - u r unfair in making a quick judgment upon him. Give him the benefit of doubt. If u r a 40 year old woman n still single - u would surely feel the same desperation and pressure he is facing. Of cuz, bible teach us to seek god but sometime people do veer out of the right path. Be understanding not disgusted. If u r a christian then u shld understand jesus preach the message of salvation to tax collector, prostitutes and robbers - so u should show some mercy and emphaty for the TS.</p>

              <p><br>He go for both. Of course serve god first. Other come later if blessed.</p>
              <p>it is only fair wat. Some pastors get married. Some people at church find life partner and get married. So why is it such a problem? For him to also seek a life partner? Maybe he got it all wrong and not listen to god but he put too much emphasis in finding life partner. But he didn't do so bad, rite?</p>

              <p>I am a guy approaching my 30s. I have been trying to find the
              right girl for me until now I have yet to find. I am not disclosing
              my race nor my nationality. All I am saying is that where I am - I
              am not progressing.</p>
              <p>1) I went after this girl at church. We went out for few dates.
              Then she said to me that she is not interested in me and we should
              be friends. So I agreed. however after I attended a church meeting.
              Her brother in law didn't like me - when I went in one of their
              meetings - he slammed the door to my face. And then the some of the
              church members became very hostile towards me. This made me
              discouraged to make my first move for fear of being flamed.</p>
              <p>2) I met this girl who work for a bank at a church camp. I got
              her phone number through the address book. I contacted her in
              effort to make conversation. Then her text messages became more and
              more longer to reply: sometime 1 day or 2 day. After 3 or 4
              calls - she never pick up. I gave up.</p>
              <p>3) I attend another church. Met this 25 year old girl. At first
              she was very nice to me. We chatted. Then she ask me out a few time
              but unluckily at the time my boss force me to work long hours. I
              had to say no. Then this other 25 year old guy at the church went
              after her. She became very show off to me and told me that she want
              this guy over me. This lady go and bargain high high price at
              me.</p>
              <p>4) I did work two years serving the church. Suddenly this lady -
              she is in her 40. She suddenly ask me out many many times. At first
              she needed my help to shift some furniture and escort her to
              church. So I gentleman escorted her. Then she became more
              aggressive started asking me out more often. Then the church people
              also wanted to match make me with her. The church leader go and
              make a meeting appointment for all church members but nobody turn
              up except this lady and me. Then she propose we go out together. I
              turn her down because it starting to make us look like a
              couple.</p>
              <p>I am not interested in lady in (4) because I am looking for a
              girl who is in her late 20s or at least early 30s - I want to start
              a family. I got many friend who marry at 35 or 36 with wife of same
              age now struggling to have babies because of the age. Anyway, I
              know this 40 year old lady for 1 year, i know I am not interested
              in her because she is very different from me. Moreover she is older
              than me. I don't want to marry somebody older than me</p>
              <p>5) I met this girl at the office. About 6 month ago. She broke
              up with her boyfriend. They had an argument and boyfriend gave her
              a blackeye. So i was so excited to make my move. I decided to chat
              more with her. At first ok. Then I decided to ask her out. Suddenly
              some co worker became very hostile at me. They started to mock me.
              She also became very unfriendly to me and treated one guy at the
              office better than me. After valentine day - she accepted that guy
              as her new boyfriend.</p>
              <p>At first I pursue her. But she kept avoiding me. She instead
              delegate one lady to distract me. This lady keep on asking me out.
              I am not interested in her. Because the lady she delegate to
              distract me - like to go night club and get drunk. She is quite a
              drunkerd.</p>
              <p>Conclusion:</p>
              <p>I am frustrated. So many years here wasted. Cannot find
              life partner. So hard to find. I go to gym and diet to make myself
              look good. I dress well. I even go and study MBA to improve my
              skills. I go and serve in the church. In the end - what do I
              have to answer for? A 40 year old spinster lady?</p>
              <p>On the other hand. My older 40 year old brother who is so
              so straight guy. He never had girlfriend before. He is so innocent.
              Apparently he was still a virgin. Then when he migrated to
              Australia - he met one ang moh lady. Within two week they became a
              couple. Within 1 year they got married. The ang moh lady even
              younger than him.</p>
              <p>I have been here for 30 years and cannot even find a girlfriend.
              This is ridiculous. Mankind have existed for over million year and
              still able to find life partner to continue the human race.
              Nowaday, woman is getting more affluent. Make it impossible to find
              life partner.</p>
              <p>I am thinking of going to Australia to find life partner. Over
              here (may not be singapore) it is getting impossible. I am not
              getting any younger.</p>
              <p>Why is it always like this:</p>
              <p>1) Why cannot find boy and girl like each other and then
              progress from there? Instead have to find girl that bargain high
              price - chase her then always get rejected.</p>
              <p>2) Why always I like the girl but the girl don't like me?
              Ironically those lady I don't like, they like me? And these lady
              who like me normally are too old (I want to find a lady who is of
              child bearing age and very important I must have chemistry).</p>

              <p>Yup you sound very desperate.</p>
              <p>I mean moving in on a girl who just got beaten up in her relation?!? All that girl needed was protection and care not a guy pushing himself forward for a relation. That is why the other church goers look negative at you. You urge to find a mate is understandable but you are losing your human side in the process.</p>
              <p>And please be careful, you can move to another place but then it is harder to find out girls their back-round and you may end up with someone who gives you allot of trouble.</p>

              <p>I just read TS story again. You are again jumping into conclusion. Did he say he went after one after another. I don't know. It could be that he did it in a span of 5 or 8 years. Maybe after this one fail. He wait 1 year and then try. You mean to tell me that if TS fail, then he should go to the cave and never again woo another girl???? I don't see your logic.</p>
              <p>Come on, Kitty. What do you expect a guy to do? We are human beings. We need to woo a potential life partner.</p>
              <p>We are not frogs whereby we dump our sperm into the pond and then expect the female to lay eggs into the pond to produce tap poles and then abandon the babies.</p>
              <p>We are human beings for goodness sake. Guys have to woo girls.</p>
              <p>You are being very unfair towards me and TS. Why you see us in so negative light. God teach us to love your neighbour as your love Thyself. Was TS unloyal to his girlfriend/wife? No because he is single. As long he is single he is not betraying anyone. It is natural for a guy to want to start a family because as he age, it is harder to start a family later in life due to economical pressure.</p>

              <p><br>Not sure if TS was going after girls beyond his league. He never say. But he did state that he wasn't interested in a 40 year old when he is only 30. Age gap of 10 years. To be fair some guys don't want to be with a lady who is 10 years older than him. THis is definitely not even within league, it is like one wanting to go to Italy for tour but end up going to Peru. Two so different places. Or you want to hire a plumber to repair your broken sink but a fireman turn up at your doorstep instead. More like - cannot compare apple to apple.</p>
              <p>There is a big difference between pervert and a pursuer. Don't think girls will think of him as pervert. Pervert are those that go to take photo of girls underskirt or those that spy on women showering. This one is different. Maybe the girls will treat him with caution and become irritated.</p>
