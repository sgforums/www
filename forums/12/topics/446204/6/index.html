              <p>Are Australian girls more?</p>

              <p>An important reason why girls in foreign countries are not wanting to marry Asians is actually not your fault. (Assuming you are a caring, loving and family man.)</p>
              <p>Asians hav very bad reputation due to the previous generations of immigrants.</p>
              <p>Asian men are stereotyped to be machoistical, self-ish, tight wads, irresponsible and uninvolved fathers, treat women badly and bad communicators.</p>
              <p>These create a lot of problems for the newer generations of Asian males.</p>
              <p>Defunct the stereotype and you will have more girls ( of any race ) willing to date and marry Asian males.</p>
              <p>An Asian father who behaves badly in society is doing his own asian son a big disfavor.</p>

              <p>I put it to you: You are here defending everything dear to you because it is all you have in life. If you shrivelled up and died, the would would not notice the difference, so you're trying to carve out some little way in which you matter to the world.</p>
              <p>If I were ever to see your round form on the street, I would push you onto a busy road. But since I'll never have that pleasure, I will be content with the satisfaction that your child will amount to nothing more than a failure in life. You will never be able to prove us wrong and we will never be able to see it happen, but we will have the satisfaction of knowing for sure.</p>
              <p>Nothing you can do will change that. In fact, it might benefit him or her more if you do nothing at all, because of who you are. This is something you will never be able to change.</p>

              <p>I actually have no idea. I rarely know an Ang Moh. So I can't say if an Ang Moh is more caring and less machoistical. Maybe Americans tend to be more fun and outgoing. I remember one time I went into the lift of my insurance office and bump into my American CEO. He made conversation to me that he saw some monkeys and he was exhilarated to see wildlife. But when I work for HongLeong. I went into lift one day. Saw my CEO come in. Wah. He so proud don't even look at me. Don't even talk to me. Unlike the American CEO - every morning he come into office - he say good morning and if he see me work late - he ask me how am I.</p>
              <p>But I notice lately. Yeah a lot of Asian guys only care about making money. Lots of money. That is becoming a problem. Asian guys no longer care about the fun of life. I got a few friends who like to play board games, mountain biking and go wind surfing. These are the open bunch. But majority of my friends only care about making money and becoming more influential in the office. Maybe it is the chinese mentality of making money into a religion. Men become more egoistical at the office - want to gain more power and suck up to bosses. Men no longer care about poetry, song, inspiration, friendship, fellowship and charity. Asian men want ego, power, money, wealth and sex.</p>

              <p>Ang moh also care about making money.  Ang moh also got big ego , want power , money and wealth and sex.</p>
              <p>Got money is good lah.. but if you have money but is a jerk, no decent lady will tolerate you for very long lah.</p>
              <p>In
                               Asia, most men only need to provide for family financially. They still 
                              expect their women to serve them and guai guai listen to them, treat 
                              them as head of household. Simply because he has a dick.</p>
              <p>In the western world, you see Ang Moh men pushing baby prams, 
                              care for their babies and help with family chores. They don't expect 
                              their wives to be house slaves. They work as partners to raise a family.</p>
              <p>If you are a woman, who will you choose ? Of cors the one who 
                              respect you and not treat you like a lower class human being right ?</p>
              <p>in USA, Asian-american men are changing. There are more and more 
                              inter-racial marriages. If they had held on to their old school, male 
                              chauvinistic mentality, no American woman of any racial background will 
                              ever wanna touch them with a 10ft pole not even Asian-Amercian women.</p>
              <p>Among my social circle, there are several couples of Asian 
                              husbands and non-asian wives. All of these Asian husbands ( usually second or third generation transplants ) do not think 
                              or behave like traditional asian men, so it's easier for their non-asian
                               wives to accept them.</p>
              <p>On the other side, don't expect these non-asian wives to behave like asian women. they don't . If you are expecting a submissive stereotypical asia woman, better you look in your own backyard.</p>
              <p>Not saying that asian men are doomed.

              <p>Ang moh also care about making money.  Ang moh also got big ego , want power , money and wealth and sex.</p>
              <p>Got money is good lah.. but if you have money but is a jerk, no decent lady will tolerate you for very long lah.</p>
              <p>In Asia, most men only need to provide for family financially. They still expect their women to serve them and guai guai listen to them, treat them as head of household. Simply because he has a dick.</p>
              <p>In the western world, you see Ang Moh men pushing baby prams, care for their babies and help with family chores. They don't expect their wives to be house slaves. They work as partners to raise a family.</p>
              <p>If you are a woman, who will you choose ? Of cors the one who respect you and not treat you like a lower class human being right ?</p>
              <p>in USA, Asian-american men are changing. There are more and more inter-racial marriages. If they had held on to their old school, male chauvinistic mentality, no American woman of any racial background will ever wanna touch them with a 10ft pole not even Asian-Amercian women.</p>
              <p>Among my social circle, there are several couples of Asian husbands and non-asian wives. All of these Asian husbands ( usually second or third generation transplants ) do not think or behave like traditional asian men, so it's easier for their non-asian wives to accept them.</p>
              <p>On the other side, don't expect these non-asian wives to behave like asian women. they don't . If you are expecting a submissive stereotypical asia woman, better you look in your own backyard.</p>
              <p>Not saying that asian men are doomed. Asian men are perceived to be more loyal than Ang mohs. Ang mohs go through wives like tissue papers, it is common for ang moh man to have several children from different women, and pay several sets of child supports during his lifetime.</p>

              <p>Yeah tell me about the rate of divorce among Ang Mohs. Although Asia is beginning to increase but it is no match for the Ang moh divorce rate. On average almost every Ang moh has been married before. I think it is easier for Ang Mohs to get married (maybe they don't screen the partner as well as Asians) but very easy for Ang Moh to divorce.</p>
              <p>My perception of ang moh women is that they expect their men to be more adventurous. I notice a lot of ang moh women nowadays like to go scuba diving, kickboxing, mountain climbing and bungee jumping. With the exception of those obese ang moh women of course. I think maybe i get this perception from Discovery Traveler where i see a lot of adventourous ang moh women. Maybe that is why ang moh women don't want or prefer asian men who raise in asian conservative upbringing.</p>
              <p>I also notice ang mohs like to hug. They are a physical lot. When I saw my cousin brought his american wife - she hug his grandma and kiss her forehead. We asian men not like physical type only sex haha.</p>

              <p><br>Ang mo women are very much less femine in nature than Asian women, in another words, ang mo women are like Asian men, marriage and divorce is just lunch and dinner for them, and also you hv to take into account human rights, ang mo respect human right to marraige and divorce too, so it is a no problem for them, happy, be together, not happy, just break off better, for their lord said, "Go make as many as you can, thou shalt be blessed", so they go on and make love here and there, marriage is only a title, nothing else.</p>

              <p>I think another reason could be because TS is socially awkward .... <br>Most Ang Mos are very smooth around the ladies whereas a lot of Asian Men are not as smooth and say all the wrong things. </p>
              <p>Anyway, I prefer Asian Men and there are Asian Men in Asia who are much more westernized in thinking and very much unlike the traditional asian guy. </p>
              <p>The other thing is that most women will also take the guy's family into consideration as well. At least I do. If I think my MIL is going to be the typical traditional MIL who expects the DIL to stay at home and do all housework and defer to her husband, that guy is also written off in my books. </p>
              <p>Anyway, usually if the guy is more westernized in thinking, the chances of his parents being non-traditional is also very high. They kind of go hand-in-hand. </p>
              <p>In any case, I think if you have problems scoring with your own country women (being home ground it should be easier), I think you will have more problems with foreign women, unless they are from some village. </p>
              <p>Also if you are talking about Australia, I think you will not have much chances unless you already have citizenship because a lot of Asian women there are trying to snag a man with citizenship. </p>

                  grandma and kiss her forehead. We asian men not like physical type
                  only sex haha.</p>

              <p>Hugging is casual form of greetings. Some pat pat your back, some muuah muah your cheeks.. During business they only give each other a firm handshake.</p>
              <p>Do you watch Survivor ? Remember that guy Yul Kwon ? He is working hard to shed media stereotype of Asian-American men.</p>
              <p>If you can be like him... you got chance lah.</p>

              <p>Look at those impressive abs ! Ok - time for me to hit the gym !</p>
              <p>Kind of good if we asians can hug, pat on the back, kiss cheek, handshake, greet each other more often. It is very encouraging. Sometimes I leave the office - i am unable to say goodbye because the co-workers are conservative and feel strange towards such greetings.</p>
