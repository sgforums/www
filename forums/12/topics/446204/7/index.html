              <p>and folks on this planet usually dont immigrate because of a sex partner.folks immigrated because they want to build a better future for family because spore cant give it.</p>
              <p>i know some folks here are foreigners and take their freedom for granted....thenthey  shouldnt really be asking about migration as they have already taken so much by coming into spore at the great expense of sporeans and their freedom n rights from a dumb n blind leadership.</p>

              <p>capability?i already immigrated overseas which<br> is 100 times  much tougher than immigrating to singapore without a degree.went thru army seen death a few times or more and lived thru it in one piece.and i had to fight with thousands of foreigners vying for one single professional job.and i have a manufacturing business of my own.so after having gone thru all that,im sure getting a tall leggy blonde babe with big boobs is not any capability issue.so that doesnt apply to me but rather on u.</p>
              <p>the right fit?that should be the problem.most girls here dont work.they dont sweep,clean wash etc etc.they also lack of education where they might fail in logical training and processing back in school but the school simply let them pass.</p>
              <p>The DNA exhibiting their usefulness in this world to build a better world should not be cross linked with not verty bright intelligence and motives in life.once u mix them u would get farmer genes or criminal genes.DNA is very important to create the best enginners,inventors,great generals,great thinkers,super technicians,awe inspiring movie directors and music composers and technological directors like thomas edison ,bill gates,oppenheimer etc.</p>
              <p>alas if u mixed your DNA to another dim witted person who pass their basic math with great difficulty then u need to check see ifr your offsprings would be people who knpow what they are doing without any guidance or aim in life.</p>
              <p>its the genetic code that builds a better world which is important to me.less complications to me in an already dumb singapore with its numerous oppressive laws from reservist,housing etc and not terribly bright australia which has kids rumoured to have .promoted to next stage of school when they had failed in same subjects for a few years.</p>
              <p>being in a dumb or not terribly bright country,i prefer the latter due to less dumb laws as compared to a not terribly bright laws.</p>
              <p>the capability is important but that has nothing to do in getting a girl to me.as i am exceptional bright,i could have a harem even withput blinking an eye.as i said discpline is the keyword.if u dont undertsand then its not your fault....its your DNA.</p>

              <p>this means person could be confused all along and probably isnt thinking rationally.means the person should work more than dream of girls.wouldnt get into a fight due to someones mental issues.</p>

              <p>capability?i already immigrated overseas which<br> is 100 times  much tougher than immigrating to singapore without a degree.went thru army seen death a few times or more and lived thru it in one piece.and i had to fight with thousands of foreigners vying for one single professional job.and i have a manufacturing business of my own.so after having gone thru all that,im sure getting a tall leggy blonde babe with big boobs is not any capability issue.so that doesnt apply to me but rather on u.</p>
              <p>the right fit?that should be the problem.most girls here dont work.they dont sweep,clean wash etc etc.they also lack of education where they might fail in logical training and processing back in school but the school simply let them pass.</p>
              <p>The DNA exhibiting their usefulness in this world to build a better world should not be cross linked with not verty bright intelligence and motives in life.once u mix them u would get farmer genes or criminal genes.DNA is very important to create the best enginners,inventors,great generals,great thinkers,super technicians,awe inspiring movie directors and music composers and technological directors like thomas edison ,bill gates,oppenheimer etc.</p>
              <p>alas if u mixed your DNA to another dim witted person who pass their basic math with great difficulty then u need to check see ifr your offsprings would be people who knpow what they are doing without any guidance or aim in life.</p>

              <p>Yes Yes. You said it all. I do not know why you want to prove to me so badly that you can start a harem. You should prove that to yourself.</p>
              <p>Finding a life partner is not about finding a tall leggy blonde lady. It is about finding somebody you truly want to live with the rest of your life and she too want to do the same for you. You got the whole concept wrong.</p>
              <p>What good does a successful profession (assuming that you possess one) do to you when you are nothing but one person in this world? Most business people would want to pass down their business in succession to their children. They feel they have continuation in their life.</p>
              <p>Futhermore nobody works 24 hours. When come back home - people seek life. Family is the ups and downs of life. But coming back home - still living with parents (assuming that you are living with parents) doesn't do much for motivation.</p>
              <p>At least some of the friends I know are getting out there and searching. Not doing anything but saying that you can but yet you are not trying - it seems singleness is destine for you.</p>

              <p>I am driving the idea of not putting too much emphasis into a job or else one day you will regret what you missed out on. Think about it. One day when you hit 50 or 60 - touch wood - if you kena stroke or heart attack - who is going to come visit you in hospital or boil soup and sit next to you all day? Who is going to visit your house during CNY? Friends? Nah.</p>

              <p>True true. But most daddies are not maternal yet they still able to raise kids. If your daddy didn't bother to be a dad - you would not have existed.</p>
              <p>I am driving the idea of not putting too much emphasis into a job or else one day you will regret what you missed out on. Think about it. One day when you hit 50 or 60 - touch wood - if you kena stroke or heart attack - who is going to come visit you in hospital or boil soup and sit next to you all day? Who is going to visit your house during CNY? Friends? Nah.</p>
              <p>I don't think men are ever made to live alone.</p>
