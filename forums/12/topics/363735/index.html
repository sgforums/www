              <p>duno if this might help....</p>
              <p>try letting ur mum get used to the idea of not having u all around slowly...</p>
              <p>so.. try sleeping over at ur mum place over the weekend once in a while or invited her over to stay once in a while.....</p>
              <p>cut the frequence down to only seeing her once a week after months.....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>ppl who feel                         abandon are normally lacking a social life of their own. Try getting ur mum to join some local hobby group, like tai chi or cooking class, singing class..... once she have groups of fren of her own.... u will b the last thing they want to spend their weekend with.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>Not only is your mother a very possessive person, she is also obviously not very fond of your wife. I suggest that you do not bring your wife over to your mother's house -- at least not for the time being.</p>
              <p>On a side note, you are lucky to have a wife who remained by your side despite everything that your mother have said, and you should treasure her.</p>
              <p>I can tell you there is no easy way out of this sticky mess, at least not within a short amount of time. Like EarlNeo said, you could try introducing your mother to joining Social Groups or activities, but given her bad temper, I highly doubt she would bond with anyone else. Unfortunately, old people also are not very fond of counselling either.</p>
              <p>You did not mention anything about your father, so I guess he is just acting like what most guys would do in such a situation -- hide in one corner and pretend not to see or hear anything. If he has some 'control' over your mother, he will have been able to, and probably will have, help the two of you out. But he seems like one of those hen-pecked guys, so whatever he do now will not be of much help to you and your spouse.</p>
              <p>The best solution in this case, is to get a grandchild for her to look after. Maybe you will like to try out IVF, though you will have to fork out some cash for it. You could also go for medical check-ups along with your wife, as there a few factors which could explain why she is not pregnant yet. Two of the most common reasons are:</p>
              <p>1) The male having a low sperm count</p>
              <p>2) The female having a weak uterus wall lining</p>
              <p>For now, you will have to bear with all your mother's scoldings yourself, and not to let your wife suffer anymore of it. One important to note is that you should never blame your wife because of the scoldings, for it would harm the relationship between the two of you. Remember, your wife is not at fault here, and that as her husband, you have a duty of protecting her.</p>
              <p>And whatever you choose to do, please do not move back to your mother's place or ask her to stay at your house. I highly doubt she would change her attitude towards your wife anytime soon, and sooner or later you will find your wife breaking down and/or squabbling with your mother.</p>
              <p>You could also choose to cut all contacts with your mother and move somewhere else with your wife, but that will be very unfilial of you. This should be used as a last resort only if your mother becomes physically abusive towards your wife.</p>

              <p>OK. Your situation is very similar to my brother when he first got married. It has a lot to do with power struggle between the two most important women of your life. The last thing you want to do is be the weakling, as this power struggle CAN break up your marriage.</p>
              <p>Now first of all.. why only 1 and half day of the week ? Is it very difficult to go dinner at your mother house about 3 times a week ? Afterall.. she only living across the street mah. And how often do you bring your mother out for dinner as a family ? Is that why she complain you have abandoned her ???</p>
              <p>Second.. why do you allow your mother to treat your wife so badly. I suggest one day.. you tell your wife to do her own stuff after work.. and YOU the man go and sit down with your mother and father.. and discuss your mother's passive aggressive ways. You gota let her know that it is unacceptable and not good for your marriage. And if your mother got anything unhappy with your wife.. ask her to TALK TO YOU instead of nagging at your wife. Tell your mother that.. you will deal with it yourself. That way you are IN CONTROL of the situation.</p>
              <p>Let her know that you are trying to start a family of your own.</p>
              <p>If she becomes obstinate.. ask her this question. " DO you want me to become a divorced man ?"</p>
              <p>" You have me to take care of you in old age.. but do you want me to die a lonely man ?"</p>
              <p>Remember.. your mother is YOUR mother.. she is NOT your wife's mother. If your wife's mother has issues with you.. your wife must deal with the problem.</p>
              <p>Now YOUR mother is giving your wife problem . YOU must step in and halt the problem.</p>
              <p>Let me warn you this OK. If your mother continues to treat your wife this way.. and the relationship turns sour... when the baby comes out.. your wife AND your mother WILL have even MORE problem !! </p>
              <p>And as a husband it is very important you support your wife during pregnancy and after child birth.. Because if you don't handle it properly.. your wife will most likely go into POST NATAL depression.</p>
              <p>And there will be more power struggle if your wife's mother and your mother wants to take over the child care of your baby. </p>
              <p>Seek a fertility expert. Sometimes it could be your wife's fallopian tube is blocked. A simple surgery may just do the trick.</p>
              <p>Good Luck.</p>

              <p>ur mom need to understand that u have ur own family now... u have ur own life... ur own decisions.</p>
              <p>It would be best to sit down with her and say u cant spend time with her as much as last time, not because u love ur wife more than her... but because u have ur own family now... tell her the current situation really bothers u... and can cause a rift between u and ur wife...</p>
              <p>Tell her that u would really be happy if ur mom can get along with ur wife... every parents want their children to be happy...</p>
              <p>Assure her also u are not abandoning her that she can call u whenever she needs u... anyway ur not staying far from her.</p>
              <p>It's important also that u come across as a neutral party between ur mom an ur wife. Dont take sides when they disagree.</p>
              <p>Also, as some posters here says, she needs a hobby eg: karaoke, line dance, taichi... get her to like smth, support her or even sponsor her on it...</p>
              <p>Be patient, things will work out eventually :)</p>
