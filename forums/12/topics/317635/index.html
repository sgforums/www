              <p>Its good to just move on. I am not saying admins are bad but it seems that the people in these group tend toc arry a lot of baggage around themselves... </p>
              <p>To me, its just work. No point getting bent out of shape. And I do hope when I get bent out of shape, someone will tell me and I hope I am smart enough to wake up and reform...  Sigh....</p>
              <p>I am so against these kind of things happening in office cause it will start people creating lines and political factions. Something I do not enjoy dealing with. Makes simple office life so much more complicated over nothing and especially for that little bit of money ..... its almost laughable....</p>

              <p>hahaha this forum knows me lah. Sometimes, people just want to gripe but actually they know the answer. In fact, most people more or less know the answer already... if you only ask the correct questions. So it means that the best way to get about "advising" people is to ask questions.</p>
              <p>I don't think AA is just a place to get answers, sometimes, its to share answers people discovered in tough situations.</p>
