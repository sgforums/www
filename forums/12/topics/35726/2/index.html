No matter how careful he/she walks - it will bound to leave marking on the cement.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>People *DO not* forget relation, although many chose to let it pass and get on with their lives because simply if they don't, they also cannot do anything about it most of the time. So the only option is to move on, than to stay in this pit of sorrow.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>People remember relation especially, the woman/man you *feel* you most loved *at that point of time*, first love, love that was never meant to be yours (you yuan wu fen kind), the unattainable, you did all you can, but it doesn't turn out the way you want, the man./woman that is so different and you so loved it and you know that you will never find another person the same, and the lists goes on.<br><br>Noticed a link between all these? Yes, you guess it: You remember most deeply is relations you can never have or once had and lost it.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Here is another analogy.<br><br>Imagine one day when you were out shopping in a super market and you wanted a drink. You saw a new drink and decide to try it out. You paid about a dollar for it, walk out and happily open it to drink it, just to find out that the drinks sucks. You threw it away and cursed.<br><br>Who will complain and rant over such small priced items over the course of 1 month?<br><br>A change of location: Imagine you wanted to buy a Handphone, some latest one (perhaps 6110). Only after you bought it, you found that it is damn sucky.<br><br>Chances are, you will complain, rant, and *feel* the pinch of the money spent and it's not worth your money even after one month.<br><br>So what am I talking about?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>The more money you spend buying one item and to find out that its not what you want - the more you will feel the pain: In relation, the more you give and contribute (mentally, emotionally and spiritually) in this relation and it doesn't last - the more you won't forget and longer time you need to heal the hurt.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="Evil or Very Mad" title="Evil or Very Mad"><br><br>ONS is like buying a stick of sweets that cost 60 cents - you don't give a sh|t even if you don't like it - life just move on.<br><br>After naggy so long - my answer to your question is: You want to know how long you need to heal the pain? So how much have you 'spend' then?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Velvet gal, *poor Thing* breaking up is the hardest thing to get over ... Especially when u treasure and always think abt all those moments. Perhaps the other party doesn't even care and feels great to be broken up , the worse is tt she/he finds a new love immediately. HaiZzzzZ</div>
