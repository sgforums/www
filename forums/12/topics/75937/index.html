            <div class='col-md body'>here i continue this silly crappy story.<br><br>months passes. we kept chatting on the phone almost daily in fact 4-5 time daily. sometimes when i busy for 3 hrs i will recieve 10 -20 missed calls from her. as i am i am sometimes a forgetful person. i will tell her i will call her when i reach home but end up forgetting about it until the next morning and of cos she will be very angry with me. but we patch up very quickly. anyway this unsteady relationship last and grew. ending up we were more like couples than friends. start to call each other nick names and send love msgs. But there has always been a problem between us. we havent met each other b4. i dunno when ever i try to ask her out she will give me silly reasons like her aunt will not allow. busy with exams.<br>if its exams i dont mind i ask her to meet after it. she said ok but to change her mind when that day closes. ending up till today we havent meet at all. but she ask if i will wait for her for 3 yrs after her studies overseas to be with her and meet her. till today i havent even seen her pic. which i ask for for the past 1.5 yrs. everytime she will say she sent it but never reach me. the only time that reach me was when she send me her 12 yr old pic. which was like taken 7 yrs back. now i am in a mess should i even wait for her or love her?<br>anyone out there helllppppppppppppppp.<br></div>
