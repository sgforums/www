            <div class='col-md body'>Well, that Portion from Master Yun was a good one.<br><br>EC (Didn't know the initial is that. Take down notes).<br>Love?<br>Selective Perception. (Wham Bam, Home Run!)<br><br>On a serious note. You might have thought that it's difficult to let go of this 'relationship', and afraid she/you couldn't take it.<br>Ultimately, if you were to count the cost thru all these efforts. It's a No WIN situation...until both parties meets up.<br>Meeting up will be a whole new ball game altogether. When it reaches the next level. Let me know.<br><br>The phone calling, breaking up and patching back are all kiddy play. EC plays a very crucial part in this scene.<br>It creates mind games and led you to play her game.<br>(I don't know her personally, so i'm not in the right to tell you if she's cheating on you or not. But I may be right that she could be cooking up stories, not all of it...but a part.)<br>You're uncontrollably into it, and i attribute to EC.<br>EC could simply cause a person succumb into <strong>Deluded State of affection</strong>.<br><br>&gt;&gt;&gt;The deluded may have thought he/she know the other party and understands he/her very well.<br>Deluded felt so close emotionally to the other half that he could trust...believe her.<br><strong>Lastly, Deluded would not know the Real person he's talking to but chose to believe the virtual person. </strong><br><br>My view: You're under her mercy, all requests could be turned down, left you hanging in the air.<br>A male should not hang in the air for too long...depending on your patience. When the guy hangs too long...it proves the point evenmore that she could control all requests, in fact, everything.<br>You can go crazy or helpless, for all she care. She doesn't know what the Fish you're going thru.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow"> My Advice: Get a grip, make a decision. Meet up or break up.<br><br>Do self check, reflection and learn thru.<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"> If you were to let her go one day, you'd realise that your recovery rate is actually faster then you thought.<br><br></div>
