I read their postings and I can say that what the TS is experiencing is very real, if not, possible.<br><br>Just like how schoolboys form a clique and tease unceasingly a target - usually a girl of course, these girls try to adopt what the guys do. They form a clique and choose a target. TS is the target and this girl would have been dared and goaded by her group to go for it.<br><br>What's their purpose? AMUSEMENT, FUN, A SUBJECT MATTER THEY CAN DISCUSS DAILY with reports from this girl.<br><br>The TS's reactions will either add fuel or water to the fire of the chase.<br><br>TS, just regard them as 'childish' pranksters and don't show that you are afraid or irritated. In fact, fear and irritation are the fuels for the girl to keep on harassing you.<br><br>If this girl wants to be close to you, let her...keep quiet and show no reaction. You know, like a block of wood? If that's how you're going to behave whenever you are in her presence, she'll soon get tired of her quest. You will become 'no more fun' to her and the group.<br><br>Btw, take a lot of raw onions/cheese when you are near her.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_twisted.gif" alt="Twisted Evil" title="Twisted Evil"></div>

This will certainly help! Or maybe, you will want to do the reverse - Show her all the attention that she ever needs; I suspect that she might be doing it just to irritate you, perhaps because she knows you hate that kind of attention. Or she has genuine feelings for you<br><br>Anyway, ask yourself, if you do have any feelings for her at all? I mean, from your description, it seems that you really do have a pretty bad impression of that girl. Perhaps view it more positively? I mean, when you are negative about something, your view is block and thus you'll tend to see only the bad side of it.<br><br>I can tell that you are the sort of guy that will get embarassed pretty quickly. Perhaps you want to use this opportunity to change it? You know, you will lose out a lot by being shy/easily embarassed e.g. ever been in a stituation where there is the last piece of chicken wing left and you friend asks if you want it. You do, but is shy to take it. So you lie that you don't want it. In the end, your friend takes it. You have just lost something. If this was bigger, in monetary terms, you would have lost big time.<br><br></div>
