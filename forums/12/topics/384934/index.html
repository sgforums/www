              <p>A real friend won't keep criticizing u, but give constructive comments or advice. Seems like she's one sort of a shallow person who doesn't think what she says and only gives hurtful remarks. Why bother hanging around with her? Your dignity and pride will only get damaged if you continue to stay with her as friends.</p>
              <p>U are not the mean person here, she is. Don't blame urself for wadever criticisms she has made of u. Be strong.</p>

              <p>I have a friend..I used to treat her like my best friend.
              Sometimes I feel that she doesn't appreciate my loyalty to her. I
              always help and give her moral support but she never do the same to
              me. Instead, she starts to criticise me when things starts to get
              better for me. She never support my idea and give me encouragement
              whenever I encounter problems in life. I just feel that she is
              being very selfish person. I realise I involved in alot of gossips
              whenever she is around in a group and affects me to start talking
              behind people's back.</p>
              <p>All along I havent been very smooth in career prospect due to my
              weak personality. I always talk to her and she never advice me much
              but just answer me things like "is it..oh no choice bla bla.."
              sometimes she even avoided my calls when I need someone to talk
              to.</p>
              <p>There's once I helped her the whole day for her wedding from
              morn till night she never appreciate and say that I did a bad job
              for helping. I tried to defend myself and she insist on the
              criticism. I was very angry initiatly but I still forgive
              her. And recently, because I am going back to school to study
              to get better opportunities and partly to find new direction. She
              starts to criticise me again. Because of my unsmooth career, she
              stab me by saying that I am a failure in life dats why I have
              switched my career direction. She say that in a very rude
              expression and I felt sad about it. I don't feel like forgiving her
              but she keep texting me she show that she is remorse for saying
              those stuff. Sometimes I think if she is worth being my friend or
              not? Am I wasting my time for friends like her? Am i too mean to
              ignore her like that?</p>

              <p>Hi snowieyun,</p>
              <p>You may treat her like a best friend, but it is likely that she is treating you as an item. I agreed with Miss Tiny that she is a shallow person, and I will like to add on that she doesn't see you as anything more than someone whom she can make use of.</p>
              <p>Most importantly, you must realise by now that there is no friendship between the two of you - The relationship between the two of you is more akin to that of an user and a tool. You have chosen to forgive her a few times before, but she doesn't change even in the slightest, thus it is likely that she will go back to her old self once you tell her you forgive her. </p>
              <p>However, I do not have the right to ask you to leave someone whom you feel so dear to yourself, but I sincerely hope that you will make an appropriate choice.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Hi snowieyun,</p>
              <p>Please do not think of yourself as weak. You have already shown an incredible strength which many people lack - The willingness to forgive wholeheartedly.</p>
              <p>Although it is common for soft-hearted and kind people to be made use of and bullied, you shouldn't change yourself into someone similar to those who bullied you, or abandon your heart of kindness. </p>
              <p>From such experiences, you will learn to be stronger, and judge fairly for yourself who are those that are true friends to you. This will also allow you to share your kindness more with those who are deserving of it.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>Once you ignore them long enough they will get the idea. To forgive others when they hurt you so badly already made you a strong person. However, it is important to know who to share your kindness with, and who to ask to talk to your hand. </p>

              <p>Hi snowieyun,</p>
              <p>You are indeed a very kind person to worry that they will be hurt even though they have hurt you so much, but sometimes we can't avoid hurting someone, unless we want ourselves to be hurt. You may not realise it, but every time they send you a message, it reminds you of what had happened before, and you are hurt by the memories once again.</p>
              <p>I will suggest that you change your phone contacts if you really do not wish to confront them, though it will be better to be direct and honest and tell them that you wish to end your "friendship" with them.</p>
              <p>Cheers.</p>

              <p>To tell you the truth, they are playing with you.</p>
              <p>They know you can be swayed. They know if they whine, and whine some more, you have no resistance and will give in. They purposely act pitiful just to get you.</p>
              <p><em>"Please lah, Please lah, help me lah, please lah pleeeease</em>...." you relent and then they laugh behind your back. </p>
              <p>The purpose of such people is actually to train you to be more circumspect about people. If  you do not learn, the lesson will be repeated, again and again, until you learn.</p>

              <p>I have a friend..I used to treat her like my best friend. Sometimes I feel that she doesn't appreciate my loyalty to her. I always help and give her moral support but she never do the same to me. Instead, she starts to criticise me when things starts to get better for me. She never support my idea and give me encouragement whenever I encounter problems in life. I just feel that she is being very selfish person. I realise I involved in alot of gossips whenever she is around in a group and affects me to start talking behind people's back.</p>
              <p>All along I havent been very smooth in career prospect due to my weak personality. I always talk to her and she never advice me much but just answer me things like "is it..oh no choice bla bla.." sometimes she even avoided my calls when I need someone to talk to.</p>
              <p>There's once I helped her the whole day for her wedding from morn till night she never appreciate and say that I did a bad job for helping. I tried to defend myself and she insist on the criticism. I was very angry initiatly but I still forgive her. And recently, because I am going back to school to study to get better opportunities and partly to find new direction. She starts to criticise me again. Because of my unsmooth career, she stab me by saying that I am a failure in life dats why I have switched my career direction. She say that in a very rude expression and I felt sad about it. I don't feel like forgiving her but she keep texting me she show that she is remorse for saying those stuff. Sometimes I think if she is worth being my friend or not? Am I wasting my time for friends like her? Am i too mean to ignore her like that?</p>

              <p><br>If you don't know what you must do, then you should continue as her friend until you are able to come up with a decision by yourself.</p>
              <p>It's rude for us to tell you what you must do with your lives and your friendship only hearing your side of the story.</p>

              <p>Thanks u guys for being very encouraging..I will try my best to overcome this difficult time in my life. Though that was a very hard decision. Seriously, I treasure my friendship with this friend  but people changed which is something that is not within my control.  I think the only way is to forgive her in heart then move on and will use my time wisely on how to improve on myself for the better and treat her criticism as a reminder. i will be strong..</p>

              <p>Well, all that u did for your friend came with expectations - and that is where u erred lar.</p>
              <p>Pix this - if u had not expected anything but did it out of love or whatever u feel it to be so - u would not face this predicament. Unless the word 'friend/friendship' is just a means to an end. Ur end? her end?</p>
              <p>I cannot tell u what to be - just know this lar - what u accumulate will eventually surface later - it would be wise to be grateful and unlearn  or one can hold grudges and store grievances and live - whichever the situation - what is in u will surface.</p>

              <p>You don't overcome it "one day". You learn as you go along, as you grow and learn.</p>
              <p>You must learn from your past, and from what just happened. Things may not happen right, but let it happen only once. Its ok to be tricked once, or be outsmarted, or bungle, but learn from it and avoid a repetition. That you must do.</p>
