Why choose a husband like that since you seems so troubled? It's not just about your mum you know.. It's also about your own life... Then again... You seems to be worrying so much of even the little things sometimes...? (unrelated to this topic)<br><br>Since your mum's place is 1 room... Is the place worth much? How about trying to get a new place for her which might be much nearer to you so that you can go over to look after her often...? Or if not... Try to rent a flat or room nearby where you're living? Possible?</div>

N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). Clearing of the mucus can be helped with taking about 500 mg. of N Acetyl Cysteine. This will loosen the mucus and caused it to be liquified, thus reducing the obstruction.<br><br>2. Magnesium. People with COPD have been linked to magnesium deficiency, a potential problem because magnesium is needed for normal lung function<br><br>3. Eucalyptus Essential Oil inhalation. Eucalyptus tends to destroy whatever pathogens that's causing the inflammation of the lungs. However this tends to have a drying effect but does clear the breathing, so temporary use is acceptable, but not too much<br><br>4. CoQ10. Researchers have also given coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) to people with COPD after discovering their blood levels of CoQ10 were lower than those found in healthy people.<br><br>5. Avoid smoking and second-hand smoke. Exposure to other respiratory irritants, such as air pollution, dust, toxic gases, and fumes, may aggravate COPD and should be avoided when possible.<br><br>6.
