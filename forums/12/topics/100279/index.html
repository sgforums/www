Obviously most will agree that he's out to play and that she will lose out for sure. Be it whatever advice you want, it's just a support you need from others for helping her think about getting out of the relationship. However, it is only HER who has her final decision in giving or not. Many times, it'll probably be a temptation to her. However, SHe has to bear her own responsiblity in the decision she makes and all you can do is say what you feel is best for her and be there for her when she needs you.</span></div>
