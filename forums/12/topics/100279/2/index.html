            <div class='col-md body'>hi hi..... hmm.. I think your friend now probably.. doesn't feel good too. If she's 20 she would be mature enuff to know what is going on, and what is her game! And that, she would probably be called as a home-wrecker if pple gets to know about the relationship.....<br><br>Right now, she's in love with a man of 40's..... so, probably, alot of pple cannot take the age gap difference. and, previously.. some commented that 40's is already old man... But, hey.... you're wrong.....<br><br>Let me explain a little......<br><br>Man's golden age = 30 - 45.... golden age meaning.. the best time of a man.. be it appearance and looks... that's the time when you can really get attracted by their charisma and charms..... Becoz, they grown mature and been thru life, they be able to take care of the girl.. well and dote on the girl.... especially they are financially stable and hence, their mentality is more or less stable, unlike the younger man at their 20s. So, don be surprised if you see an age of 20 over girl with an age of 40 over man.. Afterall, girls need security, attention and alot of alot of love, care and concern.<br><br>Girls golden age = 18 - 33..... golden age meaning.. the best look of a girl, best figure, best skin, best elasticity... with great boobs and bum.<br><br>Its not perverted of an old man to come after a young girl. Its their concept... they probably, love to go out with young girls.. makes them feel young, bring back the old memories.... and make him feel happy and energetic... On the other hand, the girl feels secured, cared and concern... and being showered with so much love.... hence, the "odd couple" would not feel ODD AT ALL!  Its FRESH NEW and happily ever after...hmm.. but however, such relationships doesn't last.... becoz, the age gap would be a PROBLEM after the passion dies off.... The needs and the activities they have.. would be entirely different.<br><br>what you probably could do is maybe, widen her social circle..... come out with her more often.... If I am not wrong, as time goes by.. the things that she like would slowly become things that pple that has got mature age likes becoz, she is in love with a mature man. And usually, she probably wear something more mature to suit the man of her love. So, you probably could let her realize that, hey.... be energized.. get something youthful.... Go for more youthful activities.... maybe, clubbing? erm.. or... going out with youngsters....<br><br>There is no right or wrong.....becoz nobody has did it right. Anyone here that hasn't sinned before????? So, don condemn her if her choice is to continue the relationship with the married man. Warn her to be more careful, after all the guy's more mature than him... DEFINITELY more EXPERIENCED. So, get her to prepare herself... she is in a "GAME" now.

I agreed... that its not right....going out to have an affair.... in fact... the married man or wife goes out having extra-maritial affairs... could be charged to court for adultery... However, if these kind of affairs could be controlled.. the divorce rates in sg.. won't be getting higher and higher...<br><br>Its just a kind of situation where we see in singapore... Marriage, is a bond signed under some witnesses.... in ROM. its a cert to verify that you both are man and wife.... When, they vow... to be together in rich, poor, sick, healthy.... but, how many can really do that? How many really mean it??? <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"> (sorry, if I sound too negative.. but, guess that's the fact of life!)<br><br>Marriage bonds two persons together.... what keeps it going on, the passion... the love for each other.... the concern... the accompany and many more factors.....<br><br>Love... is just like a plant, adequate water, sunlight and fertilizers are needed regularly to let the plant bloom. If you don do that to maintain the plant... after a while, how much amount of sunlight, water and fertilizers wont revive the plant back to life! The same for marriage....<br><br>hmm.. we often blamed pple or scrutinize pple for doing wrong... but, did we take a look at ourselves?? hmm... we probably.... did wrong in another way too....<br><br>sorry if I am too direct... as usual.. just wanna hit the bull eye</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My dear friend,for I do not know you personally or friend.But my only advice is to stay off married couples and don't ever get involve cos there wouldn't be a happy ending.This thing actually happen to a friend of mine.Her hubby is often busy working but very nice responsible person,then the wife felt bored at home so starts to go nightspots mixing with her other female friend,and from there she got to know this guy who is like 10 years younger than her,my this friend is about 35 years old now,sweet pretty good looking so I guess thats what attract other guys.Her relationship with this new guy goes on,but later part the hubby found out,so I guess you know what happened to them in the end.Good thing is that finally she made up her mind to carry on with her own family.Until today she kind of like feel bad about what happen before,so pls kindly advice your friend to leave that guy alone.I'd say that man is merely looking at younger ladies for some thrill,and youe female friend will be the loser for sure once that man had bedded her.Sorry if my message is too long here,thks for reading...stay happy everyone</div>
