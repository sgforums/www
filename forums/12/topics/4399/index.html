            <div class='col-md body'>As a guy, i personally dun agree tt such a mindset exists. I think it's a question of whether the guy or gal find the love of the opposite sex necessary for himself or herself. If a person doesn't believe in relationships, he/she can think of 1001 reasons why he/she can live alone.<br><br>Besides, i find it hard to accept it when anyone says tt he/she doesn't need the opposite sex....caus we are humans..and love is an impt part of life...</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>I'm a disgrace to the female population...that's what alot of my friends say. I'm rely alot on my bf. Everything is bf bf...bf comes first before anything else. I can do alot of things willingly for him. Like changing myself, listening to whatever he wants me to do. They always say I'm an obedient gf lor. Hehe. Well...I personally feel lah...I change myself for him, becos I love him, becos I love him, whatever I do for him, I'm happy. I dun feel suppressed or feel that I'm forcing myself to change. I feel happy when I do things for him. I want to spend my time with him. I dun go cheong with my friends cos he say gals shouldn't stay out late...so I dun go...anyway I'm not interested either.<br>I'm the kind who can't live without him. Hehe. Call me a weakling...cos I admit I am lah. I still have the thinking that a woman's place is at home. Being able to make the perfect homemaker is my greatest goal in life. I'm currently undertaking BSc...but I'm trying to learn to cook, knit and iron my own clothes, wash the dishes etc etc (cos I used to have maids to do these for me...then when no maid, my mom will do it). My Bsc...hmm...I dun really care if I get first class or not...I just wanna pass, go Australia with my bf, wait for him to finish studies then get married.<br>But I must say, alot of woman out there are very career minded and very 'big woman' lor...they really think that without guys, they won't die...but alot of them no bf so they'll say these lah. Like my sister...last time she also say she no guy won't die...she dun think she wanna get married at all...all she want is money and that's enough. Now leh...she's so troubled over her love life. Had three bfs liao...and get so upset when she broke up with them. Who says she no need guys.<br>I guess at different points in life, one will have different ideas and thinkings. Maybe now I seems like I'll die without my bf, but who knows if I break up with him (touch wood), I may also think that no guy won't die.<br>Alot of gals (not saying ALL) dun really mean what they say. Like my friend, she always say she dun foresee herself marrying her current bf, and she dun give a damn about him, she dun care if he two-timed her...but what happens? She still felt sad when her bf two-timed her, she refused to break up with him...still say she love him and dun wanna leave him and that she cannot live without men. Hmmm...quite fickle minded as in now she can say she no need guy, the next min she say she cannot live without them. It's like guys make them love and hate at the same time. Love but scared of being hurt by them. Hai...women can be a complex creatures at times.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>maybe bcos in terms of education and career, females no longer lag behind, in fact in sg, they tend to be ahead by 2.5 years if u know what i mean.  So they are not dependant on the male counterpart anymore.  Plus, females are outnumbering males, and many, not all, are setting their standards way too high.... watch to much US sitcoms maybe...<br><br>anyhoo, its down to the chemicals in our body lah, nature will take its course, whatever will be will be....  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>well if you think that women and men are equal.. then I think you're wrong.. In fact they can never be equal.. I'm not MCP, but just taking fact from books and the society... Not doubt women are more independent now than before. and we even have some career women in the society which tey earn a lot... and my single-parent families, where we have the mother working hard to bring her child or children up...<br><br>BUT, at this point of time, there is still unequality.. They have earn a lot more, but the position they are holding and the same number of years of experience, it still bring them less then what guys get for their salary. Even in the American society, it's working this way as well. For Singapore, they put this 'difference' in salary termed under NS, which gives the govt or company the excuse to pay guys more without showing discrimation.<br><br>Another example is one that is very obvious during recessions like now. They claim that thousands of people have got no jobs!!! but you have to look at the statistics on how many people are man and how many are women. I can tell you almost 70% or maybe even 80% are women... because guys are normally thought to bring $$$ for the family. but I doubt any govt will give this sort of statistics, because it's sexist.<br><br>Still there's lots of other myths are independent and equal... No doubt the situation is better... but the prejudice is still lying beneath the system...<br><br>------------------<br>()""()     ************************<br>( 'o' )     Barely Bearing Berry Belly Bear<br>(,) (,)   =======================<br>(.)_(.)
