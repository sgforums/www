              "It was her who initiated the break up.
              The reasons are bullshit to me, they are excuses rather than reasons or causes."
              
              The above statment was made by you rite?
              
              1) You never state her reason at all. No matter how bullshit reason you may think it is, it is important for us to know to find out the real reason behind it all.
              
              2) most of the time we overlook the main cause of the problem and jump straight into advicing but I wish to find out more before I make any judgement.
              
              3) Do you know that make the above statment only shows that you totally do not respect her at all. When you love someone, you do not think that their words are bullshit.
              
              
              Respect others first so that others can respect you in return.

              <p>I have been reading this reputable and useful aunt agony forum and wanted some advices on what I should do right now. This is my problem.</p>
              <p>My ex is still in the same class as me.</p>
              <p>Everyday without fail, she'll filrt with almost every guy in the class, whether its on studies, jokes or anything. This irritates and affected me immensely on my emotional status. Even though we are no longer together, the sight of her smiling with other guys triggers a strong volume of jealousy deep within.</p>
              <p>The worst thing is, I don't know how to get rid of this jealousy problem, even though I know we can no longer be together. I even tried to walk out of the classroom during lunch hours just to avoid seeing her with those guys, but to no avail.</p>
              <p>This caused me to become moody every now and then. I have also tried every possible ways to extinguish my feelings for her eg. thinking of other girls, studying real hard, sleeping etc. I am really at loss of what to do.</p>
              <p>So fellow SGforumers, please advise me on what can I do to avoid sinking into depression and dropping in my grades. Your help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you all from the bottom of my heart. </p>

              <p><br>hey abang,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>u no need worry  so much.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>1.  a gal who likes to flirt. what loss is there ?</p>
              <p>     its a blessing you not attached with her! save so much trouble!</p>
              <p>     u wanna be a cuck.... noris?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>2.  u looking for good gal who can be wife or a sex-toy?</p>
              <p>     look at the character. could she be a good faithful wife when one likes to flirt? remember character and sex-drive of a person cannot change much.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i suggest this:</p>
              <p>1. find any nice / decent looking gal and flirt with her and this will make you feel better. i think your ex is trying to slice your heart. some bitc.... are like that. they like to get attention from as many man as there is.  some where deep deep real deep down inside, they shiok. these are usually no more virg. u want second hand ar?</p>

              <p>the reason why i do not wish to state her reasons for breaking out is that it would expose me.</p>
              <p>anyway, one of them which is not so obvious would be her saying 'it just didnt work out' after a date wif her.</p>
