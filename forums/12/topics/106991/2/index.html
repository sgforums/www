No proper reason means no reason to give him the money~<br><br>pls do help me.. i'm doing a poll down here and i wan to show mine bf not all guys does tat to hurt their stead..<br><br>A poll? Do you think he bothers? If he bothers to do those actions stated above, do you think he would change? Man has a weird but strong sense of pride. Using others to threaten his dominance would only make him more defensive and thus spoil the whole relation. Try reasoning it out with him, if he tries to dominate the talk, bring in a good friend of yours and his as the center man/woman . Keep the topics private. Remember, talk with reason. Guys tend to argue poorly as their emotions take over during arguements. Careful to take note of his emotions during arguement. A guy that can be violent to you would do so in front of others to show that he's in control. TAke Care. Though.. i believe this relationship won't last long.. Even if it lasts, You wouldn't be happy. Trust us.<br>[/b]</blockquote></div>

As subzero_baby has mentioned, even if you hold on to him, he <strong>WILL</strong> break up with you sooner or later.
