            <div class='col-md body'>Well, this is reality of life... loneliness will come at times but it will also go away. Its your birthday... at least try to enjoy yourself and take your mind off things. Don't think so much about the past if its sad memories but think of the happy memories. There is a saying "its better to loved and lost than to never at all". So just be happy that she was once part of your life... but life has to go on! Good luck and all the best for your next relationship!</div>

Maybe you do need more time... time can heal the wound and pain but it would never ever remove those memories. Just remember to take it easy and be happy. If you do get another relationship, at least you are a little more exprience now so you handle your new relationship better.</div>
