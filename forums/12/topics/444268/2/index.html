              <div class="quote_body">
              <p>First and foremost, you seem to be very interested to know your
              friend's situation, you seem to have very high stake in the
              situation. Not sure if you are really the guy or the girl, in the
              story.</p>
              <p>Should not jump to conclusion. It is very hard to conclude if
              the secretary is interested in him. Your friend should not make it
              a joke to say the secretary teasing is his girlfriend, it can cause
              misunderstanding.</p>
              <p>If your friend doesn't like the secretary to tease and matchmake
              him, he should stop telling the teasing secretary to be his
              girlfriend (as a joke). This is because she would matchmake him
              even more, as she would want to find out more if he is interested
              in her, to eventually make him blurt out that he likes her. Not
              generally but some women, like the guy to say these things, because
              it makes them feel more wanted. But it doesn't mean these women
              like the guy, they just want to hear it that the guy likes them.
              When the guy say these things as a joke, they tend to fester and
              build strong crush on the girl, eventually he may not able to
              resist and confess his love to her. The final result is not good,
              once the secretary finds out, she would leave him high and dry as
              she is only interested to know how he feels about her.</p>
              <p>Simply make it clear and tell the secretary to stop it. If it
              goes on, keep quiet and ignore. Better concentrate on the job
              because all these distractions can lead the boss to think that he
              is out of focus on his job.</p>
              <p>I think your friend is not realistic, in saying that he would
              only marry when he achieves $5,000 a month salary. Sometimes, when
              love comes, he has to grasp that opportunity, it only comes once in
              a blue moon. Having said that, I am not saying that the teasing
              secretary is the one love that he should be chasing, because it
              seems that their relationship is only at platonic level. I have
              known a lot of guys who earn $5,000 a month, still single. Monetary
              is important but it is not all omnipotent in finding life partner.
              On the other hand, I have known people who earn $3,000 or $2,500 a
              month yet they are married at younger age.</p>

              <p><br>Reality is that all couples argue. There is no perfect marriage. Yes some divorce. Ultimately it is up to you whther you feel marriage is right for you or not. SOme marriages work, some don't work, some marriages carry on in misery for the sake of the children growing up.</p>
              <p>Sometimes being rich doesn't guarantee a happy marriage. I know a rich businessman who doesn't get along with his wife because of money. Yes being poor also don't guarantee happy marriage. So should one strike a balance? Be middle class? Not too rich, not too poor? I don't have the answers.</p>
              <p>I am no expert in marriage. But i get a lot of feedback from friends. Some tell me the happiness in marriage are the children. Less the wife.</p>
              <p>Marrying young has its benefits. Its easier to bear children. It is sad when I see some couples who marry in their 30s try very hard to have children but fail - they pay a lot of $$$ to fertility clinics. I am not saying people in their 30s cannot have children, it is just harder.</p>
              <p>Also by the time you earn the level of $$$ you want in order to get married and established, you would have found many of your friends already married, your group of friends less and less. So it is harder to meet people especially the potential life partner. Usually people prefer to marry people at same age. You don't normally see a 32 year old guy going out with a 25 year old. Of course, got but not very often.</p>

              <p>Yes true.</p>
              <p>Marriage got risk. Sometimes we don't really know. Go dating that day, we think this person is perfect for us. Then marriage, the glow of the romance start to wear off, then tension. Divorce or stay on can happen. Ultimately we must ask ourselves, do we want to commit to marriage? Sometimes when we want something badly, do we have to try? When a person wants to start a family, he or she knows there are risk of divorce and unhappiness, what should the person do? Wouldn't be to try as the first step?</p>
              <p>Sometimes we thik about it, marriage is scary prospect. It could make you feel so good then somehow divorce can destroy your life. Then again, living alone also is a scary prospect. Nobody want to die alone. Nobody want to live alone, watching all their friends marry, siblings marry and then parents one day will pass away - leaving us alone. Ultimately one must make or risk the decision - should marry or celebate? </p>

              <p>My dear, marriage is a legal process, if 2 persons want to come together, they actually do not need to marry or make and announcement for the whole world to know.</p>
              <p>But in the abiding laws, you need to get marry to have legal child, buy flats or house, being legally recognise in law as husband and wife. It is a legal binding. Just like if you want to buy a car here, you need to register.</p>
              <p>It had somehow become a human life process, meaning after you were born, grow up, educated, work, become an adult, get married, have a family, grow old, sick and die. This is a typical human life process, and most peoples go by such rules of thumb, but it is not a requirement if you choose not to, however, since it become so common and usual, being single like us become a strange and out of normal process in life, but if you are open up, that is not the case, I hv the right to remain single, take single seat, book single room and sleep in a single bed.</p>
              <p>Be yourself, dun be pull by the process which is not a necessities in life, marrying and set up family is not compulsory in life, it is just a traditional believes, because it had been past down since donkey years.</p>

              <p>THat is why, it is up to the individual. Some prefer to remain single. Some prefer to marry. Ultimately up to you.</p>
              <p>External life influences can be very burden. Very hard to avoid the social pressures. If you have done so, I congratulate you.</p>
              <p>I don't know about singapore, I know in western country they got domestic partner policy. No need to get married. Guy and girl live together and then start family. The australian Prime Minister, Julia Gillard is first PM to have domestic partner.</p>
