Her relationship with 'G' has been quite long and is quite a factor for 'G' to detour (at least probably so based on G's form of mentality). Chances of stray is quite high. 'G' is a bit like lost sheep because he wants in and at the same time (probably subconsciously) he wants out. Hence the confusion within himself. Note that he could have broke off with 'B', but he went back to 'check on her'. Despite her age. Despite her past commitment to this relationship. If she knows what's good for her it's time for her to move on. High chance is the future with 'G' won't be a bright one. Added on A's nature.

'B' probably know about A's sucidal acts and tendencies quite a while ago. Chances of 'B' being suicidal now is quite LOW. It can also be a fabrication on G's part. 'B' is indeed quite strong like 'G' has described and know how to take care of herself. Her suicidal act (probably not many) is just a follow-up of the attention 'A' is getting from her suicidal tendencies if it's true and not a fabrication by 'G'. She's probably 'MOST willing' to let go if not for her stubborness. She probably felt VERY CHEATED by 'G' in a way. You probably can tell from the way she talk to you IF she's sincere in her conversation with you... Else, she's probably just hiding it.<br><br>'G' probably deserves more of 'B' than 'A'. And deserves the outcome he'll have with her. A bit like the 'short-term' &amp; 'long-term' investments Yun was talking about... He finds 'B' rather attractive but does not provide for the kind of security that 'A' can give. YET, he's probably unwilling to just let go of 'B' based on the little doubts he might hold. Yes, he may be CONFUSED &amp; 'TRAPPED'. YET, he's probably the KEY FACTOR in this relationship. His heart is NOT fixed. 'WHAT he WANTS?' is the QUESTION. And he'll have to be DECISIVE in his acts.<br><br>Regards.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>sorry that i have to say this harshly but then its definitely G's fault cos he started all this so he has to finish it.<br><br>one more thing.. is G the only guy in the world that 2 gals have to die for him.? i cannot stand this attitude of commiting suicide, esp for a guy like this. there are more things in a life than just a failed relationship. I do hope u can let the gals understand that. There are many more people who are in worse situations and still thinking about how to live the next day.<br><br>my suggestion is that u tok to both gals about the importnace of their lives and the fact that it doesnt not only encircle the guy. then when they realise that and stop thinking about commiting suicide, then u can try to bring them together for a settlement. talk to the guy seperately and then bring them together to settle the situation once and for all.<br><br>if suicide is all they care, i would give them a tight slap myself and ask them wat will happen to their families? esp their parents who fought so hard to bring them up? just throw them away b'cos of a useless guy?? then how about the other friends who care about them.??<br><br>u need to be strict to them to wake them up.. but be gently so that they will listen.. so u need to work on that b4 u talk to the gals. if u knwo any more friends who thay are comfortable with, get them to go along to help talk or at least be there just in case they are more dumb to go commit suicide straight after hearing you out.<br><br>All the best and i hope u succeed. btw that G-guy, tell him if anyone dies, its on his conscience forever cos he started all these, and so he better wake up his idea and resolve this properly.<br><br>at least he has a friend like u to help. all the best.</div>

At least not for long... Sticking with 'G' would only get herself DEEPLY HURT... 'G' don't deserves neither of them ('A' or 'B')... ie. he fled in sight of trouble... Chances of him flirting (or 2-timing) again is rather high... Can 'A' ACCEPT that?<br><br><strong>A is very stubborn,i told her something like that before, but she say she is willingly to wwait for G to change  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_neutral.gif" alt="Neutral" title="Neutral"> ''' i beleive she willlor, coz she waited for him during poly days to break up with his first gf.</strong><br><br>If she can accept that, she probably can just simply see the outcome of 'B' and 'G' quite SOON enough...<br><br>Regards.<br><br>PS. Sorry, got to work. <strong>no problem  </strong><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"> </blockquote></div>
