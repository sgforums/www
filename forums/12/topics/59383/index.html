            <div class='col-md body'>B always break down whenever she is alone G knows all this but there's nothing that G could do as A also love G as much as B and A been a longer period with him.<br><br>B one day becomes very sad and angry when she thought of what A and G is doing and attempted committing suicide by cutting wrist but it was unsuccessful.. and then had an asthma attack, lucky it was not serious. G dunno what to do as he dislike them doing this as he feel that B dunno how to treasure life, beginning to feel "fan gan" towards B. heartache to see A and B suffer too..<br><br>both B and A are my friends, or rather G is my friend and i know B and A thru them. all 3 parties confide in me in their troubles.<br><br>G - very stress always have to scare tat he will make either party very unhappy and might make them lose thier lives as both have "suicidal threats" on top of that, G has its own sets of problems like work and family too, most of the time confides in B as he feels that B understands him more, however after the suicide incident, he told B that "actually i find that u dun understand me at all" meaning he had lost all hope in B..<br><br>B - very very "cake-sim" liao... but cant see herself losing... lost control over herself n commit suicide.. so afriad tat G might not love her anymore....<br><br>A - also very "cake-sim" but still have faith in him as their relationship is longer. does not understand why G is treating her like that. and is happy now coz G treats her like a queen giving her whatever request she has as long as she "be good" and not create trouble. A felt closer to G and thinks that G loves her too.. but at the same time feel that the relationship is very "empty"<br><br>the attempted suicide of B came to A's knowledge by accident - wrong sms by me.. YES ME!!! i hated myself~~~ now there's more trouble for G coz of me.... anyway G was not angry with me... he just keep asking me HOW....<br><br>what were u do if u were A, B , G??????</div>

He retain the feelings of both lady, yet feeling down because of their reaction and behaviour due to him. If he really cares for:<br><br>A: He wouldn't have two time her and brought in unwanted trouble into the relationship. The crack in the relationship has been very deep and the his consideration to fling and get another girl shows that his relationship with her is descending to destruction. He is not willing to leave because of her tendency to play sucide and because of the 6 years - this is definitely NOT love. Liability, you stay, however, have HE ever have heart-to-heart talk about the problems in the relationship? I doubt a good attempt has been made. He fear this fear that, such an excuse to avoid playing the 'bad guy'. WHATS the use of having a empty relationship? Then what is his reason for remaining in the relationship since he has no possible future and a breakup in the future is definite? (I am pretty sure of this, because of statstics and similiar case studies)  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>B: She has met him in a pub.
