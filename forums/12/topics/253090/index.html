I personally think it will be better to pick a double degree that compliment each other.  Eg.  Bachelor of Science (majoring in Maths - statistic) and Bachelor of finance.<br><br>At the end of the day, you can only find a job based on one of your degrees. I, too, have a double degree - Engineering and Science (major in applied mathematics).  The reason I picked Maths because I enjoyed Maths but I couldn't really get a job for that.  I wished I put a little bit more thought to that at that time and given the choice again, I'd probably choose something that would benefit my engineering degree.<br><br>Anyway, I just hope you don't make the same "mistake" as I did.<br><br>Good luck!!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

I graduated with a Bachelor Degree in Engineering (Hons). That time, our graduation batch and the subsequent batch was the most hit by the recession and the dot.com bust. Even though I have worked as an engineer for 4 years, I took up graduate accountancy conversion masters part-time during that time and presently working as an auditor in one of the international accounting firms. Even though engineering and accountancy are both very different fields and a lot of people feels that it is a career switch that is not advisable, I still manage to prove some of them wrong by engaging mostly engineering companies as my clientele and portfolio and able to see both the engineering aspect and also the financial aspect of the company. It gives me a tremendous edge and I always feel it is the right move and treat it as a form of career integration rather than a career switch.<br><br>Since your aspiration is to work in the banking and finance sector, my advice would be to first obtain a degree in banking and finance and later continue to pursue a CFA while gaining experience in the banking/finance industry. After you have obtained a CFA and also at the same time rise to management level, taking MBA will still not be too late. I have frens who took a break to study MBA full time so as to have a switch from engineering to other sectors also found themselves having to start from bottom or somewhere there.<br></div>
