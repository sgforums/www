            <div class='col-md body'>Love is forever evolving and devolving; changing in intensity. It has no fixed nature of its own. It is a feeling can't be controlled by a remote control. Love can't be defined as it can't be measured.<br><br>There are many types of loves ::&gt; Family love, friendship love, bf/gf love and  love for a stranger. Love does not necessarily need two hands to clap. You can love without expecting anything in return. You can even love a stranger, by showing care and consideration to him.<br><br>If you put in too much love into ONLY someone, you probably will suffer alot when there person is gone but when you spread your love around in the first place, it couldn't be there bad when it is gone.<br><br>When i love ( be if friends, family, bf etc. ), it is probably almost forever and true.
