And if you would read through AA, you would find many models and many interpretations of love.<br><br>Possessive and jealous on one extreme, generous with giving and not asking for return on the other extreme.<br><br>But what is love to you? Your own views on love, your own model of love.<br><br>And at that, I want to pose an additional question:<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Does loving someone means you need to be in a relationship with that person?</span><br><br>This is merely a thread for people to post and perhaps discuss.

I really wish u can also get ur other half bro, thirty is still ok really, hope u dun give up hope, just like u have injected hope in me the last time.<br><br>My advice or rather what i have learned:" If u want to woo a girl, really be hardworking.

            <div class='col-md body'>After reading so many fellow sgforumers' definition of love, perhaps it's time to say mine.<br><br>I believe love is a decision which follows attraction.<br><br>The initial attraction can only go on with the decision to love the person. Not many share this view, I suppose.<br><br>To love someone whom you deem deserving of your love, to care for someone whom you deem deserving of your care. A self-centric model perhaps, but one that self-preserves as well.<br><br>~~~~~~<br><br><img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_arrow.gif" alt="Arrow" title="Arrow">  No one's answering the question on my first post!  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"></div>
