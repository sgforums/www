The more conscious you feel about your surrounding, the more blunders you will made and the more awkward you will face.<br><br>Before anything could begin - make yourself comfortable there FIRST. Seek for familiar faces first, relax around, eat/drink something, start conversation and go on from there.<br><br>Lots of luck!~  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Sucess guys, thanks a lot. I felt great at this thing and i met many new people. Ha somehow this girl i seemed to have "LIKED" and "gotten all NERVOUS about" does not make me feel this way anymore, even though we still clicked and we are friends and all. I just don't feel very infetuated with her anymore haha, i feel kinda liberated and confused about why i feel this way now. Maybe its coz in being there i noticed she and i are not that common after all, or maybe its coz there was another girl who was interested in me there, either way i feel ok. Thanks a lot guys, i did take your advice, i just let go and was myself.<br><br></div>

I am afraid i am gonna make a complete bafoon of myself in front of her and other friends who will also be there lol. I am also slightly afraid that i have screwed up on previous occasions when i did go out with her, but then again, if i screwed up in her book, then why would she still have invited me out with her and friends?<br><br>Ok so i'm just nervous i'm gonna be an idiot at this outing lol. But logically i know what to do; 1. talk to her and know her betta, ask her lots of questions. 2. Possibly brag to her about my probs and stuff; so she can know be betta. 3. Crack jokes and make her laugh.<br><br>What else!?! I am feeling nervous heh.</div></blockquote>dun feel nervous, dun think about it, juz go there n tok to everyone if possible.. or someone nice, if nervous, juz tell directly to her so can start conversation or something. zhuo dao qiao tou zhi ran zhi.</div>
