            <div class='col-md body'>Geez... err If I was not ready to commit.. I would be very freaked out if my partner does all these for me. It is not that it is not good. It is just TOO MUCH TOO SOON. I mean.. geez.. taking out my family members for dinner when I am not around.. is like... infiltrating the Headquarters u know! I mean Unless i REQUEST for him/her to do it.. or else.. I find it a bit too... pushy on this front. AND geez... "you like.. if u like I wear lor" is like.. ... u try to answer " i like u to don't wear.. then u don't wear issit?" better mah.<br><br>I don't know if you are getting punished or not. BUt I do know putting in TOO much effort in a relationship TOO soon is just as bad as not contributing enough. It makes the other party dont have enough opportunity to 'sacrifice' cos all the work done by one party liao. Which is why people just shouldnt TRY too hard - Quality is more important than Quantity.<br><br>Anyway I think you are just dating to make a point to urself - that u are giving urself a chance ot get to know more girls.. and while they may be attractive.. think perhaps your interest in them simply isn't deep enough for you to put in the effort to know them more. Plus the subconcious desire to punish urself maybe pushes u away from commitment. hurhurhur.<br><br>What you need is to get 'tekan' by another older wiser woman. Someone who abuses ur feelings, wakes up your heart and then hurt it. THen suddenly you will be back in the field again. Need to repay ur debt.. then u can make money again.</div>
