But my story isn't so typical of a stereotyped young urban homo out there in the streets... because i'm not exactly homosexual, given the chance, i'd be straight... trust me on that<br><br>why am i writing this blog? again, i can talk to no one about this... no im not horrified or traumatised by my experience or whatever, i just wanna share my side of the story, so please save your counselling and saintly advices for someone else.<br><br>if you respect me please respect my writing. no scathing response please, im too lazy to entertain those. for those homophobes please try not to get agitated... for im pretty straight too.. just that circumstances are pretty off the track now.. and please dont refer me to any counseling nonsense, like i said, im happy with myself now and will be... im just happy with the way i am<br><br>im the storyteller here, and i owe nobody nothing... if you like the accounts of my life, continue reading, share your opinions sometimes but if anyone violate any of the above, *poof* account and blog deletion is really easy...<br><br>would you continue reading on? the decision, really, is in your hands.<br><br>regards,<br>quietrevelation<br><br>Posted by quiet revelation at 7:58 PM<br><br>i hope that i can share my experiences (good or bad) with everyone.. please don't hate me just because im different! <a href="http://quietrevelation.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://quietrevelation.blogspot.com/</a></div>

And also, you don't want advices. Then I suggest you should just stick to your blog because posting this in a public forum will definitely attract those thingy.<br><br>To me, this has nothing to do with your homosexuality - you are just selling your soul in exchange of hedonistic, material pleasure. It's the same as women selling themselves, therefore the kind of sex (engaging in homesexual or heterosexual activity) involved doesn't matter - what matters is that it degenerate your soul and damage outlook in love.<br><br>You lived with your choice - although I would say that's a poor way to govern your life in that manner. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_idea.gif" alt="Idea" title="Idea"><br><br>Cheers</div>

He is not really a homosexual but he loves the money the sugar daddy give him.<br><br>so I guess it is a story of play with fire, sometimes you get burnt. It will be difficult to have a normal relationship again. I am just guessing of course. I have no idea what happens to people that becomes pros; male or female.<br><br>In Thailand there was a very big story in the newspapers about a pros (female) that graduated from university. To her at least and to their society, her past didn't seem to matter too much. They expect her to live life normally like everyone else even though she was a pros before.</div>
