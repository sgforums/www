            <div class='col-md body'>It isnt easy to let go.<br>There's always a first time to everything. This maybe the most painful loss of a loved one but also in learning to let go.<br><br>You may find that there maybe a chance there.<br>No doubt. There's also a 50% chance that she wldnt agree and stick to her decision.<br><br>You may like to try...i mean by all means. I wish you good luck.<br><br>However, see that she has decided to let go. It isnt easy as well to decide so unless she has enough reasons to insist on ending this 4-yrs r/ship. It came as a suprise to me when i read that you hardly even sensed it coming your way. How cld it be? Please do some serious reflection. Sit down, clam down to see what has been ahppening for the past four yrs.<br><br>When a feeling dies, it really did.<br></div>
