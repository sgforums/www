            <div class='col-md body'>me, ah? i major in accounting(still got one more mod to retake), damn sianz, accounting has more prospect bah,i think, business &amp; management too general already, and furthermore accounting is not about maths, i am struck lah, my resume, mostly related to claims, and insurance, so every single time, i send resume looking for admin, they(recruit agency) will ask me, i have an opening for account assistant...... for now, if u want, just take any diploma lor, then decide what you want to major in for your degree, you are still young, take your time to decide lor, its easier to find a accounting job, from my opinion, normally take me, only one month, just to find a job. Now starting this new job, oracle sucks!!!!! i still prefer to use sap :-P</div>
