            <div class='col-md body'>DMI, I saw your MSN Nick and didn't want to disturb u further but just a word of advice: Whatever u chose - Be it ITE or retaking of O's, Be sure to put in alot of hard work.<br><br>Because If you do well in ITE, you can proceed to NS and den finally obtaining a Diploma and you can even go on further by obtaining a Degree.<br><br>If you chose to re-take ur O's, be sure to put in double effort. Becos if u chose ITE, at least u have a NITEC or Higher NITEC qualification to fall back on but if u chose to re-take ur O's, u only have 'O' Level Qualification or PSLE Qualification.<br><br>Think about your future and keep out all the other factors like ego and friends because this is your future.<br><br>Cheers.<br>C.K</div>
