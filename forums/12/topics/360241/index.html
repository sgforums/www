              <p><br>Young man, you are only 13 years old. I know that you hate anyone who tries to make you think you are a child, but the truth is that you are not an adult for sure. Just a growing one and confuse with the complexities of life.</p>
              <p>Do be careful with love, espacially for another person other than your family, for you are not ready for that kind of committment. Your emotional level is still in its growing stage.</p>
              <p>Right now your confusion comes from not being able to understand women. Don't worry, most grown men, including myself, still don't. But one thing we do know is that it is best to be friends, espacially at your age.</p>
              <p>Being friends will remove that responsibility of committment to another that you are not ready to bear at this young age. Love is not a toy that you can play with when you please and then chuck it aside when you want something else, even for grown adults.</p>
              <p>Being friends will not have 'nothing to say'. You can talk about anything under the sun - movies, school, subjects, teachers, friends, family, celebrities, etc. Be more of a listener than a talker, then she will feel comfortable talking to you. No one enjoys talking to a braggard or a bore.</p>
              <p>Studies must come first, but i know it can be boring. Unfortunately, it is something we must do well right now, or we will regret later and may not even have a gf when you most need one, because we may not have a good job to support ourselves, let alone a gf and family.</p>
              <p>If she studies in the same school as you, you will still be able to see her daily, so it's like its not that you will see her no more and miss her. She is still a friend, and do have a right to choose her friends, just as you too.</p>
              <p>Remember, it can only be friends now, for you and your peers are not ready or stable enough to handle love and its complexities. Don't bother about others and what they do. Some grow up and mature faster than others. Let you be one of them to be similarly so. Studies must come first, and have friends to enjoy your youth, not steady gf. Your time will come in the future, but not now.</p>
              <p>You will be able to forget her easily at your age, for if you fill your life with studies and good friends with a wider social circle and hobbies, you will have an enjoyable youth and in time forget about her, and cease to want to control her life, regardless alone or she with another bf.</p>

              <p>Cheer up! (:</p>
              <p>I guess you just gotta keep occupying urself with things to do. Don't let urself have time to spare, 'cause 101% you'll end up thinkin of her. You can try going out with your friends, spending time outdoors, it's good to have some fresh air as well.</p>
              <p>I know it'll hurt when she really gets attached, the thing is, deal with it. Forgetting is a very hard thing to do. So the best thing to do is to face the reality. Don't leave everything to forgetting. Forgetting will only come when you're over her.</p>
              <p>Do hope that you'll get over her soon. :)</p>

              <p>Let time take its own natural process to forget. In the meantime, you can play dota, hang around with friends and do something else to be happy with. You can also think why you want to break up with her in the first place - if there reason is valid and strong.</p>
