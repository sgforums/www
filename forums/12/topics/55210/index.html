I am more interested if there are real life expriences. Its very interesting because you never know what might happen.

What would you do if you both went steady for quite some time and one day find out that you both are related. I have read somewhere that there is a couple who is blood related but they don't have kids at all due to the fact that the girl went to tied up her tube and so did the guy. Could love really conquer all things? I just want to know from other people expriences what was it like? It must have been tough... but what issues did they have to handle?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused" title="Confused"></div>

I don't really know if there is any real life expriences but it would be nice to know and learn more. Don't mean to offend anyone who reads this topic, ok?</div>
