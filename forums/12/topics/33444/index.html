She was disappointed cause you didn't take responsibility to call her and let her know of your well-being.<br>Moreover...she's your Leader, means that she will also be responsible in a way, of your actions. She might have felt tat she didn't do her job well enough for you to open up your problems to her.<br>She might even be demoralised and more disappointed of herself in her Leadership, she might have high expectations of you and see you highly as somebody who can do great things.<br>Well....it seems like she never thought you would do this kinda this.

When you're feeling extremely down, you can still go for church services and such even if you're not with your cell group for the time being... But it's always good to let your leader know what's your situation at least in brief....<br><br>If you REALLY can't get along, try to change to a different cell group...? &lt;- But that don't seems to be really that case for you now...?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"></div>
