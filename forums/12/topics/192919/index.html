            <div class='col-md body'>I strongly do not advise you to take A levels as a private candidate. First of all, you cannot take Art alone and be accepted into NIE as an Art teacher, you will have to at least find a couple of subjects to fulfill the minimum requirements of 2As 2 AOs. In additional, the course is relatively different from what you took in dipolma and extra effort will have to be put into first set yourselves to the A level course second to understand the requirements of the exams.<br><br>Alternatively, I will advise you to take up Art dipolma again and then go through the degree course.

If you are good - you never know where opportunities might come by .<br><br>By the way with your talent- why not check out british council because I think they have some creative art scholarships to UK institutions . Might be another route to get around to teach art.  Just a suggestion to build on what you already worked hard for. Don't disregard your diploma - make use of it, just like what I did. The moment you see the beyond - it opens alot of doors.<br><br></div></blockquote>honestly, i dowan to do 'a's if i dont have to, cos it was never my intention. but still, if i have to, i will still clench my teeth and finish it. (though it will definitely be really tedious).<br><br>i still love my design diploma, i have no wish to do interior design but i really appreciate my design education. it opened my eyes and opened my mind, but unfortunately it is not relevant to get myself into an art degree.<br><br>creative art scholarships to UK institutions : moe's minimum criteria is art dip from lasalle or nafa. i thought there might be a chance some art institution might take me with my design dip. but moe doesnt recognise. sheesh.<br><br>I hope someone can help point out some doors for me. I've been walking into many closed doors everywhere i turn. my forehead is all bruised.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>where did you get your diploma from? i can't see why you cannot progress to a degree from there unless your previous institution is a half past six one....don't do 'a' levels, it's a complete waste of time. go on to degree course and create a portfolio of sorts. opportunity comes differently for different people and you'll never know what can open up for you later on. perhaps you may teach art at a higher level than moe schools. so take heart...</div>
