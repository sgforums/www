              the present moment -- an instant without duration. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span class="style12"><span class="style27"><span class="style27"><span class="style45"><span class="style70"><span class="style113">This is reflected in European 
              languages, which have tenses in the past, present, and future. But some peoples, 
              such as the Bantu of Africa, do not have time classes of this sort in their 
              language or social outlook. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span class="style12"><span class="style27"><span class="style27"><span class="style45"><span class="style70"><span class="style113">Many Bantu tongues divide verbs into those concerned 
              with completed and uncompleted actions. They have no future tense because they 
              categorize the future and the present together into a single form concerned with 
              unfinished actions. (Similarly, in English we sometimes say, "I am going to 
              school tomorrow," using the present tense for a future action.)<br>  <br> In the usual Bantu cognitive system, time is quite different from what it is to 
              middle-class Americans, since it consists of a present of long duration and 
              great importance; a past of less importance and moderate duration, such as can 
              be held in personal memory; and almost no future distinguishable from the 
              present.<br>  <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><br> Among some of these people, the future is not conceivable beyond the next few 
              days and certainly has no meaning in terms of years.</strong></span> These people live in and 
              value the present with all its problems, pleasures, and human relationships. 
              Such people, even if they are given birth-control devices, are unlikely to use 
              them, simply because they have no training in subjecting present relations to a 
              hypothetical event nine months in the future.<br>  <br> Such cognitive differences are of great significance, especially when value 
              systems are different. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>The African values the present, whereas many middle-class 
              Americans put all emphasis on the importance of the future and are ready to make 
              almost any sacrifice in the present for the sake of some hypothetical future 
              benefit.</strong></span> In contrast to both, the aristocrat of today, like the ancient Greek, 
              usually puts highest valuation on the past.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

When any infant is born and socialized in a society, even if he is to become a very mature individual, he has been brainwashed. That is, he has been given a structure for categorizing his experience and a system of values applied to that structure of categories. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But in our society, in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, this has now become a propagandist system in which emphasis is put on the future: Think only of the future.</strong></span></span></span></span></span></p>
              <p><span><span><span><span>This is the ideology against which the young people of the 1950's and 1960's rebelled. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Future preference: plan; study hard; save.</strong></span> All the things I used to hear from my maiden aunts: "Wise bees save honey; wise boys save money," and they each secretly gave me a dollar as I was leaving. "A penny saved is a penny earned." "A stitch in time....." Everything that's in "Poor Richard", the Benjamin Franklin propaganda machine.</span></span></span></span></p>
