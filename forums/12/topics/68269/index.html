In our midst of anger, we can claim words that may/may not be right - then again, as we calm down and think, we must learn to understand that everything happens for a reason and we must look beyond surface problems - look at the roots of your relationship. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>You girl obviously has some hidden tension inside her that she may not have expressed her dis-satisfaction. Of course, its really attitude to put her bf down when in reality she should be supporting you. Then again, have you source for that dissatisfaction in her? There are certain things that a woman wouldn't talk until things happen and she will blame you for them. Being a guy - you are cursed by nature of the inability to know what's going on in relationship unless you are told about.<br><br>With the combination of these two - we have a little communication problem and our relationship's 'engine' would jammed.<br><br>Learn to release that tension in her. At least, know why she is reacting in this way. Talk not before the surface issue - you may like to have a soul talk regarding this relationship? At least, when this is done, you both will understand each other better. Your definition of a supporting gf? Tell her, let her know. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt="Rolling Eyes" title="Rolling Eyes"><br><br>Cheers</div>

            <div class='col-md body'><blockquote>Originally posted by antoh:<br><strong>i m totally disappointed wif my gf ... what the fuck is her doing?<br><br>i m very sad sad sad and vex vex vex ...<br><br>i thought she wanted to know me better. </strong><br><br>Perhaps? At least initiately? Who won't wanna know their partner better?<br><br><strong><br>ok fine i juz posted her wif some question regarding my career ...<br><br>she complained i dont have a transport ...  is this what she want? i have told her i wll go for my driving licience and she say i m lousy.<br><br>what is this ?<br><br>arent gf supposed to be supportive?</strong><br><br>2 things...<br><br>1. It could be her partial requirement.<br>2. This is probably the more important one. She's highly anticipating you to accompany her. 'Transport' is a key.<br><br><strong>On personal note. </strong>Remember what I've told you about 'short terms' relationship? Her heart might be swaying. She probably don't wanna leave you just like that (recall putting you as an 'establishment' in her relationship). All the 'coldness' and remarks could be her 'internal struggles'. Yes, it could be a sign of this relationship's drowning. At least from her point of view. And by now I believe, her mentality further enhanced by your response.<br><br><strong><br>ask her what i wanna do in future she also dont know .. everything she say dont know ... how to maintain such relationship ..</strong><br><br>Other than 'internal struggles', there's another point to note. Which is what I'd mentioned to you before. Don't 'LEAN' against her. By asking her opinions about your future and career, she might deem you as someone who don't have own career plans and cannot be relied on. At least you should be avoiding this at this point of the relationship. <strong>2 signs </strong> are AGAINST you. 1st is the crack of your relationship. 2nd is the fact that you're not established with her on a solid ground yet.<br><br><strong><br>she say she is disappointed in me for my rudeness and some other minor issue. such things can be ironed out easily</strong><br><br>From your point of view, they're just 'minor issues'. She can probably thinks quite differently, especially with the current frustrations and disappointments within her. And if she knows that you're just seeing things as 'minor issues', she'll probably sees it as you putting little importance to who she is to you.<br><br><strong><br>i nvr realised she is such a materialistic person .... at least take some effort to know about my fture and stuff like that ... arent that simple .. juz to tell me ...</strong><br><br>Things I've told you and plus some points above. My personal advice here. If she can't accept her character and sees it as materialistic... Better just stop here.<br><br><strong><br>she is extremely selfish and think for herself only ... want ppl to think about her feeling ... </strong><br><br>Her 'selfishness' is due to the fact that she needs to be highly satisfied. And yes. You are right. She needs people to think much about her feelings especially when you're her bf. She can easily label you as being insensitive to her feelings. Despite how strong and demanding she could appear to be. She can have quite a vulnerable heart.<br><br><strong><br>she asked me if i m tired to salvange this relationship? </strong><br><br>It's probably a sign. Might also be a 'judgement' she haves on you. If you really wants to save this relationship. I'll suggest your conversations with her be on a more 'heart to heart' (inner ones) than reality (materialistics ones) for a start. It'll help to pass time as you establish yourself to meet her criterials. And it's relatively easier to work on this one 1st than the other given your curent status and the fact that it's a LDR.<br><br><strong><br>i think i will break up wif her .. </strong><br><br>Has it been established?<br><br>i m simply tired ..[/b]</blockquote></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Remember one thing, u are now very vex about it and this can mislead u into wrong decisions...<br>Try to cast all these prejudgement aside and have a good talk with her. Find out on what basis she based on for all that she have said. U need to let her know your intention also. When things are said differently, it brings different meaning. U maybe  wanting to get some support from her by asking her what u shld do in the future. But will it be better if u ask it in this way : "what do u think abt me doing this in the future" at least for this question, u showed her u have an idea of what u wanna do and is seeking advice or other points of view and not just hoping for answers from others. I think no gf will like to spoonfeed the bf with answers without him thinking through first...<br>good luck</div>
