              <p>Hi ppl,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm just finished with my NS and i am current in NTU mechanical engine. Life so stressful. Used to be doing quite okay during poly but after 2 years of serving, most of the knowledge i already return to poly lecturers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is there anyone here whom been in my shoes before? Its sooooo stressful as this is my first semester and i am a direct year 2 student. They keep stressing that the concept is very important but I am a memorising guy in poly. I'm trying to understand the 'concept'as much as i can but i really scared i might flunk my first exams. The marking scheme shld be diff right? poly they do give marks for rubbish you wrote but i heard if the prof in uni who is marking your paper thinks that u dun understand anything, he give u a zero?</p>
              <p>I also scared of dissapointing my parents as they had invested alot of money for me to studies. I've already loss my will to study but I know i need to get a deegree at the end stage.</p>

              <p>Think 'bout it this way...</p>
              <p>Every guy would have to go through this 'transition period', for those who are going into courses not relevant to their diploma (i.e. IT dip grad going into banking and finance), the learning curve is even steeper.</p>
              <p>A direct entry into year 2 means that you've gotta catch up with 1 year worth of syllabus; which also means that your classmates who had been through year 1, they have a stronger foundation than you. Understanding that NTU courses are 3 years direct honors (Correct me if I'm wrong), TS might not even get a 3rd class honors if this goes on.</p>
              <p>Now you guys understand the gravity of this situation, you should not have asked him to spend the entire day at the cinema <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Time to make friends, TS.. And get them to help you with your course, it's good to have a study partner to pace and motivate you.. Find a study style you're comfortable and confident with, and start working on the books..</p>

              <p>it's time to dig out your textbooks and revise!!</p>
              <p>no point complaining here. I'm also struggling in Yr2, but now i'm telling myself to buck up or i'll fall behind my peers.</p>
              <p>The fact that you made it to Uni already means you have the stuff, and you can't change e system, so you have to adapt and change your habits.</p>
              <p>Tips: understand your tutorials, try tb examples, attempt past year papers. The rest up to above liao. Engin seldom write essay i think, but at least write something for exams so that examiners can look for marks to give you.</p>

              <p>poly you still can see alot of lazy people around who can't be bothered with studying. this scenario doesn't apply in the uni. everyone's having the mugging mentality alr. ok maybe not all but most <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>
              <p>sometimes i feel sad when students can't cope with their studies. they start to hate a subject because they can't understand it. they can't understand it because they don't dare to clarify it <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/sad.png" alt="sad.png"></p>

              <p>uni is a lot harder than poly....u are expected to cover a lot more within a shorter period of time, and sucks to be those who did not have proper grounding for those sci/engine courses, especially Maths C</p>
              <p>and you don't try to understand <strong>as much as you can</strong>. It's either you understand, or you don't. At the end of the day, not everyone will understand everything covered in the course, it's all about how to spend your time wisely and make every day count</p>

              <p>That is why business degree is popular in sg. Cos no difficult concept and physic to understand. Even u go NS 2 years come back still can study but engineering course will be very tough and different.</p>
              <p>Btw, is yr mathematic good? If no good. Wish u good luck!</p>

              <p>Hi ppl,</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I'm just finished with my NS and i am current in NTU mechanical
              engine. Life so stressful. Used to be doing quite okay during poly
              but after 2 years of serving, most of the knowledge i already
              return to poly lecturers.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Is there anyone here whom been in my shoes before? Its sooooo
              stressful as this is my first semester and i am a direct year 2
              student. They keep stressing that the concept is very important but
              I am a memorising guy in poly. I'm trying to understand the
              'concept'as much as i can but i really scared i might flunk my
              first exams. The marking scheme shld be diff right? poly they do
              give marks for rubbish you wrote but i heard if the prof in uni who
              is marking your paper thinks that u dun understand anything, he
              give u a zero?</p>
              <p>I also scared of dissapointing my parents as they had invested
              alot of money for me to studies. I've already loss my will to study
              but I know i need to get a deegree at the end stage.</p>

              <p>Do your tutorials deligently... then go to class n clarify w the tutor...</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>for engrg tutorials that i went thru long time ago... the "Air" levels folks seldom do their stuff n rather the Poly folks are the ones that lend us their model answers....</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>try reading the lecture materials prior to the lecture, highlight those that u dun understand n try to grasp them during the lecture. If possible, refer to the specific chapters in the reference books for resolution....</p>
              <p>next is to find a group of motivated folks n help each other out.... u can do this easily by going to the library n see if u can join in the "common" groups - i.e. always there rain or shine doing work....</p>

              <p>It is quite hard to start on the second year as most of the poly students will have a hard time in grasping the formulas.</p>
              <p>My advice for you is to form a study group with your fellow students who used to graduated from poly.</p>
              <p>At least all of you can get support and encouragement from each other.</p>
              <p>It will be sharing of knowledge and understanding.</p>
              <p>Or course, all of you must be geniunely willing to work together.</p>

              <p>U better start learning instead of memorising.Fast.Next Monday should be Week4...</p>
              <p>I know for a fact that some lecturers do not bother reading everything that U write...if they glance and see that it doesnt look like the steps they are expecting...U get 0 for that part...nicer lecturers will go look at the final answer and if it looks quite close to the correct answer...then they will go back and check out the working...provided they find your handwriting acceptable to them lar...</p>
              <p>there is an appeal thingy when the results are released...need to pay...I think like 20 bucks per subject....but I have neber ever seen anyone get their grades changed through it...so I think U can forget about it...</p>
              <p>I am not going to blow sunshine on U to cheer U up....I just want to add that whatever U decide to do...do it decisively....as in...dun get stuck in Year 3...FYP coming...workload heavy....then come back and post a "I am still stressed" post...I may sound cruel...but uni life is not a bed of roses.</p>
