Do you love her heart or love her appearance? This type of girls are hard to come by especially nowadays where u find indecently dressed teenagers walking along the streets and raving at each other and flirting with guys noisily. If your girlfriend behave in such a manner you will definitely not like it. You should be feeling safe with her. Actually shirt with collars look very nice.. see how nice the actresses dressed in such apparels in TV dramas, and especially in long sleeves cotton checked shirt with white collar. Love her for who she is.</div>

The second thing is the way she dress was quite funny, she wore a shirt with collar when going out with me, everytime she wore it without fail.<br>As she got a strict parents conquering her freedom, she dare not dress until very little. I always felt uncomfortable when we are together and a girl who walk pass me dress up until so nice such as sleeveless, shoulder length hair with coloured re-born and slim truly makes me envy a lot and the third thing is she like's to keep short hair, not too short, around the length of the neck. She said that it was hot for her so she decided to keep it short.<br><br>As I told her for not being so conservative, she told me, she'll tried to change and I willing to gave her some time but I wish to tell her another thing which is about dressing and appearance but i'm afraid if I tell her again, she might think I'll controlling her free will and had no freedom with me.
