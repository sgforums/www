              <p>Hi,<br> <br> I am a polytechnic student aiming for either NUS or NTU. My GPA is
              around 3.1, 'O's 16 points.<br> <br> I got rejected by both, but let's say I still really, really wish
              to be admitted into either of them. What possible ways are there to
              go about doing so? I hope to leave overseas uni only as a final
              resort.<br> <br> Will any of these work or at least grant higher chances of
              admission?<br> <br> 1. Retake some sort of exam apart from the 'A' levels (does such a
              path even exist)?<br> 2. Get more certifications (My diploma is in the IT field) and try
              again?<br> 3. Spend 1 year to get a degree from SIM's UOL/UOW, then use it to
              gain entry to NUS/NTU? (Heard of this from a colleague, is this
              true?)<br> 4. Would they take working experience into consideration? If so,
              how many years is required?<br> <br> Thanks in advance for all your valuable advices! :)</p>

              <p>First 3 are not valid ways. <br>1) No such thing<br>2) Why waste so much money and time to get another diploma to get in. <br>3) You have to complete your UOL/UOW cert, halfway dropout is equivalent to not taking the cert at all. <br><br>4th way - Working experience counted, but not for full-time studies. Maybe you can check their website for more details. Most likely enter local uni as part time student.<br><br>Anyway, the average GPA to get into local uni is about 3.6 and above to get into local uni if I am not wrong.<br><br>You can try SMU. They do take in students with lower GPAs, but are more outspoken.</p>

              <p>1. You are bonded for 4 years for the degree courses, 5 years is for 2 of the diploma courses - The general diploma course is only 3 years. Anyway you can choose to be not bonded and pay for yourself. Be warned that the NIE degree is one of the most expensive degrees across all three unis (You will need to fork out about 116k)</p>
              <p>2. Having an education cert means you are stuck with the education sector. Most who do not go for higher education or enter management-level in school or MOE usually ends up as private tutors anyway.</p>
              <p>3. NIE does not offer degrees only, they have diplomas, prep programs, special programs, AED programs, masters....etc. Only those taking the degree programs and above are considered students of NTU.</p>
              <p>4. Psychology also quite hard to enter. You can try ADM if you have the background, or nursing if you have the interest and is willing to commit.</p>

              <p>1. You are bonded for 4 years for the degree courses, 5 years is
              for 2 of the diploma courses - The general diploma course is only 3
              years. Anyway you can choose to be not bonded and pay for yourself.
              Be warned that the NIE degree is one of the most expensive degrees
              across all three unis (You will need to fork out about 116k)</p>
              <p>2. Having an education cert means you are stuck with the
              education sector. Most who do not go for higher education or enter
              management-level in school or MOE usually ends up as private tutors
              anyway.</p>
              <p>3. NIE does not offer degrees only, they have diplomas, prep
              programs, special programs, AED programs, masters....etc. Only
              those taking the degree programs and above are considered students
              of NTU.</p>
              <p>4. Psychology also quite hard to enter. You can try ADM if you
              have the background, or nursing if you have the interest and is
              willing to commit.</p>

              <p>You don't have to be so blunt. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Out of the education sector it really won't help much, though you can use it for further studies. Then again, you are restricted to either education or whatever you majored in for higher education. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif">  But when you compare it to an engineering degree in the current Singapore context..... <img style="border: 0px initial initial;" src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>
              <p>Anyway, ADM is Art, Design and Media. It is quite an interesting degree program, as they generally don't really care about the grades when you are applying for it and worry more about the portfolio you present to them.</p>
              <p>There were some years where the 10th percentile drop as low as 2.2 and DDD/D, but don't let that fool you: the 90th percentile is always more than 3.8 and AAA/B. In fact, the 90th percentile is usually AAA/A. It wouldn't be wrong to say that the students here have the widest range of entrance grades.</p>
              <p>Nursing is a very Funnnnnnnn thing. Lets just say that you will have an easier time teaching than being a nurse. My ex-classmates get to deal with all sorts of stools (shit in layman terms), and they have to study a lot due to the high biology and medicine knowledge content. </p>
              <p>Anyway, if you need anymore information on the different degrees, feel free to pm me.</p>

              <p>try your best to get into a course that you are interested to WORK in. no point doing something just for the sake of getting a degree.</p>
              <p>about trying to see your MP to write a letter. i mean now you are in a situation where giving it a shot is at least better than nothing. don't care about people telling you abt meritocracy in singapore, but seeing your MP could allow you to get a part-time work at a cdc or any other areas that could help you meet ends meet. whether u get into any school or not, just put in your best effort know.</p>
              <p>regarding the quality of singapore universities, yes you are right some of our ministers, perm secs, GLC CEOs did not study local universities. but they were students in prestigious overseas schools like Harvard/Cambridge, some even on scholarships. but those are moot points for you.</p>
              <p>what i think you could do</p>
              <p>1. find the area that you REALLY want to dedicate your life in. could be teaching or whatever, but you have to be practical.</p>
              <p>2. look for options to begin a career there</p>
              <p>3. if unable, try to get a job and think of where you want to go from there</p>
              <p>4. look for your MP to see if he can give you any assistance (in any way for jobs or schools)</p>

              <p>Let me tell u the tale of a guy who got into NTU Computer Science with a Diploma of IT, GPA 3.3 and O'Levels L1R5 20++ pts.</p>
              <p>Becoz' he was a guy he had 3 years to try for it. For the first 2 years, he got rejected by NUS, NTU and SMU(SMU gave him an interview though.)</p>
              <p>But he never gave up. First, he decided to improve himself. He knew his field IT, so he went to sign up for 3 professional certifications. Took them and pass them all with flying colors.(Dun ask which 1, any would do really.)</p>
              <p>Then he remembered there was a essay section in each Uni's application. He planned the essay long before. He vetted it over and over again. In the essay, he wrote how he discovered IT, why he liked it, and his future with it.</p>
              <p>Then he remembered, he could also get Testimonials from teachers and officers. So he rang up lecturers that he think might remember him and also got a testimonial from his officer.</p>
              <p>Then he knew that all he did was very normal, many others did that too. So to stand out, he started to make a program to show his expertise in IT. He burned the program into a CD, and made a User Manual.</p>
              <p>Then when the application date came... he when to popular and bought the nicest envelope, the 1 which is most catching to the eye. Then he send out his application.</p>
              <p>He also practised for the interview at SMU, as he went there the year b4 and knew what they were going to ask. He recited the answers he was gonna give over and over again.</p>
              <p>As expected, SMU asked him for an interview, he went down and ace it due to all his preparations. Then to his surprise!!! The letter from NTU came way b4 SMU's. YES! He got accepted into bouth NTU and SMU!!!!! But NUS rejected him though.</p>
              <p>But the truth is... when he enrolled in NTU, he realized that year the intake... the cut off is low (2009)... -_-" Not becoz' of all his efforts... Tamade waste my time and $...</p>

              <p>This is rather apparent. 'Pharmacy' 'studies' biology and medicine as well. A doctor studied surgery in addition to what the others have studied.</p>
