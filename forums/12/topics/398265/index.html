              <p>Hi,<br><br>I am a polytechnic student aiming for either NUS or NTU. 
              My GPA is around 3.1, 'O's 16 points.<br><br>I got rejected by both, but
               let's say I still really, really wish to be admitted into either of 
              them. What possible ways are there to go about doing so? I hope to leave
               overseas uni only as a final resort.<br><br>Will any of these work or 
              at least grant higher chances of admission?<br><br>1. Retake some sort 
              of exam apart from the 'A' levels (does such a path even exist)?<br>2. 
              Get more certifications (My diploma is in the IT field) and try again?<br>3.
               Spend 1 year to get a degree from SIM's UOL/UOW, then use it to gain 
              entry to NUS/NTU? (Heard of this from a colleague, is this true?)<br>4. 
              Would they take working experience into consideration? If so, how many 
              years is required?<br><br>Thanks in advance for all your valuable

              <p>First thing for you to do is to appeal, everything comes after that.</p>
              <p>I won't suggest that you try taking private "A"-levels, since you did not take the JC route previously.</p>
              <p>You can try the mature applicant route, but you will have to work for quite a number of years. Getting more certifications will unlikely help out much, to be honest. Â </p>

              <p>Comp Sci/Eng ususally are popular with JC students compare to EEE/Mech Eng side, coupled with u got to compete with the top poly grads armed with Merit/Medals or at very least a couple of distinctions that make them above average. So chances are quite low actually.</p>
              <p>Part-time courses are usually the same course as the full-time except they take a 5 years route (Such as the NTU B.Eng EEE/Mech degrees both full-time and part-time take exactly the same contents, exam and certification 1st/2nd class honours). Depends on course availability (Such as NTU, I think they only offer EEE/Mech for part-timers only)</p>
              <p>Or the course itself to tailored to part-timers such as the B.Tech courses in NUS (some-say is a watered-down version of the B.Sc/B.Eng courses which I dunno how true is this).</p>
              <p>From what I know, for getting a deg some where else then getting into NTU, the success cases are ususally for post-grad where they have a degree and come back to do their Masters. Then again, even at post-grad level, the quality of your degree becomes important (where/how/duration u get it). For undergrad, for my view, it can be even counter-productive as in why let you in when u already have a degree, etc, etc.</p>

              <p>There is an appealing period where you can write a 2k words appeal for NUS and 50 words for NTU. In case you are thinking, you didn't see it wrong, it is 50 words for NTU.</p>
              <p>Do not underestimate this appeal, this is when you can sell yourself (Not literally) and earn yourself a place in one of the fore-mentioned uni.Â </p>

              <p>can or cannot...getting the gist ofÂ the sad storyÂ can already...U think the appeals people really read every word of a 2000-word essay?but then again...50 words sound pretty short...even NTU's English test needs more than that...<img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/KMess-Cartoon/confused.png" alt="confused.png"></p>

              <p>that is one way if ur grades are just below the entry requirements....cos...dont expect ur MP to write a very "powerful" letter for U....the most is like...telling ur sad story in 1 paragraph and then finishing it off with a "appreciate it if you could give the application due consideration".</p>
