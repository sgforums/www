This failure dropped out of VJC after Year 1, then bummed ard &amp; worked in various temp jobs for awhile.  1 day, when all her frens got their A Level results &amp; were whooping wif joy &amp; planning abt uni entrances, the failure woke up from her idea, &amp; realised tt she was missing out on all the fun in planning for an edu, getting a degree, etc.  She thot back to when she excelled in school, qualifying for entrance into the top sec school &amp; how she'd let it all go to waste.<br><br>The failure then went to a private institution &amp; obtained info on all the private diploma courses.  She studied as hard as she did when she was younger, &amp; obtained an overall Distinction grade.  Subsequently, she was accepted into a prettie gd uni in Oz.<br><br>She's a grad now, wif a stable job &amp; a steady income, &amp; has done fine.  She's Not by any means totally outstanding like president scholars or those private bankers, but she has earned herself her own respect, &amp; tt of her parents, whom she disappointed many yrs ago.  Pple who haf wayward children ask her to give encouragement to them &amp; help them see all is Not lost.<br><br>Sounds incredible?  Shade, it's me.  It's a true story, cosh it's my life.  I'd wasted time, but I've gained a measure of it back.  All is Not lost simply cosh u din get the best grades during ur O's.  From it, u can earn an experience, how to deal wif failure, how to cope wif it, how to move on, &amp; u become stronger.<br><br>I wldn't haf had the chance to make thgs better for myself if I'd simply committed suicide.  And the strength I had from disappointments in the past has helped me deal wif tough working life now : )<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br></div></blockquote>Thanks FF <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br><br>your story has indeed woke me up<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> I can now see the light <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"> Never will I think of taking my life again...</div>
