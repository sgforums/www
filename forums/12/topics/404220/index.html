              <p>I discovered my hubby been playing around when he forgot to logout from his msn.</p>
              <p>What am I suppose to do? So angry that I wanna castrate him! From the conversation, they were sending dirty pics to one another and had met up with her!</p>
              <p>I am in two mind now...one to divorce him,(we've been married for 10 yrs) and the other to take revenge. Expose him and the slut online! I have their pictures especially the slut. That slut is a local married woman too. How can she do that!</p>
              <p>I thought of putting her pictures all over the internet to take revenge on her for breaking up our family. Or should I get a PI to make it official. I haven't told my hubby I knew his unfaithfullnes. In fact, after this, I secretly check on him, his hp msgs and discovered that he cheated on me with a few other women! I have 2 kids and am working too.</p>
              <p>I have ask my friend ( she is in IT) to check up on the slut as I have her email and her name. I knew I had to leave him but I can't take it lying down! I want revenge on both of them! Disgrace them!<img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_evil.gif" alt="icon_evil.gif"></p>

              <p>Hi,</p>
              <p>First of all, let me convey my deep condolences.</p>
              <p>Secondly,</p>
              <p>This may be hard for you to take, but....actually.....your husband is suffering from psychological disorder.</p>
              <p>He is doing that because he is having issues, and have sex addiction and cybersex addiction.</p>
              <p>So what I am trying to say is.....</p>
              <p>Sometimes when someone is doing something wrong......</p>
              <p>We need to think deeper.</p>
              <p>My question to you......do you really love your husband..? Do you love your kids, and your family? And how has he been all these 10 years?</p>
              <p>I repeat again, your husband is suffering from a mental condition.</p>
              <p>There are two ways.</p>
              <p>One, try to understand it and sympathize with him. And try to get help and treatment.</p>
              <p>The other one is, to be angry and reactive, and dump him.</p>
              <p>In this AuntAgony subforum, in the top rows, there is a topic about "call these numbers to get help", try to click that one, and then browse a bit. You will see something about "family therapy" , or "couple therapy" , or "Sex addiction therapy" , something like that.</p>
              <p>If the result is unsatisfactory you can also use Google.</p>
              <p>Please, at least do this step.</p>
              <p>You will understand more after that.</p>
              <p>Then maybe you can consider about what the next decision is.</p>
              <p>Good luck and I wish you all the best.</p>

              <p>I can understand how you feel.</p>
              <p>Sometimes, you can be so angry until want to chop off his penis when he's sleeping and throw it to the dogs.</p>
              <p>How can a man you loved, married, bore children with and swore to grow old together with do this to you ?Even if you consider you want to salvage the marriage and forgive him for the sake of the children, how do you know he's not doing it on the sly again ?</p>
              <p>And...... by doing the same back to him (ie: having an affair to make him a cuckloid) doesn't bring any satisfaction at all. The issue here is : the wife loved the husband so much and yet he betrayed her.</p>
              <p>I wish all straying men a cancerous death.</p>

              <p>Yes it is true.</p>
              <p>But do you guys know why some people become like that?</p>
              <p>I think we need to think deeper.</p>
              <p>As an example, if it is your child who misbehave, your mind will start to work, what went wrong. Maybe he has wrong friends, bad influence. You would definitely think like this, and not completely condemn or cut off your child.</p>
              <p>Your loved ones are the same like your child.</p>
              <p>Despite people growing up, becoming adults, there may be issues in the heart.</p>
              <p>He is doing that because he has issues.</p>
              <p>He is suffering from something and it manifest in this way. The best way really is to seek professional counselling. But this is tough I know. But it already happened. Anyways all other options are also tough. No easy choices. But I recommend to seek help. I cant say too much anymore except that I wish you Revenge441 would be strong during the difficult times ahead.</p>

              <p>Why bother to go through the same thing just to let him know how you feel ? It's no use. Too late already.And frankly, ... most men won't feel guilty. They will act as if it's their right to do it.</p>
              <p>"Which cat doesn't eat fish" kind of syndrome.</p>
              <p>I tell you la... men ought to have their penis chopped off so that they will feel the pain and without their prized jewels, ... no woman would want them.</p>

              <p>This cat already has a fish at home, he is not supposed to go out fishing at the pond.</p>
              <p>Something happened to the cat.</p>

              <p>"Suffering from something" is just an excuse.   </p>
              <p>Men always turn around and say that women suffer from PMS... why can't we get cured from that first...Life is just not equal la.</p>
              <p>Men ought to be taught a firm and severe lesson. Why can't they be faithful unconditionally ? If they are fed up of the wife, then say so... see what can be done to repair the relationship etc..Having affairs is the worst, most hurtful kind of experience a faithful dutiful wife has to go through.</p>
              <p>For that kind of pain, I don't know what kind of revenge is deserving of these useless men.</p>

              <p>Suffering from something is not an "excuse".</p>
              <p>It is real.</p>
              <p>He may have depression, self-doubt, mid-life crisis, anxiety, sexual addiction, or cybersex addiction.</p>
              <p>All these are potent disorders which cannot be helped.</p>
              <p>I say something like this, you cannot understand or accept.</p>
              <p>Maybe I give another example.</p>
              <p>Gambling addict.</p>
              <p>Now, I remove the love / sex part. Do you agree there are people who suffer from gambling addiction?</p>
              <p>How about drug addiction?</p>
              <p>But those 2 conditions also severely harm their familial relationships. It harms to all directions.</p>
              <p>But this is something which is psychological.</p>
              <p>And especially for a case like this, dont just immediately blame the wrongdoing person. How it happened this way, what went wrong? Is something wrong with him? Maybe something wrong with the marriage relationship also? It is uneasy but it is neccessary to look deeper, however uncomfortable it is.</p>

              <p>It's not easy to get the man to admit that something is wrong with him in the first place. Very rarely will any man admit it's his fault, let alone want to admit something is wrong with him.</p>
              <p>In these situations, the wife is the one who bears the most suffering, heartache and loss.  I really sympathise with you "Revenge441".    You got to be strong for your kids and walk out of this relationship. Don't give up.</p>
