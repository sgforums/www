              <p>I discovered my hubby been playing around when he forgot to
              logout from his msn.</p>
              <p>What am I suppose to do? So angry that I wanna castrate him!
              From the conversation, they were sending dirty pics to one another
              and had met up with her!</p>
              <p>I am in two mind now...one to divorce him,(we've been married
              for 10 yrs) and the other to take revenge. Expose him and the slut
              online! I have their pictures especially the slut. That slut is a
              local married woman too. How can she do that!</p>
              <p>I thought of putting her pictures all over the internet to take
              revenge on her for breaking up our family. Or should I get a PI to
              make it official. I haven't told my hubby I knew his
              unfaithfullnes. In fact, after this, I secretly check on him, his
              hp msgs and discovered that he cheated on me with a few other
              women! I have 2 kids and am working too.</p>
              <p>I have ask my friend ( she is in IT) to check up on the
              slut as I have her email and her name. I knew I had to leave him
              but I can't take it lying down! I want revenge on both of them!

              <p>Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. Guys, do you know what you are dealing with?</p>
              <p>Why can't you be like Jack Neo's wife and forgive your husband? Maybe your husband doesn't have as much money as Jack Neo.</p>
              <p>You don't need to be in two minds. You can take revenge first and then divorce him. Gather evidence without alerting your husband. If you can afford to hire PI, it should be better as it can provide more compelling evidence.</p>
              <p>Revenge is always sweet!</p>

              <p>How are you now? Have you taken any action yet?</p>
              <p>I hope the women who have been playing with your husband get their deserving retribution for luring your husband. Similarly, I hope all similar women who provoke infidelity in other married men get retribution.These sluts need to be punished severely for breaking a couple's marriage.</p>

              <p>This is just so wrong. A married man cheating with a woman who is also married as well! Thats altogether 4 people involved.. Like all the advice given here, one of the most important would be to think of the kids as well.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And most importantly, before you let your emotions get the better of you, don't be too rash. Think carefully on how you should deal with this as anything done when being very angry might make you regret later. As many have said, seek a marriage counselor who can see the best way out for you calmly</p>

              <p>If it is really true as you have spouted here about ur spouse's alleged infidelities -  he is no longer being a husband and no longer interested but simply holding on to something that died long ago.</p>
              <p>That is the reality.</p>
              <p>To make another wrong and make oneself rite is unhealthy.</p>
              <p>If u cannot cope and cannot accept the situation - resolve to make a decision but the blame game is just an excuse.</p>
              <p>Also, to blame the other ''woman'' is totally unfair cos your spouse is also part of the equation.</p>
              <p>No one can change another and the sooner one understands and unlearns the ''conditioning' it would have one in good stead to handle living.</p>
              <p>To change another one changes one's behaviour to elicit change - words are an exercise in futility.</p>
              <p>Avenging is not about the other but what has always been there within oneself and has now surfaced and thus the wanting to take revenge.</p>
              <p>Judging another is in actuality speaking volumes about oneself who is passing judgement.</p>
              <p>To stay or not stay is not the issue - being self-honest and facing what ''is'' may go a long way to saving oneself and those who one professes to care or what have you. It is easy to leave a relationship, marriage or ... but one doomed to repeat if it is unreconciled within oneself - let me reiterate, being self-honest is essential.</p>

              <p>Catch no ball in what he's trying to say.</p>
              <p>Anyway, of course the spouse shares the blame with the "other woman". Taking revenge will never give you happiness because nothing can repair what the 2 of them destroyed by having their affair. </p>
              <p>The only thing that can give you 'happiness' would be to work it out with him to see if your marriage is repairable and if it has more value over your hurt. If not, then leave him and find another happiness.</p>

              <p>You are full of Shit , you think Man don't suffer as much as the women in such situations if they switch places and it was the wife who cheated instead ?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>As for the Poster of this thread your advice is written as follow</p>
              <p>Anyway advice to you, gather all information expose him and make sure you get the freaking alimony , he needs to suffer and get a wake up call make sure the drama unfold between the other married women and her husband as well.</p>
              <p>Just do it and dont even finch , most important you have to do it with absolutely no emotions when he confront you and say sorry. Cheating is something should never be forgiven, everything else you can forgive but cheating is a BIG NO.</p>
              <p>Only show your emotions when you are in court , make sure you get the Video of them having sex or something as well.</p>
              <p>In such situations you need to remain CALM to plan out your next move and attacks and make sure he doesn't realized you know about it .</p>
              <p>Smile at his jokes treat him nice , and when you gather all information give him one big stab so that he can never recover properly.</p>

              <p>Why are you so angry at women? I think the above posts were directed at all straying and cheating spouses (regardless of gender). Its just that these posters were female and they probably empathized with revenge441 as a woman too.</p>
              <p>Don't you agree that its more common to find cheating husbands than wives although I know these days, women are very liberal and are equally likely to cheat on their husbands.</p>
              <p>In the situation of cheating husbands, the wives have to look after the children and thus have more to suffer. More often, the responsibility of looking / caring for the children in a broken marriage falls on the woman and not the man. And having put in much of her youthful years into building the family, she now has to continue shouldering the care for the children alone.</p>

              <p>All cheating husbands or wives deserve the same punishment and retribution. But the woman suffers more if husband cheated on her because men don't age as badly (or fast) as women.</p>
              <p>To men who think it's their right to flirt and sex around, you need to be taught a big lesson. I hope one day, someone does the same to you and throws a fist at you where it hurts the most !!</p>
              <p>To women (married or not) who flirt and lure other married men into affairs, you need a hellish punishment to wake you up from your wicked deeds.</p>

              <p>Whether TS's husband is really 'suffering' from any psychological problems, it should not negate his disgusting behaviour.</p>
              <p>Being an adult male, he should have been able to recognise at least some of the things he did were wrong! Don't tell me he went through all he did on auto-pilot!</p>
              <p>The moment he knew he was straying to the dark side he should have gotten help.</p>

              <p>Yes, your kids are important, but right now, I feel the person who needs the most support is YOU. Whatever you do, please take your feelings &amp; needs into account also. YOU need to care for yourself too.</p>

              <p>Stop Being delusional.</p>
              <p>Singapore Women are educated , smart and sophisticated.</p>
              <p>They have no doubt earn themselves a place in our previously male dominated society which is a good thing.</p>
              <p>Women in our country no doubt have more rights in what they do and a much better social standing than anywhere else in Asia.</p>
              <p>However the backlash that comes along with such attributes tend to revolutionize the thinking of women.</p>
              <p>Point is , women in our generation have no qualms in giving up their kids and dump them to someone else or leave them alone.</p>
              <p>Alot of men I know have taken a back seat when it comes to such situation.</p>
              <p>Call it coincidence or I just mix with the wrong crowd. I have seen close family friends and personal friends marraige break apart.</p>
              <p>Husband was great but just couldn't afford the luxuries the lady wants. Had kids, wife dumped kids to the husband and ran away with Ang Mos.</p>
              <p>Husband left with the kid and bringing them up by themselves. The tide is evidently changing in Singapore. The amount of women in Singapore putting their husbands or ex husband in a fix like this is completely astounishing.</p>
              <p>And if you girls feel that equality amongst Gender is an issue , you can be  assured that it is right now . There is an equal amount or even more Men going through such bullshit than women thats for sure.</p>
              <p>The only reason why you don't see Men complaning about it is due to Pride .</p>

              <p>TS some of the men here seem really quick to defend their own kind.</p>
              <p>Even if your marriage has problems....<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>it is still wrong for your husband to have mulitple affairs</strong></span></p>
              <p>I suggest you confront him, but gather enough evidence first. In fact, like what one of the forumers have suggested, keep a copy of your evidence.</p>
              <p><strong>Right now, revenge <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">should not</span></em> be your topmost priority. You should concentrate on solving this issue as quickly as possible, while trying to limit emotional trauma to your kids.</strong></p>
              <p>Think it over long and hard...whether staying in this marriage would be the best solution in the long term for you, your husband and your kids. Don't make such a decision implusively. Especially not when you're still angry and upset.</p>
