              <p>break up already can still be friends even when he's with a friend of yours.</p>
              <p>but, if you still can't face the facts, i think you should take some time offÂ anything and everything from him.</p>
              <p>you may not initiate anything but he may. then you got to decide if you want to reciprocate. if you don't, theres high chance that the friendship may slip away. still, let him know how you feel bah.</p>

              <p>okay.. my take on this is that you are cooking up a recipe for disaster and a LOT of long term pain.. you are trying.. begging to give the pieces of your shattered heart to the one who smashed it... on your knees praying that he'll patch the pieces back together and keep it safe again... while he's poking the pieces with a stick just to give you some hope.. the way someone would poke something lying on the ground with stick out of curiosity..</p>

              <p>i need help here.this is my situition:</p>
              <p>i have broken up with my ex-bf for 3months.We were having
              LDR(long distance relationship) for about a year.But in the end
              when he came back,he told me he has got a new gf n wanted us to
              move on on our own.First 2 weeks i stopped contacting him at
              all,but then he texted me back and showed he still care for me.So i
              thought maybe we could be friends again.But i know i still do have
              feelings towards him.</p>
              <p>Â </p>
              <p>He has gone back to australia to continue his studies.ps:his gf
              is having ldr with him as well,she is a friend of my friend.But i
              still couldn't ignore him even he is still with her.Sometimes
              really feel like just stop contacting him,but i just couldn't do
              it.We still contact each other quite often,just like the time we
              were still couple.He wont be coming back in more than a year
              time,that means i wont get to see him for a long time.Now my
              problem is,i dont wanna make this more complicated.I am not really
              happy staying in a relationship like this.if we r jut pure
              friend,then y is he contacting me so often.bt we are not couple
              too,he has a gf.and he doesnt seem like wanna give up on her.</p>
              <p>what do u all think i should do?</p>
              <p>should i just stop contacting him,ignore his calls n block him
              in msn.</p>
              <p>or should i wait that maybe he will come back to me again.</p>
              <p>or we should just remain to be friend like this.</p>
              <p>can someone help me?</p>
