              <p>Hey I have a similar situation to yours, of course not as serious but the basics are there, and I got a couple of things to say. The world isn't perfect, and there's absolutely no way to change that. Capitalism, Marxism, Feudalism, we tried them all and they all didn't work out well. After saying that, I'll tell you this, no one is perfect, not in this system, not in this world. Your 14, same as me, and at the best time of your life where you have the freedom of thought and innocence, and you shouldn't bring forward your misery, because when you enter the working world, life is going to be a whole lot worse, and you lose even your basic freedom. If you feel pathetic, then know that everyone else is the same. On a more complicated term, humans are mere slaves to their own system, and most don't even know that.</p>
              <p>As for your CCA, mine is a whole lot worse than yours. I don't even have the basic attendance, nor do I have any rights in it. For me, it's just a name that's written in black and white, so you shouldnt feel negative about yours. What kind of a cca will deny your efforts for a camp anyway? And girls? Well your just 14 and it's not the time yet to worry about them.</p>
              <p>Finally, judging by the replies you must have been posting such emo threads often in the past aye?</p>
