              <p>wow you seem really confused. IMO the fact of our mortality is not necessarily a tragedy. I find it makes life more glorious. Imagine if you lived forever would it matter if you accomplish your goals now or 10000 years into the future??</p>
              <p>It is precisely because of our limited time that we should go out to achieve what we want before our time comes and to be able to say at the end that the journey was enjoyable</p>

              <p><br>Ya.. As I was chatting yesterday... I remember before 2000, people draw hover crafts all over the sky in 2010 and such... But still... This year already 2009... I think nobody really expected such a bad market drop... If someone a 'market down trend graph', I think many people would be REALLY GRATEFUL TODAY..... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="icon_lol.gif"></p>

              <p>i used to think everyone's here in Life for a good cause,but nowadays,i'm starting to believe that we're here to make this world a lousier place.it's times of depression,horror and cynicism that we can see who are the real martyrs and who are the ones who have no sense of self and social awareness at all.i believe in "a circle has no beginning".what we do unto others will ultimately come back to us.</p>

              <p>some might say why is this happening to me? but some just don't care about anything<br><br>some ppl will feel that renovation for a hawker centre and doubling the rent of the hawkers will be good because they will provide better service and willing to pay more.</p>
              <p>some ppl will feel that renovation for a hawker centre and doubling the rent of the hawkersis riduculous and they have to pay more for the same food.</p>

              <p><br>ya true la.. but i research on the 2012 prediction, it said that around 1989 got same thing happen, but it only affect one state (perhaps in US). so i dun think it'll afffect the whole earth..</p>
              <p>if 2012 is end of the world, i believe it'll be because of war and stuff, not the storm thingy. haha...</p>
