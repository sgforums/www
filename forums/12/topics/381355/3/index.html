              <p>These are troubled times. It was good that you offered to help. Never lend anyone any money that you cannot afford to lend. Most people will understand it and accept it. Buy him a meal or a lunch instead. But if you lend money, then you must be prepared not to see it back.</p>
              <p>And secondly, make sure you know who you are lending money to. Is he gambler or a womaniser? If you lend to such person, you will only destroy him. But if he needs it to feed himself or his kids, then search within yourself if you can spare him some cash, even if you need to give up on some entertainment yourself.</p>
              <p>However,these troubled people would be better served if you can refer him to our CDC agencies for help. Alone, our funds may not be enough, but combined as a caring society, we can help these people - to tide over for a period of time, to upgrade or to seek jobs. No responsible person will be turned away or left behind.</p>
              <p>My suggestion to you is to forgo the $200. Look at this way, it only costs you $200 to know a person. You got it cheap. I've lost thousands to find that out. Pity that person instead - his integrity and friendship is worth only $200. Money can always be earned, but integrity and respect is priceless, once lost, is gone almost forever....</p>

              <p>tell him to use this precious and possibly once in a lifetime chance of joblessness to quit his smoking habit. the reason govt increased the price of ciggies every yr is to make smokers quit. it works because i know at least 10 smokers in army who quit because of the yearly increase in cig price.</p>
              <p>even when he has a job, some day down the line when he matures and wants to preserve his health because he may have more to lose if he dies, he would want to quit but it would be even harder because he would have money to afford cigs.</p>
              <p>btw how is it possible that he smokes one pack a day? sg only has the 20 stick pack now and that is a lot of cigarettes he's smoking in one day. 24 hours - 8 for sleeping left with 16 hours and he can smoke 20 sticks in 16 hours?!?! smokers I know smoke at the very most on a stressed day 10 sticks. where got time?</p>

              <p>I am wondering, why do you all think that: beat up some1 = breaking law = going to jail? </p>
              <p>The fact is that if the other party claimed that you have attack him, he will have to produce medical cert and eye witness to show that I have attacked him on this day, time and venue. Who start the fight? Is that bruise cause by a punch or kick? There are many issues involved. Can get away one... just that you dont know. </p>
