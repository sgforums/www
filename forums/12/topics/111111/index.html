            <div class='col-md body'>Hi all.<br><br>this is a real life experience that i am going to share with you all, especially those married guys that frequent the IRC. I am telling you, you are putting yourselves at very big risk. You are risking not only yourself but also your spouse. I am one victim of such.<br><br>I am 30, married, and i only recently found out that my husband is a regular at the IRC, and he has been chatting up ladies in the IRC, and i would'nt imagine that he is talking abt soccer or work with these ladies. He even have the guts to meet up with these ladies. To my ultimate shock, he recently met a group of girls who are using the IRC to "fish" out married guys.He confessed that he had intended to meet this girl by the name Sally and her girlfriends for sex. Let me explained why he had confessed. it was not because he felt guilty.<br><br>According to him, when he met these girls in some cheap hotels in geylang, Sally (mid 20s, tattoed body, quite tanned) made him join her and other couples in the room, do 2 things before agreeing to having sex orgy. First thing, to do drink some spritual drink and secondly,start doing some mass chanting ritual facing the bed. My husband refused, and he wanted to leave out of fear (i guessed). Sally and the girls then told him, he could leave, but they would come after his wife, and tell her abt their rendevous. He of course didnt believed, and they told him, that they knew where we live, what car he was driving, where he work etc. He found it absurb and he left thinking he could just forget abt the whole incidence.<br><br>He was dead wrong, and they were dead right! Abt 8 pm that evening (and this was liked last month, and i am still getting nitemares from that!), 2 girls knocked on my door of our flat, i opened it, i was asked if i am his wife, i said yes, they slapped me, pulled my hair, pushed me to the floor, spat on me, and all hell broke loose!! i didnt have a chance! My idiot hubby came out, he was shocked to see them, and i was totally disgusted with the whole episode!! I have made a police report, but they have treated it like a one-off case, even when our car and flat have been vandalised!<br><br>i am hoping to recover from this episode, by writing this email to forewarn those married guys that have this habit! i hate the trauma, and i am dead sure many out there would have suffered in silence like me, cos its really very embarassing and frigthening. Pls help by at least relating your experience to the police, so they know its not a one-off incidence. I am not planning to forgive my hubby yet.<br><br>Pls forward this email along. if you are a victim suffering in silence, make a police report.we cant let such behaviours and immorals live in Spore! it will help. pls help forward this message along. thank you.<br><br>Sandy.<br><br></div>
