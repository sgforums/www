Because of that he bear grudges with me from then on. Scolding me C***B** all that on occasions and never talk to me. So as a kid that was a threat and I actually lived in fright and try to stay as far away from him as possible.<br>I also witness my self how he wanted to whack up my brother as a kid when my brother tease him.
