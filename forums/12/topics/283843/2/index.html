            <div class='col-md body'>Hi<br><br>From what I recall, and gone thru, the money in the cpf will be distributed as<br>fair as possible. CPF board will perform this task.<br><br>My father died when I was 13, leaving behind a small sum of CPF shared<br>among my brother, sister, mum and me.<br><br>CPF board split the money this way, my mother will get 40%, and the rest of<br>us 3 siblings get 20% each.  We had no arguments, well... how to argue<br>anyway.<br><br>Since I was 13, I was not entitled to draw any money until I reach 18.<br>When I turned 18, cpf sent a cheque to me and just deposit it into<br>any bank account. It took them about month after my birthday to send me<br>the cheque, but I was not so bothered.<br><br>I am 26 this year, so the whole issued started 13 years ago.<br><br>When your parent died, were you already 18? Also, CPF board will only<br>recognise legitimate family members. So if you unfortunately do not, in any<br>way, carry some form of legal papers regarding to your parent, you may not<br>be entitled to a single cent.<br><br>Otherwise, your parent has already made a will that is to pass every asset<br>and money to partner in law or someone else.<br><br>Best of luck to you</div>

And in this case i don't think the TS hates the parent, seem more towards indifference and after what happened doesn't seem unreasonable.<br><br>inheritance is a gift in your point of view, some one else can say its a right. but as i mentioned, even if we take it as a gift, given no prior wishes to gift to which person we have to fall back on the legal rights. unless you want to donate all to charity or something.<br><br>But regardless, since its there and legally supposed to be hers and getting it back would not do much to cripple the surviving parent; I see no reason not to get it back. As some one said, a little luxury isn't bad esp if its just getting back what belongs to you.</div>
