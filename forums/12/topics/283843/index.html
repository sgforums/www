            <div class='col-md body'>Much depends on the types of assets and how they are held in law. If the house is held by both your parents as joint tenants as opposed to a tenancy-in-common, upon the cessation of one joint owner, the property will go the surviving joint-tenant who then becomes the sole owner.<br><br>CPF monies will go to the person who had been nominated by the deceased parent. In your case, probably the surviving parent must have been nominated by the deceased.<br><br>Insurance is the same as CPF rules - depends on who the nominee is.<br><br>Cash assets will be distributed in accordance with the rules of intestacy. It is probable that there is little if any cash assets or you should have been notified of the share you are entitled already....... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>
