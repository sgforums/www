              <p>That is why it is important to live by some standards or as what we call, have your own principles. Principles are absolutes. That means, they cannot be compromised. Sometimes, we would of course like to give our loved ones a second chance. However, if what you have preached or said seems to be continually ignored, then that means it's time for some serious action on your part. And do it.</p>
              <p>You are doubting yourself because you have not been living up to your principles. As time goes by as your principles get more voilated, you doubt yourself more and depend even more emotionally on your partner and loved ones for approval, <strong>whether they are right or not.</strong> This is especially not a very good position for a man, because it weakens a man's resolve and you will lose the strength to be able to defend your loved ones in times of crises.</p>
              <p>So quiet down your mind. Choose your friends wisely and surround yourself with friends who respect your choices. Listen to people whom you respect. However, first and foremost, it is more important to respect yourself. Mix around more gradually and experience first hand, then decide for yourself what emotions are healthy and what are not. Until then will you be able to find and invest in a relationship that is truly healthy for yourself and your partner. This is going to take time, so don't hurry yourself <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/set1/smile.png" alt="smile.png"></p>

              <p>You are not retaliating.. You are taking advantage.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If it's some other guy "retaliating" on your gf.. I'm sure down there you also buay song one.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Just because he smile smile .. is give his gf face.</p>
              <p>Yet you still buay zhi dong.. (not automatic).</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>You should be seeking consent from her bf.. not from the girl. So please get this straight.</p>

              <p>Instead of asking us, you should seriously ask youself, "Do you want this girl to be your girfriend?"</p>
              <p>You can tolerate her personality, for the time being (because the relationship is still new), but later, believe me, your resentment will get the better of you, if you do nothing. If you try to control that girl, she will resent you.  Don't expect her to change. It is you who should make a wise decision.</p>
              <p>There are many girls out there, find one that suits you naturaly, so that no modifications would be necessary.</p>
              <p>How do you choose your clothes? Pick anything, and then alter it to suit you, or do  you choose the ones that fit you? You should give more care in selecting a companion.</p>
              <p>She can be your friend, you can be her friend, nothing more, just like her ex.</p>

              <p>the fact that u feel jealous means u value her alot, nothing unusual</p>
              <p>u muz let her noe yr displeasure, no pt bottling it up. If she still don't register, u can try more radical method, like u flirting wif other gals yrself</p>
