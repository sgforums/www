              <p> </p>
              <p>i know she dosent have any intentions but there is one mutual friend with ours she had a fling with last time (before we got together) she is particularly very friendly with him. and well.... touchy.. .. i get insecure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>honestly i am confused, i really am. i really don't want her to change because of my jealous insecurities</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but on the other hand i do feel insecure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i have talked to her and expressed this to her. but i know she can't really register.. because well she's kinda the type in one ear out the other and she kinda gets lost i the moment of fun.</p>

              <p>I think this is very much because she's still young and immature.  For most mature adults (in general), when they are in a relationship, they would know when to draw a line and would know better not to do anything disrepectful to their partners.</p>
              <p>If you feel uncomfortable about the issues, just talk to her about it.  I am not asking you to tell her off since I don't think she is doing it intentionally to hurt you. Try to reason with her and help her to look at it in different viewpoint like how she would feel if it's the other way around.</p>

              <p>it is right to feel what you feel, and given U two are in a r/s, there should be trust but importantly, respect.</p>

              <p>Nuad,</p>
              <p>You gota stop letting your gf walk all over you.</p>
              <p>She is an attention seeker. Perhaps you have not paid her enough attention.. therefore she seeks to fill this void from other men.</p>
              <p>She can allow other men to get touchy and physical with her.</p>
              <p>But other men are disrespecting YOU when they touch your gf.</p>
              <p>If I am you.. I would tell the guy off the next time he touch your gf again. Simply ask him.. would you like me to do the same to your gf ?</p>
              <p>If your gf protest.. you should just tell her " If you like that guy to touch you so much.. you can go be HIS gf."</p>
              <p>As a man.. you need to start behaving like one.. if not.. women will treat you like a fellow woman.</p>

              <p>hi Nuad,</p>
              <p>for a relationship to last, both partners need to respect each other and behave appropriately.</p>
              <p>a woman who becomes touchy easily with other men, may also be cheated easily.</p>
              <p>to most men, such a woman does not offer a sense of security.</p>
              <p>therefore, your feeling of insecurity is natural.</p>
              <p>two options are available for you.</p>
              <p>1) if you find this woman is the one for you and is teachable, try your best to educate her on proper behaviour.</p>
              <p>2) dump her and look for someone else, if she's incorrigible, to avoid future problems, especially after marraige.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>all the best! :)</p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>If you think of change a girl character, stop thinking that. It is as same as a girl think of changing a guy if they get marry or together.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you can accept her as what it is now, then you continue your relationship.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If you cannot accept her behaviour, than advice you to break off and find a new one. (As Arieswilson say, that is to avoid future problems)</p>

              i thin talk to her abt it ba. she seems to be ignorant in where to draw the line. ur not being overly jealous. if she still do not listen to you and show no change in her behavior. 
              
              this is not abt changing her to suit your needs but something she need to learn on where to draw the line in friendships ba.

              <p>my girlfriend she is a very friendly and socialble person,
              sometimes with our group of friends she's outgoing to a point where
              she would play with the guys like tickling and playful touching
              them.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p><strong>i know she dosent have any intentions</strong> but there is one mutual
              friend with ours she had a fling with last time (before we got
              together) she is particularly very friendly with him. and well....
              touchy.. .. i get insecure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>honestly i am confused, i really am. i really don't want her to
              change because of my jealous insecurities</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but on the other hand i do feel insecure.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i have talked to her and expressed this to her. but i know she
              can't really register.. because well <strong>she's kinda the type in one
              ear out the other and she kinda gets lost i the moment of fun.</strong></p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>so firstly i want to ask if from a third person's opinion, am i
              being overly jealous?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>i told her about this and had a long talk and said that i would
              try to prevent and control these thoughts. or get used to it......
              because the truth is this is her personality.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>and <strong>i love her for being herself</strong>, and expecting her to change
              seems <strong>contradictory </strong>to me.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>but im confused by my emotions and my head.</p>
              <p> </p>

              <p>I sincerely do think that there is really some conflict going on here, or as you have put it, "contradictory".</p>
              <p>May I guess that you are the opposite of your girlfriend's personality, and because she was so different from you, perhaps may I presumptuously presume, the part of you that yearns to be so carefree too, that you were attracted to her?</p>
              <p>This has nothing to do with the so call "opposite attracts" for those are based on <strong>healthy </strong>complementary differences, not based on insecurity or "jealousy".</p>
              <p>There is nothing wrong with you. You were just not comfortable with your girlfriend's "outgoing" behaviour to the boys and like what one forumnite said, I do not think those guys are being respectful to you or your girlfriend either when they are so-called "being playful" with her.</p>
              <p>You said you had a long talk with her. Yet you also expect to be turned a deaf ear upon. The word is "expected". <strong>Why?</strong></p>
              <p>That is why I said "opposite attracts" and this "opposite" is not a good sign unlike those based on healthy complementary differences e.g.--&gt; This is unlike she is into sports and you are into plants.</p>
              <p>First, there seems to be a huge disregard of respect, from what you have written, from your girlfriend's side.</p>
              <p>Can a relationship work without respect inspite of her "she kinda gets lost in the moment of fun" &amp; "i know she dosent have any intentions"? <strong>Are those really good excuses?</strong></p>
              <p>Back to the part where you said you expected her to turn a deaf ear to you. <strong>Why are you letting her do that?</strong> <strong>Why do you allow </strong>someone <strong>especially </strong>your significant other, who should of all people, pay the most attention and respect to you, disrespect you this way? Why are you helping her to find excuses already (ref: "i know she
              can't really register.. because well she's kinda the type in one
              ear out the other and she kinda gets lost i the moment of fun.") and in a way <strong>expect to be</strong> walked all over by her?</p>
              <p>In my opinion, work on your own issues first before you truly plunged into a relationship. <strong>Be truthful to yourself, your own feelings.</strong> Right now your own feelings is telling you that you are uncomfortable with this situation. Are you going to disregard it <strong>again</strong> and sweep it all under the rug only to be nudged time and time again by this uncomfortable feeling? <strong>Respect yourself and others will respect you. </strong>It is because (perhaps since growing up, people around you have been putting you down) that you are used to disregarding yourself that you have perhaps walked into this relationship without even realizing whether it is healthy or not for you.</p>
              <p>Maybe it is a lot of work for you to do, but may I suggest that you write down what kind of qualities are you looking for in a girlfriend and what kind of girls in reality have you been attracted to? Compare the qualities in this 2 columns, are they in conflict? How do you think you are able to match both of them? You need some quiet time for this and a whole lot of thinking for yourself, <strong>what you want in your life</strong> and the <strong>quality </strong>of your partner. Especially pertaining to your significant other, this is not a matter to be "qing cai" or "anyhow" about.</p>
              <p>I am going to be very presumptous here again, but I just want to say, we may not be able to choose our family, but we sure can choose the <strong>good </strong>friends we want to surround ourselves with and<strong> that includes your significant other.</strong> Respect yourself, learn how to walk away from situations we find ourselves uncomfortable in, learn to be more open and assertive, and respect will come your way.</p>
