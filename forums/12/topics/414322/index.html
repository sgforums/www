              <p>I recently grad from university with some AASS degree and got a job in decent company with okay pay - around average for AASS. Nothing seems great. I'm not on fast-track to success...and frankly not really interested in the job. Was at first, but now work environment and all, not really motivated. don't feel any fire in me.</p>
              <p>Do you think life is just about sticking though it, work hard and find enjoyment outside of work/weekends...to afford a good life?</p>
              <p>When I think about it, I feel like this is horrible. Unless I really impress in my work and have good success, I will be nothing and yet having to deal with job dissatisfaction. I want to feel more alive. But my friends, accountants, doctors, lawyers, engineers, business...go bank, law firm, accounting firm...etc all earn more than me. I feel scared that if i stick on this road, i'm still inferior. If I don't stick, I scared I regret in future if my uni friends see me end up doing some crap job crap life.</p>

              <p>Really sad that to you, earning more than you means job satisfaction and feeling superior. That is completely the wrong way to think and completely the right kind of thinking that will allow you to feel miserable the rest of your life.</p>
              <p>You know something. People envy me because I stay at home all day without working. Then I say I am unemployed. Then they despise me. Then I tell them I don't have to work because my business is making money to keep me alive. Then they envy me. Then I said, but it's probably making less money than you. Then they feel superior. Then I said, you make $20k/month right? Then they said only $3k. So I said, oh then in that case I make more than you. Then they envy me. If you notice, all the while, the situation never changed. If you want happiness, you have to stop comparing yourself with others. Maybe I might be wrong, but so far, that works in my life. I am happy almost everyday except for the occasional PMS.</p>
              <p>Or maybe we're different. Maybe I shouldn't impose my type of thinking to how you should live your life. To me, I just crave to be happy. I don't crave for luxury items. Of course I need money for food and those stuff, the people who said so you don't need money of course they are talking rubbish. The fact is, beyond the need for survival, happiness is a matter of choice more than money. The other thing I am doing is pursuing my dreams. That makes me happy too. Making money from it is a bonus (apart of the survival I mentioned).</p>
              <p>If you notice, maybe accidently or something, the richest people got so rich partly because they pursue their dreams. Facebook, Google, eBay originally were all non-profit. =) In fact, YouTube too!</p>

              <p>so you compare your pay to the accountants, doctors, lawyers etc who earns much more than you. once you earn more than them, what's next? compare to the other ceos, ministers, property tycoons?</p>
              <p>keep on comparing until you earn the most - and then what? try to keep that income and refuse to retire? do everything to hold on to power when you're old, inventing new positions for yourself to promote to?</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>my opinion of money is this -&gt; enough to survive can liao. no need to be greedy. if your desire for money outweighs yourself, you'll spend (and waste) your whole life chasing after it</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>if you say my pay is low, i'll compare to all the jobless, unemployed pmets out there</p>
              <p>if i end up jobless, i'll compare to those who can't even afford a roof over their heads and needs to resort to camping</p>
              <p>if one day i'm homeless, i'll compare to those who died while chasing the neverending money game, without the chance to live out their lives</p>
              <p>if one day i die, then there's no need to compare anymore =P</p>

              <p>angel young girl, not that botak understand life more, just that botak put in effort to gain knowledge in reading.</p>
              <p>dont limit yourself only on maths and engineering or on business and finance. this knowledge will only solve your work problem.</p>
              <p>when u encounter problem in human relationship at work place or within your famliy or if u dont know how to handle your kid, read up subject like social psychology and child psychology.</p>
              <p>when u encounter problem about life, read up subject like religion, history and eastern philosophy.</p>
              <p>when u encounter problem about office politic then go read up political science.</p>
              <p>all this knowledge are free where u can go national library to get the books to read. if u are lazy then u can also surf wiki or watch youtube from the internet.</p>
              <p>gaining knowledge will increase your wisdom. lol</p>
              <p>last but not lease, moral education also very important, if not when u gain knowledge u will go and do all the bad things.</p>
