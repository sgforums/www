If not u will going to struggle in uni. Even if u going to chemical engin, it is pretty different from the chemistry u study in sec or jc. I will say that chemical engin is something like chemical manufacturing. maybe u can surf nus or ntu for their chemical engin course  for more infor.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink" title="Wink"></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>physics - no need to memorise the formulae and explanation at all if you can understand and visualise the concepts, which will be pretty simple actually. easiest of the three subjects to get top scores with least studying provided you do the regular tutorials and grasp concepts of the workings of daily phenomenon without much fuss. also, the exam questions will not be as stingy with marks awarded since many marks go to workings and the points you write down for the explanations are more easily accepted than in biology or chemistry<br><br>chemistry - not so much with formulae. but the concepts are more abstract than those in physics and so hard to visualise. so, you have to memorise. organic chemistry will be a killer to cram. what's worse is that chemistry exams are harder to score, since there will generally be more nitpicking at various keywords and points brought out in the numerous explanation questions.<br><br>biology - your perfect choice if you are the type who takes in knowledge wholesale and vomits out everything during examinations without much understanding of the subject matter. again, nitpicking of details in the essay questions, but overall easier than chemistry to score if you have photographic memory. helpful if you are aiming for a place in the medicine faculty and have the calibre to do so.</div>
