            <div class='col-md body'>hey, given the fact that you have so much problems, could the reason be you yourself? I'm not fault finding but usually before I look outwards for reasons on my problems, I first look within myself, before I look outwards. Sometimes it's me not doing a good job. But of course sometimes it's really beyond our control.<br><br>But let's just say, everyone have ups and downs. When I was down that time, I closed my eyes, with tears, cycling against traffic in the expressway, I fell down but never genna accident. Genna honk until siaoz... But now my life is totally amazing... My parents dun dare to be mean to me anymore, because they know they need me to take care of them. I am not worried about social life because I have learnt to be more open and outgoing and friendlier, last time I always cage myself. I also have not much financial worries, because I'm not a materialistic guy and living simply makes me very happy.<br><br>I don't know what your actual problems are, so I can't say much of it, but I believe time helps to change things, and I believe, eventually, once you get pass these down stages, you'll get to the happier times, and that's when you will appreciate whatever happened.<br><br>At that moment of my craziness, which I could have knocked down by any car, when I think back, I learnt some very good lessons and I never forget them because it's so emotional. Because of these lessons, I have mastered to be very happy and appreciate life. Sometimes, from the bad things, you will get good things, but because you're so focus on the bad things, you are unable to see the good things that is happening around you. Life is just a game, enjoy it.</div>
