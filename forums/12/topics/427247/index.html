              <p>Cold war is a passive aggressive tactic.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cold war only works on people who gives a shit about you. By withholding love/concern/attention... you seek to passively punish and to gain control of the situation.</p>
              <p>Your mother may not always be right in your eyes. She may have her own reason for her behavior/action.</p>
              <p>Just because she does not share your perspective does not means you should punish her for it.</p>
              <p>Agree to disagree..as long as she is not endangering you or disrupting your normal life.. Live and let live.</p>

              <p>Speaking to <em>The New Paper</em> from their four-room HDB flat in Simei, accountant Jayden Liu, 24, said, "Now, we can only pray that a miracle happens before we lose her or the roof over our heads."</p>
              <p>Jayden now works part time in a karaoke chain, and more than half his S$3,900 take-home pay goes towards paying relatives from whom he borrowed money to clear his mother's debts (of more than $300k).</p>
              <p>When asked by the same paper about her children's struggle, the hawker mum said, "I really don't think it's any of their business what I do, even if the creditors come hounding. If they are so unhappy, they can always move out."</p>
              <p>On her suicide threat, she added that it was only a threat, and she never really intended to jump.</p>
              <p>All mothers are good to their children? My ass! This is just 1 article on the newspaper, what about those whose children are suffering but their plights are unknown because they did not report to the newspaper? Sorry to say, life isn't always fair.</p>

              <p>Speaking to <em>The New Paper</em> from their four-room HDB flat
              in Simei, accountant Jayden Liu, 24, said, "Now, we can only pray
              that a miracle happens before we lose her or the roof over our
              heads."</p>
              <p>Jayden now works part time in a karaoke chain, and more than
              half his S$3,900 take-home pay goes towards paying relatives from
              whom he borrowed money to clear his mother's debts (of more than
              $300k).</p>
              <p>When asked by the same paper about her children's struggle, the
              hawker mum said, "I really don't think it's any of their business
              what I do, even if the creditors come hounding. If they are so
              unhappy, they can always move out."</p>
              <p>On her suicide threat, she added that it was only a threat, and
              she never really intended to jump.</p>
              <p>All mothers are good to their children? My ass! This is just 1
              article on the newspaper, what about those whose children are
              suffering but their plights are unknown because they did not report
              to the newspaper? Sorry to say, life isn't always fair.</p>

              <p>This guy is stupid. He shoulda just let her go into bankruptcy.</p>
              <p>A bankrupt mother is not a dead mother. She is financially responsible under her own name. The other relatives want to keep giving her money is they themselves stupid.</p>
              <p>Instead of paying for her debt, the siblings shoulda just go and get themself a roof over their heads elsewhere.</p>
              <p>Fillial piety is a virtue..but these morons couldn't differentiate that from plain ol stupidity.</p>
              <p>Your mother owes people money only you disown her ?</p>
              <p>But when she strike lottery, you will suck her toes and hope she don't live too long, yes ?</p>
              <p>Yes, life isn't fair to people who are born a dumbass. She shoulda flushed you down the toilet.</p>

              I guess its really on a case by case basis and we can't be too quick to judge / blame either the parent or the child for the outcome of things. Afterall, it takes two hands to clap rite ?
              
              No one is perfect and its foolhardy to believe that parents (or the children for that matter) are oblivious to their actions. We're all adults here after all. There is a level of expectation that we perform at a reasonable social level in society and that should also equate equal respect to our families and close friends.
              
              I'm a bit tired of people playing that "get out of jail free" card where they insist that their families, BFs, relatives, etc need to put up with their bad tempers or unreasonable demands simply cuz blood is thicker than water; wake up. One day, people will have enough and they will walk out on you. 
              
              My two cents worth - if someone is a toxic influence on your life, you reserve the right to remove that person :)

              <p>the last time my mum do that, and it's obviously her fault, i
              left home. a few years already now i never return. i believe when
              people do wrong things, they need to apologize and change for the
              better, then people will respect them.</p>
              <p>can't say just they are parents means they are always right.
              what about those fathers sexually abuse their child for years? all
              those people who say mother always have the child best interests at
              heart obviously never see newspaper about mother killing their
              children or flushing the babies down the toilet...</p>
              <p>nowadays children are of a different generation. you cannot use
              past generation child rearing methods to raise the new gen
              children. it is just not effective.</p>
              <p>now back to the topic, since you're not me, probably you want to
              let bygones be bygones, forgive and forget. people like me super
              stubborn, what i believe in, i strongly go for it. i can't say
              stubborn is a good or bad trait because it's how i grow my company
              through the recession period and endure through all the hardships.
              some of the hardships came because i strongly believe in my values.
              i would rather suffer hardships in the name of justice than go the
              corrupted way and take the easy life.</p>
