            <div class='col-md body'>hi everyone.. tis my first posting.<br>i split which my gf abt 5 mths ago. we emailed each other since, but did not talk or go out. (it was a amicable breakup). recently, she's emailed me asking if i'm going out with someone. replied saying that i am jus friends with tis girl, too early to tell(truth). then she replied saying that she has found someone new and his mum likes her and stuff... the guy's 29 and her colleague. my ex and i are both 23. the problem is i still have feelings for her, and would like to get back together with her.<br><br>my questions are: does she mean anything by asking these questions and telling me these? is she jus being friendly? what are the chances she doesnt actually have a new bf? what should i do now?<br><br>thx in advance.<br><br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>From the sounds of it... all i can conclude is that she probably still likes you...and was hoping that you would try and get her back by hinting that she has found someone else... but... that is what i think... i may be wrong...  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_sad.gif" alt="Sad" title="Sad"><br>I hope you can get her back though... seeing that you still like her so very much... otherwise, your only choice left is to move on...<br><br>------------------<br>In your service,<br>Dragonlance</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>My opinion is that she is only trying to strike up a conversation. If she really wants to get back with you, she will drop some hints such as "you are more suitable than him".."how i wish he can behave in certain way like u"..."I sort of regret..." etc, u get what i mean?. I may be wrong.<br><br>Anyway, nothing wrong with being friends, and if you really likes her, tell her about it and see whether or not she will recipocrate.</div>
