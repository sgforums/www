That is because, nobody can write for "everybody". I am a writer. I know. You can write in simple language for children and use simple concepts since you are targeting at children. You can also write as if you are writing for experts in the field and consider very advance concepts, AND THERE ARE MANY TYPES OF PEOPLE IN BETWEEN!<br><br>The reader must play his part. S/he must read with a critical mind and that is, S/he must consider what is written and the bases (reasons, explanation) behind the concepts, whether they agree with the concepts and techniques taught them in the book.<br><br>In that sense there are no "bad" books. You read the book and all the book does is to "give you ideas". You then pick up the "good" ideas and suitable ideas and discard those that are not suitable for you or you are not convinced based on the reasons provided by the writer.<br><br>You need not worry about the book giving you the wrong ideas if you read books critically and intelligently.<br><br>I think we all know that Chin Eng is one of the Moderators of ~Eternal Hope~ a Christian forum (Moderators: sillyme, Chin Eng, ben1xy) and I am brining this up because it is relevant and not meant to insult anyone). I think that it is important to know where CE as Mod of a Christian forum and a religious person is coming from when he asks "what experts"?.<br><br>Christians and other religious people are taught to "accept" "believe" and "not criticize". It is "THE WORD of GOD".

In the real world, people will read the reasons behind the proposals and accept or reject them accordingly.<br><br>ShrodingersCat: I think you have made is abundantly clear that you too are of the opinion that parents should seek expert advice and read as much as possible regarding the concepts and techniques of parenting, but you have cautioned that it might not necessarily lead to success. While it might not lead to success, there are no better alternatives.<br><br>This is like saying that people should go to school even though not everyone will pass the exams (there are no better alternatives, practically speaking). Or saying that people should go to hospitals even though some people die in hospitals (there are no better alternatives, practically speaking).<br><br>So it is, "read as much as possible on Parenting and learn as many ideas/concepts and techniques as possible but learn how to use the ideas/concepts and techniques wisely.</div>

They are expected to believe that "GOD SAID IT, I BELIEVE IT, AND THAT SETTLES IT."<br><br>Google Results 1 - 10 of about 9,960 for "God Said It, I Believe It, That Settles It".<br></div></blockquote>aiyah, no end lah... wake up so early to post.... cannot sleep ah?<br><br><strong>again, mr yap misunderstand </strong>- and if he has not misunderstood, <strong>please <span style="color: red;">point out clearly </span>where: chin eng says that there is NO NEED FOR EXPERTS</strong>.<br><br><strong>i ask: please define what "experts" are</strong>. my question is based on the understanding that we need to draw the line as to what we are discussing about. if i say, that "experts" are my ancestors, he might say these people has no formal training, so we need to define as to what mr yap thinks are experts.<br><br>it must also be understood that andrew pk yap is in the habit of asking too many questions without bothering to answer questions directed to him.<br><br>it must also be understood mr yap is a<strong><span style="color: red;"> sacked </span></strong>moderator because of his confrontational style and that he had chosen to undermind the main mod, as he is not able to take criticism and <strong>WILL </strong>edit threads and posts commenting on him. <strong>this is pointed out so that all will have no delusion on the propensity of mr yap to be destructive and has no qualms about putting words in your mouth.</strong> I am sure I'd not be able to last this long if he is the mod of AA <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing"><br><br>while the long discourse by mr yap earlier defined clearly what a writer is, it has not defined what an expert is. i feel that mr yap is UNWILLING to define what an expert is because it will put him in the spot - again! <strong>a person who writes does not qualify him to be an expert.</strong> and <strong>an expert may not be a person who writes.</strong> such a simple concept, yet ...... hmm......<br><br>note the KEYWORD is EXPERT - not WRITER.<br><br>while mr yap had taken great pains to point out who chin eng (as if these folks do not know) is, he has also taken great pains to put words in my mouth by making wild assumptions about what i should or should not do.<br><br>since when has mr yap be willing to draw clearly what he is talking about, because by doing so, he is unable to wriggle out of his own definition. just look at THIS THREAD - it has gone OUT OF TOPIC from post one as the topic title states very clearly that the discussion is on GOOD PARENTING SKILLS based on THE EASTERN or WESTERN CONCEPT, yet along the line, this is totally discarded.<br><br><strong>Why, mr yap? write a book with a title then in the middle of it talk about something else???? </strong> yup, you sure is a good writer <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing" title="Laughing">  <strong><span style="color: red;">can't wait for the next book, because it's like a mystery gift, you'd never know what you'd get.</span></strong></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>it should be noted that mr yap can choose to end this by continuing constructively on this thread, based on what he has defined (regardless of the fact that it is different from the title). yet mr yap has chosen to nitpick on folks that he disagree with, dissecting on the points he is not happy with....<br><br>yet very strangely, he has written:<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The reader must play his part. S/he must read with a critical mind and that is, S/he must consider what is written and the bases (reasons, explanation) behind the concepts, whether they agree with the concepts and techniques taught them in the book.<br><br>In that sense there are no "bad" books. You read the book and all the book does is to "give you ideas". You then pick up the "good" ideas and suitable ideas and discard those that are not suitable for you or you are not convinced based on the reasons provided by the writer. </span><br><br>....yet he embarks on a journey where he'd labelled all he disagree with as delusional.....<br><br>....i really don't know if the intention of mr yap is to continue to look for pointers in good parenting skills, or that he desires all to lie prostrate at his feet and tell him how learned and clever he is.<br><br>....if, mr yap, you have anything constructive to add to your own post by means of real good pointers of parenting, please do so, otherwise, you had destroyed your own thread.</div>

An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability in a particular area of study. Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. An expert can be, by virtue of training, education, profession, publication or experience, believed to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially (and legally) rely upon the individual's opinion. Historically, an expert was referred to as a sage. The individual was usually a profound philosopher distinguished for wisdom and sound judgment.<br><br>from : <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert" rel="nofollow">Expert From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a></div>
