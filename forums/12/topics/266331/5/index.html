            <div class='col-md body'>I think that experts are over-rated at times. Sure, experts do bring in suggestions and ideas that the parent did not even think to consider. However, it's still important to consider whether these suggestions or ideas are necessary at times.<br><br><strong>So if people take the attitude: "There's no right or wrong sometimes." does that mean that people do not bother to learn parenting skills? </strong><br><br>There's no right or wrong, does not mean that people do not bother to learn. It will simply mean that people should proceed with this mentality as they go about finding more information. Each person has their own judgement on what's right or wrong.<br><br><strong>So all in all, it is better that parents read and learn as much as possible instead of simply going with their own "beliefs and delusions".</strong><br><br>In actual fact, it is common sense that it is better for parents to read and learn as much as possible. This is true, irregardless of what topic you are learning at the moment (parenting is a topic, I guess). The question is, as you have mentioned, where should parents acquire their knowledge. From the recognized experts? Probably... But how about from the old too? From those who had past experience on raising children? Is it in our society to place such great emphasis on experts opinions, to forgo the lessons and experiences passed down through the generations?<br><br>Just a passing thought:<br><br>Suppose expert advice do help. If parents were to wholeheartedly listen and follow  experts' advice, what would this society become? A society that is so focussed on perfection that parents have to be taught the correct way to raise their baby? A society that has become a factory outlet because each baby are being raised by Standard Measures?<br><br>A question to ponder:<br>Why would parents want to parent their child in the first place? For love? For responsibility? For their (the parents) own future? Or?<br><br>Sidetrack:<br>I'm sleepy</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Learning from the experts does not mean that you give up "common sense". What it means is that, you might rather not trust your common sense or modify your common sense if your common sense conflicts with the recommendation of the experts.<br><br>ditto "parenting advice from the old"<br><br>ditto "Love"<br><br>What is love? If what you think is the "loving thing to do" and that harms the child according to the experts, will you still go with "love"? Will you not modify your "loving"?<br><br>Like the "lock up the child together with you" "to deprive the child of the attention it seeks" recommendation by the experts... sure, it is distressing for the child... but is letting the child suffer some distress, "loving" or not letting the child suffer any distress "loving"?<br><br>If the child is suffering from pain or sickness and making a nuisance of itself, should you similarly lock up the child? Should the parent "slap" the child for making a nuisance of itself because of pain or sickness?<br><br>The technique "lock up the child to deprive it of the attention it seeks" is a technique that parents can now consider because they "have knowledge of it".<br><br>The parent can then use it when the child starts making a nuisance of itself screaming and shouting in the department store because the parent refused to buy it the toy it wants. The parent can scream back at the child or try to talk to the child "nicely" and if the child refuse to stop making a nuisance of himself, the parent now has another "method" up his sleeve.<br><br>If the parent never heard of this "technique" how can the parent know that he can "to lock the child up in the toilet cubicle together with the child"?<br><br>The knowledge empowers the parent.

            <div class='col-md body'>I don't know about kids or parenting. But I know what is good and bad behaviour from kids and parents.  I've not seen good behaviour from Local Parents and Kids. So a sweeping statement is that, local parenting skills really suck. I have my fair share of BIL kids in my house. When they run amok and throw all sorts of tantrums, destroy property, etc. The 2 parents seeing them acting out negative behaviour did not correct them, did not speak up and instead expect us, the host to correct and teach their kids. Their kids are in my place 7 days a week. You think I want to correct someone's kids? I cannot care less besides, I do not know if there are any thing that the parents do not like me to teach and then cause more conflict because of them. They are not my kids - so they should not be my problem.<br><br>I see so many ill behaved teens and kids all over the place. Seriously, I can only blame the parents for their bad parenting to bring up such a ill mannered generation.</div>
