Each case is probably different.<br><br>Maybe these parents think that discipline is killing creativity... But because we live in a social world, there are rules to abide by, like it or not. Discipline actually increases creativity, because less time is wasted on correcting bad behavior down the road.<br><br>I don't want to be too judgemental about your colleague. Maybe she has a room in her house that allows the children to draw on walls and stuff like that, which I think is wonderful if she, the parent, can take it.<br><br>But if her children starts hitting others, and she starts defending them by saying they have a freedom to express themselves.. and the "other party" starts it first and is wrong, then I think we may agree there is a problem there.<br><br>Alternatively, she might have her own experiences which stifle creativity in herself that prompts her to adopt the extreme... this is where the arguments about parental experiences you and Andrew have said come into the picture.<br><br>The key thing is achieving a balance that allows your child to express himself/herself without fear and judgement, and keeping him/her behaving within boundaries.<br><br>It is not easy, and I am still learning...<br></div>

We need yardsticks to determine whether A or B is right.<br><br>"A" will insist that he is right and "B" will insist that he is right. Usually people have their reasons for saying that they are right.

For example, if it is recommended by the Ministry of Health, then you know that it must have achieved some credibility after some scrutiny by experts in the field.<br><br>You might want to read widely even from sources that are not "accredited" to give you an idea what the issues are and reflect whether or not you have considered the issues or have missed them.<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ordinaryguy32:</div><div class="quote_body">Sometimes to be a good parent, one must look within himself/herself first.

            <div class='col-md body'>Maybe I am the guilty party of going into specifics on the correct ways on parenting, eg. starting the argument about how to discipline a child when he/she has misbehaved in public.<br><br>Andrew,<br>I share your opinion on the need for expert opinion, and I think every parent should pick up a book and learn about parenting.<br><br>But seeking expert opinion on something is only a means to an end, and not the end itself.<br><br>Well, perhaps discussing about how to do parenting well in this thread is not relevant, and we should all talk about the importance of seeking help from reliable sources.<br><br>Permit me to be guilty of irrelevance again, but the lockup thing you have suggested is very extreme, and sometimes a child only wants attention. Throwing him into a dark room and letting him cry till he stops is very traumatic, and should be used very sparingly.<br><br>But having said that, maybe that is totally irrelevant in this thread.<br><br></div>
