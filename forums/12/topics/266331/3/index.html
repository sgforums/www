Most times they're not refuting your statements, merely just adding and extrapolating from there.  This process is called a discussion.  There's no need to go on the attack.  At the end of it all nobody needs to change anybody's minds about anything, it's just a sharing of ideas.</div></blockquote>This is a good example of extrapolating:<blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MiX Metal:</div><div class="quote_body">Reading books from experts on how to bring up your child is good but I feel that the parents should first understand their children in order for it to work as every child is different and so by understanding the child then they will know which methods are best in helping them. Some requires a soft touch while others will need the "locking the child up" method.</div></blockquote>and my replay to him was:<blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by AndrewPKYap:</div><div class="quote_body">Agreed... reading what the experts say is the starting point... for you to seriously consider the best way to bring up your children. If as parents you do not even want to learn what the experts say and cling on to your own beliefs and delusions, that is very alarming... </div></blockquote>When people start putting the experts down... I don't think that is acceptable... and yes I have to attack their POV. What are they suggesting? That people should not refer to expert advice? Then what?
