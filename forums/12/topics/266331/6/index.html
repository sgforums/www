In ToyRUs, on the streets, in kindergarten...<br><br>I would like to say that it is nobody's responsibility but the parents (and maybe the teachers) to correct the behavior of such kids.<br><br>Usually parents with such kids are busy pursuing the finer points of life, and have no knowledge/desire to discipline their children, and we may all agree it is very sad and pathetic.<br><br>I know you don't want to have kids of your own for now, due to the "evidence" of bad state of kids these days, but I like to add that the discipline of your kids is entirely in your hands. That's the good news. The not-so-good news is as you may know already, it is no easy feat to balance discipline and love/freedom.<br><br>There are parents in SG that are willing to learn/accept the responsibility of disciplining their kids (I like to say I am one of them, and others in this forum like Chin Eng, Andrew too)... but we are in the minority, sadly...<br><br>Hopefully this forum can help create awareness of such a need..</div>

If what you think is the "loving thing to do" and that harms the child according to the experts, will you still go with "love"? Will you not modify your "loving"?<br><br>Like the "lock up the child together with you" "to deprive the child of the attention it seeks" recommendation by the experts... sure, it is distressing for the child... but is letting the child suffer some distress, "loving" or not letting the child suffer any distress "loving"?<br><br>If the child is suffering from pain or sickness and making a nuisance of itself, should you similarly lock up the child? Should the parent "slap" the child for making a nuisance of itself because of pain or sickness?<br><br>The technique "lock up the child to deprive it of the attention it seeks" is a technique that parents can now consider because they "have knowledge of it".<br><br>The parent can then use it when the child starts making a nuisance of itself screaming and shouting in the department store because the parent refused to buy it the toy it wants. The parent can scream back at the child or try to talk to the child "nicely" and if the child refuse to stop making a nuisance of himself, the parent now has another "method" up his sleeve.<br><br>If the parent never heard of this "technique" how can the parent know that he can "to lock the child up in the toilet cubicle together with the child"?<br><br>The knowledge empowers the parent. Parents, get the knowledge.</div></blockquote>I think everyone's idea of common sense is about the same, but I do not wish to open a can of worms talking about the definition of it.<br><br>Taking a long term view, if the love I dish out harms the child long term, according to the experts, I will modify my behaviour accordingly.<br><br>Letting the child suffer some distress depends on whether the child experiences trauma or not. Again, that depends on what the expert thinks. I used to dish the cane when my child is 1-2 years old, and I have learnt since not to use it.<br><br>I agree that parents should get as much knowledge as possible.<br><br>The danger is we shouldn't follow blindly the teachings of others, but to learn to use our instincts and common sense.. I think all of us are "human" enough to know that we are not delusional, and sometimes following the teachings of others blindly can lead to imbalance.

You just need to know what to do and when to do it.<br><br>The last thing you should do is become to your kids "public enemy number one" or "old foggies with ancient concepts and ideas".<br><br>Unfortunately you need a lot of time to explain your positions and gain their trust and friendship and time is something Singapore parents do not have.
