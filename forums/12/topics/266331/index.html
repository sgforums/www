            <div class='col-md body'>Do you think that there are differences between Eastern and Western Parenting techniques?<br><span style="color: red;">Yes. Western techniques do not emphasize on filial piety and respect. They emphasize on individual rights. Eastern techniques tend to be pretty hierachial (?sp).</span><br><br>Do you think that there are Good/Better and Bad/Worse Parenting techniques?<br><span style="color: red;">No. There is no real answer because the child is the variable, and as in any strategy, techniques change because of the variables.</span><br><span style="color: blue;"><strong>What is believed to be good in one household can be seen to be bad in another. However one thing is true: neglect will probably qualify as an absolutely bad parenting technique.</strong> </span><br><br>Is Parenting a Skill (that you can develop and get better at) or Instinct (everyong is naturally good at it)?<br><span style="color: red;">A little of both, and a hint of common sense wouldn't hurt. Many modern parents read parenting books and impliment wholesale, what is written, yet these parents do not apply common sense when dealing with their children.</span><br><br>Do you think that just because the Parent/s wants the best for the child, they naturally knows what to do, how to bring up the child?<br><span style="color: red;">No. Many parents think they want the best for the child, but the reality is they want to live off their own dreams. Therefore they make decisions based on what they think is best, but not necessarily in the interest of the child.</span><br><br>Do you think that people sub-consciously learn their Parenting techniques from their Parents and that most people do not make the effort to learn what is considered good Parenting skills / techniques?<br><span style="color: red;">Depends on the individual and their experiences in the past. Some will learn the techniques wholesale, others will modify, yet others will totally disagree with the techniques. I am not sure what statistics are we looking at.</span><br><br>How do you rate your parents' parenting skills and will you be better at it yourself?<br><span style="color: red;">I rate myself way better than average, obviously there is always room for improvement.</span><br><br>Do you wish you have better parents? Do you wish you will be a better parent?<br><span style="color: red;">Yes, but time is irrevisible. Yes, there is always room for improvement.</span><br><br>These comments are merely my opinion based on my experience.</div>

(not retarded/autistic... and so on)... I believe that the good parenting techniques will work well on the child. All parents should learn good parenting techniques.<br><br>Humans on the whole, "believe in themselves" and their reasonings (common sense).<br><br>That is most unfortunate. There are good techniques (you need to develop skills to apply the techniques well) and parents should learn what these are and not depend on their own reasonings or common sense.<br><br>If what they believe is what the authorities say, then good. Otherwise, they should have a serious rethink as to the validity of their own "common" sense. That is contingent on the fact that they must know what the authorities recommend.<br><br>If they disagree with what the authorities recommend, then they must have valid reasons for disagreeing. That is why having a logical mind and knowing the rules of logic and knowing what makes a good argument is very important. If you decide to go with your "common sense" based on "poor arguments" in your own head, that is most unfortunate.<br><br>For example, a boss in a company can use his common sense in handling his workers or he can see what the best practices in HR Management are. If he decides to go with his common sense and he decided on that based on illogical and poor arguments, that would be most unfortunate.<br><br>In a small company, it might not be so important. In an big company, the consequences can be very drastic if the best practices of HR management are not implemented.<br><br>You cannot say, every worker is different and so, there is no need to implement the best practices of Human resource management in the company.<br><br>If you get an independent consultant in, he will be able to tell the boss, "This is the consequence of doing this and that and these are the consequences (consequences can be in the form of opportunity costs, hidden) of not doing that.<br><br>The boss will not be able to see it because people see things from their own subjective (inaccurate) point of view rather than an objective (more accurate) point of view.<br><br>It is better not to trust your own perspective and change your perspectives to those of recognized authorities in the field (need not be people but can be a list of best practices, for example)<br><br>Parenting involves the lives of your own children and if parents want to mess up their children's lives, (or is tida apa about giving the best for their own child/ren), that is the parents' prerogative and their responsibility.<br><br>I can only urge parents to learn the techniques of good parenting from recognized authorities rather than on their own common sense. There are many consequences that are hidden that people do not realize and cannot see.</div>

Understanding SELF is a more important step than understanding theories.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">nevertheless, understanding SELF is almost impossible for some people and at the very least, take the effort to learn what "good parenting" is all about.</span><br><br>-----------------------------------<br>How do you rate your parents' parenting skills and will you be better at it yourself?<br><br>Quote ShrodingersCat: <span style="color: green;">No parents are perfect. But I feel that for what its worth, through my life I have always felt they loved me. That had formed the basis of my relationship with them which is good and that is the most important message I will wish to pass to my children.</span><br><br><span style="color: darkred;">That in my opinion is the biggest cop out why parents do not bother to learn good parenting skills... they always says: "but I love them... but I only want the best for them... but I am all sincerity...." Like Pink's song say: keep your dreams and just give me the money... (do the necessary and that is, equip yourself with parenting skills)</span><br><br>-----------------------------------<br>Do you wish you have better parents?
