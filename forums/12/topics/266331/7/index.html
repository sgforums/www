How to prevent them?<br><br>That is where learning from the experts come in handy. Some people had spent time and effort to think through all the issues, and might as well learn from them instead of acting based on your own "beliefs and delusions" or running out of ideas altogether.</div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by ShrodingersCat:</div><div class="quote_body">I wish to emphasize that EXECUTION of techniques is far more complex than simply understanding the theory....</div></blockquote><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by MiX Metal:</div><div class="quote_body">I think you misunderstood me. What I meant to say is that Learning from experts is a good thing, but as there are alot of different techniques given and every technique works differently on each child as what I've said in my previous post that some requires a soft touch and others the "locking up method" that you've mention.<br><br>Therefore I feel that after reading books from experts, parents should also make the effort to understand their child so that they'll not use the wrong technique on their child.  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile">  </div></blockquote></div>

He flat refused. I feel sad thinking about some job issues. Or I make negative comments about anything, job, TV or any f-thing. He tell me to stop and not talk. I cannot have a black face from bad day. I must act like clown or everyone thinks I am angry with them. I cannot feel unwell or sick because he does not believe it. Anything I do will affect his mood for the day. But he is for most days, most times, moody and black faced. I still have to remain cheerful otherwise it will make his day worse and then I am to be blamed. Anyways, like I say, regret.<br><br>Take them for movies. These kids cannot behave and stand still for one moment. Their own parents don't even want to bring them along when they go shopping. When these kids go out, the MIL must tag along to take care of them both. Bring them out on my own? To be responsible for them? Tough job even their parents reject.<br></div></blockquote>Well, personally, I think counselling will definitely help. Why don't you ask him again? You can put it in a extremely nice way, and maybe dangle some carrots.<br><br>It sounds like he's rather weak. But all hope is not lost. If he agrees to go to counselling, I think things will improve dramatically!<br><br>Maybe you and your hubby can bring only one of the kids, whoever behaves better. One at a time. Sometimes kids, being ridded of their troublemaking gang members, sober up.<br><br>The thing is if you help bring one of them out, you can spend time with ur hubby, and he is not guilty of not helping his mom take care of them.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>After considering that HB has already to deal with his beloved mother and listen to her endless complains. He already has his hands full with his beloved mother, BIL kids and whatever work problems. He effectively has a wonderful family. He had no intention to start a new one with me. I was expected to join the existing and change myself to fit. For the past year, I only hear what I failed to do, what I never do correctly, what I should do/act so as to make everyone happy, etc. I felt demonized for creating such unhappiness in his family. So I want to move out. It was viewed negatively. Its a situation where everything I do is wrong. I considered sucide. Then I consider divorce. I considered everything. sadly, we have only married 1 year. What a failure.</div>
