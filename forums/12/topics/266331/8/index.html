That people learn from the experts or go with "a big dose of common sense and love"?<br><br>Or is he suggesting to "learn from the experts but make sure you learn the lessons well or else don't learn"? What? Learn or don't learn?</div></blockquote>Clarification:<br><br>I am suggesting.. basically what I have written - it is good to learn from experts BUT without a big dose of common sense and love to EXECUTE what you have learnt, sometimes a lot of parents take the theory wholesale and can even carry it too far.<br><br>Also different experts can advocate contradicting theories, for e.g. within the area of autism or children with ADHD - how to handle such kids. Without understanding, common sense and love - it is hard to pick and choose which is the most SUITABLE technique for your child.<br><br>Why is there this difference?<br><br>Example: I have met some dedicated parents who spend a lot of time with their children to teach them at home. They use specific techniques in teaching that they have learnt from experts. However, the objectives of both parents can be very different.<br><br>One spends the time interacting with the child valuing the INTERACTION. the other parent spends the time with the dominant desire to IMPROVE the grades.  The first child was ready for such a teaching technique, but the second wasn't. The technique used for teaching was similar - the results of such a technique was different.<br><br>Does this mean that it is bad for the parents to learn from experts? No, because in both cases, both children have improved academically. This is the benefit of learning from an expert.<br><br>However, in the case of the second child, due to the expectations of the parents, the increased pressure at home actually resulted in a decreased concentration span in school. This affects the child social behaviour, and may cause a permanent impact on the child's learning ability due to a shortened concentration span. This is because the child was not ready for a technique specified by an expert.<br><br>This does not mean the parents have failed to learn from the expert, but that the parents lack of understanding of their child's needs. Also while parents may learn techniques from experts- they do not become experts themselves.<br><br>I am sure you understand that there isn't just Yes or No, black and white in the world. <strong>The success of anything is dependent on many factors - to say that it might fail due to certain factors<span style="text-decoration: underline;"> does not mean that I disagree</span> with the original intent of constant learning.</strong><br><br>Personally I think what most parents need is COMMON SENSE, and understanding of their children and Love. A lot of parents have brought up intelligent, well behaved children in the past with totally no expert help --- simply because they have COMMON SENSE and they love their children.<br><br>Eh i tot topic closed?</div>

On the contrary, his brother may be more independent and spoilt.<br><br>His mom probably used emotional blackmail to manipulate ur hubby "Do it, boy or I dun like you" when he is young. And he hasn't learnt to break away from this type of relationship.<br><br>He wants you to be happy, but faults you if you are unhappy. The reason for that is he is emotionally weak. This is not a forever state and can be changed. But it is difficult.<br><br>He needs to learn to be his own man, if he wants any chance of sustaining his marriage.. And by the way, with his attitude, no sg woman out there would fall for him, despite his threats of wasting other women.<br><br>For your work problems, you can pick out some self-help books to learn to be more assertive and courageous in saying "No".
