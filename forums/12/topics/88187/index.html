(2) is pretty LOUSY... Unless you're REALLY that FANTASTIC LOOKING (and she happens to be much of a 'looks creature') then you'll stand a CHANCE... Or she already have a liking for you to start with... If she happens to like BLOD and DARING guys (even then you still have to consider the fact that she might not like a desperate guy or a tactless guy?)....<br><br>(1) can be a HINT... Try to find out what she's reading then FIND OUT MORE about THAT comics.. Hopefully you can use that to strike up a conversation with her?  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt="Mr. Green" title="Mr. Green"></div>

Methods like such... But it'll be idea if you do a little bit of 'research' and get to know at least a bit bout the kinda comics she's into and what she reads about...
