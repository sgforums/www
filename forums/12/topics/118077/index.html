            <div class='col-md body'>I think is very hard to say whether that person is ready for commitment then go for a relationship. Sometimes we do see some students barely 12-13 yrs r holding hands and into a relationship. Do they know what is commitment? If your nephew really like that girl, jus go after her. Last time I do puzzled bout this, and miss the boat. Hope your nephew wont b affected by what other say.</div>

He said he is not ready for one that will need him to be emotionally involved, tho I could not see why should one get into a r/s if there is not emotion involved. I guess that was one of the major reasons why I broke up with him, even tho it was hard for me to do so. I guess I had put my heart into this r/s and I couldn't stay in it if he refuses to share his love with me as well. He told me he doesn't know what love is like...I don't know whether I should be angry or sad when I heard this...but I rememeber telling him that I hope he will find someone one day who will finally be able to teach him what is the meaning to love someone as much as I had once loved him...<br><br>i.c.y</div>

(I don't disagree that some males do mature faster than females)<br>Maybe because I know of alot of mothers or friends who were married by the age of 20 -25 (and not SHOT GUN, okay?)<br>Maybe cos I have a niece and nephew who just got married 2 yrs back and they are 20 and 23 respectively<br>Maybe cos I married at 22 (not SHOT GUN - cos I know alot of "wise-cracks" here will make that comment!)<br><br>And the part I agree is that, nowadays, I feel that most kids (I feel old already) don't understand what is a r/s and rush into a r/s without understanding the fundamental value of it. Maybe it's because they just treat this as a "game" and nothing serious, or maybe its just following the trends....<br><br>Most of the time commitment = demands from their partners. They do NOT look at the other side of things like commitment = tolerance = give &amp; take = love = security = comfort level = etc<br>It's alot of things and not just demanding from each other this and that.<br><br>Well, not sure if I make senses leh... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"></div>

Sometimes we do see some students barely 12-13 yrs r holding hands and into a relationship. Do they know what is commitment? If your nephew really like that girl, jus go after her.
