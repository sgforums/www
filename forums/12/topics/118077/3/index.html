            <div class='col-md body'>MCSquare, I appreciate you spending time dissecting through all my previous posts to prove that my post doesn't make sense. We only went official for a very short while after he got back from his vacation, and it was for a short while because I decided to terminate it. After I asked him what he wanted out from the "relationship" and he told me the truth, I decided that I wasn't ready for the kinda relationship he was seeking, an "easy", light and short-term kinda relationship. I decided to break it off before things drag on further and it will only be harder for me to get out from it later. So is it so hard to believe that we went official for a short period of time? I would like it to be for a longer period, but sadly that was not the case.<br><br>Well, you may understand certain things more than me, that I am certain as I am still learning. However, please don't think everything that I have said is a lie because what I wrote really did happen to me. Thank you for taking the time to read through all my posts, and really appreciate all the advice you have given, but I guess at this point, like you said, there is nothing left to be done but to move on.<br><br>peace out.<br><br>i.c.y</div>

It takes awhile to get over the pain of breaking up, but if we continue to wallow in self pity &amp; turn into a love cynic, we might miss out on The One if he does cross our paths : )<br><br>I'm glad tt AA is of help to u, tt's wat the forum is abt.  We're here to support each other, to learn, to share experiences, etc : )<br><br>I've oso learnt thru the sharing of opinions in this thread, &amp; I hope to add watever knowledge to those stored in my heart &amp; mind, &amp; help others in future.
