            <div class='col-md body'>Dear IceBaby0,<br><br>I do agree wif wat u sez, commitment means so much more than juz staying wif 1 person all ur life.  It involves a whole lotta thgs, &amp; sometimes, younger ones may Not understand.  If tt's the case, it's difficult to expect them to commit in a r'ship, when they dun even haf a clue as to wat commitment means.  But u've raised a v. valid pt, &amp; I'll discuss this wif my nephew *grinz*<br><br>FeowFeow<br><br><blockquote><div class="quote_from">Originally posted by icebaby0:</div><div class="quote_body">I partially disagree and partially disagree with what u say<br><br>Maybe it's because I am looking at a woman's point of view as some "women" actually mature earlier than men. (I don't disagree that some males do mature faster than females)<br>Maybe because I know of alot of mothers or friends who were married by the age of 20 -25 (and not SHOT GUN, okay?)<br>Maybe cos I have a niece and nephew who just got married 2 yrs back and they are 20 and 23 respectively<br>Maybe cos I married at 22 (not SHOT GUN - cos I know alot of "wise-cracks" here will make that comment!)<br><br>And the part I agree is that, nowadays, I feel that most kids (I feel old already) don't understand what is a r/s and rush into a r/s without understanding the fundamental value of it. Maybe it's because they just treat this as a "game" and nothing serious, or maybe its just following the trends....<br><br>Most of the time commitment = demands from their partners. They do NOT look at the other side of things like commitment = tolerance = give &amp; take = love = security = comfort level = etc<br>It's alot of things and not just demanding from each other this and that.<br><br>Well, not sure if I make senses leh... <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_redface.gif" alt="Embarassed" title="Embarassed"> </div></blockquote></div>
