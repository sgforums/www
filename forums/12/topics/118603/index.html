Sending you letters?  If they actually made you pay the late charges, the only thing you can ask the courts to do is nullify and of the charges.  Providing you don't actually have late charges.</div>

I rather not use their serivce. Everyday, I hear tons and tons of complains fro customers and from internal staff using the service... I see their process so screw up  and I know the people who run them and the instructions is from the top who I have a very low opinion of... so my advice again and again.. Why do people want to suffer bad service and pay them to treat you badly?<br></div>

At least I can call back directly every few days to check until the things are done.<br><br>jus 2 little mini cents....but of course, u can also cancel the card.
