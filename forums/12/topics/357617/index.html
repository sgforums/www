              <p>Separating them... you sure that's what you want to do?</p>
              <p>Time is the essential here...</p>
              <p>If you're really that into her, my feel is that you should wish the best for her. In the event her marriage fails, then stepping in will be good for both of you.</p>
              <p>Still, you have to wait for quite some time before anything happens between the both of you. Even without love, she's likely to feel morally obliged to her broken marriage. Unless she is someone who changes at the drop of her hat, then good for you.</p>

              <p>I tell it is strange how my story is like one tamil movie - <strong>Minnale (</strong><strong>translated :The lightning</strong><strong>)</strong></p>

              <p><strong>Minnale ( translated :The lightning)</strong></p>
              <p><em>Blog Post </em></p>
              <p><em>21 October 2004 </em></p>
              <p>Minnale, oh..it still strikes me now as lightning as much as it did in 2001. This movie which was a stylised hollywood type of indian romance was an insanely huge box office hit a few years back for its story and music. Its success prompted bollywood producers to remake the show in Hindi. Cineindia reported that this gem of a movie set the cash registers rolling in Sathyam Theatres of Chennai. The story was conceived by a debutant director Gautham Menon and a first time music composer Harris Jayaraj,   has composed brilliant music that made even AR Rahman sit up and notice. The soundtrack  was released months before the film and became widely talked about. Most importantly, Minnale marked the coming of the Gautham- Harris combination as a potent force in the industry for the years to come. <em>Minnale was one of the most successful tamil movies  of the 2000s and inspired a slew of similar movies in the years after.</em></p>
              <p><em>Review</em></p>
              <p><em>17th May 2001 </em></p>
              <p>A <em>shrewd street punk (Maddy) who  likes a girl (Reema) at first sight, and wanted to woo her. Unfortuntely,this girl is a very practical person who doesnt believe in love , and who wants to settle down in life and have kids. Unknown to Maddy, she is already engaged to </em><em>someone arranged by her parents  she hasnt even met before </em><em>.Our hero  goes to meet her on a casual date. She thinks  that her fiance has come to meet her in disguise.  </em></p>
              <p><em>She plays along thinking its her fiance. He plays along making up extravagant stories about himself to impress her . </em></p>
              <p><em>They date for 10 days and </em><em> the shocking truth comes out when her real fiance arrives and says he could not make it for the meeting with her the other day because of work commitments.</em><em>Our hero</em><em>  finds out that the person she is engaged to , and him have the same name and to meet our girl on the same day.....</em></p>
              <p><em>Reema then thinks that </em><em> Maddy  </em><em>has cheated her by impersonating as her fiance whom she is to meet on the same day he appeared.  Feeling betrayed and angry with </em><em>Maddy, she tells him off not to see her again ever</em><em>. </em><em>Maddy </em><em>was just unlucky that fate played him around but he didnt meant to cheat her . He became a circumstantial victim of coincidence. But the both of them could not forget the 10 days they were together . She realised that in those 10 days within herself, there is a strange feeling called  LOVE.  Beneath the deep resentment and extreme prejudice, Reema finally manages to acknowledge </em><em>that life is not about marrying a successful and rich man , and that life is about marrying someone u really love and wish to spend the rest of that  life with. </em></p>
              <p><em>First time director Gautham Menon has some interesting camera angles and generally the quality of the film is top notch. The subtle nuances and attention to detail makes one wonder the directional capabilities of this promising newcomer. The songs were tastefully done especially Vaseegra, and the music of Harris Jayaraj ,  a newcomer musician gives  AR Rahman, the king, a serious challenge. There is an uncanny resemblance to Rahman many will agree but though the music is original and fresh, it hooks on one instantly and before u realise it , u reach for the repeat button on your hi-fi after the addiction gets into u. Minnale is well worth your time and movie ticket. Energetic,vibrant and full of LOVE.</em></p>
              <p><em> </em></p>
              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <p><strong>Just like the movie : I have spent some time with her and she enjoyed my company.</strong></p>

                  charm ? heh...  if u think u can be the one for her, n can
                  give her the love and happiness, chiong man. Good luck. May the
                  best man wins.</p>

              <p>I dont know , but i managed to capture her attention, And it seems she is thinking about something and very interested in what i had to offer...</p>
              <p>As for the engagement part i know it is real. But it is not a formal ROM. Some traditional acknowledgement made between parents on both sides</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>But i can tell u indian girls marry for love mostly , and those who dont, do it for a variety of other reasons like eg. Parents pressure, Social expectation, Face</p>

              <p>U see in our culture, a woman is considered "married" even though she is not lawfully ROM.</p>

              <p>There is still time left to change her mind. It seems that she is making a big mistake by marrying for reasons other than love, she is good looking and should not be a prob to find suitors.</p>

              <p><em>Blog Post </em></p>
              <p><em>21 October 2004 </em></p>
              <p>Minnale, oh..it still strikes me now as lightning as much as it
              did in 2001. This movie which was a stylised hollywood type of
              indian romance was an insanely huge box office hit a few years back
              for its story and music. Its success prompted bollywood producers
              to remake the show in Hindi. Cineindia reported that this gem of a
              movie set the cash registers rolling in Sathyam Theatres of
              Chennai. The story was conceived by a debutant director Gautham
              Menon and a first time music composer Harris Jayaraj,   has
              composed brilliant music that made even AR Rahman sit up and
              notice. The soundtrack  was released months before the film
              and became widely talked about. Most importantly, Minnale marked
              the coming of the Gautham- Harris combination as a potent force in
              the industry for the years to come. <em>Minnale was one of the most
              successful tamil movies  of the 2000s and inspired a slew of
              similar movies in the years after.</em></p>
              <p><em>Review</em></p>
              <p><em>17th May 2001 </em></p>
              <p>A <em>shrewd street punk (Maddy) who  likes a girl (Reema)
              at first sight, and wanted to woo her. Unfortuntely,this girl is a
              very practical person who doesnt believe in love , and who wants to
              settle down in life and have kids. Unknown to Maddy, she is already
              engaged to</em> <em>someone arranged by her parents  she hasnt
              even met before</em> <em>.Our hero  goes to meet her on a
              casual date. She thinks  that her fiance has come to meet her
              in disguise.  </em></p>
              <p><em>She plays along thinking its her fiance. He plays along
              making up extravagant stories about himself to impress her
              .</em></p>
              <p><em>They date for 10 days and</em> <em> the shocking truth
              comes out when her real fiance arrives and says he could not make
              it for the meeting with her the other day because of work
              commitments.</em><em>Our hero</em><em>  finds out that the
              person she is engaged to , and him have the same name and to meet
              our girl on the same day.....</em></p>
              <p><em>Reema then thinks that</em> <em> Maddy </em> <em>has cheated her by impersonating as her fiance whom she is to
              meet on the same day he appeared.  Feeling betrayed and angry
              with</em> <em>Maddy, she tells him off not to see her again
              ever</em><em>.</em> <em>Maddy</em> <em>was just unlucky that fate
              played him around but he didnt meant to cheat her . He became a
              circumstantial victim of coincidence. But the both of them could
              not forget the 10 days they were together . She realised that in
              those 10 days within herself, there is a strange feeling called
               LOVE.  Beneath the deep resentment and extreme
              prejudice, Reema finally manages to acknowledge</em> <em>that life
              is not about marrying a successful and rich man , and that life is
              about marrying someone u really love and wish to spend the rest of
              that  life with. </em></p>
              <p><em>First time director Gautham Menon has some interesting
              camera angles and generally the quality of the film is top notch.
              The subtle nuances and attention to detail makes one wonder the
              directional capabilities of this promising newcomer. The songs were
              tastefully done especially Vaseegra, and the music of Harris
              Jayaraj ,  a newcomer musician gives  AR Rahman, the
              king, a serious challenge. There is an uncanny resemblance to
              Rahman many will agree but though the music is original and fresh,
              it hooks on one instantly and before u realise it , u reach for the
              repeat button on your hi-fi after the addiction gets into u.
              Minnale is well worth your time and movie ticket. Energetic,vibrant
              and full of LOVE.</em></p>
              <p><em><br></em></p>
              <p><strong>Just like the movie : I have spent some time with her
              and she enjoyed my company.</strong></p>
