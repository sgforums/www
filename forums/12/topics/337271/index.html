              <p>You are feeling like this because you acknowledge/approve people around you too easily and unconsciously granted them permission to hurt you.</p>
              <p>People can only hurt you when you ALLOWED them to do so. Always remember who you are, your heritage, and how important you are to your families, your parents, your loved ones.</p>
              <p>Understand who you are and NEVER PERMIT anyone to hurt you without your permission, for you are always more valuable than those cowards who tried to bring you down out of fear.</p>
              <p>The choice is yours and you should decide if you want to surrender to the fears that others have for you, or you want to create more fear in their hearts of those cowards who have chosen the path to hurt you out of their own fears.</p>
              <p>And I can tell you, it's so easy to see the fears and insecurities that others has for you when you know how to deny them and their cowardly act. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p> </p>
              <p>If not go out look at the sky, tell yourself your problem is shit compared to those poor sods at Africa with nothing to eat, and you ought to be grateful for what you have now.</p>

              <p>You are feeling like this because you acknowledge/approve people
              around you too easily and unconsciously granted them permission to
              hurt you.</p>
              <p>People can only hurt you when you ALLOWED them to do so. Always
              remember who you are, your heritage, and how important you are to
              your families, your parents, your loved ones.</p>
              <p>Understand who you are and NEVER PERMIT anyone to hurt you
              without your permission, for you are always more valuable than
              those cowards who tried to bring you down out of fear.</p>
              <p>The choice is yours and you should decide if you want to
              surrender to the fears that others have for you, or you want to
              create more fear in their hearts of those cowards who have chosen
              the path to hurt you out of their own fears.</p>
              <p>And I can tell you, it's so easy to see the fears and
              insecurities that others has for you when you know how to deny them
              and their cowardly act. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"></p>

              <p><br>You must have gotten it wrong, I'm not advising you to be a snobbish, self-centered, unfriendly person. My advice was focused on TS/victim/sufferer and not on the other bad people who are never important.</p>
              <p>When I advised not to allow/permit people to insult, humilate, ridicule, hurt you, I meant the acceptance part of yourself when you are on the receiving end of the attacks that people has inflicted upon you.</p>
              <p>A person have two sides, one side (A) is how the person expresses/projects themselves towards other good/bad people in the society. Another side (B) is how the person absorbs/accepts themselves towards the good/bad people in the society.</p>
              <p>A person who understands and able to correct their side (B) will be able to reduce/nullify any factors that once contributed to their emo-ness feelings. But of course you will be shocked/upset/angry when bad people around you have decided to hurt/insult/humilate/ridicule you. However if you have been practising on your control over your side (B), you will find that all those hurt/insult/humilate/ridicule will gradually disappears and evaporates and you will no longer be bothered by those hurt/insult/humilate/ridicule factors anymore.</p>
              <p>It's gradual and it is not instant unless you always practised/focused/prepared on your side (B) whenever you got time...by imagining the hurt/insult/humilation/ridicule that you might possibly received in the future. And as the time passes, you will find that all these negative factors that people would like to pour upon you will be so meaningless and funny that you might even pity them when you know that they are unable to handle their own side (B).</p>
              <p>But of course you should also focus on your side (A), and do practise the love that you can bring and expressed upon others. Don't we all have an overwhelming fountain of love overflowing within ourselves?</p>
              <p>Love is a natural emotion in life, and it should be expressed as naturally and comfortably to others and especially people whom you cared for the most and of course your special person.</p>
              <p>IF you are able to express love for others in a natural and comfy manner and still negate all the negative factors that others have chosen to throw upon you, you will be able to tell yourself that you are a happy person and your remaining journey in life will definitely be a happy one even until the end of the world.</p>
              <p>Afterall, nobody deserves to feel moody, stressful, emotional, angry, upset, negative when they are all here for only 100 years? The clock is still ticking away and I am still growing even though I am unhappy or happy, so isn't it better for us to be happy then unhappy?</p>
              <p>I have decided to die with happy memories, and replace all my unhappy memories with many happy memories till the rest of my time.</p>
              <p>And I hope everyone will be able to be happy like me too. <img src="/images/emoticons/kde-3.5.8/redones/angel.png" alt="angel.png"> </p>
