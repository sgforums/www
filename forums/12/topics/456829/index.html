              <p>Please ascertain her relationship status first before you try.</p>
              <p>The best thing is to be her friend first lah.</p>
              <p>You don't even know her well , and jumping in without making sure its safe or not, will only result in a bruised ego, possibly a bloody nose too.</p>

              <p>sure why not? 0 experience in relationship? mmm hard bro.</p>
              <p>Is she hot? then you are gonna have hard time due to the lack of experience.</p>
              <p>If I were you, I would try to talk to her. Don't show any interest (Can you do that?)</p>
              <p>I would ask her whether or not she's taken.</p>
              <p>If you dislike asking such question, I would just be a friend with 0 interest.</p>
              <p>If she likes you, cool you will take it at free will. If she is not interested in you, it's okay your life still moves on. question is.. can you do that? I even have a hard time with few experience if the girl is my type.</p>
              <p>Good luck</p>

              <p>Before you try, do you think she likes you? even though you like her.</p>
              <p>It takes two to tango. Don't just blindly pursue her or else people would think (even she) that you are going after her for her looks and not her personality.</p>
              <p>Warning most girls at office are taken. Don't fall into the trap. You say she is lying to mislead a co-worker going after her, that seems unlikely, no single girl will declare such thing because she has to prove to her colleagues that she is attached/married. It is bad for if her boss knows she is lying; bad for promotion.</p>
              <p>Some more you have zero experience, so you are bound to fail.</p>
              <p>Get to know her better. Befriend her and talk to her. But don't make it too obvious.</p>

              <p>Girls will like you when you are a good listener and excellent in making small conversation. It doesn't sound silly but just comfortable. </p>
              <p>@OP: when you are getting closer, she will tell you about her bf. You don't really have to ask. Asking her out is a good indicator to find out whether or not she is single. </p>

              <p>How a gal react depends on how the guy behaves after he got rejected.</p>
              <p>If u hav confessed already, then graciously thank her for her honesty. Respect her decision.</p>
              <p>If u haven't confessed or told anyone, then just act like nothing happen lah. </p>
              <p>do not get into a depressive mode to show her how wounded you are, girls don't care and they don't want t o know.</p>
              <p>The moment you act like a wounded animal, she will stay away from you... As far as she can. </p>
              <p>Be a gracious person, other girls may be impressed with how u carry yourself . Set yourself up for other opportunity when this one is gone. One door closes several may just open for you. So don't mess up.</p>

              <p><br>i know its hard for you to feel like this. imagine if a girl you hate a lot say she like you, then you rejected her, and she makes a hell lot of whining and shit - how you will feel. it takes 2 hands to clap, so just move on, find a new hobby, get yourself distracted from this shit. as time goes by you look back -y ou will have a laff at your own doings later in life</p>
