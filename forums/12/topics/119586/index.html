            <div class='col-md body'>I'm studying in a poly, and my gf is in JC year 2. She's havin her 'A' levels this year and she seems so busy with work. I like her alot and had always hope to spend more time with her. Even though both of us are busy, she with school, me with cca's and lessons outside. I told her to ask me out whenever she has time and i'll cancel anything on hand just to see her. We meet like once to none every week. So, 1 month will be like 4 times most? Do steadys meet this seldomly? But she thinks it's ok.<br><br>I am sad, and i told her about it. She apologised too and say she has work. I too, told myself nevermind. Afterall it's just a few months to her 'A' levels and after that she'll have more time to spend with me. She's a very hardworking gal, who excels in studies. How? What should i do? Wuss, will i end up breaking with her? HELP!!<br></div>

            <div class='col-md body'>Hi just_a_boy,<br><br>If you keep on letting her feel that you want to go out with her that very often, when you jolly well know that she's studying for her exams, you are right-on the 2 of you might not last as long as you hope!<br><br>What she needs right now is your understanding. You can do your part by giving her all the time she needs to study but also let her feel that you are by her side all the time. All these should not be mere words but by action.<br><br>When she slowly feels that you care for her very much by giving her the necessary space, she'll eventually appreciate you better. <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile" title="Smile"></div>
