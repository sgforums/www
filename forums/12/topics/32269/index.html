So I'm still waiting... and now come the confusion. We have a mutual friend who knows abt it. And he claims to be neutral and helping me to be with her.<br><br>However, things changes. He keep advising me to give her up... saying all sorta bad comments about her. But behind me, he keep msging her and treating her like a "special fren"... and told her to give up on her current bf... but yet want me not to accept her when she choose me....<br><br>So what do you think this neutral friend is doing? And for your info, he is married. </div></blockquote>I think your neutral friend likes this ger. How could he ask you to forget about her and say bad things about her. and at the same time treatig her as a special friend. something is wrong..</div>

But my heart refuse to listen to reason...<br>Am i making excuses for myself? I probably am... but how can you let go when your heart keeps screaming to you again and again that you shouldn't give it up.. that you must not give it up?<br>What i'm saying is that sometimes things are easier said than done...<br>Nevertheless, i do know that this can't carry on, for whatever reason and excuses i can make up, he isn't mine to hold on to. If i were to say that i love him, then my friend's love for him would be ten times more.. If she were ever to find out.. i'll definitely lose this friendship.. she'll never forgive me... and that's definitely not what i want..<br>Bottom line is, i do know what i am suppose to do.. the question is how do i pull myself out of this pit of misery that i've so willingly stepped into?<br><br></div>

So I'm still waiting... and now come the confusion. We have a mutual friend who knows abt it. And he claims to be neutral and helping me to be with her.<br><br>However, things changes. He keep advising me to give her up... saying all sorta bad comments about her. But behind me, he keep msging her and treating her like a "special fren"... and told her to give up on her current bf... but yet want me not to accept her when she choose me....<br><br>So what do you think this neutral friend is doing? And for your info, he is married. </div></blockquote> yes u say u like her &amp; she like u but y ain't her letting go? u wnaa knw the reason? i v direct pls pardon me.<br>coz the reason v simple she luv her bf more than u. . .yes she might luv u too but then the luv she hv 4 u is nutin compared to her current bf dat y she cannot let go. . .</div>
