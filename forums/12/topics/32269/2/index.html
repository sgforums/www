They like to play with us.<br>Your case is not unusual regarding the fact that i have seen and experienced these kind of situations.<br>E.g. My cousin just got marrried. Nothing unusual, lovers get married in the end...mostly...the only difference is that he is marrying the girlfriend of his best friend of 10 yrs.<br>They went to the same Uni to study, but my cousin's best friend graduated earlier, so he left first. There left my cousin and the girl. Slowly as time goes by, feelings developed.And she realized that my cousin is the one she wants. This was told to me by my cousin's younger sister. She also told me that the girl confessed that she had the feelings for a very long time.<br>So, your case is normal. It does not mean that he betrayed your best friend to be with you makes him a bad guy. Feelings can never be totally controlled, no matter how hard you try. Once you have it, you have it.<br>Just do what you think you have to do. We can only advise you, but ultimately the choice is yours. Whatever decision you make, no one is wrong here. Dont blame yourself, the guy or your best friend. This is life. Reality.</div>
