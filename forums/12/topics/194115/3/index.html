I managed to found this out and she finally disclosed to me after i confronted her. I'm felt very hurt. She said she dunno why this happen as she is very lonely that time.<br><br>She promised me that it will never happen again and she said she really love me.<br>Do you think I can believe her? give her a chance again?<br>It is really hurt to be betrayed by somemone that i really loved and when i was alone, i never betray her eventhough i had a chance to.<br><br>Now she's back and i can see she making effort for our relationship, but now i'm really afraid being cheated again. The pain is too hard to beared. I'm trying to recover but the image sometimes still flying through my minds.<br><br>Do you guys and gals have any advice?</div></blockquote>Personally I will not accept betrayal... based on many experiences, especially in long term relationships.<br><br><strong>Do you think I can believe her?</strong><br>FIVE years of relation... by right u should already know her character/style. In general, is she a serious, responsible &amp; honest person? Does she prefer to keep promises or secrets? Ask yourself, is she making effort because of guilt, love or other reasons?<br><br><strong>give her a chance again?</strong><br>Damage have been done, u have fear &amp; distrust... will this affect future relation with her? (U have to give urself some time too) Can u 'REALLY' forgive her &amp; are you a risks taker (prepare to fail again without regrets)?<br><br>If u are an emotional person, you take love very seriously &amp; cannot take it if she cheat on you again. Seriously it is best to let her go now or later. u can let the relationship dies off slowly, it's a choice.<br><br>Love is about two person, it's not only about how much u love her... before u decide, u must also understand how much she love u. Take some time, have a clear mind, think logically &amp; long term, sum up those good AND bad memories, before making ur decision, good luck.<br><br>In short: if u can take it, give another shot. If not, leave it.</div>

That is why i'm struggling to recover.<br>Fear and feeling of distrust still existed. I think needs time and her commitment to make this relationship work.<br><br>Lonely of cz is a very lame excuse. I feeling very unfair is because all the while I did not cheat on her even i have chances to. But why she did this to me.<br><br>From my side, I already do what I need to do as a man, and i have no regret. So just see whether she know how to appreciate the chance I gave her. because there will not be a second chance.<br><br>I agree, and hope mistake do let ppl grow more mature.<br>and most of all follow our own heart.<br><br>Sometimes human are like this, never appreciate what they have until they start to lose it.</div>
