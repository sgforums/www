            <div class='col-md body'>I suggest you let her go. Lonely wasn't a good excuse. So if you are lonely, you can go find chick too? Ask her to wake up her idea and don't give lame excuse. Why don't she just admit that she is having the urge to filrt with guys and she is feeling itch to try different guys? Human are just plain selfish, they do something wrong yet they don't wanna admit their truth intention and still find lame excuse to cover themself up. If you don't want to suffer in future, then i suggest you to leave her else you may get another shock sooner or later.</div>

The pain is too hard to beared. I'm trying to recover but the image sometimes still flying through my minds.<br><br>Do you guys and gals have any advice?</div></blockquote>I know how u feel now, cos something like tat happened to me. Was with my ex gf for close to 5 years, and 1 night i wanted to give her a surprise waiting for her at her void deck to pass her something and guess wat , i saw a guy sending her hm. When i confront her, she told me everything. I was so sad and disappointed. In the end she left me for that guy. Now, close to 1 year later, i still could not forget her. My advice is , if you really love her, give her a chance . Thing may just work out. Try to spend more time with her and forget how she hurt her.</div>

            <div class='col-md body'>In my perspective, I think the bonding of your relationship may not be strong enough to withstand any stormy circumstances. I understand that you guys have been together for quite some time, probabilty things will get saturated and mundane. It's usually takes 2 hands to clap and 2 of you to maintain the bonds continously.<br><br>Flash back your memories and recall the unforgetable memories you had with her as well as the occasions you might let her down. Think of the days if she's gone for good, can you live without her? At the point in time, you have to make your decision and decide whether is she still worth your affection and love.<br><br>Since she is trying to make up for you, why not give yourself some time to re-consider your relationship and decide later. Possible and hoefully you can start afresh again.<br><br>Although, it may sound easy to say than to do, but I hope you can at least give a try to patch up the crack or gaps between you and her.<br><br>Remember, we do make mistakes unconsciously at times.</div>
