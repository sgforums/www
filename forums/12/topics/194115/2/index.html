Trust me bro, she ain't worth it don't waste your time and money on her. Just make her pregnant and then dump her and let me suffer on her own.

Is a 50 / 50 chance.<br><br>Life will not tell you the answer you have to find it out yourself.<br><br>If you are not strong enough then ask yourself can you break up with her right now.
