              <p>Jeez. If he's going to flip over something minor like that and over YOUR things and YOUR right, he has a huge ego problem or just an ultra huge MCP</p>
              <p>So if it's something major, what's he gonna do? Go berserk and go on a rampage???</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Seriously, know your rights.<br>He is just your boyfriend and not your keeper and he don't have a say on how you wanna use your voucher -_-"</p>
              <p>He's not even giving you the basic respect you deserve; which is respecting YOUR decision on how you wanna make use of YOUR voucher</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>I can't believe that not only are you not angry with him for being a jerk, you are wondering if you're in the wrong -_-"</p>

              <p><br>Maybe his behavior was driven by envy/jealousy that you've a bigger buying power than his? Maybe he had a bad day? Some other issues?</p>
              <p>It's all guesswork at the point of time - what I suggest is that.. you guys should find time, sit down and thrash things out.. Communication is always very important in r/s... And don't bear grudges =d</p>
