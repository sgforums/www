              <p>anyway to her ex: totally no link la, the case in question now is about the voucher what, whats wrong with getting something free, it makes totally no sense to link it with bad spending habits, you are clearly passing judgement based on your previous impresions of her spending.</p>

              <p>I think maybe the BF here is misunderstood.</p>
              <p>I think he is unhappy about the habit rather than the actual facts surrounding this particular voucher. He is afraid that what if this voucher doesnt cover the whole cost, for example, just a 50% discount, would the GF then use the voucher if she gets another voucher like this because of her spending habit.</p>
              <p>But hey BF, your GF has every right to use her money. And you are not wrong to think ahead and wants her to save for emergency reasons. There is always a solution to every problem. You cannot insist on your way, that is beneficial to you, not her. She of cos cannot keep on spending, that is beneficial to her, not to you. I am assuming that her spending habit is so bad that she does not save any money at all, or worse, owe credits. It is always best to find a win-win situation, that then is consider a solution. Why not both of you talk and limit her monthly spending to a certain amount? Since she seems to be serious to cut down her expenditure to please you, I think you should also understand her need to spend and shop sometimes....you cannot just expect her to buy only what SHE NEEDS.... if you do that, I have to ask you, do you really NEED everything you bought in your life? No right, you cannot exert your perception of needs onto her. Instead work out a solution that pleases her (she gets to shop and spend) and pleases you (she saves an amount every month).</p>

              <p>As I read your posts, I find myself getting angry... I'm really surprised, cos usually I don't give a damn about most things.</p>
              <p>When did you ever say you will be the one who needs the money? You certainly didn't say you will be the one, but you did say this: "put yourself in a suition when u
                                      need $ frm your partner because of some reason and shit! there
                                      isn't any." I'm sorry if the signal I caught, the signal that you have the slightest inclination of relying on her for your financial needs was an erroneous one.</p>
              <p>If you have to think about whether it is fair for her to rely on you when you cannot count on her when you need to, I don't think you <em>deserve </em>to be in a relationship at all.</p>
