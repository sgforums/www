              <p>Of course, it's not as simple as it looks. But if you understand the relationship so well, it wouldn't be doomed to fail.</p>
              <p>Let's give you the benefit of doubt and assume her spending habit is indeed a problem. So she just bought another pair of shoes and you're at her place 'cause it's some anniversary. You saw the shoes, got upset and decided to bail. You got no balls to solve the problem, dude. Only good at walking away and then justify yourself.</p>
              <p>Yea, she should have bought something and then give it to the charity -<strong> to show her selfless she is and to please her douchebag bf</strong>. Why don't you give that bolded sentence a few reads and then tell us what's wrong?</p>
              <p>I personally don't give a shit what you do; you're just another nobody who 'do charity' just to 'feel selfless'. You know when your cause is motivated by image, it's not altruism.</p>
              <p>That much being said, I'm thankful her relationship with you ended. You're just another selfish, conceited asshole who lack maturity and balls to handle a relationship.</p>

              <p>i have no balls? haha.. if u r in the relationship, in my shoes, i assure u.. u would have left it long away before me.. why don't u ask post and ask her how paitent i am? how nicely i reason with her with our fights?  how i am always the 1 who sloves the problem? she has never sloved 1 before alright. that i'm sure of it! so don't tell me i'm only good at walkng away! we have fought countless times.. i'm tired of it..i have sloved so so many of our fights! so please take back what u have said Detacted.</p>
              <p>and another thing. u're basis. seriously. u do not even know me and u say thatmy cause is motivated by image.. DO U EVEN KNOW ME? if u don't, shut up please..</p>
