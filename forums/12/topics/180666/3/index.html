            <div class='col-md body'>Hi, I did not read thru all the messages, but from what I had read, I feel that maybe you dun really like her deeply, cos you are unable to accept the changes in her. The one you like in your heart is the her innocent image, but once she changes, you are unable to accept the new her. That mean maybe what you like of her is just her image, her face. You may know her for a year, but do you really understand her fully? If a gal who dun have ear holes is not materialistic, den how about those who have a lot of ear holes? Are they materialistic?<br><br>Dun torture yourself by not reply to her msgs or whatever things, just take it one at at time. If you got her msg, reply her, dun alien yourself to her. Maybe she just want to take things slowly in r/s. cos she might had got hurt badly last time. So she dun want to go thru all the hurts again. I had a friend who like gal for 2 - 3 years, who reject him a few times, who had a few bf, but my friend still quietly wait by her side, be her support when her r/s fails, who help her alot. He finally wins her heart with his patience.<br><br>So dun lost heart, gd luck  <img src="/images/emoticons/classic/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy" title="Very Happy"><br></div>

The one you like in your heart is the her innocent image, but once she changes, you are unable to accept the new her. That mean maybe what you like of her is just her image, her face. You may know her for a year, but do you really understand her fully? If a gal who dun have ear holes is not materialistic, den how about those who have a lot of ear holes? Are they materialistic?<br><br>Dun torture yourself by not reply to her msgs or whatever things, just take it one at at time. If you got her msg, reply her, dun alien yourself to her. Maybe she just want to take things slowly in r/s. cos she might had got hurt badly last time. So she dun want to go thru all the hurts again. I had a friend who like gal for 2 - 3 years, who reject him a few times, who had a few bf, but my friend still quietly wait by her side, be her support when her r/s fails, who help her alot.
