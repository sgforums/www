            <div class='col-md body'>im t just turned 15. i know m since p5 till now and we're really close. m's 14.we text alot since p5 and has since cut down after dad complained about bills. but i still talk to m on msn almost everyday.we meet every week starting october this year.<br><br>m used to blog about how much she loves me. she also wrote about how she always think of me and that she hopes i ask her again to get together. i asked her before but she rejected and moved on with s. m then broke up with s and she began blogging about me.<br><br>i didnt know m loves me so much. that was way back to earlier this year.we treat each other so much so like best friends. i used to read her blog secretly. now, she doesnt blog about me anymore. but posts pictures and articles about our outings.<br><br>funny thing is, m always holds my hand and always joke about my ex who asked me whether i wanted to hold her hand when i was in p6. m and me hold hands in the bus, and m always lie on my shoulder too.<br><br>i feel the soothing "warmth" and ive never felt anything like it. i really like m. safe to say i love m. but im very very anxious everytime i try to ask her "do you think we can get together". i dont know if m still loves me.<br><br>problem is, i dont have money. i always ask my mom for money when i go out.and i always get $4 or so. im from a very decent family like every other family honestly. live in hdb, dad's sole breadwinner. mom stopped work since she delivered again.<br><br>i TOTALLY UNDERSTAND mom's situation of course. cant possibly ask mom for money all the time. she not working and always asks dad for money for groceries.<br><br>if i were to have a relationship with m, how am i to provide for her when we go out? i always treat her drinks which i can afford. but food? i always ask her are you gna have lunch at home or out, i always have mine home cos mom's the best cook ever. rarely eat out. so if m is to makan out, she always gives me money and i take her order. recently, when i sent m home, she asked me cheekily for a kiss. i wanted to kiss her so much. my lips were already close to her cheeks yet i didnt kiss her. happened 2 times. she said i shudve kissed her properly. and im certain im gna give her a proper kiss in the cheek on tuesday.<br><br>if i were to go into a relationship with m, i would always hope m would agree that love dont always require money but our love for each other itself.<br><br>m has got everything ive wanted. outgoing, hip, hot, super friendly and all. no other girl are like her. i really do love m. we are going out on tues and ive been thinking whether i should ask her "you think we can get together?".<br><br><strong>thank you all for taking your time reading. appreciate it alot.</strong></div>

From your post, i feel that she ain't a girl who wants the guy to pay the bills.. Of course once in a while you can pamper her, sometimes a handmade gift is definitely better that a expensive present, its the thought that counts right?? =)</div>
