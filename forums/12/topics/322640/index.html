              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">A gal fren of mine, Ms A, broke off with her ex, Mr Scoundrel about a year ago. However, Mr Scoundrel’s rented condo’s PUB is still under Ms A name. Not only that, he had taken an SCV cable box, M1 mobile broadband kit, his M1 mobile line and Starhub mobile line, all using Ms A’s name and still using these facilities.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">He paid off the bills the first few months after they broke up. However, he stopped paying the bills and the poor gal had to pay up all these bills herself with her own money. She sent multiple sms, called multiple times and sent multiple emails but that guy was just ignoring her. The mobile bills alone accrued to more than $1.5k. She at last had no choice but to refuse to pay for him. However, the telcos started to issue lawyer letters and send debt collectors after her. In order to prevent Mr Scoundrel from conjuring up more bills, she decided to terminate the mobile lines.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Mr Scoundrel was worried that the PUB will cut his supplies and immediately changed the payee name to his. However, he was not going to clear the previous PUB bills still under Ms A’s name. By cutting his mobile line, she had no ways of contacting him and therefore approached his mum.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">Everything, including paying early termination fees come to about $3k.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">At last, he replied an email saying she had harassed her family and refused to pay her a dime. Please note that this guy is a business man who claims to earn revenue of $10 million SGD annually. When he started off his company, Ms A had actually provided him a capital of $20k at least. During his cash flow difficulties, Ms A gave her ATM card to him where he withdraws the money to tide his business (another $10k), promising to return a few months later. And that never happens till date.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">When Ms A confronted him in his office, he kept saying he is still using the cable TV box but just refuse to terminate the account or return the setup box. And of course refuse to pay because he said she was also watching cable TV. Ms A replied she wants to cancel the cable TV but he just refused to return the setup box! As for the mobile line, he not only refused to pay the mobile bills, he even refused to do a line transfer. He also refused to return the M1 mobile broadband set.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">And in retaliation of claiming Ms A is asking him for money (when she is only claiming bills he had incurred and nothing more), he told the housing agent to kick her out of her rented room within 12 hours of notice. It was till then that she realized that the agent was in cahoots with him.</span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;"> </span></p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">
              </p><p><span style="color: #000000; font-family: Times New Roman;">
              </span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;">Mr Scoundrel kept claiming Ms A used his money etc … but this is the type of guy who says ‘I will buy this for you … but you foot the bill 1<sup>st</sup>’ So at the end of the day, he went around claiming he bought lots of branded stuffs for Miss A while Miss A had to pay on her own for most of the branded stuffs. He claimed she treated her like a ‘QUEEN’. How can a guy treat a gal like a ‘QUEEN’ when he laid his hands on her i.e. he slapped her?!</p>
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              
              <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"> </p>
              <span style='font-size: 12pt; font-family: "Times New Roman";    '><span style="color: #000000;">Does anyone have any such experience and how can Ms A get Mr Scoundrel to return the SCV setup box, M1 mobile broadband kit and pay the bills he incurred?</span></span><p></p>

              <p>I think the best way to deal with this skunkhead is to waste $$$ for betterment.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>What i meant is:</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>Cut whatever utilities bill, Starhub and so on (recurring expenses) before they escalate. I believe there is a way to rectify this things out with the company as ur fren is a customer afterall.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>For the return of Starhub box, ur fren can report to police about the refusal to return box by that @sshole. It is considered as theft by law.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>If u want to warn the fellow ladies about this kind of @sshole, post ur story on newspaper to share.</p>

              <p>BTW, earning 10 million of revenue meant nothing in corporate world. This is because revenue does exclude debts need to generate it. That is, u borrow $20 to produce sth and earn $10. The $10 is ur revenue but ur debt is $20. As a whole u lose $10.</p>

              <p>Why bother other pples unless you are going after this gal, anyway, this is very common scene among those overly committed relationship that end in a sour note. When in love, darling i want broadband, h/p, money..., ok lah my dear, no problem. When fall out, u asshole, u scoundrel, u son-of a bitch...u... aint it part and parcel of a fail relationship? Dun worry, they will settle among themselves.</p>
              <p> </p>
              <p>And to the best method to deal with asshole and scoundrel is to be an asshole and scoundrel youself.</p>

              <p>im working in SH , so i would say , Ask her to call in to suspend the services , lodged a relevant police report and inform relevant telcos n services providers to protect herself .Since services r under her name , she has the right to terminate and suspend . Maybe she can set a pin so that idiot cannot call respective call centres in to activate without that unique pin .</p>
              <p><br>Then start to work closely with the service providers n police to see what can be done</p>

              <p>Secondly, what we gather here is simple, cut and stop all the lines, as TS is the ownership, my sensitivity mind and genes told me that TS is still in love with her ex, that is where she got a problem, she still hope to get back her ex and love him forever. So that is why she did not wish to cut off which is as simple as ABC.</p>
